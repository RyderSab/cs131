Haven't you wondered what Sam Vimes really looks like? How about Lord Vetinari, or Rincewind, or the Nac Mac Feegle, or those wacky witches of Lancre? \\"The Art of Discworld\\" brings together artist Paul Kidby's renderings of the wonders of Discworld. Filled with both color paintings and black-and-white sketches, this book brings Discworld alive. Kidby's works are not only painstaking in their detail, but they faithfully capture every nuance of the characters as described in the books.<br /><br />In addition to the artwork, there is also running commentary by Terry Pratchett on the many people, creatures, and places in Discworld. He provides interesting new insights on the conception and evolution of his creations and describes how his mental visualization of them compares with Kidby's execution. Kidby also adds his own comments on why he depicts the characters the way he does.<br /><br />There are so many treasures in this book! There's Death dressed as the Hogfather. There's Angua in her human and wolf forms. There are depictions of the Librarian that show the man within the orangutan skin. There's a sketch of Twoflower that's a perfect rendition of the first Discworld tourist. Let's not forget the cosmos-scarred Great A'Tuin, bearing the weight of four elephants and a flat planet on his mighty back. I could go on and on, but I won't. You have to see these amazing illustrations for yourself. This is a must-have for a Discworld fan's collection.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-10-08

Thinking the note is a hoax, Billy does nothing. Later he finds that indeed the murder took place based on his choice not to go to the police. Soon another similar note and choice comes, and then another and another. In each case Billy finds the choices more and more difficult to make. Fearing that someone dear to him will soon be a target for this cruel and clever psychopath, Billy races against the clock trying to discover the killer's identity and to stop this deadly game in its tracks.<br /><br />There's nothing supernatural here. Instead, Koontz has drawn a portrait of a creepy serial killer who is merciless in the psychological game he plays and unpredictable in what his next action will be. The most unsettling part of this killing game is that by refusing to make a choice, Billy is in reality still making a choice. As Billy is painted into a corner of desperation, he finds that there is no way out.<br /><br />Some of Koontz's recent novels such as \\"The Taking\\" and \\"By the Light of the Moon\\" have disappointed me with their rampant spirituality or ludicrously saccharine protagonists, but in \\"Velocity\\" Koontz is back in fine form. Except for the final chapter, this is a very dark novel, and Billy Wiles is not a very likeable protagonist. He has to make choices that are not pleasant to face, and some of his actions are surprisingly violent. This is a taut and suspenseful story that not only features a very warped and resourceful serial killer, but also builds up a psychological terror that will have you looking over your shoulder. There are twists and turns right up to the end that will keep you guessing. Welcome back, Dean Koontz!<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-10-03

The scene switches back and forth between a scientist with an obsession to claim credit for the discovery, an ex-con he hires to track down the notebook and kill those who possess it, a researcher who studies a sample of the find and comes to an alarming revelation, a monk and a veterinarian who pair up to track down the fossil, and a rogue government agent who will stop at nothing to keep the others from learning the treasure's dangerous secret.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced action-packed tale that bears an eerie similarity to an Indiana Jones adventure. Like many of the other thrillers Douglas Preston has written, this one is well suited for the silver screen with its high adventure, desert settings, and touch of science fiction.  As the author of the nonfiction \\"Dinosaurs in the Attic,\\" Preston is also well qualified to include information about dinosaur hunters, the mighty tyrannosaurus rex, and theories about the extinction of the dinosaurs. Although the novel's scientific conclusion is rather preposterous, it's still great fun.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-09-28

He's back from his first story, \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter,\\" for more dastardly dealings. This time, he finds himself under suspicion by Police Sergeant Doakes. Dexter can't help feeling that Doakes is as much a monster as he is, and that monsters recognize their own kind. When Doakes begins a constant surveillance that prevents Dexter from heeding the call of his Dark Passenger, he spends an uncomfortable amount of time with his girlfriend Rita and her two kids in an effort to appear domestic. To his chagrin, he is becoming a bit too normal for his own liking. Luckily, he is conscripted by his police detective sister to help investigate a new rash of grotesque serial killings that give even a monster like Dexter pause. When the killer absconds with Doakes, Dexter feels an obligation to help his sister track down the killer, even if, by saving Doakes, he will be forced to remain trapped in a life of normalcy.<br /><br />I wondered if author Jeff Lindsay would be able to pull off another novel about the endearingly inhuman Dexter without reverting to telling the same story twice. He did an admirable job doing just that. As in his first story, Lindsay combines humor along with Dexter's dispassionate acknowledgment as an unfeeling monster. But this time, he provides several fresh new facets to Dexter's personality: first his new role as a reluctant domesticated man, and second his innate understanding of, and gentleness with, children. This short book is a quick and entertaining read. I recommend it for its innovative depiction of a murderous psychopath that a reader can actually like and root for.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-09-27

At first thought that seems preposterous. But think of it this way: instead of competing in a grueling physical activity, the participants in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament compete in an equally grueling mental one. And oddly enough, they gather together in order to perform a solitary activity. They race through timed puzzles at a breakneck pace in spite of the fact they normally solve puzzles at their leisure. Above all else, they get the opportunity to socialize with fellow crossword enthusiasts and have a good time.<br /><br />Here's your chance to match your solving skills against those of the tournament masters. This collection, edited by American Crossword Puzzle Tournament founder Will Shortz, contains all 56 of the tournament puzzles from 1998 to 2004 in chronological order, along with their time limits and the actual solving times of the participants. This allows you to compare your time against theirs. The only shortcoming is that, in the interest of simplified scoring, you can compare only your solving time and not your accuracy. In reality, the participants receive a point score that includes both factors.<br /><br />The puzzles in the book are the cream of the crop from noted puzzle constructors, and they range in difficulty from simple to devilishly difficult. There is a list of the winners in each year's contest since 1978. Interspersed among the puzzles are photos of solvers and constructors, along with tournament preparation and solving advice from the participants. If you think you've got what it takes to perform competitive crossword puzzle solving but can't make it to the annual Stamford Connecticut tournament, this book is the next best thing to being there!<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-09-24

I solve the newspaper Jumble puzzle without benefit of a pencil and can often identify a phrase on \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" with only one or two letters visible. So it was with great interest that I read \\"Crossworld.\\" Author Marc Romano has done for crossword puzzles what Stefan Fatsis has done for Scrabble: he documents his obsession with the pastime and provides a description of its history, devotees, and competitions.<br /><br />Romano, a long-time crossword solver, attended the American Crossword Puzzle tournament to write an article on it for the Boston Globe, and then decided to be a first-time participant the following year. He describes his grueling weekend competing against some of the nation's top solvers. He interviews some of the attendees, and provides an in-depth look at some of the names familiar to crossword puzzle solvers, such as constructor Brendan Emmett Quigley and puzzle editor/tournament founder Will Shortz. He adds humorous anecdotes about the quirky personalities of crossword people and about the snafus, triumphs, and camaraderie at the tournament. Detracting somewhat from the book are some rather odd theories about crossword puzzle solvers, such as their being more honest than the general populace.<br /><br />The book is full of interesting facts about everything related to crosswords. Among the details: the earliest word puzzle, dating back to around 1600 BCE, may be a clay disk inscribed with interlocking glyphs; Arthur Wynne, the creator of the first American crossword, originally called it a \\"word-cross\\" until a typo reversed the word order; Will Shortz has the only college degree in enigmatology, or the study of puzzles and games. The book contrasts the differences between British and American crosswords, as well as the varying styles of the New York Times crossword puzzle editors over the years. There are tips on how to be a better and faster crossword solver, and how to practice for competition. In spite of all the crossword trivia here, Romano claims that this book is \\"rare among books about crosswords in that it doesn't actually contain one.\\"<br /><br />If you are the kind of person who not only enjoys crosswords, but also has wondered about how they are created and edited, or has imagined what it would be like to compete in a crossword tournament, then this book is a must read.

The case turns from accidental death to one of murder. Dumpty was a womanizer and con man who had been involved in a lot of shady dealings and who had lots of enemies. Jack is still stinging from not being able to bring the three little pigs to justice for their wanton murder of Mr. Wolff. He wants to shake his reputation for having a poor solve rate for his cases, so cracking the Dumpty case is important to him. How can he solve this high-profile case and prevent the maligned Nursery Crimes Division from being disbanded? How can he keep superstar Detective Friedland Chymes from stealing the investigation from him? Why was Dumpty buying up all the shares of Spongg's Footcare stock before his untimely death? And most important of all, how can the resolution of this case make good copy for a future issue of Amazing Crime Stories magazine?<br /><br />Author Jasper Fforde has switched gears from his Thursday Next series to begin a new series of hard-boiled police procedurals based on Nursery Crime cases. \\"The Big Over Easy\\" has many funny moments as Fforde places familiar nursery rhyme characters in unusual situations. There are puns galore, and humorous character names such as Hercule Porridge, Miss Maple, Lord Peter Flimsey, and Winsum & Loosum. Each chapter is prefaced with an excerpt from an imaginary book that covers a literary topic in this topsy-turvy world. Examples include the Ugly Stepsisters suing fairy tale publications for defamation of character, the testing of a transmutation device that worked temporarily when it turned a pumpkin into a coach, and the banning of the use of twins as plot devices in crime stories.<br /><br />Fforde parodies detective fiction and nursery rhymes in an innovative and humorous way, but the world in which the story takes place is not as well developed as that in which Thursday Next lived. It is unclear which characters are from books and which are real, if any. Adding to the confusion is the inclusion of a binary-talking extraterrestrial alien. Whether the concept of satirizing a mix of nursery rhymes and detective stories will quickly become tedious or not remains to be seen (the next in the series will feature Jack and Mary in the case of \\"The Fourth Bear\\"). But in the meanwhile, I recommend this story for fans of the Thursday Next series, since it employs Fforde's trademark British humor and is an entertaining literary spoof.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackin an innovative and humorous way, but the world in which the story takes place is not as well developed as that in which Thursday Next lived.

Forensic pathologist Frank Clevenger and his friend North Anderson try to find the common link that ties the cases together so that they can track down the killer. This is not a whodunnit in the traditional sense, because right up front the reader knows that master architect West Crosse is the one who dunnit. He is designing perfect buildings and then using murder to redesign the perfect families to live in them. The suspense, then, is in watching Clevenger race to solve the murders before Crosse practices his craft on one of America's most famous families.<br /><br />As a protagonist, Clevenger is an interesting and well fleshed-out character. Not only is he involved in a solving series of baffling murders, but he is also battling his own demons: alcoholism, a rocky love relationship, and an adopted son who is hanging around with a very rough crowd. In some ways, Crosse is the typical serial killer with obsessive behavior and more than a touch of megalomania. But author Keith Ablow, himself a forensic psychiatrist, provides an interesting portrait of a psychopathic serial killer with an unusual obsession.

Young Teppic is sent away to Ankh-Morpork to go to Assassin's School. He is called back to the kingdom immediately after graduation because of the death of his father. He must now ascend the throne, wear the ceremonial gold mask, and commission master architect Ptaclusp to build the massive mother of all pyramids for his father's earthly remains. Being the pharaoh of the dusty old tradition-steeped Kingdom of the Sun is no fun, however. Teppic misses the modern excitement, not to mention the modern plumbing, of Ankh-Morpork. When the pyramid under construction begins to generate enough energy to warp the fabric of time and space, the entire kingdom is displaced from Discworld into an alternate dimension. Teppic, accompanied by his headstrong handmaiden Ptraci and a mathematically inclined camel, is catapulted out of the kingdom. The threesome must find their way back to the kingdom to return it to its place within the dimensions of Discworld, rescuing it from beliefs turned to hellish reality.<br /><br />This Discworld novel has a different feel from ones that precede it. Once Teppic leaves Ankh-Morpork, almost all traces of Discworld slip away. The reader is immersed in an amalgam of ancient Egypt and Greece, complete with mythology, high priests, deserts, hieroglyphics, and lots of pyramids and mummies. There are no wizards or witches here, and the magic is of an entirely different nature. There are almost no familiar characters, although Death does make a minor appearance. Pratchett uses this unusual setting to explore ideas about religious beliefs and traditions, and the nature of time, space, and reality. This is some pretty heady stuff, but it is given the magic Pratchett touch that entertains the reader while providing a lot of serious food for thought.<br /><br />Pratchett is in top form as he satirizes Greek philosophy, Zeno's paradox, quantum physics, mythology, pyramid power, and the Trojan wars. His parody of the Riddle of the Sphinx is hilarious, as is an introduction to the questionably honorable ideals of the Assassin's Guild. Although Pratchett avoids chapter breaks, at least this book is divided into four sections to provide you with a few logical stopping points. This will give you several places to catch your breath in a funny and thought-provoking story that is a royal jewel in the scepter of Discworld.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackythology, pyramid power, and the Trojan wars.

I believe Dell is actually the originator of this puzzle, which was called \\"Number Place\\" rather than \\"Sudoku.\\" The rules are quite simple. Given a 9 by 9 square grid, you have to arrange the digits one through nine into the grid so that the same number does not appear more than once in any row, column, or subgrid.

It takes reasoning, logic, and, in the case of the harder puzzles, a lot of persistence.<br /><br />This Sudoku collection contains a detailed guide on how to solve easy, medium, and difficult puzzles (and yes, the harder the puzzle the more complex the approach that must be taken to solve it). It contains more than 130 puzzles arranged in order of difficulty from easy to diabolical. The grids are large and easy to work with. This book will keep you challenged for a long time.

He decides to take a drug tour to the Ecuadorian jungle in the hopes that this will inspire him to create the novel he is meant to write. The drug he takes there, known as datura, or the tiger's blindfold, simultaneously provides blindness and extraordinary clarity of inner vision. He smuggles the drug back into the States and uses it for controlled blindness in order to gain heightened awareness and insight into his past so that he can write a semiautobiographical novel. He becomes addicted to it as he dictates his novel to his lover Ava.<br /><br />Steadman then comes out of seclusion to attend social functions and to go on a book tour, while pretending that his blindness is permanent rather than temporarily drug-induced. Eventually, however, the drug no longer works in a predictable way. His visionary blindness begins to give way to a much darker blindness while the secret of his success is in danger of disclosure. The character of Steadman is an interesting one. Acting the clairvoyant blind man, he swaggers, mind reads, brags of his omniscience, and impresses everyone up to and including President Clinton. He is an antihero as egotistical and colorful as Paul Theroux's Allie Fox, and is destined for as hard a fall.<br /><br />This story is full of metaphor and symbolism. There are sleep masks, blindfolds, festival masks, and blind people. There are constant references to light and darkness, awareness and ignorance, sight and blindness. The best scenes are those in the Ecuadorian jungle, and they are reminiscent of Theroux's \\"The Mosquito Coast.\\"  The most tedious are those in Steadman's house as he dictates the erotic scenes for his novel and acts them out with Ava. These sexual narratives and flashbacks are overwrought and add little to the story.

Although he was not a particularly extraordinary man, his extra limb notwithstanding, the interest in this story lies not in the fictional biography of Blashette himself as much as in the minutiae at the margins of his life. Author Mark Dunn, who wrote the whimsical word-play novel \\"Ella Minnow Pea,\\" has pushed the boundaries of fiction even farther with \\"Ibid.\\" As Dunn states in the acknowledgments, he sought to \\"step wide of the narrative box\\" by crafting a story solely through the use of footnotes. As constrained as the idea sounds, it actually works.<br /><br />Through the footnotes with their interviews, excerpts from articles and diaries, and accounts of historical events, the reader becomes acquainted not only with Blashette, but also with his family, his friends, and society at large. Blashette managed to rub elbows with such celebrities as Rudolph Valentino, Lou Gehrig, and Dylan Thomas. He was placed at the scene of numerous historical events, both well known and obscure. Thus, Dunn asserts, \\"History can be more fun than dry facts and dates.\\"<br /><br />The silly-sounding names and titles cited in the footnotes, as well as selections of atrociously composed poems, songs, and essays, spoof their more dry and scholarly real-life counterparts.  The tongue-in-cheek details go off on bizarre tangents. In a parody of Wilde's Dorian Gray, an account is given of Blashette having commissioned his deceased true love's portrait and then having it modified every year to age her appearance. In another reference, a description is given of a friend's membership in a small Christian sect that believed Jesus had a dog that accompanied Him as He preached. There is an amusing account of a devastating squirrel migration in 1826 that destroyed crops.  Another humorous segue is a court deposition, recorded during a lawsuit against Blashette's deodorant company, that is written in the form of a play script,<br /><br />Where Dunn will go from here is anyone's guess.

At the same time, her father-in-law Wilson, running from a loan shark he owes a large debt to, shows up in town looking for cash from his son Michael. When a gypsy family holds a funeral at the Savoy funeral home, a special gold coin is placed between the deceased teenage girl's hands, meant to pay her safe passage to the next world. Wilson steals it to pay off his gambling debts, but promptly loses it. A ghostly presence later appears to Michael and warns him that if the coin is not returned to the gypsy girl's grave by the rising of the second sun, a deadly vengeance will be exacted upon the Savoy family. As Michael and his father conduct a desperate hunt for the coin, Janet, unaware of the menacing threat, takes her daughter and niece to a family cabin for a short vacation. The gypsy curse follows them there, and Janet's worst nightmares are about to come true.<br /><br />\\"Grave Intent\\" is chock full of scary themes and scenes: a gypsy curse, ghosts and otherworldly terrors, demonic possession of a child, and a series of ghastly things that go bump in the night. At the beginning of the story, there is a bit of comic relief in the form of the gypsy antics at the funeral and Wilson's attempts to weasel money out of his son. But that is short-lived, and the horror builds to a heart-pounding crescendo. Although the haunting is sometimes a bit over-the-top, this is a fast-paced and creepy novel that will keep you turning pages far into the night.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-07-05

This time, he's placed on retainer by a flamboyantly wealthy Texan named Billy Bob Barnstormer. When Billy Bob's date winds up dead in Stone's guestroom, Stone and his cop friend Dino investigate the murder. It turns out that Billy Bob is not what, or who, he seems. The feds, the CIA, and the NYPD are all soon after the elusive con man, and things turn dangerous for Stone when Billy Bob decides to turn the tables on him.<br /><br />Stuart Woods has a formula that has worked for many Stone Barrington novels, and he doesn't diverge from it now. Stone is still the suave James Bond-like protagonist who bravely goes after the bad guys while barely breaking into a sweat. He is still pursued by incredibly beautiful and wealthy women, this time by the U.S. Attorney for the state of New York as well as by his ex-flame Arrington Carter. As usual there are plenty of dinners at Elaine's, bedroom romps, unrealistic and often outrageous scenarios, and chase scenes. There is still a predictable outcome, although there are a few turns along the way.<br /><br />This is a quick read with short chapters, comic dialog, and lots of action. It is a fairly entertaining, although simplistic, story. The reason why I gave it only 3 stars is because it's almost become a stereotype of a Stone Barrington novel. If you enjoyed others in the series and want more of the same but in a more concentrated dose, you'll like this one. If you want something with some substance or with a bit of finesse, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-07-05

Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton's personal relationship is on the rocks because Jack is afraid to commit to marriage with Laurie, whose biological clock is ticking and who wants to start a family. To add to her stress, Laurie discovers that she has a genetic marker that significantly raises the probability she will eventually have breast cancer. As a distraction from their personal problems, Laurie and Jack become involved in a series of autopsies on surgical patients who died of cardiac failure in spite of being young and relatively healthy. Laurie learns of a similar series of deaths in another hospital. She suspects they are all related, but is unable to convince anyone else that these may be homicide cases.<br /><br />Robin Cook became a pioneer in the medical thriller genre with his book \\"Coma.\\"  Since then he has written many other medical thrillers, most of which follow a plot formula that ensures lots of suspense and a bit of medical education thrown in as a bonus. \\"Marker\\" follows the typical Cook formula: an enthusiastic medical professional is a witness to a series of mysterious deaths in a medical environment, suspects foul play, and in the pursuit of the perpetrators, is put in jeopardy him/herself. The medical lesson here is about the DNA markers in our genetic makeup that control not only the functioning of our physiological processes, but also their malfunction. In an afterword, Cook discusses the mapping of the human genome, and then presents the uses, both good and bad, that could arise from knowledge of the genetic markers that predict our future health. This is a fast-paced, suspenseful novel with two likable characters and some romantic interest thrown into the mix. Recommended.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-07-03

This globalization of industry, communications, and commerce is bringing about a revolution in the way we do business. It is empowering a new level of international collaboration that will affect each and every one of us.<br /><br />This book begins by presenting the ten forces that have flattened the world, starting with the fall of the Berlin wall and ending with the ubiquitous high-tech digital communications and storage devices that enable us to communicate with anyone anywhere. It then proceeds to the convergences of these factors to form new collaborations. It poses interesting and very challenging questions about the conflict between personal, corporate, and national interests in a flat world. It describes the impacts of the flat world on America, developing countries, corporations, and individuals. It explains why parts of the world remain unflat and what can be done to help flatten them. Above all, this book presents a balanced view of globalization that encompasses both the good and the bad.  It presents an alarming view of the forces that try to counter globalization while at the same time availing themselves of the ten flatteners to accomplish this objective.<br /><br />Friedman provides some interesting theories on why some nations are flattening and others aren't, and on why economic globalization can impact geopolitical systems. Although some of the news in this book is frightening, it ends on a positive note. It provides suggestions on how American society must adjust to compete in the new global marketplace.  This book is a wakeup call for everyone who holds a job or has lost one, for everyone who gripes about the lack of American-made products and then expects to pay bottom dollar for those products, and for those who are concerned about the quality of our educational system and the threat of terrorism. In other words, it is required reading for everyone!<br /><br />Eileen Riebackholds a job or has lost one, for everyone who gripes about the lack of American-made products and then expects to pay bottom dollar for those products, and for those who are concerned about the quality of our educational system and the threat of terrorism.

But when her true love Romeo Cacciamani damages his back in an ill-advised attempt to carry her up the stairs, he winds up confined to her bed for an indefinite period since he cannot be moved. Then Julie's older daughter Nora arrives on the scene with her own medical problem and moves in, and the house becomes very crowded. Throw in granddaughter Sarah's obsession with Willie Wonka and with lottery tickets, add regular visits from Romeo's sizable Cacciamani clan, and total chaos ensues. With all this confusion, there's not much time left for minding the family florist business. Although the situation seems difficult, Julie finds that good luck comes in family-sized packages.<br /><br />This is the typical feel-good Jeanne Ray story, where the bustle and domestic squabbles of a close-knit household test the strength of the most patient of mothers, and where the family is brought closer together through love and a mild, and almost humorous, crisis. Ray's stories almost have the feel of fairy tales, since they tend to have happily-ever-after endings. In this one, Lady Luck is a veritable fairy godmother. I didn't enjoy this book as much as its predecessor, \\"Julie and Romeo,\\" perhaps because as a sequel it didn't have the novelty of the original. But it was still a quick and fun read - the kind that had me smiling as I closed the cover. It's a great beach book.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-06-14

Rodney Rothman, who prematurely retired at the ripe old age of 28 after losing his job as a television show writer, moved into a Boca Raton Century Village retirement condo, determined to try out retirement forty years early.<br /><br />We meet Rothman's roommate, a shy retired piano teacher whose only companions are her condo-prohibited pets. We learn about his new friend Amy, a raunchy 93-year-old former stand-up comedian. We watch him play bad golf with Artie, a former heroin dealer who is uncertain about what to do with the rest of his life. Then add anecdotes about his shuffleboard, club, and pool buddies, and Rothman paints a fascinating picture of what it's like to grow old. He also throws in details about his own personal concerns, such as finding a Nice Jewish Girl, convincing his family and friends that he's not crazy for what he's doing, and deciding how and when he will reenter the work force.<br /><br />Rothman did his homework, having read up on the physical, mental, and social concerns of the elderly. As he compares the differences and similarities between the lives of the young and old, he provides an interesting interpretive twist from the refreshingly witty point of view of a twenty-something. In many ways, he claims, the elderly are a lot like their teenage counterparts. They form the same cliques and have the same concerns about fitting in. Old men, who left their immature behavior behind when they married, regain it at this stage of their lives and have primarily women on their minds. Old women are still the giggly, gossipy girls they were in high school. Although I expected this book to be exaggeratedly funny a la Laurie Notaro, instead I found a lower-key, yet still hilarious, memoir that demonstrates a surprising amount of compassion for the elderly. I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it as a laugh-out-loud yet moving account of the golden years, South Florida style.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackhilarious, memoir that demonstrates a surprising amount of compassion for the elderly.

These witches bestow three gifts upon the baby and place him with the owner of an acting troupe. The new king is an evil one, and the entire kingdom (animal, vegetable, and mineral) expresses its displeasure. How could the witches possibly refrain from using their magic skills to meddle in royal politics, place the rightful heir on the throne, and set things right?<br /><br />\\"Wyrd Sisters\\" is the sixth title in the Discworld series, and with each book, author Terry Pratchett keeps getting better and better. The story is a clever parody of Shakespeare from the opening scene onwards. It's a fast-paced romp through a pastiche of scenes, themes, and lines from Macbeth, Hamlet, Julius Caesar, King Lear, As You Like It, and many more, all unified into an entertaining whole. Pratchett also throws in references to Tolkien, Alice in Wonderland, the Wizard of Oz, and Sleeping Beauty (not to mention others I have probably missed).<br /><br />The witches are my favorite Discworld characters, and with good reason. Their personalities are drawn to perfection, and each of them is endearing in her own way. Granny Weatherwax, who was first introduced in \\"Equal Rites,\\" is the feisty, powerful, no-nonsense witch who believes in headology. Nanny Ogg is the grandmotherly witch who loves drinking and bawdy songs. Magrat Garlick is the young, idealistic New Age witch who likes spells to be performed just so, and who falls in love with the court Fool. The interactions and squabbles between the three witches are hilarious.<br /><br />You don't have to like Shakespeare to appreciate this book, although a passing knowledge of at least Hamlet and Macbeth will enhance the enjoyment. Nor do you have to be a fan of fantasy fiction. You just need a good sense of humor, because this book is wickedly funny all the way through. Even the footnotes will make you laugh.

Victor has learned the secret of long life and is still alive and well in 21st century New Orleans. Now a respected scientist and wealthy member of high society by day, Victor practices his high-tech life creation projects by night in order to create perfect beings, totally obedient to his will. He seeds his creations throughout the city so that they can undermine, and eventually replace, humanity and lead to a perfect New Age society. In the meanwhile, Frankenstein's original monster, now called Deucalion, is also gifted with immortality. He learns of his creator's existence and sets off for New Orleans to seek revenge. When a series of gruesome murders occur where body parts are removed from the victims, two police detectives try to track down the killer. Is one of Frankenstein's creations to blame?<br /><br />The portrayal of Frankenstein's creatures is especially interesting. Created with a carefully controlled blend of human emotion and programmed behavior, they are at times confused about their feelings. Sometimes their human component fights against their artificial one, with interesting results. In a clever turnabout, Victor Frankenstein is portrayed as a monster and Deucalion has evolved to show more human traits than his creator. At first I was amused by the fact that immortality has become a popular pursuit, and that others in the story besides Frankenstein and his creations are capable of prolonged lives and physical perfection. Yet the real-world popularity of plastic surgery, nutritional supplements, and health clubs does prove that art imitates life.<br /><br />Koontz originally wrote this story as a two-hour script for a television series pilot for the USA Network. When the producer requested major changes, Koontz pulled out of the project and decided to rewrite the story in book form in order to preserve the original concept. This book is only the first in a series of novels about Frankenstein and his progeny. Although I was expecting the story to have a few loose ends to pave the way for the next in the series, the ending could have been a bit less abrupt.

In debut author David Maine's \\"The Preservationist,\\" he works out many of the practical implementation details in a believable manner and allows readers to place themselves at the scene. We get to witness the labors of Noe (as he is called here) and his family, as they gather materials and build the ark while facing ridicule from others. We accompany the women as they collect every species of animal, and then load and arrange them on the boat. We experience the effects of a year of cramped conditions aboard the ark, while worrying about having enough food and fresh water for the survival of man and beast alike. We feel what it would be like to be the sole survivors of a watery holocaust, setting out to rebuild our lives and repopulate the world. And through it all, we feel God's helping hand here and there to make this monumental feat succeed.<br /><br />As interesting as these details are, what truly makes this story shine is the way in which Maine makes his characters come alive through gentle humor and creative artistry. Told in alternating voices by the members of Noe's family, the story documents the unspoken affection between 600-year-old Noe and his unnamed wife. It explores the personalities and conflicts of Noe's three sons and their wives. It explores Noe's alternating feelings of confidence and anxiety as he bears the responsibility of carrying out Yahweh's will. Every character has the opportunity to voice their thoughts about the nature of God and His reasons for causing the flood and sparing their lives.<br /><br />This book can be read both as an interesting story of a family's struggle for survival and as a refreshingly innovative retelling of a story of God's relationship with man. At times funny, at times touching, and at times even irreverent, it is a story of affection, faith, humanity, and endurance.<br /><br />Eileen Riebacks touching, and at times even irreverent, it is a story of affection, faith, humanity, and endurance. <br /> <br />Eileen Rieback	2005-05-27

Sorcery makes wizardry look like child's play, and ten-year-old Coin, guided by his staff imbued with the spirit of his wizard father, wants his magical power to reign supreme over all Discworld. Starting off by usurping the position of Archchancellor of Unseen University, he proceeds to overpower anyone and anything that stands in his way. The Patrician Vetinari, and even the gods themselves, are no match for Coin. The entire future of Discworld is at stake as it teeters on the brink of the Apocralypse. No, I didn't misspell it - the Aprocralypse is an apocryphal apocalypse in which magic will destroy Discworld and the Ice Age will return.<br /><br />Rincewind, the bumbling and cowardly wizard of previous Discworld books, is back to face his most daunting challenge yet as he is commanded by the Archchancellor's magic hat to vanquish sorcery and save Discworld.  He reluctantly joins forces with the beautiful but fierce Conina and an adolescent barbarian-wannabe named Nijel, and together they travel from Ankh Morpork to Klatch and back using some very unusual modes of transportation. Rincewind's many-legged luggage makes an appearance as well, but it keeps wandering off and it doesn't do much to advance the story line.<br /><br />Pratchett delivers another madcap adventure full of satire and spoofery. He does a wonderful job of portraying a parade of funny characters. Among them are a filthy rich Klatchian ruler who spouts bad poetry, the One Horseman and Three Pedestrians of the Aprocralypse, the orangutan librarian of Unseen University, and a genie who doesn't obey commands very well. Pratchett can anthropomorphize objects like no one else. Besides the luggage, he animates an ill-tempered magic staff and the frightened grimoires of the university library. He enlightens the reader on the nature of hit-or-miss inspiration, warns of the flaws of the wizards' genetic experiments, and presents a magic lamp paradox that even the laws of physics can't keep up with. This is a hilarious story of magic gone awry. Since it builds on the characters from the previous books of the Discworld wizard track, I suggest you read \\"The Color of Magic\\" and \\"The Light Fantastic\\" first, if you haven't already done so. Then dive headlong into this one. You will be enchanted!<br /><br />Eileen Riebackthe wizards' genetic experiments, and presents a magic lamp paradox that even the laws of physics can't keep up with.

After an infant boy is discarded on a garbage heap and left for dead, he is found by Geoffroy Loveall, the effeminate, eccentric Lord of Love Hall, who is concerned about the need for an heir to inherit his vast wealth. Lord Loveall brings the baby back to the manor, hastily marries a member of the household staff, and claims that there is a new heir to the family fortune. However, obsessed with the death of his sister and living in a dream world of his own, the Lord declares the baby to be a girl and names him Rose. With the collusion of the immediate family and household staff, Lord Loveall raises Rose as a proper Victorian girl who is pampered, spoiled by an excess of weath and prestige, and dubbed \\"Miss Fortune\\". For years Rose never questions his femininity. His life seems idyllic as he plays with the two children of a household servant and helps his mother with her work in the estate library.<br /><br />Inevitably, the young Rose reaches adolescence and suddenly doesn't look or feel ladylike any more. As greedy relatives circle in their attempt to wrest control of the estate from Lord Loveall, Rose discovers his true gender and adoptive status. When he reveals himself as a male to society at large and to his predatory relatives, he causes a scandal that jeopardizes the legitimacy of his inheritance. He does not feel at home in his male body and continues to wear dresses, even while sporting a fine mustache. After Lord Loveall dies, his survivors struggle to keep their claim to the Loveall fortune while Rose sets out to discover his roots... and himself.<br /><br />There are many humorous elements here. The reaction of proper Victorian society to the cross-dressing Rose is one. Another is the squabbles of a dysfunction pack of conniving relatives who examine each other's weaknesses and go for the jugular. The Loveall wealth is exaggeratedly immense, leading to descriptions of a household staff so huge that one servant does nothing except raise or lower a flag to signify whether the Young Lord is at home and well. Author Wesley Stace, who is also known as singer/songwriter John Wesley Harding, laces the story with Victorian ballads, one of which is instrumental in helping Rose unearth his true past.<br /><br />In some ways, this story brings to mind the novel \\"Middlesex,\\" since both novels are about a male brought up as a female in unconventional family surroundings. Both concern the child's gradual awakening to his true sexual nature, his flight, and his gradual acceptance of what, and who he is. Both are also interwoven with mythological references. Although \\"Misfortune\\" is not as well-crafted a novel as \\"Middlesex,\\" it is an entertaining story full of wild Dickensian coincidences, absurdly comic situations, songs, and bawdy humor. It also offers some serious observations about a dual masculine/feminine psyche and the nature of fate.

Author Kenji Kawakami, whose International Chindogu Society promotes this wonderfully wacky art form, has compiled \\"The Big Bento Box of Unuseless Japanese Inventions\\" to celebrate the best of Chindogu.<br /><br />Each of the 200 inventions includes a description and one or more color photographs of someone modeling or demonstrating the product. How can I begin to list the many types of devices found in this off-the-wall collection?  There are many items of apparel ranging from a backscratcher's T-shirt with an itch grid (\\"Could you please scratch my back at F6?\\") to training high heels with stabilizer wheels. For the workaholics, there are an office tie and tool belt, each with handy compartments to hold business cards, a calculator, telephone, pens, and other office essentials. There are many umbrella devices, such as the full-body umbrella, an umbrella golf club, and shoe umbrellas to avoid nasty rain puddle splashes. For dieters there are a magnifying fork and dishes that hold half the food they seem to through the use of mirrors. For the handyman there are Swiss army gloves and lawn mower sandals. For the water hater there's a bath body suit to keep you dry no matter how long you soak in the tub. For the claustrophobe, there are wide-angle glasses to make that cramped apartment look roomy. For the ultimate in personal hygiene there are a two-sided toothbrush that cuts brushing time in half and a pair of eye drop funnel glasses. I could go on and on... but I'll leave you with this final gem:  the solar-powered flashlight. What would be more impractical than that?<br /><br />These Chindogu do a masterful job at spoofing our insatiable need for gadgets. The deadpan photos of people using these items are hilarious. Not only will you laugh, but you might really crave a more refined version of some of these products. You might even be inspired to create an unuseless invention of your own.

Although it does not state that these puzzles are collected from past issues of the Dell magazine, they are the same types of word puzzles with exactly the same names (Kriss Kross, Figgerits, Cryptoquizzes, Bowl-A-Score Challenger, Spellathon, etc.) that Dell puzzle solvers are familiar with.<br /><br />This collection includes plenty of good-quality medium difficulty puzzles. One reason I gave this book only three stars is because it has no table of contents, so if you enjoy one particular type of puzzle over the others and want to tackle those first, you have to thumb through the entire book to find them. Another reason is that it is hard to justify the price when you can buy an almost identical collection as a Dell Vacation Special issue for half the price.

A young girl says that they are saving the world. Soon they are joined by other women, and then more women, and suddenly this gentle gathering appears to have the ability to transform the world for the better.<br /><br />In an afterword, author Sharon Mehdi described how she came to write this story. She had been trying to write a serious nonfiction book about buried scrolls that would save the world, but came down with a bad case of writer's block. At that same time, several things influenced her to take a different tack: she became a grandmother, the world was full of bad news about war, violence, and economic woes, and she recalled a Native American elder telling her that \\"men have taken the world as far as they can. It's up to the women to lead us the rest of the way.\\"  At that point she decided to write her granddaughter a children's story for grownups. It began as a booklet, but as it was read to more and more women, its popularity spread until it was time to be published for a wider audience.<br /><br />This small book carries a message of hope. Laced with warmth and humor, it asserts that silence can speak loudly and that small acts can take on a power of their own. This would make a great gift for Mother's Day, or for any woman who thinks she can't make a difference in the world.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-04-14

As the CEO of Stratton Corporation, a major manufacturer of office furniture and cubicles, he was forced by his parent company to lay off five thousand workers. Now he is an outcast in his own hometown, since almost every resident was affected in some way by the layoffs. A disgruntled former employee has been breaking into his home and leaving threatening messages. The members of the board of his corporation appear to be acting behind his back and trying to force him out. He is a recent widower with a kitchen in the midst of a major remodeling and a teenage son who is having problems at home and in school. Sound bad?  Well that's just the beginning. When he confronts the intruder who has been threatening him, things go very wrong, and soon he finds himself the target of a police investigation. As his problems mount, so does the tension. Nick has nowhere to hide.<br /><br />Finder has continued in the tradition of his last novel \\"Paranoia\\" with another fast-paced and suspenseful story. This time, however, it's a combination of corporate thriller and murder mystery. Instead of examining the world of high tech, it explores a manufacturer of more down-to-earth products like desk chairs. There are interesting details about the design and manufacture of office equipment, and it's obvious that Finder did his homework on the topic.<br /><br />Anyone who works in the corporate world or is close to someone who does will find that the ripple effects of Stratton's mammoth layoffs ring all too true. This makes Nick's \\"company man\\" portrayal a bit out of the ordinary, since he is a high level executive with a conscience about the corporate buyouts, force reductions, and labor outsourcing that have become an integral part of today's business practices. He even insists that top management work in a cubicle environment like the other workers instead of in posh corner offices. Besides Nick, there are many other well fleshed-out characters. One of them is police detective Audrey Rhimes, who struggles with racial and gender discrimination on the job and who must keep an open mind when investigating Nick even though Stratton laid off her husband.

He is a precocious, emotionally disturbed French nine-year-old who is oddly different from other children.  He has been a victim of frequent life-threatening accidents since the complications of his birth. His Maman warns him that he is using up his nine lives faster than a cat, and she is frantic to protect him. But on his ninth birthday, while on a picnic with his parents, he falls off a cliff and his Papa vanishes without a trace. Maman claims that Papa pushed Louis off the cliff and has gone into hiding. Although pronounced dead, Louis somehow begins breathing again, but is in a deep comatose state. He is transferred to Dr. Pascal Dannachet's coma clinic while the police search for Papa.<br /><br />The story is narrated alternately by Louis within his coma and by Dr. Dannachet. In a disturbing and eerily askew voice that calls to mind Christopher Boone from \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\\" Louis tells his life story to a mysterious bandaged man who lives in his head. Through the voice of the doctor, who becomes obsessed with Maman and talks with the police, the reader is presented with different perspectives on the severely dysfunctional Drax family and Louis's near-fatal accident. As the two narrative voices converge, the truth of Louis's past slowly emerges.<br /><br />I found the book unsettling, haunting, and full of constantly shifting truths. Yet I also found it riveting, freshly original, and full of twists and surprises. Louis is presented in a quirky and endearing fashion, and his narrative mixes humor with angst.

US	53012990	RP2R8TZPUW446	0385510454	797048445	The Broker: A Novel	Books	3	15	18	N	N	Not among Grisham's best	When Washington power broker Joel Backman gets a presidential pardon after serving six years of his twenty-year sentence in federal prison for compromising national security, he is given a new identity and sent to Italy. He undergoes an intensive language and culture training program to integrate him into Italian life and hide him from danger... at least that's what he's told. What he doesn't know is that he has been set up by the CIA as a target for assassination in order to determine which foreign agency he tried to sell secrets to.<br /><br />Joel Backman might be a former lawyer, but this is no legal thriller. There are no courtroom scenes, crime investigations, or legal maneuvers. It borders more on an espionage thriller, although the cloak-and-dagger action is minimal. The book consists mostly of Backman's struggles to keep a low profile in a foreign country and outfox his nameless pursuers. There is some amusing humor at the start of the book as the completely inept president, in his last hours in office, is bullied by the CIA into pardoning Backman. But that rapidly falls by the wayside as Backman goes into hiding. I found that the best part of the book was its delightful travel narrative, with Backman playing tourist and absorbing the local color of Treviso, Bologna, and other Italian cities. I imagined myself sitting with Backman in the cafes, drinking espresso and dining on fantastic local cuisine, learning Italian, and wandering the arched portico-covered sidewalks while absorbing the scenic panoramas of Bologna.<br /><br />Although the first half of the book was fairly suspenseful, the ending was very disappointing. It seems that Grisham grew weary of Backman's predicament and decided to tie up the loose ends far too tidily. He brought the story abruptly to an unrealistic and naive conclusion. This is not one of Grisham's best efforts, but if you enjoy travelogues and want to practice your Italian 101, you might consider that the book's redeeming quality.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackality. <br /> <br />Eileen Rieback	2005-03-29

Malcolm Gladwell says that \\"thin-slicing,\\" or the use of narrow slices of experience to find patterns in situations and behavior, is often a more effective way to make a decision than through a lot of thought and an abundance of facts. He starts off with the story of a statue, purportedly rare and ancient, that was asserted to be genuine through careful analysis, yet was felt to be a fake through the instant intuition of some experts. He then presents a number of interesting examples, from speed dating to conducting warfare, from selling cars to interviewing job candidates, that demonstrate how to effectively make quick decisions based upon a small amount of data. Again and again he reminds us that less is more.<br /><br />There are fascinating anecdotes here that demonstrate the power of our subconscious mind. Gladwell presents some people whose sense of intuition is uncanny: a psychologist who, after observing a married couple for fifteen minutes, could tell with ninety percent accuracy whether they would still be married fifteen years later; a tennis coach who could tell when a player was about to double fault; a psychology professor who could read faces so well he seemed to be able to read minds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are two problems with this book that detract from its strengths. First, there is little or no explanation given for how or why we might experience these phenomena. It is not a how-to manual, as there are no hard and fast rules on how to thin-slice our way to brilliant decision-making. And second, Gladwell cautions that we can often be misled by our snap judgments due to priming, prior bias or associations, and stress. He contends that we tend to base our judgment about something as much on its physical appearance or packaging as on its actual function. Doing incorrect thin-slicing led to the New Coke marketing fiasco, led to the election of a president who was handsome and charismatic but one of the worst leaders in U.S history, and kept many talented women out of top professional orchestras. Will this book change the way I come to decisions?  No. But it has been an informative read nonetheless, and it has given me more reason than ever to admire the mysteries of the human brain.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackg led to the New Coke marketing fiasco, led to the election of a president who was handsome and charismatic but one of the worst leaders in U.S history, and kept many talented women out of top professional orchestras.

Narrated alternately by the French baker Raymond Joubert and through excerpts from Gemma's diary, Gemma's story slowly unfolds. The beautiful British decorator marries Charlie Bovery, becomes caught up in a dead-end career, and is reluctantly involved in Charlie's domestic conflicts with his ex-wife and children. She decides to flee her dreary London life, and she talks Charlie into buying a home in the rural French countryside. Small town life seems no better for her, however, as her charming country cottage develops water leaks and is infested with pests. She tries to escape her boredom through adulterous love affairs and a spending spree that causes financial problems. Joubert, her next-door neighbor, becomes obsessed with Gemma, spies on her, and becomes jealous of her lovers.<br /><br />If you have any familiarity with French literature, the title \\"Gemma Bovery\\" should  immediately remind you of the Flaubert novel \\"Madame Bovary.\\"  And if that's not enough, the parallels in the two story lines should make it obvious that this is not mere coincidence.  But this story is more than a retelling of the classic novel, and there are as many differences from as there are similarities to the original. It is a witty modernization of a timeless tale that satirizes the aspirations and foibles of the yuppie middle class as well as the  cultural differences between the French and British. In no way are the similarities between Emma Bovary and Gemma Bovery subtly presented. Author Posy Simmonds revels in them through the observations and machinations of Joubert, who warns others of parallels between the two and tries to prevent Gemma from coming to the same tragic end as Emma did.<br /><br />For a graphic novel, there is a lot of text. But the cartoon panels are interspersed with the text, diary entries, and snippets of partially translated French dialog in a wonderfully layered fashion and are rich in detail. There are twists in the story as the details about Gemma's death are revealed. Whether you have read the original French classic or not, and whether you are a graphic novel fan or not, this is a creative and entertaining story you will enjoy.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackch in detail.

They settle down to family life in 1950s Wisconsin and suffer the tragic loss of their son. When the famous resident artist and womanizer Ned Weaver sees Sonja, he insists she model for him. She decides to accept his offer but doesn't tell Henry she is doing so. Ned becomes fascinated with Sonja, and he is driven to capture every facet of her body and moods on canvas. Henry eventually learns from his neighbors about her posing in the nude, and he becomes angry.  Sonja is soon caught between the obsessions and jealousy of both men. The situation seems destined to come to confrontation.<br /><br />This novel is written in a lyrical style that drew me in and held me spellbound. Larry Watson is as artistic with his prose as Ned is with his paintbrush. The characters come alive: the down-to-earth Henry, the enigmatic Sonja, the eccentric Ned, and Ned's long-suffering wife Harriet, as well as the other family members and residents of Door County. The details of the town are described as though through an artist's eye, and readers cannot help but feel that they are there sitting in the Top Deck Tavern, or watching Ned working in his cluttered studio, or braving the wintry weather to gaze at the ice-crusted harbor. This is a book to savor. I recommend it highly.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-03-08
US	53012990	R2HUF0CDPZHM36	0399151613	781983073	The Jane Austen Book Club	Books	3	25	33	N	N	Disappointing	\\"Each of us has a private Austen,\\" begins this novel about a group of five women and one man who form a club to discuss the works of Jane Austen. Each club member has their own view of Austen, her characters, and what she was trying to say about love, marriage, and the role of women in society. Each chapter covers the club's discussion of one of Austen's books, although the story is more about the lives of the club members than it is about the book discussions. The story not only covers the events in the present-day lives of the club members, but often detours into the past to describe their lives and the experiences they bring to the interpretation of Austen's works.<br /><br />In spite of the glowing praise on the front and back covers of this novel, I found it  a disappointment. Part of the problem is that, for me, the story succeeded neither as a story about women and their bonds of friendship nor as a tribute to Jane Austen that provided insights into her novels or characters. I never grew to like or care about the six club members. Nor did I feel a new appreciation for Austen that made me want to run out and read her novels.<br /><br />At the beginning and end of some chapters, there are out-of-place quotations about the publication of Austen's books, comments on her works by classic authors, and even a passage from a novel by another author that only has peripheral relevance to the story line. The end of the book contains summaries of the plots of the six Austen novels, questions for discussion, and comments on two of Austen's novels by her family and friends. It also includes a lengthy section of footnoted comments by critics and authors from the early 1800s to the present day that run the gamut from the positive to the negative. If you are an Austen fan you will probably get more out of this book than if you're not. If you're looking for a good story about a group of people brought together through a book discussion group, you're better off reading \\"The Reading Group\\" by Elizabeth Noble.<br /><br />Eileen Riebacke Reading Group\\" by Elizabeth Noble. <br /> <br />Eileen Rieback	2005-02-28

Con man Moist von Lipwig (and who but Terry Pratchett could get away with naming a protagonist Moist?) is in the process of being hanged for his many misdeeds when he suddenly finds himself awakening in the offices of Lord Vetinari, the despotic ruler of Ankh-Morpork. He is being offered a reprieve if he is willing to accept a job as Postmaster of the town's postal service. Guarded by a golem parole officer and forced to face the decrepit ruins of this once-great government institution, he begins to think that this is a fate worse than death by hanging.  Ancient undelivered mail is piled to the rafters. The mail carriers are even more ancient. The building is delapidated, as typified by its plundered plaque bearing the logo \\"Neither rain nor snow nor gl om of ni  t.\\"  How can Moist whip the postal service into good enough shape to overcome fierce competition from the omnipotent Grand Trunk communications company, headed by the supreme crook Reacher Gilt? How can he win the affections of Miss Dearheart? Or better yet, how can he escape from this impossible job, his golem guard, Lord Vetinari, and his appointment with Death?<br /><br />Discworld fans will not be disappointed with Pratchett's latest effort. It is wickedly funny as it finds new and interesting topics to satirize:  government institutions, corporate greed and corruption, secret society initiation rites, Internet hackers, and the hobby of collecting. On a more serious note, Pratchett explores the many facets of free will and hope as embodied by Moist, Vetinari, and the golems. Those who know a bit about the technology of communications will see the interesting mix of telegraph, telephone, and Internet technology present in the \\"clacks\\" system of communications used by the Grand Trunk, and will see echoes of the detrimental effect the Internet is having on the real-world postal service business.<br /><br />This is the first of Pratchett's adult novels to be divided into chapters, for which I am very grateful. His books are hard enough to put down as it is without the difficulty of finding a good place to stop. Pratchett even makes the implementation of chapters fun by using chapter subheadings that pique the readers interest and solicit laughs with such wording as \\"In which Stanley experiences the joy of sacks\\" and \\"A discussion of Lord Vetinari's backside.\\" Each chapter is also graced with an illustration of an Ankh-Morpork postage stamp, and for you ardent Discworld fans, I understand that collector editions of these stamps have actually been printed and are for sale to collectors.<br /><br />Although this novel is populated with wizards, guards, and other Ankh-Morpork denizens who have made appearances in earlier Discworld books, readers new to the series can fully enjoy the story without needing background information.

US	53012990	R2NUN0GWTWX5ZY	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	3	71	96	N	N	Fact or fiction?	Millionaire philanthropist George Morton, concerned about the environment, pledges millions of dollars to the National Environmental Resource Fund (NERF) in its fight against global warming. Morton doesn't realize, however, that Nicholas Drake, the head of NERF, is secretly working with ELF, an ecoterrorist group, to trigger a series of climatic disasters that will call attention to the dangers of global warming and fatten NERF's coffers. Morton becomes suspicious of NERF when some of its funds are diverted, and he demands an audit and threatens to withdraw his pledge. But Morton mysteriously disappears after a car crash. Security agent John Kenner, tracking the activities of ELF, drafts Morton's attorney Peter Evans and assistant Sarah Jones into a perilous race to save the world from the activities of the ecoterrorists.<br /><br />As a thriller, \\"State of Fear\\" is only so-so. It has all the standard international chases and narrow escapes as the protagonists attempt to track down the ecoterrorists and foil their plans for cataclysmic disaster. I could see the cinematic action playing out in my head as Evans and Sarah are caught in an Antarctic glacial crevasse, locked in a lightning chamber, and chased through the tropical jungles by cannibals. But the characters are weak. The idea of a mild-mannered environmental attorney and a personal assistant racing around the world and bravely facing and escaping one peril after another is a bit much to swallow. Other characters are blatant caricatures of real environmental spokespeople or are cardboard stereotypes. Although the story is fairly entertaining on the surface, it seems to be more of a vehicle for the author's ideas about environmental issues than it is an international techno-thriller.<br /><br />Crichton contends that global warming is a myth used by environmental groups to frighten the public into supporting their activities. The story perpetuates this claim as Kenner counters every argument by Evans, Drake, and other environmentally aware characters who fear the imminent dangers of global warming. The story line is continually interrupted with charts, graphs, and heavily footnoted findings from scientists and environmental studies that contend that there is no warming or other effect on the climate from carbon dioxide or other industrial gases. The author gets onto his soapbox in an afterward, where he warns against politicized science and makes a veiled comparison between such politically endorsed theories as global warming and eugenics. Are Crichton's theories controversial? You bet. Are they true?  You decide. Some experts agree with him and some don't. As Kenner cautions Peter and Sarah that statistics can be manipulated to prove just about anything, so I caution the reader that Crichton may be doing exactly the same thing.<br /><br />Eileen Riebacke, and other environmentally aware characters who fear the imminent dangers of global warming.

As each date approaches, Jimmy feels the sword of Damocles dangling by an invisible thread over his head. What will each horrible day bring, and when during the day will the sword drop? Each chapter covers the time leading up to and through one of the prophesied days. Those days are horrible indeed. They are also interrelated and tied to a mysterious fact about Jimmy's birth that he has yet to discover.<br /><br />I breathed a sigh of relief when I closed the cover of this book, but not because of the ending. I'm referring to the fact that Koontz has redeemed himself for his disappointing last book, \\"The Taking,\\" with the suspenseful and surprise-filled \\"Life Expectancy.\\" Koontz is the only horror writer I know who can seamlessly blend horror, humor, love, and hope. The only reason I did not give this book five stars is because I felt his trademark juxtaposition of horror and humor actually went a bit overboard at times. The story is full of twists and turns and tension-filled moments. It is populated with quirky characters including pastry chefs, a tornado chaser, a morbidly pessimistic Grandma, demented circus performers, and a pet portrait painter.  Recommended as a riveting and satisfying read that both chills and radiates the warmth of a freshly baked loaf of bread.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-01-23

King George III has become a raving lunatic. England is at war with France and could use some magic to defeat it. Along comes the colorless recluse Gilbert Norrell, who seems to be the only practicing magician left in England. Perhaps this is because he hoards all the books of magic that are known to exist. He is called upon by the York Society of magicians to demonstrate his abilities, which he only agrees to do on the condition that they all stop studying magic. As the only remaining magician free to practice the craft, he is now in great demand by the government, who uses his talents to help win the war against Napoleon.<br /><br />However, it is lonely being the sole magician in England, so Mr. Norrell takes on the young apprentice Jonathan Strange. Norrell is conservative where Strange is progressive. Norrell reviles the legendary Raven King, a powerful magician raised by faeries during the glory days of magic, but Strange believes the Raven King's magic should be studied and appreciated. With such conflicting opinions on the practice of magic, it is inevitable that a confrontation will ensue between the two magicians.<br /><br />This book is brilliant in its treatment of magic as a rule-based gentlemanly art, studied by scholars and accepted in the highest social circles. As the story progresses, there is a gradual shift from this civilized magic of parlor tricks and war tactics to the far more ancient and untamed magic practiced by faeries. Before long, a pervasive dark magic overlays reality and is reflected in every mirror and rain puddle. Clarke is able to portray both flavors of magic with masterful skill, and she blends them into a mood-setting whole that is unusual and innovative.<br /><br />There is such a seamless blend of history and magical fantasy that it is hard to tell where real English history leaves off and an imaginary history of magic takes over. Strange and Norrell carry on their business alongside the Duke of Wellington and poet Lord Byron. Clarke tells the story with wit and polish. She sets a realistic tone with meticulous detail on societal structure and mannerisms of Jane Austen's time. Her use of quaint phrasing and such spelling as \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\" and \\"shew\\" for \\"show\\", as well as use of fictitious footnotes on folklore and the history of magic, add to the realism. Yes, this is a long novel. But that effectively pulls the reader into a world where Parliament and magic, history and enchantment, and gentlemen and faeries work side-by-side. The book is so full of well-articulated imagery and magical surprises that the story line speeds along. Forget comparisons of this novel to Harry Potter. I recommend it as a refreshingly unique read.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackt it is hard to tell where real English history leaves off and an imaginary history of magic takes over.

The Friday and Saturday puzzles might be the toughest of the week, but nothing can compare to the themed cleverness and generous size of the Sunday puzzle. In this collection of Super Sunday puzzles, which originally appeared in the New York Times from April 1997 to March 1998, editor Will Shortz has added a twist:  each of the fifty puzzles has two sets of clues. The first set, which is located beside the puzzle grid, has the original clues. The second set, at the back of the book, has an easier set of clues that can be clipped out and overlaid on top of the original clues. The solver can either tackle each puzzle with the tougher clues first, using the easier ones when necessary, or else simply use the easier clues to begin with.<br /><br />As for the use of the easier clues, they may not make the solving that much easier. The majority of the easy clues are exactly the same as, or a slightly reworded version of, the original clues. Will changing \\"Jordanian tongue\\" to \\"Language of Jordan\\" really help a solver?  Not likely. But where the easier clues will help is where the original ones have an intentional ambiguity to them that makes finding the answer a real challenge. An example is the changing of the clue \\"Small club, say\\" into the more explicit \\"Card that beats a deuce.\\" The themed answers that are characteristic of the Sunday puzzle will be tough to solve with either set of clues, but that's part of the fun of this type of puzzle. So give yourself a small break on some of the clues and save your brainpower for the themed words.  Happy puzzling!<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-11-29

If you thought home decor from the '70s was all about shag rugs and lava lamps, think again. James Lileks, who brought readers a look at tasteless foods from the 1940s through the 1960s in \\"Gallery of Regrettable Foods,\\" now turns his critical eye to outrageous interior decorating schemes of the 1970s. This \\"labor of hate\\" will have you simultaneously laughing and wincing as Lileks introduces you to atrocities designed by decorators run amok and purchased by people who were seemingly in a drug-induced haze at the time. These decorating no-nos were gleaned from interior design magazines, books, and pamphlets. They depict entryways, living rooms, bathrooms, kitchens, dining rooms, and family rooms.<br /><br />Within the covers of \\"Interior Desecrations\\" are infectious pattern viruses that spread like a malignancy from couch to rug to drapes to wall covering. There are bedrooms that defy a good night's sleep and kitchens that cause indigestion. There are photos of vertigo-inducing reflective wallpaper on walls and ceilings. There is a parade of startling psychedelic patterns, nauseating colors that run the gamut from blinding to \\"downer browner,\\" bad art, and unidentifiable coffee table sculpture for you to ponder. I found a birth-canal shaped bathroom of particularly horrifying interest.<br /><br />As incredible as the photos are, their impact is enhanced with sharp-witted and hilarious commentary. Lileks throws in such comments as \\"The Invisible Man would clash with this sofa\\" and \\"Visual equivalent of granulated glass in your eyes.\\" He labels especially hideous decor with such designations as \\"the Taj Mahell\\" and \\"Funhouse dining room.\\" Baby boomers beware. If anything will cure you of nostalgia for what you thought of as the hip 1970s, this book will. But buy it anyway - it's wickedly funny.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-11-22

Tucker Case, an out-of-towner who passes by the scene at this significant moment, helps Lena bury the body and then protects her from the suspicions of the stoned town cop Theo Crowe. In the meanwhile, bumbling angel Raziel comes to earth to grant a Christmas miracle to a child. Wouldn't you know that the first child he comes across is Josh, who wants Santa back.<br /><br />Throw in Theo's deranged wife Molly, a B-movie actress known for her role as the Warrior Babe of the Outland, who has stopped taking her medications and is hearing voices again. Then add a talking fruit bat called Roberto, the deceased residents of the graveyard behind the Santa Rosa chapel, and a cast of other wacky characters drawn from Moore's earlier novels. When they all gather together at the Lonesome Christmas party after Raziel botches his Christmas miracle for Josh, the result is a ghoulish Christmas party from hell.<br /><br />In \\"The Stupidest Angel,\\" Christopher Moore has produced a bizarrely funny Christmas story that's a cross between \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\" There are plenty of gags and off-the-wall dialog that had me laughing all the way through. But as Moore says in a warning at the beginning of the book, \\"you should be aware that it contains cusswords as well as tasteful depictions of cannibalism and people in their forties having sex.\\" So if you find this story unsuitable to read to the younger family members around the Yule log, don't blame Moore. He told you.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-11-22

In return, he is hired into the coveted position of the head of security for the film studio. When he probes into the mysterious death of his predecessor and the beatings of several actresses, his investigations lead to a murder cover-up and blackmail. He soon runs up against a cast of shady characters that threaten his own safety.<br /><br />In a departure from his Stone Barrington novels, Woods has produced a fast-paced and entertaining story of intrigue and organized crime against the backdrop of Hollywood in its heyday. This setting provides ample opportunity for Woods to mix a bit of history and glamour into the story. As the United States hovers on the brink of the Second World War, it touches the lives of the story's characters.  Rick Barron meets Bugsy Siegel, Clark Gable, and Greta Garbo. He is dubbed \\"Prince of Beverly Hills\\" by Hedda Hopper. He listens to the big band sounds of Artie Shaw. Rick is an interesting and likable character, and it seems likely that this is the start of a new series. Recommended as a fun and fast read.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-11-22

He has always existed beyond Time and beyond life. But he has angered the Great Ones, and now he has to share the same fate as those he reaps: he is dying.  He decides to take a holiday in order to make the most of the limited time he has left. But without Death present to claim people when they move on, things are bound to go wrong as life energy builds up and wreaks havoc on Discworld.  Windle Poons, the oldest wizard at Unseen University, finds that upon his death he has nowhere to go. So he returns to his body until he can finally pass on. In his quest to find Death, he finds life. \\"Reaper Man\\" alternates between two story lines: a mostly serious one about Death and a mostly whimsical one about Poons and his fellow wizards as they battle a new life form that threatens to take over the disc.<br /><br />Although the character of Death was introduced in earlier Pratchett books, here he is fleshed out (if you will pardon the pun) into a fascinating character. He becomes a farm hand and switches to reaping crops instead of souls. He wrestles with the concept of saving a life instead of claiming one. He learns to get along with the townspeople and forms an interesting, and ultimately moving, relationship with Miss Flitworth, the elderly spinster who owns the farm. Now that he is faced with his own death, he begins to experience the vulnerabilities and emotions that other mortals face. I found Death to be a quite likable entity, and I think other readers will also.<br /><br />The late Windle Poons evokes a lot of laughs as he tries to make his way in the world of the still living. He hooks up with a group of the Undead when he joins the Fresh Start Club, an organization that fights for equal rights for the deceased. The club members include a shy banshee, a reluctant vampire, a boogeyman, and a reverse werewolf. Poons, the wizards, the Undead, and a medium named Mrs. Cake are caught up in a funny and magically madcap race to save Discworld from a fate far worse than death.<br /><br />As is usual in his books, Terry Pratchett includes wonderful nuggets of wisdom and philosophy scattered here and there between the laughs. Among the thought-provoking ideas he includes here are the relationship between belief and the object believed in, and the trolls' theory on why living things move backwards through time. He laments the intrusion of suburban sprawl and the proliferation of shopping malls. His characters ponder the meaning of life and death. This is not merely a story to race through and enjoy. It is a story to savor, and its ideas will stick with the reader long after the book is closed.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackght up in a funny and magically madcap race to save Discworld from a fate far worse than death. <br /> <br />As is usual in his books, Terry Pratchett includes wonderful nuggets of wisdom and philosophy scattered here and there between the laughs.

The body of an art critic is found charred to a crisp, seemingly from the inside out. The surrounding area is untouched except for a hoofprint branded into the floor. There is a smell of brimstone in the air. Then other murders occur that have similar satanic earmarks. Could this be cases of spontaneous combustion... or something much more sinister and otherworldly? A group of fundamentalists and doomsayers, led by the Reverend Buck, gather near the site of the first murder and claim that the world is at the brink of the Apocalypse. Meanwhile, FBI special agent Pendergast joins with the New York City police to get to the root of the grisly carnage. The clues lead them to Italy and to the fact that several of the victims had made an unspeakable pact with the devil. Pendergast may have finally found a murderer he cannot outwit.<br /><br />For those of you who have not become acquainted with special agent Pendergast in previous Lincoln/Child books, you are in for a treat. He has the deductive powers of Sherlock Holmes, the cool demeanor and adeptness of James Bond, the escapist powers of Houdini, the exquisitely cultured and refined character of a well-behaved Hannibal Lecter, and a startlingly pale and mysterious appearance out of a Charles Addams cartoon. Then pair him with the coarse Sergeant Vincent D'Agosta and the beautiful but tough police captain Laura Hayward, and this makes for an interesting crime-fighting team.<br /><br />Pendergast has his hands full with this case, and it will certainly keep the readers guessing as well. The reason I did not give this book five stars is the ending of the book, which leaves several threads dangling and has set itself up for a sequel. In spite of that, this is a great thriller that will keep you reading far into the wee hours.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-11-01

Through it all, these women forge strong bonds of friendship that support them through the rough times and help them celebrate their successes.<br /><br />The novel is divided into twelve sections, one for each month that the reading group meets. At the start of each section is a summary of the book the group will discuss. Very little of the story actually takes place at the group's meetings, however. Nor does it draw many parallels between the titles read by the group and the lives of the women in the group. The one warning I have to give about this novel is that it divulges spoilers about the endings of the reading group's books. So although you could use this novel for suggestions for your own reading group or list, it might spoil the fun of discovering the stories for yourself.<br /><br />In spite of that shortcoming, this is a great book for women about women that's sometimes funny, sometimes touching, and always entertaining.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-10-31

While these themes are unusual and original, I would not call them hilarious. The edition I own has a whoopee cushion included inside the back cover - to guarantee that the solver approaches the puzzles with a silly mind-set, I suppose.<br /><br />I only rated this book with three stars out of five because the placement of the words in the grid is not well thought-out. Some of the grids have no, or almost no, words on the diagonal (which to me are the hardest to find), and one of the puzzles has the words clustered in only half the letter grid.

In this sequel, \\"Robot Santa,\\" a year has gone by and Bob has decided to atone for his evil ways. Unbeknownst to Santa, he has created a robot Santa to help out this Christmas Eve. Robot Santa uses a rocket-boosted sleigh piloted by a gorilla and assisted by eight mechanical reindeer. Of course this metallic gift-bringer has a few flaws in its design that cause a whole new set of problems when it visits the same sisters, Charlotte and Emily, that Bob visited last year. For one thing, it becomes confused and decides to take gifts instead of delivering them. For another it shouts \\"Bingle Jells\\" and \\"Cherry Mistmas\\" as it eats the plate upon which the cookies have been left out for Santa. The real Santa eventually shows up to save Christmas Eve, and he provides a moral about the nature of Christmas spirit and the importance of gifts from the heart.<br /><br />Told in Koontz's trademark rhyming stanzas with an awkward but amusing meter, the silly verse will surely make kids laugh. Whimsical illustrations show such funny scenes as Robot Santa carting away the furniture, the gorilla in pilot goggles wearing a \\"kiss the cook\\" apron, and a mouse creating bedlam as it chases the reindeer through the house. Since this sequel refers back to the original story, it would be best if you have already read the original to the kids before reading them this one. This is a fun Christmas story.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-10-25

He then wonders what fate would have befallen him and his family if they had been forced to remain in Poland during German occupation in World War II. This book is, in essence, an alternate-history autobiography of the teenaged cartoonist Yossel, as his family is sent to the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw. Because his abilities as a cartoonist entertain the German guards, Yossel is given special favors and permitted to stay behind in the ghetto while his parents and sister are sent to the concentration camps. As he struggles for survial in the ghetto, Yossel first bears witness to and chronicles the horrors of the Holocaust in his drawings, and finally joins the Ghetto Uprising of 1943.<br /><br />Kubert's raw pencil renderings provide an incredible emotional impact as they depict the anguish of the residents of the Warsaw ghetto, the inhumanity of the concentration camps, and the courage of the Warsaw ghetto resistance fighters. This story is amazingly personal, since Kubert bases it on letters his parents received from war survivors and since he places himself in the story. It is a moving account of a very painful period in history, but it is a story that needs to be told and retold because its events must never be forgotten.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-10-25

In this parody, Dick and Jane have grown up and they now face a raft of real-world problems. Jane is a real estate agent with a mensch of a husband and Dick is a businessman who golfs and schmoozes with his business associates. Their sister Sally is a zaftig ceramics instructor living in Berkeley. Their mother has a stroke and becomes a bit farblondget. Then throw in the cheating wife of Dick's switch-hitting golfing buddy and a goniff of a handbag salesman, and... feh! Sally kvetches that this is no longer the idealized and innocent world that she grew up in, where women were dress-wearing housewives, men always wore suits, and everything was politically correct.<br /><br />The story has 40 old-fashioned watercolor illustrations that recall the style of the original readers but with content that reflects the realities of 21st century life. The text includes such dialog as \\"See Jane schlep. Schlep Jane schlep.\\" There is a glossary containing over eighty Yiddish words and phrases and one in Chinese (yes, Chinese!) that can be found in the story. Some of the funniest things in the book can be found in this glossary, where the authors explain the origins and usage of the words. An example definition is \\"Mechuleh - bankrupt, kaput... See how the letters for 'kaput' are in the word 'bankrupt'? Isn't language great?\\" You might not learn more than a smattering of Yiddish phrases from this book, but you will have some laughs over the parody and take a nostalgic trip back to the primers that taught you to read.

Her estranged father Guy calls to announce that he broke both wrists, needs help caring for himself, and is moving in with her for a while. Her mother Hollis, who already lives with her and who detests Guy, announces her displeasure over it. Her husband Sam announces that he just lost his job. Her daughter Camille is a moody teenager who never announces much of anything. Ruth's family experiences a lot of turmoil as Hollis and Guy face off against each other, Sam starts thinking about a career change, and the financial concerns begin to mount. To attempt to cope with all this, Ruth does what she always does when under stress:  she bakes cakes. For Ruth, cakes are her escape from the pressures of daily life. She even imagines being in the center of a huge warm bundt cake as a means of relaxing meditation. Can Ruth's cakes save the day in this crisis?<br /><br />This may be a story of a family in crisis, but I wouldn't really call it a dysfunctional family. It is a family struggling to deal with the same pressures and problems that so many families do:  aging parents, balky adolescents, unemployment, and midlife career crises. Jeanne Ray's novels are feel-good books full of warmth, humor, and wisdom. \\"Eat Cake\\" is no exception. In fact, as I read it I felt as warm and comfortable as if I were in the center of that fresh-from-the-oven bundt cake with Ruth. At the end of the book is a collection of recipes for cakes mentioned in the story. They include such delights as \\"Sweet potato bundt cake with rum-plumped raisins and a spiced sugar glaze\\" and \\"Almond apricot pound cake with amaretto.\\" Read this delectable book, which can be devoured in a sitting or two, and then try your hand at one of the cake recipes.

As the story opens, an ethnic mix of Turks, Armenians, and Greeks, both Muslims and Christians, are living side-by-side in a comfortable and relatively peaceful existence. But first the Franks, as the Ottomans call the Western Europeans, and then the Greeks invade their homeland. These events set off a cataclysmic chain of events that tear apart the lives of the residents of Eskibahce. The Sultan declares a holy war against the invaders. The Muslims are conscripted as soldiers and the Christians are sent into labor battalions. The Armenians are evacuated from the region in a death march. The Italians occupy Eskibahce. The Christians are forced to relocate to Greece. Throughout it all, the residents struggle to survive amidst the turmoil.<br /><br />Although this novel does an exemplary job of bringing alive the history of Turkey, there is far more here than a recounting of historic events. Told in alternating voices, viewpoints, and time periods, this story is panoramic in scope as it follows more than a dozen principal characters and a large cast of secondary ones through a series of interrelated story lines.<br /><br />There are the childhood friends Karatavuk and Mehmetcik, who are inseparable until war breaks out. At that point, Karatavuk becomes a soldier who participates in the hellish battle of Gallipoli, and Mehmetcik, who is forced into a labor battalion, later defects and becomes a brigand. There is the beautiful Christian girl Philothei, who is betrothed to Ibrahim the goatherd and whose death is foreshadowed at the start of the story. There is the landlord and town protector Rustem Bey, who casts out his adulterous wife and takes a mistress. There are Abdulhamid Hodja and Father Kristoforos, holy men who call each other infidels yet are good friends. Interspersed throughout the story are chapters on the life and career of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who moves up the military ranks to win the fight for an independent Turkey. There are merchants and craftsmen, madmen and beggars, prostitutes and scholars. Each has a tale to tell. The main focus of the book is really the town of Eskibahce itself, rather than any one character.<br /><br />De Bernieres provides a rich portrayal of his characters. The language is lyrical, and some of the vignettes have the cadence and color of folk tales. At times the story is painfully sad and sometimes it is humorous. It reflects the full spectrum of compassion and suffering, love and hatred, pride and shame, tolerance and persecution. It brings home the horrors of war and prejudice. Iskander the potter, who likes to quote proverbs, says, \\"Man is a bird without wings and a bird is a man without sorrows.\\" Birds are present throughout the story. They sing throughout the night, carry letters to the dead, have their voices captured in clay whistles, and live in cages outside the entrance to many homes. The town residents are portrayed as wingless birds that are grounded in the reality of war and unable to flee the turmoil.<br /><br />This is not a quick read, since it contains a lot of historical background and details about the forces that brought about the transformation of the Ottoman Empire into the Republic of Turkey. There are some Turkish words that are not defined and must be deduced within context (a short glossary would have helped). But the book tells a memorable and masterfully written set of stories that capture the heart and soul of the Turks. It is a powerful epic with an important message.

When his father decides to send him off to be an apprentice, he gets only one offer - from the Grim Reaper himself. It seems like a good job to Mort: free room and board and a secure position in a business that will never run out of clientele. He doesn't even need to die to take the job. Soon Mort is doing some of the reaping himself and he even seems to be gaining maturity, self-confidence, and the ability to walk through walls. He falls in love. But can he manage to help Death harvest souls without making a complete mess of things?<br /><br />This is the fourth in the wildly funny and inventive Discworld series and the first in the Death story line. Although Death made an appearance in the first three books, this time we are provided with a much closer look at Death's domain through details on his daily routine, his likes and dislikes, his household, and his horse. We meet his daughter and his faithful servant. There are hilarious scenes where Death tries out a few mortal pleasures to learn what they are all about. Only Pratchett could depict Death fly-fishing, getting drunk, or participating in a line dance. Above all else, we find out that Death's not such a bad fellow when we get to know him.<br /><br />Pratchett continues to flesh out the geography, culture, and magic of Discworld. He addresses the self-healing nature of history and the relationship between fate and death. He presents a coronation, a bevy of bumbling wizards, a deadly beverage called scumble, a library of self-writing books of life, and a dangerous section of Ankh-Morpork known as the Shades. There is also a generous helping of wit, puns, and wicked satire. This is a great read!<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-09-24

Within the pages of Cathy Day's collection of short fiction, centering on the winter home of the fictional Great Porter Circus, you will meet performers, freaks, trainers, managers, roustabouts, gypsies, and townies. Although each of these stories can stand alone, and in fact some of them have been published previously in literary journals, they are best when read together to form an interwoven tapestry that depicts the residents of Lima and how the circus has touched their lives in some way.<br /><br />Covering the period from the Civil War to the present time, these fascinating tales run the gamut of situations and dilemmas. An animal trainer is killed by one of his mistreated elephants. The daughter of a former clown cannot resist the call of the road even though she is married to a townie. Several generations of descendants of black sideshow performer Boela Man grow away from their circus past but can never leave it completely behind. A flood inundates Lima and claims the lives of a star performer and several circus animals. A tragic accident is prompted by memories of a glamorous circus cowboy. A band of gypsies takes the local campground by storm. Every story is a gem, but in my opinion the most heartfelt is the final story \\"Circus People,\\" which ties the rest together with a powerful musing on town people, circus people, and the nature of hometowns.<br /><br />This book contains superbly crafted portraits, touched with humor and tenderness, of a wide array of characters. The tales are set against a backdrop imbued with fascinating lore about the circus. Each story is prefaced with a black-and-white photograph that evokes the mood of the tale that follows. The author, who comes from a circus family herself and who grew up in a circus town, has meticulously researched the history and workings of the American circus and seamlessly merged fact and fiction. Although you will find almost no action taking place under the big top, you will get a realistic behind-the-scenes glimpse into the daily lives of its performers and workers. I strongly recommend this book, and hope that you find it as magical and compelling as I have.

In war-torn London, married Sarah Miles has an adulterous affair with the writer Maurice Bendrix, but suddenly she leaves him without explanation. Later, Bendrix befriends Sarah's dull husband Henry. When Henry confides his suspicion that his wife is cheating on him, the jealous Bendrix hires a private detective to discover why Sarah left him and who has taken his place. Tracking Sarah to a mysterious meeting with another man and gaining access to her diary, Bendrix finds that his rival is very tough competition indeed. In spite of the interesting build-up, however, the plot then wanders off in several directions at once, and the result is a hodgepodge of side stories featuring the private detective and his son, the relationship between Bendrix and Henry, the spiritual awakening in Sarah's life, and a series of miracles that impact the lives of the novel's characters.<br /><br />This story has semi-autobiographical overtones. Greene, a Catholic who pondered the relationship between adultery and religious belief, wrote a series of novels concerning God, faith, and human and divine love. This one is the culmination of that series, where God takes an active role in people's lives. It has also been postulated that the illicit affair between Bendrix and Sarah was modeled after one of Greene's own wartime love affairs.<br /><br />There are some interesting conjectures about the nature of love and hate that provide food for thought, although Greene's repetitious phrases soon became tedious, with such dialogue as \\"If I hate her so much as I sometimes do, how can I love her? Can one really hate and love? Or is it only myself I really hate?\\" I found none of the characters in this story likeable or believable. The men were are weak-willed and indecisive. Sarah, who called herself \\"a phony and a fake,\\" did not seem like the kind of woman a man would become obsessed with. Her personality was a conflicting mix of saintliness and indifference. The relationship between Bendrix and Sarah was not memorable, and there seemed to be more contention between them than love. Although the book is short, it seemed to continue beyond the logical ending point, and after a while I was more interested in the story ending than in the end of the affair.

He also sees a similarity between this story and the comic strip \\"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\\" by cartoonist Winsor McCay, in which someone is caught up in a series of bizarre nightmares brought on by overindulgence in his favorite food before bedtime. Unlike the rarebit fiend, however, Gregor is trapped in a nightmare from which he cannot awaken.<br /><br />This graphic version of the novel faithfully retells the story of Gregor Samsa and his metamorphosis into a giant insect. But without Kuper's creative scratchboard art, it would merely be a Classics Illustrated version of the original. What adds value to this retelling is its eerie drawings, which effectively reflect the darkly humorous and absurd elements of the story and enhance the reading experience. The drawings use innovative techniques to convey Gregor's insect-like behavior and his suffering through the cruelty of family and acquaintances. As Gregor weakens, his form becomes fuzzy and indistinct. His family members become demonized and exaggerated caricatures as they come to despise the insect that was once their loved one. The drawings have unsettlingly angular and electric lines, and they set the perfect mood for a bizarre and macabre story. I recommend this book to adults for its interesting and unique perspective on a well-known classic.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-09-08

The first third of the story invents a back-story for Fagin that shows how mistreatment and prejudice forced him into a life of crime as his only means of survival.  This section also makes an impassioned statement about the hardship faced by the German and Middle European Jews, who had problems integrating into British life. The rest of the story is mostly a rehashing of the original Dickens story in Fagin's voice.<br /><br />In the book's foreword and epilogue, Eisner says that his awareness of the influence of imagery on popular culture led him to create graphic novels with themes of Jewish ethnicity and prejudice. He discusses how Dickens portrayed the Jews as a criminal element in London and provides prints by George Cruickshank and other artists of that time who perpetuated the visual Jewish stereotype. Although his illustrations are rendered in sepia tones that recall the illustrations of Dickens' novels, Eisner has tried to counter the stereotypical portrayal of Fagin by drawing him as he might really have looked. All in all, this novel provides new insight into the complex character of Fagin and a fresh and innovative retelling of the Dickens classic.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-09-08

She has written this graphic autobiography as a testament to her beloved Iran and as a remembrance of those who have suffered, lost their lives, or fled their homeland due to war and oppression. She says that \\"One can forgive but one should never forget.\\"<br /><br />The story opens at Satrapi's birth under the Shah's regime, and follows her life through Iran's revolution, conversion to an Islamic regime, and war with Iraq. A precocious single child of progressive activist parents, she is a witness to the complications and contradictions of Iranian daily life, both private and public. She recalls the first day the girls are forced to wear the veil at school. Through a child's innocent eyes, she describes her fears of the imprisonment, torture, and execution of friends, family, and neighbors, as well as of the bombings, oppression, and harassment that have become part of the fabric of her life. In spite of the turmoil, the author is a typical adolescent who takes risks by obtaining forbidden rock star posters, attending parties, wearing jewelry and jeans, and arguing politics with her teachers. Above all else, she is a spunky and lovable child who looks for freedom wherever she can obtain it and manages to triumph over her restrictive surroundings.<br /><br />The illustrations provide a simple but powerful depiction of the events in the author's life. Many of the drawings have a dream-like quality that accentuates the emotional impact of the joys, sadness, violence, and familial love that Satrapi experiences. This touching story reminds me of Hosseini's \\"The Kite Runner.\\" I recommend both as excellent coming-of-age stories in tumultuous foreign settings.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2004-09-08

This resurrected friend, Levi known as Biff, is imprisoned in a hotel room and forced to tell the story that the other Gospels have ignored. While Biff writes his eyewitness account, Raziel gets hooked on soap operas and talk shows. The story line switches from Biff and Raziel in the hotel room to the Gospel according to Biff. From the time that Biff first meets six-year-old Joshua (as Jesus is called in Hebrew) until the moment when Joshua is crucified, the two friends are inseparable. Biff helps Joshua grapple with his role as the Son of God. The two of them spend sixteen years in the Orient to locate and get guidance from the three wise men. Biff is always there to get them out of scrapes with the Romans and Pharisees, and to help Joshua spread the Word. And, of course, as kids and adolescents the two of them fool around a lot.<br /><br />Except during the emotionally charged Crucifixion chapter, where humor is interspersed only occasionally for comic relief, the story line is a continuous stream of funny dialog and situations. Among the hilarious details are such gems as the heavenly origin of blonde jokes, the invention of cappuccino, the secret to keeping camels regular, what the \\"H\\" actually stands for in \\"Jesus H. Christ,\\" and the real story behind the shroud of Turin. There are quotes from such nonexistent Biblical books as Dalmatians and Amphibians. There are plenty of wisecracks, pratfalls, and silliness. Biff's homespun lyrics to a Wizard of Oz song had me doubled over with laughter. Among the disciples are an imaginary twin and an odiferous Cynic with his own band of canine disciples.<br /><br />Author Christopher Moore states that although he has not intended to challenge anyone's faith, this book might indeed offend or anger some readers. Besides being humorous, irreverent, and satirical, however, the story is also poignant. It shows the human side of Jesus, weaknesses and all, as he ponders his identity as the Messiah, struggles through adolescence, and tries to discern the steps he must take as the savior of mankind. The Biblical setting for the story was meticulously researched, but the author admits that he fabricated the entire part about Christ's lost years. There is no evidence that Jesus was in the Orient or studied Eastern religions. However, Moore feels that the similarity between the teachings of Jesus and those of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Hinduism lead to an interesting conjecture as to the influence of Eastern thought on Jesus. That being said, read this book for its wit, creativity, sidesplitting humor, and touch of humanity, and leave it to the Bible to provide the authorized version of the life of Jesus.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackgnant.

These matches are performed using a powerful artificial intelligence-based computer called Liza. The matches are so accurate and the resulting partnerships so idyllic that not a single client has ever claimed a refund from the money-back guarantee. When two of Eden's \\"perfect match\\" couples are found dead of double-suicide, a former FBI forensic psychologist, Christopher Lash, is brought in to investigate whether Eden has failed to predict a psychological instability when it performed its thorough personality testing of each applicant. Lash finds nothing in the psychological profiles of the four suicides and he suspects foul play. Could this be homicide made to look like suicide, and if so, why?  Could it be a disgruntled former Eden employee? Or could it be a rejected applicant for Eden's services? As Lash is granted complete access to the mysterious workings of Eden, he finds that someone is out to stop him from discovering the perpetrator, and soon Lash finds his reputation and his life in jeopardy.<br /><br />Having read Child's previous novel \\"Utopia,\\" I found a lot of similarities between the two books. Both feature a large and highly successful corporation engineered using next-generation computers and incredibly futuristic technology. Both companies are being undermined, and ultimately threatened, by evildoers. In both cases an outsider is brought in to investigate the problem. Both investigators are drawn into the dangers and must race against the clock to save the lives of innocent people, including themselves. Both stories are fast-paced, suspenseful thrillers. The main difference is that \\"Death Match\\" has several plot twists and turns before the mysterious perpetrator is unmasked, and its ending is not as satisfying as that in \\"Utopia.\\" This novel is still a worthwhile read, whether or not you have read its predecessor.<br /><br />The book's details on psychological testing and profiling are quite interesting, although I cannot judge how accurate they are. The story also made me ponder the nature of attraction that people feel for each other, how its characteristics could be scientifically quantified, and whether there is such a thing as one or more \\"perfect matches\\" for every individual.

By night, he obeys the needs of his \\"Dark Passenger\\" and performs unspeakable acts of murder. What separates Dexter from the ordinary sociopath is that he only dispatches bad guys who have committed horrendous crimes of their own. When he was young, a traumatic event that he cannot recall turned him from a human into an emotionless monster whose only passion is for murder. At the advice of his foster father, a policeman who realized that Dexter had a very dark side, Dexter learned to channel his murderous urges by converting bad deeds to good and eliminating sociopaths.  He appears outwardly normal, but performs his grisly acts in a cautious, well-planned, and neat fashion so that he will not be unmasked.<br /><br />When his foster sister, a Miami policewoman, becomes involved in investigating a series of serial murders that are as bizarre and ritualistic as his own acts, Dexter helps her seek out the perpetrator. Because Dexter and his target seem to think in a similar way, Dexter can predict how he will strike next. He has disturbingly realistic dreams that further lead him on the trail of the killer. But soon, it appears that the killer has found out about Dexter and is sending him gruesome messages. How could anyone know Dexter's secrets?  Or are these acts ones that Dexter's Dark Passenger is suddenly performing on its own?<br /><br />This is not a book for everyone. Written in a first-person narrative, Dexter's thoughts and actions might disturb some readers. On the one hand he is depicted as having a charming and attractive facade that can be intentionally endearing rather than frightening. On the other, he is a cold-blooded killer with no human sentiment. Dexter deftly sums himself up as \\"Quirky, funny, happy-go-lucky, dead-inside Dexter.\\"  I was fascinated by this peek into Dexter's inner life, and I found his personality as refreshingly unique and contradictory as that of Hannibal Lecter.<br /><br />It is the ending of the story that has knocked its rating down from five to four stars. It was far-fetched and a bit corny.

Granny Weatherwax, the town witch who delivered young Esk, knows that the girl must now learn to control the extraordinary powers she has been bequeathed before they start to control her. She takes Esk under her wing and begins to teach her about witchcraft and magic. After Esk has had several years of apprenticeship, Granny decides to enroll Esk in Unseen University, the training ground for wizards. The two of them set off for Ankh-Morpork, the home of the famous wizard school. But everyone in Discworld knows that wizardry is the bastion of men and that a woman can never become a wizard... or can she?<br /><br />In \\"Equal Rites,\\" Terry Pratchett parodies gender stereotyping and discrimination as Esk is confronted with society's view of the differences between witchcraft, a traditionally feminine profession, and wizardry, an exclusively male domain. As Granny sees it, wizardry is high magic composed of science, \\"jommetry\\" and power, while witchcraft is a magic grounded in nature, herbs and \\"headology.\\"  Esk feels she can handle either type of magic and she turns wizardry on its ear as she proceeds to demonstrate what she can accomplish. Before reading this book, I thought that Rincewind was the most bumbling of wizards. I now realize that Unseen University is full of them!<br /><br />This book is not as wickedly funny as the two books that precede it, but it does contain several humorous scenes such as the magic conjuring duel between Granny and the Archchancellor of the university. Although Pratchettisms are sprinkled here and there throughout the book, the story line takes precedence over the satire.  Sometimes the metaphorical descriptions of the landscape and sunlight of Discworld go a bit overboard. As a result I give the book only four stars instead of the five I gave the previous books in the series. I did enjoy the story, however, especially the characterization of strong-minded and wise Granny, who is depicted as a non-stereotypical witch who abhors flying on broomsticks and who looks down upon the traditional fortune telling and parlor tricks favored by so many other witches. I look forward to reading the other Discworld witch books.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackthe series.

It contains lists, charts, graphs, quotations and descriptions of a wide variety of facts from the serious to the silly.<br /><br />Pregnancy is covered in such items as slang terms for pregnancy, in utero development, and anatomy of the placenta.

Child raising tips include diaper folding methods, basic Montessori principles, and milestones in child development. The financial aspects of child rearing are represented in such charts as the economics of diapers, average nanny salaries, and the estimated annual child raising expenses for the first eighteen years. There is useless but fun trivia like lullaby lyrics, the names of Dr. Seuss characters, Barbie doll careers, and lists of child rulers and child stars. My favorite chart is one that diagrams different levels of cousins - so now I know what such relationships as second cousins twice removed really mean.<br /><br />This is not a very practical parental reference book. There is no index and no structured order to the contents. It is more a book of random trivia that make interesting but not particularly essential reading.

The story begins 2 years after her last adventure ended, and she is weary of her time as the head of Jurisfiction. She decides to take a leave of absence from Bookworld and return to Swindon and a job at SpecOps. Accompanying her are her young son Friday and Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark. Thursday's trip out of Jurisfiction leaves her little time for relaxation, however. She tries to get her husband Landon uneradicated. She searches for a Shakespeare clone to save the play \\"Hamlet\\" from a hostile takeover. She must ensure that the Swindon Mallets win the SuperHoop-88 World League Croquet tournament to keep the world from imminent Armageddon, as is prophesied by 13th-century Saint Zvlkx, whose revealments always come true. She must find a way to thwart an anti-Danish book-burning by smuggling books across the border into Wales. Needless to say she must also battle the evil Goliath Corporation, along with the fictional Yorrick Caine, now Chancellor of England, who wants to become world dictator. Then there's the assassin who is repeatedly attempting to do away with Thursday. The reader can never say that Thursday's life is boring!<br /><br />There are many interesting and amusing details in the book, including the finer points of croquet law, a closer look at Neanderthals and Chimeras, the problems inherent with uneradication, the reasons behind Hamlet's dithering, and Friday's use of Lorem Ipsum, a typesetter's dummy language. Many characters from previous books make their appearance here, including the Minotaur, the Cheshire Cat, the Jurisfiction operatives, and Thursday's coworkers from SpecOps. There are plenty of chases, close calls, and time travel paradoxes. There is even a touching scene with Granny Next that might have you wiping away a tear or two. Unlike with the previous books, all the loose ends have been neatly tied up in this one. Author Jasper Fforde himself admits that the interconnectivity of the first four books can be a bit frustrating, but that he plans his future books to be more \\"stand alone.\\"<br /><br />\\"Something Rotten\\" has all the typical Fforde trademarks, including abundant literary references, satire, and silliness. This book did not have quite the impact on me as previous books in the series. Perhaps this is because the uniqueness of Thursday's alternate universe has lost its novelty, or perhaps this is because Fforde is beginning to rehash a few older gags and concepts.

It deals with the relationships between human and robot. As one of Asimov's earliest novels, it introduced the Three Laws of Robotics that have set the standard for the use of robots in science fiction. In fact, Asimov was the acknowledged creator of the term &quot;robotics.&quot;<br /><br /> The stories are tied together via the reminiscences of Dr. Susan Calvin, a robopsychologist for U. S. Robot and Mechanical Men, the corporation that invented and manufactured intelligent robots and computing machines. She reflects upon the evolution of these robots and discusses how little humanity really understands about the artificial intelligence it has created. Each story illuminates a problem encountered when a robot interprets the three fundamental Laws and something goes awry. One robot questions the reason for his existence. Another feels a necessity to lie. Yet another has an ego problem. The later stories introduce the reader to the Machines, powerful computing robots without the typical humanoid personalities of the working robots, that control the economic and industrial processes of the world and that stand between mankind and destruction. These stories introduce some fascinating and sometimes unsettling ideas: where does one draw the fine line between intelligent robot and human? Can man and robot form a balanced relationship? Can a robot's creator reliably predict its behavior based upon its programming? Can logic alone be used to determine what is best for humanity?<br /><br /> &quot;I, Robot&quot; was published in 1950 and includes stories written in the 1940's, when general-purpose electronic digital computers were still in their infancy. I was struck by what a visionary Asimov was. He had captured the mechanics of contemporary software development through these stories about the manufacture of the intelligent robot, whose positronic brain contained complex programming that inevitably had bugs that needed troubleshooting. Anyone who has ever written a computer program or has fallen victim to software bugs will get an eerie feeling of deja vu while reading these stories. Asimov's writing style might not be the most polished in science fiction and his characterizations might be a bit wooden, but the concepts presented here will blow you away. This is required reading for any fan of science fiction.<br /><br /> Eileen Rieback, whose positronic brain contained complex programming that inevitably had bugs that needed troubleshooting.

Arranged in no particular order are facts that will interest every food lover. For example, if you thought a gourmet was at the top of the hierarchy of gastronomy and a gourmand at the bottom, think again. In reality, the gastronome is the supreme connoisseur of food and drink and the goinfre, or greedy-guts, is the basest.<br /><br /> If you are a world traveler, you will appreciate the list of world beers, foreign toasts and ways to say grace, international variants for Coca Cola logos and Domino's pizza toppings (in India you might choose lamb and pickled ginger), how to ask for the bill in over twenty different languages, and a list of the 121 countries and territories where McDonald's has a presence. If you enjoy food preparation, you might benefit from recipes for cocktails or roast swan, a handy chart of food storage times for fridge and freezer, and the boiling point of water at various altitudes. If you have an interest in things medical, you will find descriptions of diseases of the digestive system, facts on odd food cravings, and hangover cures. For the lover of eclectic food facts, there is information on how to blow smoke rings, read tea leaves, and recognize poisonous mushrooms. There are charts on the body mass index, vitamins, and pasta shapes. There are lists of notable vegetarians, diner slang, edible flowers, Jelly Belly flavors, and the Scoville scale for chili pepper hotness.<br /><br /> Also included are Jewish blessings for wine and bread, and the rules of Halal, which is the Islamic dietary law. There are lyrics for the Chiquita banana song and facts on the joys and disadvantages of garlic, durian, fugu, and asparagus. You will learn why kopi luwak is the world's most expensive coffee.

When the monarchy of Afghanistan is overturned and the Soviets take over, Amir and his father flee to America, leaving Hassan behind. But Amir is haunted by guilt because of his callous treatment of his childhood companion. Years later, when an old family friend is dying, Amir is asked to return to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, and he knows that he must use this opportunity to atone for the past, and in doing so, risk his life.<br />The book also touches upon the immigrant experience as Amir's father Baba struggles to adjust to the California lifestyle and to an existence without the luxuries and honorable status he enjoyed in Afghanistan. It highlights the difference in customs and ethnic mindset between Afghanis and Americans. Parts of this novel are humorous and parts are touching. Some sections are painful to read, yet they are a necessary and haunting part of the story.<br />I cannot recommend this wonderful book highly enough. It is one of the best novels I have read so far this year. The writing style is sparse and simple, yet it packs an emotional wallop. I could smell the kabobs sizzling on the grill, see the kites soaring and battling in the crisp winter sky, and feel the despair of the Afghani people over the loss of their old way of life due to war and oppression. The story is almost allegorical in its universal truths of love, friendship, betrayal, and redemption. Not only does it bring to life the turmoil and hardships that Afghanistan has faced, but also it sheds light on the culture and nature of the people behind the news stories.<br />Eileen Riebacketrayal, and redemption.

The book runs the gamut from a library contest entry written when she was eight to articles and lectures about her current life as a writer. These essays are quite personal, honest, and told with humor and amazing insight.<br />Tan reminisces on her childhood and the clash of Chinese fate and Christian faith in her upbringing. She provides many details about her family, especially her relationship with her mother. She also talks about the loss of both her father and brother to brain cancer the same year, as well as the deaths of several close friends. She describes her harrowing experience with Lyme's disease. She talks with amusement about doctoral dissertations and Cliff's Notes that analyze her work. She discusses what it means to be classified as an Asian-American writer, and how it feels to be a literary celebrity. She recounts her experiences in the literary rock band &quot;The Rock Bottom Remainders.&quot;<br />I listened to the audio version of this book, which was read by Amy Tan herself. Since this collection let me peek into the author's triumphs, tragedies, hopes, and fears, it was very effective to hear the essays read in her own voice. After reading this book, you will better understand the elements that make up the author's stories, such as the echoes of her mother's influence in the novels' mother-daughter relationships. I recommend this book for every Amy Tan fan. It may provide enough insight on the real Amy Tan so that you'll want to reread some of her novels.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-07-12

Francis &quot;C-Bird&quot; Petrel is a former patient of a state mental hospital who recounts a series of unsolved murders that occurred at the asylum years ago. The narrative weaves together the present and past as Francis revisits the closed-down asylum for a series of lectures and then grapples with the memories and internal voices of his past. He decides to write down, in pencil on the walls of his apartment, the story of life in the asylum and his role in helping track down the serial killer known simply as &quot;The Angel.&quot; As Francis composes his tale, his madness threatens to resurface and prevent him from completing the story.<br />After being committed to the hospital at the age of 21 following a violent outburst against his family, Francis struggled to adjust to institutional life. He was befriended by Peter the Fireman, a former arson investigator under psychiatric evaluation for setting fire to a church. Fellow inmate Lanky announced that an angel visited him and commanded him to stamp out evil. Lanky was found with the blood of a slain nurse on his clothing and was accused of the murder. Prosecuting attorney Lucy Jones visited the hospital because of similarities between this murder and those against other women that had previously occurred outside the confines of the hospital. She felt that Lanky was wrongly accused and that the murder was the work of a serial killer now hiding out in the asylum. She called upon Francis and Peter to help her track down the killer among the institution inmates.<br />Lucy and her helpers soon discovered that finding a murderer in a mental institution was no easy matter. The usual investigative techniques did not work. How can they find a psychopath among thousands of psychotics and other mentally ill patients? What is considered suspicious behavior in a place where the abnormal is normal and where the illogical is routine? Are they looking for signs of sanity or insanity in a suspect? How can they interview witnesses or suspects without setting off a disruption of the institutional routine that could upset the inmates?<br />Katzenbach provides a powerful portrayal of the despair and hopelessness of asylum life through an array of disillusioned inmates and bureaucratic medical staff. He includes touching portraits of a would-be Napoleon and a would-be Cleopatra who befriend Francis. Through schizophrenics, catatonics, psychotics, and the delusional, he portrays inmates who rely on medications to keep mental demons at bay and who often lose the battle to regain sanity and reentry into the outside world. With echoes of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,&quot; this book is a fascinating, eerie, and suspenseful must-read.<br />Eileen Riebacks normal and where the illogical is routine?

As with every DK guidebook I have ever used, this one is high quality. Within its heavy paper covers are lots of brilliantly colored illustrations and a wealth of information about each of the 331 species of birds known to occur regularly in Florida. It is published in association with the Smithsonian Institution.<br />Information in the full page profile of each species includes clear drawings and photographs with distinguishing features labelled, song, behavior, breeding, nesting and nest identification, flight patterns, location, habitat, and migratory habits. There is also general information on the anatomy and topography of birds, species and gender variations, birdwatching techniques, and tips on ways to identify birds, including physical and flight characteristics.<br />Since the bird profiles are arranged in taxonomic order, you have to page through the book, matching illustrations, in order to locate the profile of the bird you wish to identify. To help speed up identification, use the handy &quot;similar birds&quot; feature. When you find a bird close in appearance to the one you are seeking, this feature lists other species that are similar in order to help you hone in on the one you are looking for. This guidebook is a great resource for everyone from the casual observer to the serious birdwatcher. Happy birding!<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-07-05

Bumbling wizard college dropout Rincewind, along with his tourist companion Twoflower, get a reprieve from their fall through the void of space. In the meanwhile, Discworld is moving steadily towards collision with an ominous red star that threatens the existence of life, the universe, and everything. Only the eight great magic spells can save the world, and since one of those spells is lodged in Rincewind's mind, he reluctantly must play an important role in the race to save Discworld.<br />Even funnier than the first in the series, this book introduces Cohen the barbarian, a geriatric anti-Rambo hero who is far fiercer than he looks. The reader is treated to the Keystone Kops antics of the senior wizards as they try to track down Rincewind and save the universe. There is a hilarious scene where Twoflower teaches Death how to play bridge. The story is full of gnomes, dwarves, trolls, and talking trees, as well as a gingerbread cottage. The reader is enlightened on the power of persuasion and the danger of flowery metaphors, and even gets a peek into the mind of the great turtle A'Tuin to learn its current destination.<br />Slapstick, parody, biting satire, word play, and philosophy are all here to enjoy. The plot is neatly tied up at the end, so at this point you can move forward to another book in the wizardry series, or switch to one of the other Discworld tracks. But in either case, there is much more to explore in the wacky and magical world of Terry Pratchett.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-06-30

Jennifer spends the rest of the summer at Sam's home on the lake, reliving her memories of time she spent at the lake as a child and waiting for Sam to awaken from her coma. She discovers a bundle of letters that her grandmother wrote to her which uncover secrets about Sam's unhappy marriage and a mysterious lover simply called &quot;Doc.&quot; She renews the acquaintance of an old friend, Brendan, and falls in love with him.<br />Similar in tone to Patterson's &quot;Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas,&quot; this short novel tells two entwined stories: that of Sam through her letters to Jennifer and that of Jennifer herself as she deals with her grandmother's illness and lets love back into her life. This is a tale of love, loss, and making the most of the precious time we have on earth. Both sentimental and suspenseful, this is a quick and enjoyable read.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-06-28

Within each crossword puzzle are a half-dozen or more clues whose answers, when placed in the correct order, yield a rhyming couplet that is a crostic clue. Place the answer to that clue in the numbered cryptic line and transfer its letters to the crostic grid, as you would when solving a standard crostic puzzle, to create a quotation relevant to puzzle solving.<br />The crossword puzzles are of medium difficulty, but it is the crostic tie-in that makes it more challenging. It also means you must solve all 49 crosswords before you can solve the crostic. A word of caution about the answer pages: since the quotation is placed on the same page as the couplet clues, if you have to look up a couplet clue, be careful that your eyes do not stray to the quotation!<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-06-20

The story is centered around the Buendia family and its progeny. Town founder and patriarch Jose Arcadio brings progress to Macondo as he pursues his search for alchemy and science. Ursula, the long-lived matriarch, tries to keep the family together through their problems and conflicts. Son Colonel Aureliano Buendia fights in over thirty civil wars before realizing the futility of waging war.  Son Jose Arcadio pursues a Gypsy woman, travels around the world, and returns a tattooed giant. Macondo has a very turbulent history. It is torn apart by war. It expands as the railroads bring foreigners, businesses, and technology that irrevocably change its course.  It suffers severe floods and droughts. It is decimated by a bloody labor battle.<br />Nobel prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez was inspired to write this novel by the tales told to him by his grandmother in Colombia. His grandmother filled her stories with a mixture of fantastic and truthful elements and told them with a serious and natural demeanor. In a similar fashion, the author tells his story using magical realism, where mythical details are intermingled in a very offhand manner with a realistic story line. Among the mundane events of town life Garcia Marquez casually scatters such magical elements as a Gypsy who is bored with death and returns to life, a man followed by swarms of butterflies, levitating people, and a contagious plague of insomnia.<br />If there was anything about the story that I found a bit difficult to follow, it was the fact that most of the characters shared the same names. Every generation of Buendias had its Jose Arcadios, Aurelianos, and Remedios. During his military campaigns, Colonel Aureliano fathered many children by women all over the country. Seventeen of them were adopted into the family and given the name Aureliano. Fortunately, there is a family tree at the front of the book that will help the reader keep track of the generations of Buendias.<br />This novel is beautifully written. The language in this English translation is rich, lyrical, and poetic. The story is full of humor, irony, and tragedy. It contains such universal themes as nostalgia and regret, strength and madness, passion and revenge. Never has a family had more long-lived and colorful characters than those in the Buendia family. Solitude is an omnipresent theme in the story, since many of the Buendias secluded themselves in their rooms or homes for years on end because of broken dreams, broken hearts, and pursuit of the impossible. I recommend this book highly.

Life is not easy for the Mortmains. Most of the family's possessions and furnishings have been sold off, they do without electricity, and there is barely enough to eat. In spite of all this, the family keeps a cheerful outlook and manages to get by, thanks in part to the generosity of the wealthy American Cotton family who has inherited the estate upon which the castle sits and who have taken the Mortmains under their wing.<br />The Mortmains are an offbeat family. Cassandra has flights of fancy and unusual schemes that often have unexpected results. Father, an eccentric and innovative writer, is suffering from severe writer's block and can no longer support the family. He spends his time holed up in the gatehouse reading novels. Stepmother Topaz is a flighty artist's model who enjoys roaming the estate in the buff. Cassandra's older sister Rose is tired of living hand-to-mouth, and she decides to find a way to marry the landlord's wealthy grandson. Handsome Stephen, a hired hand who stays on with the family even though the Mortmains cannot afford to pay him, has difficulty hiding his unrequited love for Cassandra.<br />First published in 1948 and set in the 1930s, the story has an old-fashioned feel to it, especially on the subject of courtship and marriage. It also highlights the cultural differences at that time between the Americans and the British. Possessing a wisdom and maturity beyond her years, Cassandra spends much time analyzing the people and events that surround her and then recording her observations. &quot;Contemplation,&quot; she says, &quot;seems to be about the only luxury that costs nothing.&quot; Through her journals, Cassandra's voice is sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and always endearing as she describes her concerns, her hopes, and her first love. &quot;I capture the Castle&quot; is recommended for both young adults and adults as a warm coming-of-age story.<br />Eileen Riebackended for both young adults and adults as a warm coming-of-age story.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-06-08

They work as a team along with Dino Bacchetti of the NYPD to track down and arrest a mob hit man. Things get complicated because the killer also happens to be helping the FBI on an Arab terrorist entrapment, is in the Witness Protection Program, and is under protection of the Mafia. Soon Stone and Holly are in danger, but it is unclear if the FBI, the mob, or the terrorists are after them... perhaps it is all three. There are additional side plots involving the FBI, the CIA, and a thickheaded photographer that caused Stone problems in an earlier novel.<br />Not only are Stone and Holly together in this story, with the requisite romance on the side, but almost every other major character from Wood's previous books (with the glaring exception of Stone's old flame Arrington) is either part of the action or peripheral to it. It seems like Woods is running out of ideas and is delving into his previous books for material. As a result of the reintroduction of so many previous characters and cases, there are a lot of brief recaps of old story lines, and this distracts the reader from the current plot.<br />This latest novel is not one of the author's better ones. First, it appears to be a patchwork production into which Woods only put a mediocre effort. Second, some of the plot details are so unbelievable and the reasoning so naive that they are laughable.  But in many ways, it is typical Woods: lots of glib and comical dialog, five-page chapters, meals at Elaine's, romps in the bedroom, chases, narrow escapes, and fast-paced action.  I don't recommend this for readers new to Stuart Woods because of all the references to past adventures, but for the knowledgeable Barrington/Barker fan, this is an entertaining and light, though mildly lacking, read.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-06-07

I am very glad I did. This turned out to be a very different kind of fantasy, in spite of its wizards, trolls, and dragons. Discworld is a flat planet resting on the backs of four elephants riding on the back of a turtle that slowly makes its way across the universe. As strange and steeped in magic as Discworld is, it seems suspiciously like our own world. Its inhabitants have some very familiar vices and pastimes. Author Terry Pratchett is a wonderful cross between Douglas Adams, Piers Anthony, and Mark Twain, and his Discworld novels are full of great fun, inventiveness, and wicked satire.<br />&quot;The Color of Magic&quot; is the first story in the series. This paperback edition comes with an appendix that makes a handy travel guide for first-time tourists of Terry Pratchett's amazing fantasy land. It includes a brief musing on Discworld, a synopsis of the main cast of characters in the series, a nonmap (after all, how can a sense of humor be mapped?), a guide to Discworld on thirty dollars a day, and even a crossword puzzle to quiz you on what you have learned on your maiden voyage.<br />The bumbling wizard Rincewind, a wizard college dropout and the quintessential coward, is appointed as guide and protector for the four-eyed tourist Twoflower, who hails from a gold-rich city on the Counterweight Continent and who has come to the bustling metropolis of Ankh-Morpork to see the sights. As the story opens, Ankh-Morpork is in the process of burning to the ground, and Rincewind and Twoflower are fleeing to safety. Accompanied by a frightening piece of many-legged luggage, the twosome experiences one misadventure after another. They are threatened by thieves and magic spells, made pawns in a dice game of the gods, dogged by Death, chased by dragons around the upside-down mountain of Wyrmberg, and shipwrecked at the edge of Discworld.

The coyotes huddle frightened on her porch. She feels a disturbing presence moving past in the sky. When her husband Neil awakens with nightmares, the two of them watch news broadcasts about bizarre supernatural occurrences, shocking violence, and public panic that arise around the globe. It starts to look as if an alien invasion has begun. Then the power goes out. Molly and Neil join up with some of their neighbors, trying to identify what is happening and how to deal with the increasingly evil and omnipotent entity that appears to be taking over the planet. The townspeople splinter into factions, each with its own opinion on how to handle the crisis.<br />The story starts off with powerful mood-building imagery and with echoes of Koontz's &quot;Strangers&quot; and Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot; and &quot;The Mist.&quot; Koontz then cranks up the suspense and horror as alien vegetation begins to invade the town, the residents are dispatched in gruesome and mysterious ways, and the dead come to life. Now the story segues into a Twilight Zone screenplay, as the supernatural and otherworldly occurrences increase. By the halfway point, Molly and Neil are now on a crusade to save the children at any cost, even though they wonder how anyone, adult or child, could survive this hellish new world order. When there are only 50 pages left to go in the story, I am wondering how Koontz could ever resolve the plot instead of leaving the reader hanging until a sequel. Then comes a disappointing ending that plays strongly on Koontz's increasing trend to use religion and hope in his books. Dogs feature prominently in this story, as they do in many of Koontz's books. However, the author's trademark sense of humor is conspicuously absent here.<br />To be fair, I give the first half of the book a five star rating for an excellent portrayal of a horrific and inexplicable entity gaining absolute control over the earth. I give the middle a three star rating as Molly assumes absurdly heroic proportions in the midst of Armageddon. The ending deserves one star as a cop-out and a disappointment. So how can I sum the book up? If you are a Koontz fan like me, you will want to read the book. The first half is a powerhouse of creepiness and it has a story line build-up that showcases the best of Koontz's storytelling abilities. But the second half will likely let you down, unless your favorite theme in Koontz's books is the transcendence of horror by uplifting spirituality.<br />Eileen Riebackfic and inexplicable entity gaining absolute control over the earth.

Through gene therapy, many diseases have been cured. The SimGen Corporation has now created a transgenic species called sims, part chimpanzee and part human, that are used as slave labor. Suddenly a group of sims working as caddies at a golf club want to unionize. They hire lawyer Patrick Sullivan to represent them, and he begins to ponder whether sims are entitled to human rights. He soon meets activist Romy Cadman and a mysterious masked man, simply called Zero, who are on a crusade to destroy SimGen and stop the creation of sims. While the three of them try to protect the sims, they come close to uncovering a sinister secret in SimGen, and the company will stop at nothing to deter them.<br />The reader is treated to a fascinating peek into a possible future for genetics research.  This hypothetical forecast is not so far-fetched, however scary and unethical it might be. Transgenic animals, in which human genetic material is inserted into animal DNA, are already being created today for the benefit of humanity. Transgenic cows have been developed, and they have human proteins in their milk, such as insulin, that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry to treat human disease. Pigs with human DNA are being developed with the goal of future use in organ transplants. This novel carries genetic experimentation forward to a next logical step: transgenic primates. Where would such creatures stand in society? Would they be considered people or animals?<br />&quot;Sims&quot;  was originally written as a series of novellas, but the story holds together seamlessly as a novel. Although very different from F. Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack novels, it is an excellent science thriller. At times the story line is a bit formulaic, a la Robin Cook, with an evil corporation twisting medical procedures for its own unspeakable ends and ruthlessly destroying those who stand in its path.

As a lion, he is hopelessly in love with the gazelle Ljuba, which is an impossible relationship. As a finch, he must protect Ljuba's eggs from the cuckoos.<br />This book is not only funny, satirical, witty, and surprising, it is also informative. Alessandro Boffa is a biologist, and through these imaginative tales you will learn interesting tidbits about the physiology and behavior of animal species. And one more thing: you will gain insight into the vagaries of the human condition as well. Highly recommended for a quick and fanciful read.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-05-19

He loves to fly his private plane around the local area. Everything in his personal life is falling apart. His son has driven the business to the brink of bankruptcy and is over his head in debt thanks to his extravagant lifestyle. His daughter has just been diagnosed with cancer but refuses to follow her doctor's advice to terminate her pregnancy and undergo chemotherapy. His girlfriend has left him for another man. His father is unhappy and restless in a nursing home. Jerry feels powerless to help his family and frustrated that they are not confiding in him, yet he is continually accused of distancing himself from them. In fact, he seems to feel closer to strangers than to his own family. As his problems come to a head, Jerry finally realizes that he must come to terms with those things most important to him and take control of the course of his life.<br />Although Jerry is in the air only twice during the story, the metaphor of flight permeates the narrative. Jerry enjoys flying solo in order to escape &quot;the Real&quot; and its problems and to put his life in perspective. While aloft, things seem perfect to him; the disorder in his life disappears. He not only distances himself physically from others, but emotionally as well. In a lyrical yet realistic voice, Jerry pilots the reader through the turbulence in his life. He touches upon the death of his wife Daisy, who had psychological problems that he could not understand or deal with. He describes his rocky relationships with Rita, his live-in girlfriend who helped raise his children, and co-worker Kelly, a southern belle. Both women are eventually fed up with Jerry's aloofness and they take flight.  He describes his dealings with his gruff Italian working-class father, who has always had two feet solidly on the ground.<br />Whether you like Jerry as a protagonist or not, you will recognize many universal themes in his narrative: multicultural relationships, family tradition, love and responsibility, and fears of illness, aging, and death. Every character is crafted with incredible detail that brings them to life. The family dynamics are well drawn. The plot is full of humor, irony, and many emotional ups and downs.

These 50 recipes, each of which is enhanced with ingredients out of cans, include beef, chicken, fish, pizza, pork, Spam, turkey, and veggies. Among the recipes are beer-can chicken, red-hot ribs, Dr Pepper-glazed ham, teriyaki turkey, and spuds on a stick.<br />The main ingredients and the finished product are illustrated with photographs. The book includes nutritional information, tips on the art of grilling, and a generous dollop of humor. Some of these recipes might be a little tricky for the novice cook to prepare, considering the unpredictability of a grill's flames and heat level, but there are still plenty of foolproof meals here beyond basic burgers and chicken that are great for feeding (and impressing) guests.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-05-16

Ted Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss, was far more than an author and illustrator of children's books and movies. His career includes humorist, journalist, advertising genius, magazine and political cartoonist, creator of wartime training and propaganda films, president of a publishing company, and spokesman for children's education.<br />Author Charles Cohen, a dentist and avid collector of Seussiana, is well qualified to write this visual biography of Ted Geisel. Through lavish illustrations, many from his own collection, Cohen shows the many facets of Geisel's art and imagination. The reader is treated to Geisel's earliest works from long before his first published children's book. These include examples of his college newspaper cartoons and his many successful advertising campaigns that blended humor and salesmanship. These creations are juxtaposed with his later children's books to provide the reader a deeper understanding of how culture and history shaped the evolution of his ideas and whimsical bestiary, and to point out the same themes cropping up over and over again in his works.<br />Although this book provides a fascinating view into many unusual perspectives of Dr. Seuss the artist and innovator, there is little here about Ted Geisel the man. In the introduction, Cohen says that he neither met Geisel nor interviewed anyone who knew him. Instead he delved into Geisel's works to discover what made him tick. As a result, there are many facts missing about Geisel's personal life and friendships. The few personal facts that were thrown in, mostly towards the end of the book, came from out of nowhere and made me crave more details. It is for this reason, especially since this book is called a &quot;visual biography,&quot; that I rated it four stars instead of five. It is more a visual exploration of Geisel's works than a biography. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book. It will open your eyes to a creatively obsessed man that you never realized existed. It will also rekindle your fond memories of the Dr. Seuss books you read as a child. Perhaps it will even shed a bit of light on why you loved those books so much.<br />Eileen Riebacksual exploration of Geisel's works than a biography. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book.

This time he travels out of New York to the edge of the Everglades in Southern Florida, where his father is hovering near death following a hit and run accident. Jack moves into the Gateways, his father's retirement community, for the duration of his visit. After talking to residents and employees at the Gateways, having a few unpleasant encounters with a band of mutants living in the Everglades, and uncovering a series of suspicious deaths of the community's elderly residents, he fears that his father's accident was deliberate. He soon decides that things need repairing there too. It appears that the Otherness is back, and Jack has been drawn here to confront the ultimate evil once again.<br />This novel is full of interesting characters. First there's the mutant clan leader Semelee who has special gifts that she is certain set her apart as a Chosen One, and who targets an unwitting Jack as her soul mate. Then there's Anya, an eccentric Gateways resident who watches over Jack and his father and whose green lawn in the midst of drought indicates that she may be more than she seems. Wilson delves into Jack's past and treats the reader to more on the mysterious man's background. And finally, there are some surprising discoveries about Jack's father that indicate that Jack didn't fall that far from the family tree. Now that Jack and his father have come to know each other better, they have a reconciliation that adds depth to the story.<br />The Everglades, in a mingling of the natural and the supernatural, provides an exotic and colorful backdrop for this tale. Otherworldly lights appear semiannually from a sinkhole deep within its wilderness. It harbors fantastic creatures both real and surreal. The Otherness is exerting its influence on both man and beast there. There is information about its natural wonders here too. Even though I am a South Florida resident living in a city bordering the Everglades, I learned some fascinating new facts about its ecology.

Kelly was born in 1855 in a remote section of the Australian colony of Victoria and raised in a life of hardship. His bootlegger mother apprenticed him at an early age to the bushranger Harry Power, where Kelly learned the skills that served him well when hiding from the law later on. He wound up in and out of prison and soon became the most wanted man in the area. At the age of 26, he was captured and executed.<br />Through the fictionalized account of Kelly and his family, Carey has done a masterful job of showing the oppression of the poor by the English and their persecution by the police. Like an Australian Robin Hood, Kelly decried the ill treatment of the poor and came to their defense; he desperately wanted his voice to be heard. Now Carey has let us hear it. He portrays Kelly as a sympathetic character who has the best of intentions even though he becomes embroiled in a life of crime and violence. Because of Kelly's portrayal in a heroic light, this novel is somewhat controversial in Australia, where some people are embarrassed to have Kelly represent their nation. Talking about Australia's origins, Carey said in an interview &quot;Your ship was the Mayflower. Ours were the convict ships, and each ship determined the nation's character.&quot; Controversy or not, Kelly's legend lives on and is skillfully brought to life in this book.<br />The novel is constructed as a series of personal accounts by Kelly addressed to his daughter. The contents and condition of each manuscript is provided as a preface to each chapter, and it makes this story seem very realistic; so much so that I had difficulty distinguishing what was fact and what was fiction. The rich narrative is full of folklore  and local history. There are many humorous passages, such as where men ride around disguised in women's dresses. Using as an example an actual 56-page treatise written by Kelly, Carey has captured the authentic voice of the folk hero. As a result, the story is moderately difficult to read because of misspellings, lack of punctuation, and use of colloquialisms of that era. But the reader will soon become accustomed to the cadence of the language and will be rewarded with a colorful tale that captures the soul of a country and its national legend.<br />Eileen Riebackch as where men ride around disguised in women's dresses.

Her parents then have a baby, Anna, who is genetically selected to be a close donor match for Kate. From her birth onward into her early teens, Anna is called upon to undergo increasingly invasive and dangerous procedures to provide blood, bone marrow, and other tissues to sustain her older sister's life. Now, a kidney is needed, and Anna brings a lawsuit against her parents, claiming the right to her make own decision about what medical procedures can be performed on her. Anna's mother Sara, an attorney, decides to represent her own daughter Kate at the trial.<br />There are some very difficult questions raised in this story. Does Anna have the obligation to risk her own health to save her sister?  Do her parents have the right to make the medical decisions about Anna's donor role, and where should their loyalties lie? Where is the fine line between what is legal and what is ethical in a situation like this? There seem to be no right or wrong answers here, and the ensuing trial recounts all the physical, moral, psychological, and familial struggles that are brought to bear on the issue. Picoult paints a powerfully emotional picture of a family in turmoil. She adds additional tension to the story through brother Jesse, whose drug taking and criminal tendencies add even more burdens to an already overwrought situation. The story also includes the love/hate relationship between Anna's lawyer and her legal guardian.<br />The narrative switches from character to character so that the reader hears the voices of each family member, as well as that of Anna's lawyer and of the legal guardian appointed to watch out for her interests. Sara's narrative includes flashbacks on the history of Kate's illness, Anna's role in providing medical support, and the toll that the constant threat of Kate's death takes on the family. There are several shocking twists to the plot that make the story even more riveting. This is Picoult's best book yet!<br />Eileen Riebacktakes on the family.

How, then, could author Patricia Schulz select 1,000 places from all the wonders the world has to offer? Her criterion was to select places that have inspired adventurers, writers, and artists, as well as curious travelers. She admits that traveling is a personal experience and that this is her own short list of dream trips. Since her choice was subjective, she may well have neglected your favorite vacation spot or dream destination. Even if that is the case, you will still marvel at the breadth of her selections. Don't expect glossy color photos, though. The included pictures are small black and white photos.<br />The book includes far more than just cities and countries. It mentions excursions like a cruise on the QE2, a trip on the Eastern and Oriental Express from Singapore to Bangkok, and a trip on the Moscow Underground. It suggests events like the Winter Alpine Balloon Festival in Vaud Switzerland and Mardi Gras in New Orleans. It lists geographical areas as diverse as London, the North Pole, and Bora Bora. It describes sites as varied as the Mayan city of Tikal, Museum Mile in New York City, and the Taj Mahal. It recommends places to eat as diverse as gourmet restaurants, the street food of Singapore, and Chicago's Superdawg hot dog stand. It suggests places to stay that are destinations in themselves, such as the Singita safari lodge in South Africa and the Rawlins Plantation in St. Kitts, Lesser Antilles. It includes experiences like bungee jumping from the Kawarau Bridge in New Zealand, playing golf in Scotland, and attending the opera at La Scala in Milan. There is a useful set of special indices to help you find active adventures, festivals, spiritual sites, museums, natural wonders, culinary experiences, resorts, beaches, museums, and sacred places around the world.<br />This is not really a Fodor's-type travel guide. Although it lists some places to stay and dine, it should be regarded as a source of ideas and suggestions. You should consult more detailed travel guides when planning your trip. Even if you don't have the time or resources to experience some of these destinations, it's a great way to armchair travel to some spectacular places off the beaten track.

As a hyperactive and precocious child of four, she was put to work in her father's pharmacy under &quot;doctor's orders.&quot; Her unconventional upbringing by older, free-thinking parents, who gave her a lot of leeway to think for herself and take responsibility for her actions, contrasted sharply with her stringent Catholic school education. Gildiner deftly uses her psychology training to show how young Cathy perceived herself and others, and how she struggled to peel through the layers of social and religious convention to see small-town Lewiston as it really was.<br />The author does an excellent job of painting portraits of the people that influenced her life. These include her mother, a very atypical 50s housewife who never cooked or kept house, her hard working civic-minded father, and Roy, the black pharmacy deliveryman who took Cathy on his rounds. Through her prescription deliveries, Cathy met Warty, a disfigured outcast who worked at the garbage dump, Mad Bear, the chief of the Tuscarora Indian tribe, and Marie, a retired prostitute/abortionist. Cathy bumped heads with an assortment of classmates, nuns, and priests at school and church.<br />This is a wonderful coming of age story that is poignant and thought-provoking. There were many humorous touches as Cathy described the world through an innocent child's eyes. There was also a dark side to this memoir as she puzzled over the disturbing and often contradictory elements of society that were often kept under wraps during that era. Having grown up in western New York in the 50s, I recognized many of the details of Cathy's childhood, such as beef on weck, early TV programming with its frequent test patterns, the use of fluoroscopes in shoe stores, and the severe lake effect snow storms in the area.

Larry King asked that question of over 300 celebrities, and the result is &quot;Remember Me When I'm Gone,&quot; a fascinating compendium of epitaphs and obituaries penned by the still living about themselves. The celebrities include actors, authors, business people, journalists, artists, musicians, politicians, and scientists. The contributions run the gamut:  funny, spiritual, laudatory, biographical, comforting, witty, and philosphical. Appropriately enough, there are some song lyrics from songwriters, cartoons from cartoonists, comic epitaphs from comedians, and poetry from writers. Fred Rogers composed his contribution before his death, when he knew he was seriously ill. Larry King provided his own epitaph as well. It was tough for me to select a few examples from so many interesting contributions, but here goes:<br />Joanna Barnes:  At Last - A Parking Space!<br />Arnold Schwarzenegger:  I had fun.<br />Ted Turner: I have nothing more to say.<br />Beverly Sills: The best is yet to come.<br />Robin Leach: Hi, this is Robin Leach standing outside the pearly gates!<br />Jim Davis: I would like to be remembered as someone who was extremely old.<br />Dr. Laura Schlessinger: How arrogant to write your own epitaph.<br />This book displays a lot of wit and wisdom on a sobering topic, and I recommend it as an entertaining and enlightening read.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-04-17

But this one is different, since it reflects his own experience as a first-time expectant grandfather and is dedicated to his first grandchild Ella. As Grandpa awaits the birth of his grandchild, he dreams of all the things they will share. He envisions them going to the beach, the zoo, a ball game, and the movies. He imparts his wisdom about telling the truth and tying shoes. Together they fly kites, go out to eat, and go fishing.  The rhymed verse is phrased in an awkward meter, but nevertheless it reverberates with love, tenderness, and a sense of humor. The soft illustrations depict the imagined activities between grandfather and grandchild, where the child is portrayed at different ages and genders.<br />Is this a story for an adult or a child? I think the expectant parent or grandparent will appreciate the sentiments more than a young child, since it is written from an adult's point of view and since it has no chronological story line for the child to follow. When shared between a grandparent and grandchild, however, it is certain to impress the child with just how special he/she is in a grandparent's eyes.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-04-17

However, it was a bit too sentimental for my tastes and was not as good as the author's previous book. Charlie St. Cloud has a near death experience after getting involved in a car collision that kills his younger brother Sam. After this experience, he can see the deceased while their earthbound spirits have yet to pass into the next plane of the afterlife. The years pass, and Charlie meets with Sam's spirit every evening at sundown, honoring a promise to stick by his brother forever. They spend their time together playing ball and hanging out in the cemetary where Charlie works. Then Tess enters Charlie's life after she narrowly escapes a watery end at sea when her sailing ship founders during a storm. Charlie is now torn between loyalty to Sam and his love for Tess.<br />The story is populated with a series of interesting and endearing characters, but the relationship between Charlie and Sam is idealized to the point of incredulity. There are some well written passages that make the reader feel the sea spray in their face and see the beauty of sunset over a harbor town. The description of the afterlife is a comforting one, and the concept of love transcending the boundaries of life and death is inspirational. This is a ghost story and an emotional love story, but taken together it is too unbelievable to fully work for me. It is suspenseful, but the author's manipulation of the story line to keep the reader guessing is transparently deliberate. The plot reminds me of a cross between the movies &quot;Field of Dreams,&quot; &quot;Ghost,&quot; and &quot;Sixth Sense,&quot; but not as well executed.  If you enjoy heartrending love stories and books like &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; you will probably enjoy this book.

The results of his tireless research are now brought together for your amusement and indigestion in &quot;The Gallery of Regrettable Food.&quot;<br />Through photos and witty commentary, Lileks displays some of the most unappealing foods and recipes I have ever seen, and he does it with flair.  Whether using the recipe names from the original cookbooks, with such labels as &quot;pepper pups&quot; and &quot;liver spoon cakes,&quot; or providing his own descriptive phrases like &quot;cross section of the Swamp Thing's brain&quot; or &quot;grubworms and lawnmower clippings,&quot; he kept me laughing.  He presents a parade of incompatible foods thrown together into gastronomic horrors, such as peppers baked and stuffed with creamy marshmallow sauce, frankfurters in aspic, or tongue mousse. The photos illustrate a parade of dishes that are unidentifiable at best and nauseating at worst. There are pictures of gray, fat-shrouded mystery meats, objects drowned in cream sauce, and gelatin molds with bizarre foods suspended within. The pamphlets produced by food companies urge us to cook everything using their products, whether 7UP or ketchup - and I mean everything! I could go on and on about the gems here, but I don't want to spoil your appetite for dinner.<br />This book also provides a look at the days when advertisers depicted homemakers in dresses, pearls, and frilly aprons when serving meals to the family. This was the era when cholesterol and sodium were not yet flagged as health hazards, and where salmon usually came out of a can.  It was a time when families at the dinner table were idealized and stereotyped to the extreme. Through a recipe booklet produced by Spry shortening and its spokesperson Aunt Jenny, we learn that a new bride's biggest worry is whether her biscuits are up to snuff or not. We learn that cooking man-pleasing meals is of the utmost importance to the homemaker. The only cooking a man does in this world is when he dons the barbecue apron and grills a steak.

It is loosely based on the life of Mabel Stark, the greatest female circus tiger tamer in history. Since little is known about Mabel's actual personal life, author Robert Hough uses his imagination to paint a vivid portrait of a spunky woman, plagued with self doubt and self-destructive tendencies, who has more problems handling men than she does her beloved tigers.<br />Mabel was orphaned early in life, married young, and was committed to a mental institution when she would not perform her wifely duties. She escaped the institution and joined the circus. She suffered through five unusual marriages and many a serious mauling  by her animals. This story is told in flashbacks by the 80-year-old Mabel as she looks back on her life and confesses her guilt over the tragic things she feels responsible for.  Be forewarned that Mabel has some quirky sexual escapades with both men and tigers in this story.<br />This well-researched tale immerses you in circus life in its heyday, when animal acts were much more dangerous and scams much more blatant than in today's circus. You meet carnies, grifters, freaks, cooch dancers, and star performers. You travel circus trains across the country, watch the big top being erected, and then sit under it and watch the show. You learn about the temperament of the big cats and how they are trained. You meet circus owners John and Charles Ringling, as well as Clyde Beatty, and Al G. Barnes. I recommend this book for its realistic circus ambiance. I also enjoyed the interesting  voice of Mabel herself, sometimes happy, often sorrowful, always uncertain, as she unburdened her soul. Read the book now, then see the upcoming movie starring Kate Winslet as Mabel.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-04-08

Although it is intended for readers who can find humor in someone's demise, the stories within are for the most part pitiful rather than funny. How many stories can one read about people whose lack of common sense causes them to be electrocuted, drowned, shot, or crushed? Is riding a scooter at night in dark clothing without a helmet and subsequently being hit by a passing pickup funny?  Or dying of shrapnel wounds while juggling a live hand grenade? Or drowning in a bathtub by slipping on a bar of soap while practicing walking on water? Yes, these are typical examples of the awards, which honor impressively idiotic deaths, perhaps, but not really humorous ones.<br />It also appears that the supply of anecdotes on failing Life 101 is running low, since the book has little substance. Perhaps the original concept from the web site has played itself out. Of the over 100 stories, less than half of them are confirmed Darwin Award winners. The rest are unconfirmed Darwins, honorable mentions (where the award recipients are still swimming in the gene pool), urban legends, unconfirmed personal accounts, disqualified awards, and a series of &quot;classic&quot; winners from past years. As if that is not enough padding, the book also contains discussions on evolution, safety, biodiversity, and other unrelated topics. Sprinkled throughout are dozens of inane sayings such as &quot;I don't think, therefore I am not&quot; and &quot;Another sap from the tree of life.&quot; And finally, there is an appendix containing Internet etiquette.<br />I suggest you save your money and go to the author's web site instead. The best of the awards listed in this book are there, along with many others. If you want to read about some really funny prizes, read &quot;Ig Nobel Prizes&quot; instead.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-04-05

In &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; she provides a fictionalized account of the creation of a series of famous medieval tapestries which currently are on display in a museum in Paris. Although the origin of the tapestries is unknown, including who commissioned them, when they were created, or who crafted them, the author does an excellent job of weaving together whatever facts are known, along with some supposition and a generous thread of imagination, to create an entertaining tale.<br />Artist Nicolas des Innocents, a womanizer who usually paints miniatures and coats of arms, is commissioned by the nobleman Jean Le Viste to design some tapestries to glorify the family's status at Court. He is originally asked to create a battle scene, but the design evolves into the story of a lady seducing a unicorn. Although Nicolas is the protagonist around whom the action pivots, the first-person narrative continually shifts between Nicolas, the Le Viste family, and the family of the weaver that produces the tapestries.  Because of the profusion of characters and subplots, this novel is not as focused as &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; but it is still fascinating.<br />The story contains many facts about how tapestries were made. Beneath the book's paper jacket, one of the actual tapestries is displayed across the front and back cover. I found myself continually peering under the jacket to study its details as I read about the use of color, weaving techniques, plants and animals, and symbolism. The story also provides an interesting description of life in late 15th century Paris and Brussels, including class distinctions and role of women in medieval society. I recommend it for both art lovers and fans of historical fiction.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-03-29

So it would stand to reason that he had seen it all in the realm of espionage. Yet, in the  acknowledgements at the end of the book, he states that his research on his other novels  &quot;has taken me around the world and into places like KGB headquarters in Moscow, but nothing prepared me for how strange and fascinating I'd find the world of the American high-tech corporation.&quot; In Paranoia, he combines high-tech business with corporate security and espionage to create an exciting thriller that the reader will not soon forget.<br />Adam Cassidy is the quintessential slacker who is tired of his job at Wyatt Telecom. He  diverts corporate funds to throw a large retirement party for a loading dock employee, and he fully expects to be fired for it. But instead he is threatened with criminal charges if he does not agree to steal highly confidential product plans from Trion, a rival of Wyatt. With the help of the Wyatt's CEO, security chief, and executive coach, he is groomed for an executive job at Trion. He is taught to breach the tightest corporate security and turn over his findings. Thus begins his life as a corporate spy, where the game he is playing becomes more and more treacherous, his loyalties to his friends and employers are stretched to the limit, and he is caught in a web of deceit from which there seems to be no exit.<br />The characters are well drawn and believable. Finder expertly depicts Adam's struggle with his conscience, his problems with his ailing father and best friend, his worries about being unmasked as a spy, and his fondness for his Trion CEO. This makes him a very sympathetic protagonist. The two corporate presidents are strongly contrasted: the Wyatt CEO is ruthless, aloof, and vain; the Trion CEO is paternal, benevolent, and demands honesty. Also included in the interesting cast of characters are a quirky staff engineer, some power-hungry middle managers, a jealous and competitive coworker, and a shady security chief with a penchant for violence.<br />The suspense kept me on the edge of my seat, and the final plot twist was a powerhouse. Not only is this a fast-paced thriller, but it provides fascinating facts about espionage and corporate security. Each section defines an espionage term, which is then exemplified in the story line. I was shocked to learn about how lax corporate security can be, permitting access to password-protected PCs and locked offices and file cabinets. Even badge readers and biometric scanners can be circumvented. This is definitely worth reading, but be sure to schedule it for when you have some spare time, because once you start it you will have trouble putting it down.<br />Eileen Riebacko included in the interesting cast of characters are a quirky staff engineer, some power-hungry middle managers, a jealous and competitive coworker, and a shady security chief with a penchant for violence.<br />The suspense kept me on the edge of my seat, and the final plot twist was a powerhouse.

She takes up residence in a poorly written detective novel and gets an in-depth look at the operations of the Well, where all books are created and maintained. She also becomes an apprentice in the Jurisfiction Department. But its agents are being exterminated one by one, and Thursday fears she is next.<br />Having described Thursday's alternate universe and the activities of Spec Ops in past books, Fforde now turns to an in-depth look at the mechanics of book construction. He takes us on a tour of the Well, leading us through the footnoterphone conduits, past the Text Sea where obsolete books are demolished and their letters recycled, and along the bustling streets where books are born. He introduces us to the tradesmen who support book creation, such as the chapter ending specialists, plot device, action sequence, and backstory vendors, holesmiths, and moodmongers. He describes the education of generic characters. He cautions of the dangers of grammasites and the mispeling vyrus. He lets us view the storycode engines and demonstrates the latest version of the Book Operating System, called UltraWord, which looks suspiciously like a familiar PC operating system. He invites us to the 923rd Annual BookWorld Awards, with such unusual categories as &quot;Best Dead Person in Fiction Award&quot; and &quot;Most Used English Word Award.&quot;<br />Fforde has a wicked sense of humor and an incredible gift for spoofing and word play. Clever literary allusions abound. Although it is not necessary for readers to be knowledgeable about literature, the more they are conversant with the classics the more they will appreciate the witticism here. While performing her apprenticeship duties, Thursday jumps into such books as Wuthering Heights, Alice in Wonderland, Sense and Sensibility, and Shadow the Sheepdog. She meets a wide range of literary characters, including Sir John Falstaff, Humpty Dumpty, the Minotaur, Mr. Toad, Miss Haversham, the Cheshire Cat, and Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. This American edition contains a bonus chapter, not included in the original British edition, where a WordStorm rages through BookWorld and threatens to wreak havoc in some treasured classics of literature.<br />This brilliantly written book is a joy to read, although the plot is more convoluted than those of its predecessors.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the story line that was left hanging in the previous volume in the series has still not been resolved. Instead, this book appears to be setting the stage for the next one by providing the background of BookWorld and the Well. Since the next book will be not be published until March of 2005, it will be a long wait!

The gym class you couldn't wait to end? That awkward first encounter with the opposite sex?  Those tense moments performing in front of your classmates? Paul Feig's adolescent angst will make yours seem trivial in comparison. These essays about his experiences as an insecure, picked-on, but yet ever-hopeful kid from the wrong side of the popularity tracks will have you laughing and nodding as you recognize some of those same scenes from your own childhood.<br />Paul was a quiet and fearful boy obsessed with germs, undressing in the boy's locker room, and dealing with girls. He alternately either tried to gain acceptance from, or avoided the attention of, the other kids... all of which, of course, made him the target of ridicule or worse. He describes every anxious moment in his childhood from his unusual homemade elf costume in his first grade class play to his misgivings about his date at the senior prom. I suffered along with him on horrendous school bus trips. I felt sympathy for him when his teacher mispronounced his last name, prompting his classmates to dub him with an unfortunate permanent nickname. I cringed at his Little League and football announcer fiascos. I rooted for him when he performed in the school talent show. I worried about his decision to dress in his Mom's clothing for Halloween. And above all else, I laughed.<br />These stories are not just funny, however. They are masterpieces of observation about the social interactions among kids, or between kids and their parents and teachers. The anecdotes are undoubtedly exaggerated for effect, yet they ring true because they describe every adolescent's fears of fitting in. I recommend this well written and highly entertaining book.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-03-19

Imagine grappling with physical and chronological ages that are at odds with each other for all but a brief period in your middle age. Imagine falling in love and stopping at nothing to be near the one you love. Max Tivoli has had such a life. He is a protagonist like no other, and now he writes his confessions. No, not his memoirs... his confessions.<br />Max bares his soul, revealing the paradoxes, the ironies, and the cyclical patterns in his unique and tumultuous life. He documents his struggles against the currents of time, where he has had to keep reinventing himself as time moved inexorably forward for others. He laments the deceit and rejection he has had to practice to follow his mothers advice to &quot;be what they think you are.&quot;  He describes how his best friend, in stages, plays the role of his son, his brother, and his father. He memorializes a love that transcends drastically changing age differences.<br /><br />Taking place in San Francisco around the turn of the twentieth century, when gaslights and carriages make way for electric lights and automobiles, the action centers on the three time periods in Max's life when his path crosses that of his love, Alice. In each of the three sections he reluctantly reveals, bit by bit, the surprising details that comprise the core of his life. His need for acceptance and love is portrayed in an entirely new and fresh way. The story evinces emotions that are powerfully heartrending. The writing is lyrical and full of imagery. This incredible novel will take your breath away, and I recommend it highly. If you only have the time to read one literary novel this season, make it this one.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-03-11
US	53012990	RXZVI7LOHSNIU	0765307006	554998165	The Codex	Books	4	70	74	N	N	Jungle treasure hunt	As a team, Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child have produced some great thrillers. And it turns out that their solo efforts are every bit as fast-paced and exciting. Max Broadbent, who is dying of cancer, leaves a videotape to his three sons announcing that he has buried himself and his half-billion dollar art and antiquities collection in a tomb in an undisclosed location. If the sons want their inheritance, they must track down the tomb. This begins a long treasure hunt through the jungles and rain forests of Honduras. The title refers to a codex, a Mayan compendium of plant pharmacology that becomes the most hotly contested object of the treasure hunt.<br />The story line switches between the separate treasure hunting parties and the pharmaceutical company executive who desperately needs the codex to keep his company from going bankrupt. The action converges in a final showdown over the treasure. This story has vivid descriptions of the jungle and its dangers. There are so many exotic natives, battles between man and beast, chases, narrow escapes, and ancient ruins that it resembles an Indiana Jones film. In fact, the story is perfectly suited to become a movie. The premise of this story might be far-fetched, but stay with it and you will be rewarded with a grand adventure, full of danger, treachery and surprises. I recommend this novel for those who enjoy pure escapism and armchair travel to exotic places.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-03-04

Willie Traynor, the young reporter who buys the local newspaper when it falls into bankrupcy, covers the case in the paper and befriends Miss Callie, the matriarch of the amazing Ruffin family and the first black woman juror in Ford County. Danny is tried and found guilty, but he receives life imprisonment instead of the death penalty. When he is released on parole after only nine years and returns to Clanton, the jurors who convicted him begin to die one by one, and the remaining jurors fear for their lives.<br />This novel features not only the setting of Grisham's earliest novel, but also the reappearance of its lawyers Lucien Wilbanks and Harry Rex Vonner. It covers some of the same issues of race and criminal justice. But if you are expecting this story to be similar to its predecessor, you might be disappointed. For one thing, the protagonist here is Willie Traynor rather than a lawyer. The story does contain some tense courtroom drama, but that comprises only part of the novel. Instead we see the gentler and softer-hearted Grisham as represented in some of his latest works such as &quot;Bleachers&quot; and &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot; After the fast-paced trial and while Danny is in prison, the story changes direction to indulge in some good old-fashioned Southern storytelling.<br />Through the voice of newspaper owner Traynor, a northerner who views the town with the eyes of an outsider but who comes to care for its inhabitants, Grisham shows his affection for Southern small town life. Grisham's descriptions and characterizations are so lovingly crafted that I felt I had attended a goat barbecue, sampled some powerful moonshine, sat on the balcony above the town square gossiping with and about the locals, played poker in the backwoods, visited every church in the county, and had lunch on Miss Callie's porch. The story is peppered with humor and folk wisdom. The ending, although sad, is satisfying. I strongly recommend this novel for readers who appreciate both the vintage and newer Grisham works.<br />Eileen Riebackve the town square gossiping with and about the locals, played poker in the backwoods, visited every church in the county, and had lunch on Miss Callie's porch.

Unfortunately, as the idea evolves, the story line diverges into into a hodgepodge of chase scenes, religious epiphanies, and supercomputer-gone-wrong crises that quickly get tedious.<br />David Tennant, a scientist whose brain was scanned for the computer's neurological model as part of the government's top-secret Project Trinity, experiences neurological symptoms that cause him to experience narcolepsy and hallucinations, where he imagines himself to be Jesus. Because he begins to object to the project and is considered a threat to national security, he and his psychiatrist must flee for their lives. After visiting a holy site in Jerusalem and lapsing into a strange comalike state, Tennant claims to have gained a complete understanding of God and the nature of consciousness and the universe.  The dialogue becomes preachy as he explains his revelations to his psychiatrist and then to the Trinity computer, and it seems out of place when plunked down in the middle of an action-oriented plot. The love story between Tennant and Rachel, his psychiatrist, seems unrealistic because she considers him deluded at best and insane at worst.<br />The plot about an omnipotent, out-of-control supercomputer has been done many times before, such as in the movie &quot;Colossus:  The Forbin Project.&quot; Like in that movie, the Trinity computer decides to take over the world through the threat of a nuclear Armageddon. But frankly, &quot;Colossus&quot; was better conceived and implemented. The concept of a scientist on the lam from the government or technical evildoers because he poses a threat to a misguided project has also been done again and again. Greg Iles has bitten off more than he can chew with the religious and philosophical diatribe that leads nowhere. He has written far better and far more original thrillers. Try one of his other novels instead, such as &quot;24 hours&quot; or &quot;The Quiet Game.&quot;<br />Eileen Riebackcal diatribe that leads nowhere.

Reading each successive volume, I can see that this is increasingly true. The series seems to be the summing up of his writing career by incorporating many of the characters, story lines, philosophies, mythologies, and literary inspirations of his previous works into this single far-reaching fantasy universe. This fifth installment more strongly than ever incorporates such references, including Salem's Lot, The Stand, Hearts in Atlantis, and many others. He also includes references to a myriad of books by other authors besides the obvious Tolkien. I found allusions to the works of L. Frank Baum, J.K. Rowling, Richard Adams, and even Marvel Comics.<br />I will not provide a detailed recap of the story here since so many other reviewers have already done so. What I will attempt to do is explain why I give Wolves of the Calla only 3 stars, as well as to list its strengths and weaknesses. The story of the residents of the Calla and their joining forces with Roland's ka-tet to vanquish the wolves deserves 5 stars. There is intrigue, town politics, an ominous threat hanging over the twin children of the residents, and an exciting battle between Wolf and man. The personalities of the townsfolk, who are divided in their opinions of whether to fight or submit to the wolves, are well developed, as is that of the enigmatic Andy the Messenger Robot. King has done an excellent job developing the mythology and culture of the &quot;folken&quot; of Calla Bryn Sturgis. The reader is treated to a realistic and colorful portrayal of their language, culture, festivals, music, and traditions. After finishing the story, I felt that I had actually taken a trip there and met its inhabitants.<br />Where the story line falls short, and earns the book only 3 stars, is the middle half of the novel, where there is a lot of travel to the New York of 1977 and many side narratives about the pasts of several of the protagonists. The travel, sometimes performed involuntarily through a mystical &quot;todash&quot; and sometimes voluntarily through another magical doorway, leads to efforts to protect the rose of previous episodes from harm. Not only is all this back-and-forth action distracting, but the ka-tet's dealings with the owner of the lot upon which the rose grows, and with the hoodlums who threaten him, is tedious. Also in this middle half is an excessive amount of tale telling about the pasts of several of the characters. Pere Callahan's tale is essentially a sequel to Salem's Lot, and has no place here.<br />The illustrations have added a lot to the cost of the book, but little to enhance the story. I give one star to these illustrations. Granted, Roland's Mid-World is a gloomy place, but these paintings are too gloomy and colorless. Every character is depicted as sinister. They all look physically mangy and stringy, even the good folken of the Calla.<br />Although I prefer King's horror fiction to his Dark Tower epic, being an ardent King fan I feel duty-bound to read the entire story - all seven volumes worth. Besides, I do want to know how Roland and his ka-tet manage to save Mid-World from the evil of the Dark Tower. Reading the entire magnum opus does require a large commitment, since the story, when completed, is projected to weigh in at more than 3,500 pages. Needless to say this volume of the series should not be tackled unless you have already read the previous volumes, and thus it is best left to the diehard Stephen King or Dark Tower fans. Of course this installment will leave the story, and you, hanging in midair.

Miss Jane, in her rambling, often opinionated, but always endearing narrative style, not only tells her life story but also that of the history of the black people from slavery up to their struggles for civil rights in the 1960s.<br />Around ten years old when freed from slavery, Jane decides to head to Ohio to find the friendly Yankee soldier who was kind to her when his troop passed through. Although she never gets out of Louisiana, she saves a young boy, taking him under her wing when the Confederate soldiers slaughter his mother, and sets off to find a better life for the two of them. Along with the other newly freed slaves, she deals with problems in finding shelter, jobs, and education. As she ages, she becomes the matriarch of her community, and in that role provides support, inspiration, and commonsense guidance to others as they seek their rightful place in society.<br />Jane is a colorful character with lots of spirit and determination. Her story is full of humor, wisdom, and irony. The emphasis of the book shifts about halfway through from Jane herself to the story of the people that pass through her life. Some chapters depart from the main story to cover a particular person or incident she observes. She discusses the discrimination and violence the blacks faced in the south. She is witness to the relationship between blacks and whites, including a doomed love interest. She chronicles civil rights advances and mentions the efforts of such black leaders as Washington, Douglass, and King. She speaks of the Freedom Riders and civil rights marches. One clever chapter digresses to discuss one of the floods in her town that was caused, according to Jane, by man's egotistical notion that he can change the course of rivers. Because the story covers 100 years of Jane's recollections, time passes quickly in some spots, leaving large gaps of time missing from her life. I found it was sometimes difficult to determine how old she was when a new chapter began and how far forward time had passed. In spite of this, the novel is educational, entertaining, and uplifting, and would be an excellent book to teach older children about black history.<br />Eileen Riebackime passes quickly in some spots, leaving large gaps of time missing from her life.

These 50 recipes, presented by Men's Health magazine, are quick and easy and seasoned with a dash of humor. This is a good book for the beginner because each recipe uses only a few basic ingredients, mostly from cans. Its thick paperboard pages provide clear cooking instructions, photos of the foods to be used, nutritional information, and additional cooking and nutrition tips. The categories of &quot;real guy&quot; meals and snacks include ham, chicken, fish, chili, beans, SpaghettiOs, veggies, fruit, and beer (yes, beer!). Some of the recipes are rather strange (stirfry SpaghettiOs, or drunken corn), but for the most part they are far better than the steady diet of fast food and junk food that a person might otherwise subsist on if unable to cook.

Now comes a hilarious British parody, by the fictional A. Parody, that takes the original book one step sillier. This small volume is a compendium of off-the-wall and funny facts, mostly in the form of lists. The contents range from the factual, such as famous people with pseudonyms and the semaphore alphabet, to the fictional &quot;7 things you can never quite remember,&quot; in which Santa's reindeer include Comic and Blitzkreig. Some of the categories are outrageously useless, such as prime numbers whose individual digits add up to 11.  Some are useful, such as collective nouns for animals and a list of the aliens from Star Trek. Let's not forget such silly gems as &quot;Ways to end a romance&quot; and &quot;Not wildly popular sea captains.&quot; This book even satirizes an index; the last page claims that an index should be tailored to the reader and then proceeds to explain how to construct your own. This book is witty, creative, and a great spoof. You might even learn a thing or two from it. Just remember to take its contents with a generous dash of salt! This would make a great gag gift for the trivia buff.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-02-07

These events leads doctors to conclude that Eleanor has a brain abnormality and epilectic seizures. Eleanor believes no such thing. Instead she is certain that her extrasensory abilities have allowed her to view ghosts that haunt Kingdom Hospital.<br />Reminiscent of The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer and its tie-in to the TV miniseries Rose Red, this novel disguised as nonfiction is a tie-in to the Stephen King TV series Kingdom Hospital. It consists of Eleanor's journals of her investigation into the paranormal occurrences at the hospital, the identity of a child whose phantom cries only she can hear, and the secrets of her own past. The novel reveals an explanation for only part of the mysteries Eleanor is investigating. Her introduction to the journal, a cover letter to Stephen King, warns &quot;Please read these pages as an introduction only to what I believe will one day be a complete scientific assessment of the remarkable occurrences witnessed by myself and others at Kingdom Hospital...&quot; Although this book sets the scene for the TV series that follows, it can stand alone on its own merits.<br />I recommend this novel as a well-crafted blend of the factual and the fictional. You will learn something about neurological diseases and their treatment as the doctors deal with Eleanor's hallucinations. You will shiver at the spookiest of supernatural events as Eleanor attempts to bridge the gap between the past and the present, and between life and the first state of the afterlife.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-02-03

Unfortunately, that was not the case. The story concerns the disappearance of Cindy Carver's daughter Julia, who goes for a film audition and is not seen again. Feeling the police are not doing enough to look for Julia, Cindy performs her own investigations in a very desperate and confrontational manner, casting a suspicious eye on Julia's ex-boyfriend, Cindy's other daughter's boyfriend, the director Julia auditioned for, and the next door neighbors. During the chaos of the disappearance, Cindy meets and falls in love with a man who is very unrealistically portrayed. Cindy's family rallies to her side to lend support, and coincidentally they also contribute to the better scenes in the novel. These scenes include family squabbles, misunderstandings, and reconciliations that add some warmth and comic relief to an otherwise cool and disorganized novel.<br />To Fielding's credit, she does paint a convincing portrait of the anguish a mother feels after the disappearance of a child, as well as the perception of the world as a cruel and violent place. But the details of Cindy's involvement with her neighbors, her ex-husband, her friends, and others she deals with are pointless and lead nowhere. None of the characters are likable. The ending is far-fetched and such a letdown that it ruins the suspenseful build-up that preceded it. I hope to see better from Fielding in the future.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-01-26

It does not answer life's major mysteries, but it does a wonderful job of answering the little ones. Do you wonder what the 'Q' stands for in Q-tip? Have you pondered whether cats have navels? Do you puzzle over why there is a worm in the bottom of some tequila bottles? Have you questioned why there are no purple Christmas lights? I could go on and on, but you get the idea. These little imponderables, and many more, are collected here in one volume from three of David Feldman's earlier out-of-print books.<br />Besides imponderables with answers, there is also a section on &quot;frustrables,&quot; or those imponderables that even the author's research could not uncrack. These include such mysteries as why doctors have illegible handwriting. Readers are invited to provide explanations to these unanswered questions, and there is an update in the back of each book section with reader's answers. Readers are also encouraged to pose questions of their own for inclusion in future books.<br />This collection is not only a lot of fun, but a good source of trivia as well. It is the kind of book you can open at random and find enlightenment, entertainment, and a chuckle or two all in the space of several pages. If you are a fan of Cecil Adam's &quot;The Straight Dope&quot; you will find Feldman's Imponderables a great way to round out your general trivia collection.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-01-24

Teena Maguire and her 12-year-old daughter Bethie are assaulted while walking home through a deserted park at night. Teena is brutally gang-raped and severely beaten while Bethie hides within hearing range of the violence. Bethie is able to identify several of the assailants. At the preliminary hearing, the defense attorney makes a fool of the deputy prosecutor and humiliates Teena on the witness stand. John Dromoor, the policeman who first arrived at the scene of the violence, takes a liking to Teena and Bethie and vows to help in any way he can to right the wrongs against them. Yes, this book is also a love story, but certainly not in the more conventional sense.<br />The story paints a powerful picture of the lingering after-effects of a horrible and violent crime.  The friends and relatives of the rapists cast Teena as the instigator rather than the victim, and Teena becomes an outcast in her own town. She is so devastated that she wishes she had died instead of surviving the attack. Bethie finds that her identity has been irrevocably altered to that of the daughter of the woman who was gang-raped. She is now her mother's caretaker. The perpetrators are out on bail, and they continue to menace the victims. Bethie fears for her life since she was the person to identify the rapists.<br />This book is well written and the characters convincingly portrayed. The narration switches between the point of view of several of the main characters. The voice of Bethie is implemented in an unusual second person narrative. What makes this story most frightening is that rape victims can be, and often are, tormented by these same scenarios. In Oates' skillful hands, the psychological impacts are brought home in a frightening way. I recommend this story whether or not you are an Oates fan. It will haunt you long after you turn the final page.<br />Eileen Riebackes fan. It will haunt you long after you turn the final page.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-01-19

Narrated by Simone, who was ten when her father died, this short debut novel concerns her family's efforts to accept and cope with her father's death. When Simone hears her dead father's voice calling from the backyard poinciana tree, she climbs the tree to talk with him. When her mother finds out, she also climbs the tree to converse with her late husband. But soon the tree, and with it Simone's father's memory, turn into an obsession that threatens to destroy the emotionally fragile family and their home.<br />Author Judy Pascoe provides an interesting look at the effect of a parent's death on the family, but at times she exaggerates those effects to make a point. The tree assumes metaphorical proportions as it tries to prevent Simone's mother from having a relationship with another man and threatens the house they live in with its encroaching branches and roots. The story does hit home with its analysis of the complications of the death of a loved one, including anger at the father's abandonment and the children's fear that a suitor will replace the father and usurp the mother's affection.<br />Written in simple yet lyrical prose, the story has humor interspersed at odd moments to offset the emotional peaks. It infuses the action with a bit of magic while portraying the various ways people handle and overcome grief. I recommend it for its novel approach to a melancholy topic.	2004-01-16

The cops begin to suspect Marc as the perpetrator. The ransom demands begin. Marc discovers some disturbing facts about his late wife. He is involved in several harrowing but unsuccessful attempts to deliver the ransom and reclaim his daughter. The kidnappers will give him no second chance. It looks like Tara is lost forever.<br />The story has a powerful beginning, as Marc regains consciousness in the hospital and describes his feelings about his daughter and about the violent events that have just taken place. The narrative then switches back and forth between several of the principal players in this fast-paced thriller. The reader is drawn deeper into the mystery with every chapter, as new details emerge about Marc's wife, ex-girlfriend, and the kidnappers. It is not until the very end that all the facts fall into place. There is a large cast of supporting characters, including the police detective, FBI agents, Marc's lawyer friend, the kidnappers, Marc's former classmates, his ex-girlfriend, his father-in-law, and assorted strangers who help out at crucial moments. Marc is well characterized, and as he voices his fears, doubts, and passions, the reader gets a good feel for what makes him tick.<br />This is another winner from Coben. The story builds a lot of suspense, and it is unlikely that the reader will be able be ignore the red herrings and second-guess the twists that are revealed as the layers of the mystery are peeled back. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because of the ending. As interesting as it is, the final twist is a bit too implausable for my tastes. Nevertheless, this is a very entertaining thriller that will keep the reader guessing right up until the end.	2004-01-11

Not surprisingly, author Sara Nelson found that in spite of her good intentions, she wound up reading a different list of books than she planned. After all, we do not always choose books; sometimes they choose us based upon what is happening around us and inside us. Nelson, who has worked in the publishing industry as a journalist, editor, and reviewer, has an astounding insight into books and authors. She analyses what draws us to a book and keeps us there. She discusses the contract between an author and a reader. She talks about book covers or opening lines and the first impressions they make. She writes about books with warmth, passion, and humor.<br />I was first attracted to this book because of its title, which also happens to be the catch-phrase on my Amazon &quot;About Me&quot; page. As relevant as the title is, it could hardly do justice to how this wonderful book represents the heart and soul of a passionate reader. I did not walk away from this book merely with a to-read list as long as my arm and with a new appreciation for books and reading. Besides that, the author spoke to me as one book lover to another. After finishing the book, I feel I know Sara Nelson well.  She writes about the interplay between what she reads and who she is.<br />There were so many places in the book where I nodded my head and said &quot;Yes, I feel the same way!&quot; Nelson has stacks of books to rival my own, arranged in a chaotic order, yet she can place her finger on any one of them. She often reads more than one book at a time, as I do. She has faced the same dilemmas I have:  Where shall I put all my books?  What should I read next? If I reread a book I loved years ago, will I still feel the same about it?  If a friend recommends a book to me and I dislike it, what could this do to our relationship?  Should I bother to read an overhyped book just because everyone else has? Should I stop reading a book I am not enjoying? Will an author I enjoyed on the initial go-around disappoint me in later books? What relationship is there between what I am reading and what I am doing or feeling? What attracts me to a certain kind of book?<br />I highly recommend this gem for anyone who is a readaholic.just because everyone else has? Should I stop reading a book I am not enjoying?

Each daily page is backed with brightly colored glossy paper and contains a folding/cutting template. When the day is done, fold and cut the page using the template to produce a beautiful paper design using the next day's instructions and tips. There is a set of tabbed reference pages that sits behind the calendar to provide information on the basic folds. Every page has a new pattern, and some of them get quite intricate. There is a more elaborate project for each weekend. The designs you create can be displayed as-is or used for embellishing scrapbooks, gift wrap, greeting cards, etc.<br />The only criticism I have about this product is its use as a desk calendar. The box folds out to produce a calendar stand that is not too stable and that does not hold the pages as upright as other desk calendars. It might have been more functional if it were supported by a traditional plastic easel and if the pages were tear-off instead of loose. But it does clearly list the date and holidays and is great as a calendar for papercraft lovers. I also recommend this manufacturer's Origami calendar.	2004-01-03

Then she joined the Weight Watchers class run by Ertha, who ran the class like a Zen master and provided &quot;thinspirations&quot; that seemed to work. According to Ertha, dieting is about suffering and sacrifice, and the four enemies of diet success are temptation, sloth, jealousy, and weakness. So Clair decided to distill this diet wisdom, along with a lifetime of dieting experience, into haiku verse.<br />I would categorize this book as a humor book rather than a diet book since there is not a lot of advice on dieting how-to. The haiku itself does not flow very well compared to &quot;Honku: the Zen Antidote to Road Rage&quot; or other similar titles. That is why I did not give the book more stars than I did. However, it does touch upon every fad diet and frustration the typical dieter encounters, and it is quite funny. Here are some examples:<br />On temptation: Chocolate passes/too quickly over the tongue/preferring the hips.<br />On sloth: Training wheels, training/bras, and personal trainers./The Cycle of Life.<br />On weakness: Tasty pink grapefruit - /significantly less so/after the eighth day.<br />On jealousy: Consider Helen/whose face launched all that trouble./Better to be plain.<br />On resignation: We shall overcome./If we don't, there are always/elastic waistbands.<br />If you have ever struggled with losing weight, you will find lots of laughs here.	2004-01-02

It goes beyond the more elementary &quot;How Things Work&quot; series, because it also covers the history, manufacture, materials, quality control, future evolution, and additional reading for many common household and technical objects. Behind its clever denim jeans pocket-clad cover, the book presents an alphabetical arrangement of items from airbags to zippers, including pencils, salsa, tires, helicopters, compact discs, lightbulbs, and many more.<br />Besides the basic information mentioned above, there are sidebars and boxes containing additional fascinating facts about the products. Here are some examples:<br />- The YKK symbol you see on most zippers stands for Yoshida Kogyo Kabushikikaisha, the manufacturer of most zippers since 1939.<br />- The &quot;pearl&quot; in pearlized nail polish is actually produced from small pieces of fish scales and skin.<br />- A guitar craftsman is known as a &quot;luthier.&quot;<br />- The largest consumer of rubber bands in the world is the U.S. Post Office.<br />Not only is this a valuable reference for specific items you want to learn about, but you will enjoy opening it at random for the pleasure of discovering something new about something very ordinary.	2004-01-02

Fish are mysteriously dying in their ponds. There are ground tremors and rock falls in the cities surrounding Mount Vesuvius. Some residents attribute these things to giants or to the wrath of the gods. But Marcus Attilius Primus, the aquarius, or water engineer of the Aqua Augusta, who is sent to Misenum to research and repair the problem, knows that there is a scientific explanation. As he tracks the aqueduct from its terminus in Misenum to Pompeii and then onward to the vicinity of Mount Vesuvius, he observes unusual natural phenomena, discovers the upheaval that disrupted the water flow, and realizes that an inevitable cataclysmic event is about to occur.<br />In this painstakingly researched story, Robert Harris has produced much more than a historical thriller. Although we know the story will end with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the destruction of the surrounding cities, Harris has built suspense by describing the mysterious disappearance of the former aquarius Exomnius and the attempts of the officials of Pompeii to prevent Attilius from discovering the truth. This book also provides fascinating detail on the culture of ancient Rome, from the feasts in the sumptuous villas to the ingenious plumbing in the bath houses. It provides details on the aqueduct system, a marvel of Roman engineering. Each chapter is prefaced with an excerpt from a treatise on volcanos that describes the causes of, and events occuring during, an eruption. The reader is entertained while learning all this, and is not overburdened with facts and figures.<br />The characters are well developed and fascinating.  The brilliant writer, naturalist, and scholar Pliny the Elder, and the pompous and wealthy city developer Ampliatus come to life through Harris' talent. From slaves to powerful land barons, from laborers to statesmen, the reader is treated to all facets of the citizenry of ancient Pompeii. There is also a weakly developed love interest between Attilius and the daughter of Ampliatus. This is the one part of the story that would have been better if left out. Even with that flaw, the book is compelling reading with a built-in ancient history lesson.ated to all facets of the citizenry of ancient Pompeii.

Odd is a very likable guy whose ideal future rests with his girlfriend and soul mate Stormy Llewellyn and with a career in tires or footwear.  Aware that his sixth sense is a burden that sets him apart and makes him appear otherworldly to others, he knows that he has received this gift for a reason. He feels a responsibility to make sense of the ghosts he encounters and to thwart the violence that the bodachs portend. When he spots a large congregation of bodachs converging on his hometown of Pico Mundo, he has a premonition of great disaster. He hones in on a villainous and twisted \\"Fungus Man\\" who he senses will most likely cause the violence. He must now discover the time and place where the bloodshed will occur. He races against the clock to prevent a tragic outcome.  Narrated by Odd, this story is at times gory, at times inspirational, at times funny, and at times bittersweet.<br /><br />Koontz is still a master at interweaving scenes of horror with humorous dialog and action. The ghost of Elvis materializes at incongruous moments. There is an exploding cow to add comic relief. The author portrays many humorous and colorful characters including Odd's oversized six-fingered mentor Little Ozzie and his landlady Rosalia who fears she will become invisible.

It includes a good variety of spatial, visual, logic, word, lateral thinking, and number puzzles. The solutions sometimes involve a trick of some kind. The format would have been improved if it had a spiral binding so it could lie flat. It is difficult to work the puzzles in a book this thick without one.<br />According to the introduction, there are few puzzles in this collection that children under 10 could not solve. I doubt that is true, because many of the puzzles are super-tough and require out-of-the-box thinking. It would make a good gift for an experienced puzzle solver.	2003-12-20

She dutifully leaves her small Bangladeshi village and goes to live in Brick Lane, the Bengali enclave of London, after her arranged marriage to Chanu, an educated but pompous and ineffectual man twice her age. She acts as a traditional, dutiful, and useful wife. After accepting whatever cards fate deals her, however, she casts a critical eye at the actions of her friends, her sister and her mother. She questions whether she can actually control her life. She starts to break free, first with small subtle acts of rebellion and then an affair. Finally, with the interests of her children in mind, she takes a giant step toward becoming her own woman. Interspersed throughout the story line are letters to Nazneen from her sister Hasina, who strikes out on her own in Bangladesh and, through good times and bad, forges a life of her own.<br />The writing style is colorful and descriptive. The reader can smell the spices wafting through the hallways, view the multicultural clutter of a shabby and overcrowded apartment, and share the confusion and outrage that simmer in Brick Lane due to cultural, religious, and racial prejudice. Each character is carefully crafted and brought to life. Ali peels back the surface layers of Chanu to reveal his inner doubts and disallusionment. The secondary characters such as the starchy Dr. Azad, the crafty hypochondriac Mrs. Islam, and the Britishized Razia, are depicted with a deft touch. There are only two points in the novel that could be improved upon. First, although the absent Hasina's letters add another dimension to the story by developing her personality and experiences, at one point they lead the reader off on a several year tangent that leaves a gap in Nazneen's time-line. Second, there are many ethnic words for food and clothing that are not explained, and these might cause the reader some confusion. Overall, however, this book is a seamless blend of the Old Country and the New, and it brings new insights to the immigrant experience.here are many ethnic words for food and clothing that are not explained, and these might cause the reader some confusion.

Jeremy Carrier, a staff psychologist at City Central hospital, is a loner who becomes emotionally distant when his lover is brutally slain. He is unsure of his worth as a psychologist and mistrustful of the motives of others. When he is approached by an elderly eccentric pathologist named Arthur Chess, Jeremy tries to avoid him. However, through persistence and an invitation to a sumptuous but odd dinner meeting with a group of retired intellectuals, Dr. Chess draws Jeremy into pondering violence and virtue and leads him to question his role in this strange circle of friends. Jeremy begins to receive cryptic journal articles and postcards that draw his attention to a series of violent murders. He suddenly finds himself the prime suspect of these gruesome deeds and harassed by a homicide detective. As the clock ticks down, Jeremy must track down a psychopath to protect the new love of his life and to prove his own innocence.<br />This is typical Kellerman fare, reminiscent of his previous novel &quot;The Murder Book.&quot;  In both stories, the protagonists are given a series of enigmatic clues by persons unknown and then left to follow their crooked trail wherever it might lead. Although the story starts off slowly while developing Jeremy's tortured soul, it picks up speed and ends with a twist. The book contains thought-provoking ideas on the nature and origin of violent behavior and is an entertaining story.	2003-12-04
US	53012990	RGEUS53L83ALW	0451209540	450762437	The Policy	Books	3	9	9	N	N	Ludicrous yet frightening	What is the scariest thing a horror author can conjure out of his imagination?  A vicious extraterrestrial monster, a vengeful phantom, the boogeyman under the bed? According to Bentley Little, it is an insurance agent! However, this insurance agent doesn't just bother people with a few phone calls or glossy brochures. He also strongly suggests to his clients that if they turn down his policies, some ghastly events will occur, helped along by a group of supernatural insurance company enforcers. The characters in &quot;The Policy&quot; are caught up with just such an insurance agent, forced to take more and more insurance coverage until they are faced with making the most Faustian of contracts to stay secure. Eventually, overinsured Hunt Jackson and his friends have had enough, and they set out to destroy the insurance company.<br />As with other Little novels, this one takes an ordinary organization and turns it into all-powerful and horrific evil. But this story is more outrageous than the rest, to the point where it has more than one foot into spoof territory. The author does build up a lot of suspense, although it is interspersed with off-the-wall insurance claim handling and policy fine print. I would have given the book 4 stars were it not for the ending, which was silly and surreal. All in all, though, this was an entertaining read.	2003-12-01

He works at a second-rate university, has difficulty gaining credibility among his academic peers, and is unlucky in love. He finally hits pay dirt when a doctoral student he advises unearths the grave of a prehistoric Clovis hunter. Attempting to dig at the site without the appropriate permissions, Hank winds up in a scuffle with the police that lands him in a minimum security prison. In the meanwhile, the dig unleashes a nasty surprise with worldwide repercussions.<br />There is a lot of dark and outlandish humor here, as first-time novelist Adam Johnson pokes fun at academia and our materialistic society. There are many comic scenes of Hank and his students fumbling their way through their research, of Hank's womanizing, carefree father, and of the cop who likes Pomeranians, hates Hank, and raises his kids in boot-camp fashion. Interspersed with the wry humor, however, is a serious message. There are some powerful descriptions of life after the apocalypse. We are reminded of the gloomy forecast for our future if we repeat the history of our Clovis antecedents by destroying our environment and ourselves with it. We get to view ourselves as a future anthropologist would when looking back on our culture through the artifacts of our lives.<br />&quot;Parasites Like Us&quot; will make you laugh. But more importantly, it will make you think about what it means to be human. I look forward to other novels by Johnson.	2003-11-27
US	53012990	R12IHQEAOHBUKN	0743417682	124087136	From a Buick 8	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A King masterpiece	\\"From a Buick 8\\" is vintage King, and I'd give it 6 stars if I could. Don't think that because both \\"Christine\\" and this book are about cars that they share any similarity - they don't. This Buick Roadmaster is not really a car, although the state troopers of Pennsylvania Troop D, who found it abandoned at a gas station and stored it out back of the barracks in Shed B, are not sure exactly what it really is. But whatever it is, it produces some astounding and frightening phenomena, many of which stretch the reader's imagination to its limits.<br />The story line alternates between the present and flashbacks to the past as told by members of Troop D to Ned Wilcox, the son of a trooper who died in the line of duty. Ned has peeked in the windows of Shed B and has seen the Buick do one of its tricks, and now he wants to know its history. King demonstrates his mastery of characterization as the reader hears each part of the story in the distinctive voice and viewpoint of its narrator. Through the narrative, not only does the tale of the Buick unfold, but so does the story of the troopers themselves. The reader learns of their lives, their troop camaraderie, their fears, and their hopes.<br />It is comforting to know that if Stephen King adheres to the statement that he will write a few more Gunslinger books and then retire, at least he is going out in style with this book.	2003-11-27

Unless you are already skilled at solving conventional cryptic crosswords, this is not the book for you, since it does not have the several pages of solving hints usually provided as a preface to most cryptic puzzle books.<br />These puzzles originally appeared in The Atlantic Monthly between 1986 and 1998. Each of these puzzles has an additional &quot;gimmick&quot; to it that makes the solving that much more difficult, such as answers that bend around the grid, unclued words, dropped/added/shuffled letters in the clues or answers, random order clues, and so on. If you love a challenge, these puzzles are for you. You will have a real feeling of accomplishment when you complete one.	2003-11-23

On the other hand, if you're looking for a book you can pick up, open to a random page, and unearth some fascinating tidbits of trivia, then you're in the right place.<br />Imbued with humor, sprinkled with quotations, and arranged in completely arbitrary order, this quaint compendium of facts makes for edifying, absorbing, and essential (according to Ben Schott) reading. Although the author has taken great pains to ensure the correctness of the facts, he admits that some of the trivia he presents has been disputed; he provides a list of variations and disputations. There is a self-referential page with statistical information about the book itself. There is also an index, although the reader will not be referring to it often, if at all. Originally published in England, this edition has been updated with American trivia, but it still contains such British facts as cricket fielding positions, British poets laureate, and the order of succession to the English throne.<br />Move over bathroom readers... this book is far more entertaining. I recommend you buy a copy and keep it handy at all times. You never know when you'll need to find some \\"Q\\" words with no \\"u\\" or  a list of Elizabeth Taylor's husbands!	2003-11-22
US	53012990	R1FUZW4C3WPW6K	006039384X	776351801	Mirror Mirror: A Novel	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A new slant on an old fairy tale	Gregory Maguire has put a most clever twist on this incredibly rich and creative retelling of the classic story of Snow White. In a seamless blending of history and fairy tale, the story takes place in 16th century Italy. Snow White is personified as Bianca, the beautiful and naive daughter of a Spanish expatriate who manages the Montefiore farm. Lucrezia Borgia, the decadent, beautiful, and manipulative murderess, replaces the role of the wicked stepmother as Bianca's caretaker. The seven dwarves are creatures far stranger than any I have ever seen depicted before. Part man, part rock, and wholly surreal, they move through their own dimensions of time and space. The poisoned apple is plucked from the fabled tree of knowledge.<br />The language is lyrical and evocative of far away times and places. Objects ranging from the mirror to the dwarves' cottage are painted with detail so realistic yet magical that the reader is immersed in the off-kilter and eerie world of fantasy. Colorful secondary characters such as the cook, priest, and gooseboy add humorous contrast to the evil machinations of the Borgias. Take a trip to Montefiore and revisit a fairy tale reflected in a mirror of history, myth, and magic.	2003-11-22

It was entertaining, but a bit too one-dimensional. The plot covers several days in time during which high school football coach and legend Eddie Rake is on his death bed, and many of his past players and most of the town of Messina rally to pay their last respects.  Except for a scene between all-American star and town hero Neely Crenshaw and a former girlfriend, all the dialog and action centers on football and memories of Coach Rake. The reader receives a play-by-play account of several of the more notable games in the coach's tenure, experiences all the triumphs and defeats of several generations of Spartans, and sweats along with the players during their grueling training sessions. But beyond the aura of Coach Rake and the controversy concerning his training methods, there is little else of substance there.<br />Grisham performs admirably in evoking the atmosphere of the small football-oriented town and the team spirit of the students who played football there. The reader can hear the cheers in the bleachers, see the action on the playing field, and feel the loyalty, nostalgia, and camaraderie of the football alumni as they gather on the field to honor their Coach and relive their football past. Although he never makes an appearance in the story, Coach Rake is the most strongly portrayed character in the book. He is loved and hated, respected and feared. But although he is larger than life, he is the most human character. The reader learns of his emotions and frailties.  Protagonist Neely, on the other hand, is poorly depicted beyond his obsession with, and ultimate acceptance of, his past.<br />For those football players and fans among you, &quot;Bleachers&quot; will probably bring back many memories. But when you close the cover of the book, it is those memories, rather than the story itself, that will remain with you.	2003-11-17

In the moral climate of Victorian England, the repercussions of that discovery spread swiftly and severely. The fallout not only harms the Peacocks, but schoolmaster Dr. Wortle and the reputation of his school. The story dwells less upon the secret bigamous marriage itself than upon the the moral dilemma resulting from it: whether something that seems on the surface to be immoral is in truth not really a sin.  Dr. Wortle, rather than the Peacocks, is the central character of the story. It is through his fair and compassionate eyes that the reader ponders whether the relationship between Mr. Peacock and his &quot;wife&quot; was really less sinful than any other choice available to the couple. His views are contrasted to those of the Church and to the society as a whole.<br />Trollope introduces a note of levity to the story with a side plot concerning the love between Dr. Wortle's daughter Mary and young Lord Carstairs, a student at the school. Trollope also takes some interesting potshots at America, particularly the lawlessness and licentiousness of the American West. A good introduction and footnotes to the novel provide background information on Trollope's ideas and personal life, and how they are reflected in the story. If you are hesitant to try a novel by Trollope, this would be a good one to start with.	2003-11-16

But I have yet to see one this season that compares to the mind-boggling beauty of &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot;. The photos in this magnificent collection run the gamut from the microscopic to the macrocosmic, presented in order of size. Like explorers of uncharted seas, we are able to discover the incredible detail hidden in the extremely small and to map the grand pattern in the extremely vast. We are also able to observe, as exemplified  by the illustration on the cover, that there is often an eerie pattern of similarity revealed when viewing side-by-side things of vastly different scale. Not only is this book a feast for the eyes, but fuel for the intellect as well.	2003-11-16

Because he is half man and half bull, M, as the Minotaur is now called, is understandably shy and lonely, desperate to be accepted by others while at the same time baffled by them. He longs for love. He is caught between the ancient world of his dreams and the realities and limitations of his current situation. With his bull head and sharp horns, he brings out both the best and worst from the people he encounters; their reactions range from fear to ridicule to curiosity to kindness.<br />Steven Sherrill has done a superb job in this unique and touching story. Not only is he easily able to make the reader imagine the Minotaur living and working in the contemporary South, but his lyrical prose evokes the scents and bustle in a restaurant kitchen, the atmosphere of a run-down trailer park, and the comforts of the humdrum rituals in M's daily life. The story comes alive with touches of humor. Through a skillful interweaving of imagery from the ancient and contemporary worlds, Sherrill gives glimpses of both the primitive beast and the gentle man within a single body.<br />Suspend your belief and enjoy this book. As the story progresses, you will find yourself identifying with M in many ways. And by the time you finish it, you will recognize the fragments of monster and human that are within all of us.	2003-11-10

James Siegel's &quot;Derailed&quot; is the most suspenseful and well-written thriller I have read in a long time. Charles Schine is just an ordinary guy until he meets a gorgeous woman on the train and begins an affair with her. Then everything begins to go horribly wrong, and the catastrophe snowballs until his life is completely out of control. He is thrown into a world of blackmail, scams, and murder. The plot unfolds as a story within a story. The action switches between an instructor who teaches English part-time at Attica State Prison and an autobiographical essay written anonymously by a prisoner in his class. Finally, the two stories converge into a blockbuster of an ending.<br />Through Schine's voice, the unbelievable becomes credible. There are enough details about Schine, his family, his daughter's severe diabetic condition, and his job at an ad agency to make him come alive. The author shares every thought, every doubt, and every emotional nuance that Schine experiences as he watches his comfortable world crumble. As a result, the reader is drawn skillfully into the story, surprised by continual twists and turns, and held enthralled until the last page. Read this book - you will not be disappointed!	2003-11-05

This sequel started out exactly the same: the genetically-engineered bird children performing their aerodynamic acrobatics, Frannie and Kit trying to protect them, and all of them on the run when evildoers try to capture and kill them. I also found that these elements became stale on the second go-around.<br />In the latter half of the book, I had to reexamine the title page to be sure I was not reading a bad Robin Cook novel. The story had now metamorphosed into a medical thriller: a mad scientist harvesting organs from humans to create a race of supermen to rule the world. It was replete with ominous hospital scenes that brought to mind Robin Cook's \\"Coma,\\" although not as skillfully implemented.<br />And finally, when I finished reading the book, I had to check the title page one last time to assure myself that this book was indeed written by James Patterson. He can and has done much better. The plot was preposterous and the dialog was simplistic and naive. Bring back Alex Cross!	2003-11-04

The FBI and the CIA, who suspect that the killer comes from somewhere in their ranks, join forces to try to track down the assassin. An imprisoned former CIA traitor, who claims to know the identity of the assassin, wants to trade that information for a pardon and freedom.<br />This is Woods' best Will Lee novel, even though President Will and his wife, CIA head Kate, are peripheral to the action. Woods produces some good character development in both Robert Kinney, a Deputy Director of the FBI, and in Ted, the assassin. The story is very fast-paced. There are plenty of high-tech gadgets, chase scenes, computer hacking, and SWAT team action to keep things interesting. You will find it hard to put this book down.	2003-11-03

Add to that a raccoon-dog from Japanese legend, some MIA deserters, several generations of unusual interspecies women, the culture and color of Southeast Asia, the circus, and a chrysanthemum seed. The result is an offbeat and fun story that somehow makes perfect sense.<br />This is not Robbins' best novel, but in my opinion it is one of the better ones. It is quite short, but what it lacks in quantity is compensated for in quality. I won't bother recounting the basic story, not only because other reviewers have already done so, but because describing the plot of a Robbins novel is... well, ineffective. You have to be there to appreciate it. The cast of characters is imaginative, colorful, and sometimes downright hilarious. The writing style is playful and witty, with galloping metaphors and word play in abundance. The social, religious and political satire is biting. The theme of identity and deception permeates the story on both a personal and national level. If you are a fan of Robbins, dive into this book. If you have never read his work before, start with \\"Still Life With Woodpecker\\" or \\"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\\" instead.	2003-10-28
US	53012990	R39WFPPH3RP7AL	0385721420	120680919	Three Junes	Books	3	10	11	N	N	Lacks focus	In my opinion, \\"Three Junes\\" does not live up to its rave reviews or to the National Book Award bestowed upon it. The story, which recounts the lives of a Scottish family through flashbacks into the past and three slices of time in the present, does not seem to have focus. The first section of the novel, covering newly widowed Paul's trip to Greece, is the best. Through Paul's reminiscences, the reader is introduced to the McLeods. As the perspective shifts to son Fenno in the second section, the story begins a downhill slide. I do not see the point of the third section at all, which focuses on Fern, a character who is peripheral to the McLeod family. Nor do I see a common thread binding the three sections of the book, other than the presence of some of the same characters.<br />The eldest son Fenno is the best portrayed character, and the family's history unfolds mostly through his eyes. Yet Fenno is not a very likable person, and since he is the family's \\"black sheep,\\" gay and living in Manhattan, using him as the chronicler of the McLeods seems a poor choice. His opinions of his siblings and other relatives is colored by his physical and emotional distance from the rest of the family.<br />This book is a slow read. Although it is beautifully written, that is not enough to hold one's interest without a good theme or plot behind it. If you want to read an excellent award-winning family saga spanning both sides of the Atlantic, read Eugenides' Pulitzer Prize winning \\"Middlesex\\" instead.	2003-10-22

Previous opinions have run the gamut from glowing to glowering. Perhaps this is because this is not the typical Joy Fielding novel. I can see where any faithful fan of hers might be upset by this book. So my advice is this:  if you enjoyed the movie &quot;Psycho&quot; you might enjoy this book. If you enjoy novels about women, friendship, love, and relationships, you might not. If you are expecting, as the book jacket states, &quot;an unforgettable drama of one woman's fight to reclaim her life&quot; then you will be sorely disappointed.<br />Even for those of you who do enjoy books on the creepy side, this one goes over the deep end. There are too many red herrings. There are many scenes that are not explained at the twist ending. The protagonist Terry Painter does not act in a consistent manner, and as the story progresses you will become confused. The behavior of Alison's friends towards Terry is very unrealistic and mystifying, especially considering the ending. Although the suspense and mystery build up to a fever pitch as the story progresses, you will probably be let down by the ending. I was.	2003-10-20

Nor is it a run-of-the-mill time travel tale. Instead it is an imaginative and brilliantly written blend of the two genres to produce a delightful novel of a love that spans time in both directions. The bittersweet story of Clare and Henry De Tamble zigzags back and forth through time to describe the chaotic but strong relationship between the two in spite of the unusual obstacles they face.  The story also poses some serious questions on destiny and free will.<br />The timeline is truly a patchwork quilt to be assembled piece by piece. Each section is prefaced with the date, the ages of Henry and Clare, and the identity of the narrator to help you keep track of when in time the protagonists are. There are many glorious instances of time travel paradoxes, some of which will give you pause while you try to figure out how Henry's actions impact the past and the future, and how such seemingly improbable scenarios could exist. Suspend your logic, however, and savor these paradoxes. After all, this is not a Star Trek episode.  You will laugh; you will cry; you will marvel over the story of the De Tambles. Read it and be amazed!	2003-10-07
US	53012990	R15QMQCKP0NS9C	0345459806	603452592	The Sitter	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Ho hum	Sorry to skew the consensus, but I did not find this book to be particularly scary or well written. To say that this book is adult reading is a stretch. I would place it more at the young adult level, the mentions of Ellie's sex life notwithstanding. It is a very easy read with no sophistication of plot or characterization.<br />Ellie Saks flees her traumatic past and the stresses of New York City life to find a job as a nanny in the posh Hamptons for two children, one of whom, Brandon, is severely disturbed and seemingly possessed by spirits. She is stalked by her ex-boyfriend. She receives a series of increasingly threatening gifts and messages. Her employer makes advances towards her. She sees mysterious apparitions on the grounds of the estate. She repeatedly encounters the ghost of a long-dead boyfriend. Not exactly fun at the beach, is it?<br />But in spite of the ingredients for a good horror story, the characters are naive and their actions make little sense. Why would Ellie stay on the job with all the threats against her?  For that matter, what conscientious parents wouldn't fire Ellie after all those threats? Why did she continue to humor her ex-boyfriend? How could either Ellie or the parents shrug off Brandon's escalating violent tendencies?  How much less realistic could the ex-nanny Mrs. Bricker be? How could the local police miss such elementary detective techniques when investigating the threats against Ellie? As for the surprise ending, I guessed the perpetrator halfway through, and the final details were so far-fetched that it was hard for me to take it seriously. The ghost theme was poorly developed, and at the end I was not certain what had really transpired in that regard. Ho hum. Give me a Stephen King or Dean Koontz novel instead.	2003-09-15
US	53012990	R2MLBXZ2FRLPKU	0743249887	641047904	Welcome to Higby: A Novel	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Clever and funny	Although very different from Dunn's previous masterpiece &quot;Ella Minnow Pea&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Higby&quot; is every bit as imaginative and humorous. Through a series of interrelated vignettes of small town Mississippi life, each titled with a relevant Biblical verse, Dunn depicts the lives of some of Higby's residents, each of whom struggles with a personal problem.<br />These problems run the gamut from the mundane to the hilarious. Talitha is kidnapped by a small religious vegan cult. Oren, the town minister, has a crush on the town tootsie and worries about his son Clint, who climbed to the top of the town's water tower and fell off. Carmen crafts pictures with macaroni and gets advice from her guardian angel on making the best of her shopping dollar. The clueless but good-hearted Euless is stunned by a financial windfall from his employer. Hank, on the edge of the downhill slide of Alzheimers, preaches to the neighborhood pets and frequently wanders off, to the consternation of his sister. Stewie has found God, but is foundering in his relationship with women. Ex-convict Bowmar is dogged by the police for every crime in town even though he is reformed and above suspicion.<br />In spite of all the goings-on, this novel never degenerates into a soap opera. The common thread binding all the story lines is the endurance of love and redemption. The reader is in turn amused, touched, concerned, and ultimately satisfied that the residents of Higby have bumbled their way to a happier life. So take a trip to Higby and enjoy the ride!	2003-09-15
US	53012990	R1KYII12KYQ947	0385509456	459979615	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time: A Novel	Books	5	17	19	N	N	A peek into an unusual mind	When you read &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot;, you get a glimpse into the thought processes of an autistic savant. Written in the form of a journal by the teenaged Christopher Boone, this innovative story ostensibly takes us through the boy's efforts to find the killer of his neighbor's dog. But what we really experience is a bittersweet journey of self-discovery for a boy who finds the world a most confusing and illogical place.<br />Haddon, who has worked with autistic children, does a wonderful job of explaining how Christopher perceives his environment and tries to cope with its perplexities. Examples abound of the contrasts between Christopher's literal, logical thought processes and the more typical imaginative and emotional ones. A powerful illustration of intuition versus logic is presented in a deceptively simple &quot;Let's Make a Deal&quot; probability problem that had me struggling for an entire day before accepting and understanding the answer.<br />Don't let the thought of an unemotionally narrated story with math problems in it put you off, however. This book is a delight in every way. We still witness the emotional impact of events on the people around Christopher. Although we feel frustrated over his inability to read others, we cheer him on as he manages to get by in the world in spite of his disability. There are humorous touches throughout the book to prevent it from becoming too maudlin.<br />What more can I say? Read this book!	2003-08-28
US	53012990	ROGZ26Z2V5OMM	0399148760	892853054	Seizure	Books	1	5	6	N	N	Not one of Cook's better novels	Because the release of the book \\"Seizure\\" was delayed for a long time, I had built up a lot of anticipation for it. I was disappointed. This is definitely not one of Cook's better novels.<br />Conservative senator Ashley Butler, stricken with Parkinson's, strikes a deal with Daniel Lowell, founder of a biotech company on the verge of a breakthrough in therapeutic cloning. Butler will aid, rather than oppose, the legalization of the groundbreaking cloning technique if he can be  the first unauthorized human recipient of the treatment. The preparation for the surgery takes up almost the entire book. The procedure itself and its dire consequences come so late in the story that they are anticlimactic. The ending is predictable.<br />There are many preposterous subplots and secondary characters that further dilute an already weak plot. These include use of blood from the shroud of Turin for the cloning (and the Keystone Kops attempt of the Catholic Church to prevent it), a bumbling group of mobsters that try to foil the procedure for their own misguided reasons, and the interactions between Lowell and the greedy owners of the Bahamian clinic where the procedure is to take place.<br />Although the issues surrounding stem cell research and medical ethics are thought-provoking, this story is nothing more than a platform to present them. Cook does not miss the opportunity at every turn to remind us of the good and bad uses of cloning and the evils of political interference in medical research. If you are a medical thriller junkie, you will probably read this novel in spite of the poor reviews it has gotten on Amazon. But remember that I warned you!	2003-08-13
US	53012990	R3VL5F9RREZZRP	0316168688	744408823	The Dogs of Babel	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Interesting premise, but...	The interesting premise of &quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot; was what attracted me to the book: can Paul Iverson teach his dog, the only witness to his wife Lexy's death after a fall from a tree, to speak so that the grieving husband can discover what happened? Once the story unfolds, however, the original story line goes astray with a series of flashbacks that explore Lexy's personality and her relationship with Paul. Ultimately it is Paul's own memories of Lexy that uncover the truth.<br />Not only does the &quot;teach the family dog to speak&quot; action fizzle out, but there are some unbelievable and downright silly subplots that detract from the beauty of the storytelling. These include Paul's brief association with a disturbing and fanatical group of dog abusers, Lexy's rearrangement of the books on the shelves to convey a cryptic &quot;message&quot;, and Paul's conversations with telephone psychics. As we learn more about Lexy herself, she is revealed to be a very disturbed woman with a penchant for impulsive actions and violent behavior, and I did not find her to be a sympathetic character. Nor could I understand what made Paul tick, since many of his actions often seemed irrational and out of character.<br />On the positive side, the book is well written and it does have some good points. It contains interesting symbolism about masks, as is highlighted on the front cover. There are insightful comments on relationships, love, and loss.  Lexy's fanciful side, including her square egg machine and her philosophy on food and dating, provides some light moments in a predominantly melancholy story. All in all, however, I found the book disappointing.	2003-08-07
US	53012990	R195B4VJ0ET13X	0446531421	432548907	Still Life with Crows (Pendergast, Book 4)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Fast paced and spooky	Preston and Child deliver another great story in &quot;Still Life with Crows.&quot; I won't recap the story line, since so many reviews before mine, and undoubtedly after mine, have done so. Instead I will concentrate on why I have rated this book with 5 stars.<br />While I raced through the pages, I could visualize a movie playing out in my head. There are so many scenes that are film-worthy, with plenty of spooky settings, chases, and jump-out-at-you moments. There is a bountiful cast of colorful characters and many vignettes of small town life. There are scenes inside a turkey slaughterhouse and in a spectacular series of caves. There are scenes of gruesome violence as well.<br />Rarely have I found a book where both the killer and the investigator are equally creepy and quirky, but that is indeed the case here. FBI agent Pendergast, who has made an appearance in other Preston/Child books, is a mysterious man of many talents. His knowledge of the arcane puts Sherlock Holmes to shame. His preference for the finer things of life recalls the better side of Hannibal Lecter. He selects as his local sidekick a Goth teenager with purple hair who is as much a loner as he is, and together they make an unusual team. If you are a Pendergast fan, you will certainly get your money's worth in this book. As for the killer... well, I won't spoil the story, but be assured that this is someone who is quite different from the average psychopath.<br />Although the whodunnit is uncovered well before the end of the book, it is not until the last two pages that the whydunnit is revealed. And that revelation is a stunning one, although its premise might be a bit far-fetched.<br />This is a wholly entertaining, suspenseful, and captivating book, and once the story is at full speed you will have trouble putting it down.	2003-08-06
US	53012990	RPVAFUB2JAPX9	0553802488	607743484	The Face	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A winner	In \\"The Face\\", Koontz has overcome the past few clunkers to produce a riveting and uplifting story that is worth the weighty quantity of pages. Ethan Truman is working as the head of security for the wealthy and beloved actor Channing Manheim (aka The Face). We are drawn into the story as he puzzles over a series of packages, delivered anonymously to the estate, that are filled with odd objects and that seem to pose a veiled threat. Strange events continue to unfold as the story progresses. The estate's phone line dedicated to calls from the dead begins ringing. The Face's son Fric receives supernatural visits from a \\"mysterious caller\\" who warns of impending disaster. Truman's old friend Dunny seems to have returned from the dead. Truman experiences the most eerie foreshadowings of his own death.  Cold blooded anarchist Corky Laputa, who plots to kidnap Fric as past of his master plan to destroy society, plants cruel seeds of destruction wheverever he goes. Truman's cop friend Hazard, enlisted to track down the source of the packages,is soon pulled into the bizarre happenings.<br />In typical Koontz fashion, the independent story lines converge on a race with the clock to prevent Fric's death. We are by turns horrified, mystified, amused, and uplifted as the story builds to an ending with a twist. Although Koontz tends to runs rampant in his use of metaphors, in \\"The Face\\" they are used to advantage to describe the continuous rain and gloom that foreshadow the dangers to come. We are introduced to a panoply of interesting characters, both those among The Face's staff and those in the seamy underside of the world outside it. We get to vicariously enjoy the trappings of an estate so huge and elegantly appointed that it boggles the mind. We feel empathy for Fric, ignored by his parents and filled with self-doubt about his worthiness as the son of superstars. It is interesting to note that Channing Manheim never makes an appearance in the book, even though he is the title character.<br />Although horror stories tend to wallow in darkness, Koontz adds touches of humor and hope that leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling at the end. If you enjoy vintage Koontz, such as \\"Strangers\\" and \\"Watchers\\", you will enjoy this book!title character. <br />Although horror stories tend to wallow in darkness, Koontz adds touches of humor and hope that leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling at the end.

In this sequel to The Eyre Affair, intrepid heroine Thursday Next is back for more hilarious romps through time and literary space. She is busier than ever, as she tries to save the world from a horrid (and pink) annihilation, rescue her husband Landen from his recent state of nonexistence, and guard the literary universe from evildoers, all the while evading the all-powerful Goliath Corporation. We follow Thursday into such reading material as Kafka's The Trial, Dickens' Great Expectations, Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, Poe's The Raven, and a laundry label (yes, a laundry label!). Jasper Fforde, whose humor is reminiscent of Douglas Adams, is in top form here. Literary gags, puns, outlandish situations,  plays on words, and irreverent jabs at anything and everything abound in this fanciful story.<br />I recommend that you read The Eyre Affair first, if you have not done so already, since it will help you understand the quirky flavor of this alternate universe. I also suggest that you take the Spec Ops literary challenge referenced on this latest book's back cover and try your hand at its devilishly difficult puzzles. If I have any critical comment, it is that the story leaves several loose ends, which have me impatiently awaiting Thursday's next adventure, The Well of Lost Plots. But I'm sure it will be worth the wait. Enjoy!	2003-04-21
US	53012990	R2VGEZIPYDUSZA	0671024183	111767343	Morgan's Run	Books	2	10	15	N	N	Slow going	I have to admit that I abandoned the book halfway through. Although I was expecting a story about the hardships of settling in the penal colony of Australia, I reached the novel's midpoint and Morgan was still on the convict ship, sailing past the coast of Europe. I grew tired of reading about fouled bilge pumps, shipboard diseases, and the quarrels among the ship's officers.<br />Richard Morgan was a cardboard cutout of a protagonist. His personality radically changed, according the situation at hand, from a quiet tavernkeeper's son to a rum-sotted grieving father to a wise leader of men. Morgan seemed to be no more than a vehicle for the author's detailed treatises on 18th century England and Australia and their history, public health issues, criminal justice system, and shipboard life.<br />If you are a historical novel buff with a preference for the factual over the fictional, then perhaps this novel is for you. It did not appeal to me.	2003-04-02
US	53012990	R32GNAB04GCYL4	0786867795	112945388	The Disapparation of James	Books	5	5	6	N	N	This novel casts a spell	Now you see him, now you don't!  Shy little James Woodrow volunteers to participate in a circus clown's magic trick. He literally disappears into thin air right on stage and does not return after the performance.  The boy's disappearance is just one facet of the magic contained in \\"The Disapparation of James.\\" We get to read alternate accounts of what would have happened if that fateful evening at the circus had not happened. We peek into the dreams of James' family and of the policeman who performs house duty. We witness a traumatic event that, somehow, transforms the lives of many people for the better - like magic!<br />It is a refreshing change to read a story about a family that is not dysfunctional. There are so many points in the story where parents will nod their heads and say \\"Yes!  I know just how they feel!\\" They will understand the anguish, guilt, and helplessness that James' parents feel over his disappearance. They will recognize all the dangerous forces in the world, both external and internal, that the Woodrows perceive as threats to their children. They will empathize with the complications of parental love that the Woodrows experience.<br />Being a word lover, I was puzzled by the word \\"disapparation\\" in the book title. It does not appear in the dictionary. The only reference I found to the word was in Harry Potter, so I am convinced that the word does not really exist. But that simply adds to the enchantment of a touching story that I will not soon forget. Rush to buy this wonderful novel - before it disappears off the shelves!	2003-02-07

Start with a futuristic theme park on a scale with Westworld or Jurassic park,  where historic realism mingles with next generation robotics and holography. Add a string of mysterious problems with park robots and rides. Then throw in a techno-savvy band of terrorists that threaten the lives of the park's 65,000 attendees. The result is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that has future movie written all over it.<br />Lincoln Child has produced an admirable solo effort in depicting the four fantastic worlds of Utopia and their systematic sabotage. He deftly mixes fast-paced action, a peek behind the scenes of a large theme park, a colorful cast of characters, and some comic relief through a lovable robot pet named Wingnut. Unlike many thrillers in the recent past, this one has a satisfying ending that left me smiling.	2003-02-03
US	53012990	R3IGNFFY72LMPY	0316341118	537841158	Forever: A Novel	Books	3	8	12	N	N	Spotty	Pete Hamill may be the guru of Manhattan history, but I think he tries to cram too much historical and cultural background into too little story. The first part of the novel, concerning Cormac's life in Ireland, is interesting and cohesive. But when Cormac comes to New York, the story devolves into a hodgepodge of events. The narrative leaps forward over large gaps in time, then backtracks in flashbacks. Overall, it forms a patchwork quilt with many pieces missing. The second half of the book drags as Hamill does a lot of name-dropping without adding much to the plot or character development of Cormac. The last quarter of the story is too predictable.<br />Yes, we have to suspend belief when reading a story about a man who lives forever. However, odd bits of fantasy and magic pop up in the most incongruous of places at times. After a while I began to wonder what immortal friend or pet from Cormac's past would suddenly show up next at an opportune moment.<br />After reading the book, I did not feel I had a good grasp of Manhattan's history, culture, or people. After following Cormac through 250+ years of Manhattan life I would have expected otherwise.	2003-01-28

Miriam Adahan reminds us of what we are often too quick to forget:  that every good or bad occurance in life has an  inherently holy purpose, and that we must trust that everything is positive  in some respect, even if we don't necessarily understand how.  For many,  the book isn't stating a new concept.  Regardless, even for these people,  the book is an excellent and convincing restatement/reminder!
