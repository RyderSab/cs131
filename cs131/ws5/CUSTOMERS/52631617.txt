Absurd situations, snappy one-liners, bizarre characters, and all kinds of other goodies abound in this book. I suppose it would be possible to get tired of seeing Stephanie Plum's car get destroyed, or watching the characters try to outdo each other in firepower, but in fact these have become trademarks, and I would be disappointed not to see them. Each new confrontation or car fire seems more hilarious than the last, like jokes that become funnier with each retelling.<br />Evanovich writes slapstick; I hate slapstick on the stage, but I love it on the page. &quot;Hot Six&quot; is so irresistible that I've had to share it, reading it aloud to my husband (with the door closed so that the children don't hear the language!). Do yourself and your funny bone a favor. Read this book and the five that precede it. You won't regret it, although you may notice a temporary increase in socially unacceptable words.	2001-01-26

In &quot;The Subtle Knife,&quot; Philip Pullman continues the adventures of Lyra Silvertongue, this time giving her a worthy partner in the form of Will Parry, a boy from our own universe. Will is easier to identify with than Lyra; not only is he from our world, but he also has a mother afflicted with obsessive-compulsive disorder and some paranoia, whom he has set himself to protect. The first chapter of this book has about as much action as the first hundred pages of &quot;The Golden Compass,&quot; so the reader is instantly ensnared. Scary, tension-filled, and highly significant acts take place in every chapter, and their import becomes clearer and clearer. In &quot;Compass&quot; the author was organizing his narrative universe, but here it is in full flower--there are no stage waits in this book. The reader can feel the convergence of many strands of the mystery of Dust, but can't quite see it yet, and the desire for answers impels the reading. The prose has a crystalline purity that is very seldom seen, and Pullman draws heavily on Miltonic materials that will resonate deeply with many adults.<br /> So much for reading the book. My seven-year-old and eight-year-old are, if anything, more enthralled by the tapes than I was by the text, and what is amazing to me is that they seem to grasp many of the motifs right off, and to understand where the story is going without in any sense feeling that it is boringly predictable. Clearly Pullman has written a book on many, many levels, perhaps one that should be reread every few years for additional meanings.	2000-10-17

Fabrizio, the adolescent servant of the convicted and banned magician Mangus (sic), invokes the Tarot at midnight and turns up Death, then is terrified by an ominous knock at the door. So far, so good. He and his master are taken to the Castello to use their forbidden magic to free the princess from a ghost so that she can be married off to the evil Count Scarazoni. Not bad. Fabrizio does a lot of wandering around the Castello, ostensibly in search of water, food, and information, but clearly the author was fascinated by the possibilities of endless secret passageways, doors, and staircases, and the description of these is the liveliest part of the book. Several meetings with the princess and discussions with Mangus lead to a plan of sorts, which is carried out successfully. I'm not a child, so perhaps I'm missing something here; but if I were a child, I don't think I'd be able to follow the plot, since I had trouble figuring it out as an adult. Reading this is better than reading, say, cereal boxes, but the author is not in control of his material. Give this one a miss unless you're a devotee of secret passageways.	2000-10-06

Jim Dale's reading of &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; is a pleasure to listen to. More than that, Dale's reading turns my  normally fighting/whining/yelling boys into models of good behavior when in  the car. Dale's voice is not the most beautiful in the world, and sometimes  the way he lengthens words (as when, say, Ron or Hermione begins a sentence  &quot;Harry&quot;) gets to be too much for me, but his timing and phrasing  are excellent. If anything, they add excitement to the book, something that  I, until now only impatiently a listener, would have believed impossible.  Although I hate to say it, the effect is downright magical. If you have to  drive often with children in the car, you could scarcely go wrong with  this.	2000-08-29

Loosely plotted, it's a good bedtime book, because each chapter or couple  of chapters presents a complete vignette. After all, you don't always want  to be reading a book that keeps you up till all hours! Life at Plumfield is  almost idyllic, with just enough conflict to keep things moving along. When  I was a child, I longed for a museum like theirs, and a miniature cast-iron  stove, and all kinds of things--the book was wonderful for my imagination.  N.B.: I tried reading it to my boys, and even though it's about boys, they  were bored, so it may be a girl book.	2000-08-06

The student historian Kivrin Engle wants to go to the Middle Ages, and  she's supported by a thwarted medievalist, Gilchrist, who finally gets his  hands on the power to send her there. Willis kills off quite a few  sympathetic characters, in the remorseless fashion of Renaissance tragedy.  Others survive, though changed by the action, in the best tradition of  comedy. In some ways it's frustrating to read, because almost all the  &quot;good&quot; characters are themselves terribly frustrated, but after  the first hundred pages this thing is almost impossible to put down. On the  21st century side there are a lot of light, even farcical, touches (for  example, the pressing need for &quot;lavatory paper,' and William Gaddson's  ability to attract any number of young women) that relieve some of the  inevitable grimness enjoined by the circumstances. I read this book,  despite its length, in a 24-hour period, and cannot get it out of my mind.  The detail is wonderful, the plots are wonderful, the morals strike deeply.  What a book!	2000-08-06

When Alvin and his friend Shoie discover an encoded message, they think they're on the trail of an international spy ring in their small town (the copyright date  on the book is 1963). WIth the help of Mr. Link, a former spy who is now an  invalid, they are able to decode the message, and Link teaches them about a  number of different codes. Alvin's and Shoie's characters are engaging,  their adventures exciting, and, best of all from my point of view, the book  has an appendix with a number of cryptological methods and messages for  children to play with. These are wonderful brain-stretchers, and they have  good practical applications even for children who don't particularly love  numbers.	2000-07-29

Burroughs's unique system of evolution, presented in &quot;The Land That Time Forgot&quot; trilogy, is as fascinating as it is improbable. In these novels he manages to combine shipwreck, World War I, Jurassic Park, three  rather unconvincing love stories, and a murder cult without even seeming to  break a sweat. There's plenty of action for anyone, and although the plot  doesn't really pull one along too well (hence the three stars), it's always  fun trying to figure out what he'll come up with next. Very un-politically  correct; one of my favorite places is in the second novel &quot;The People  That Time Forgot,&quot; when the hero discovers that he's beginning to  entertain softer feelings for what would be known back home in California  as--gasp--a squaw!  Times really do change. These novels are not as good as  &quot;Tarzan of the Apes,&quot; but the conceit of a lost continent with  strange beasts and people remains a good one, and the three novels, bound  together in this edition, make a coherent and enjoyable whole. And after  reading them, you can go rent the movies, as I'm planning to!	2000-07-15

After some pretty scary  adventures, she finds herself alone on a planet composed of a great  motherboard that just awaits programming, which she proceeds to give it.  Dairine recklessly creates a new species, attracting the attention of the  Lone Power, who comes to offer this species the choice between life and  death--and incidentally to get back at Kit and Nita, who are desperately  searching for Dairine. WIth a shock Dairine realizes her responsibilities  as creator, and attempts at almost mortal cost to save her creation from  the wrong choice. Duane's science fiction writing background shows the most  in this one, but at the same time she gives a not entirely implausible  rendering of what it must be like to be a young, untried god. I found this  third volume of her wizardry series not quite so compelling as the first   (&quot;So You Want to Be a Wizard&quot;), but more so than the second  (&quot;Deep Wizardry&quot;). Probably this means only that I like aliens  better than whales, so those who are similarly minded should take note! In  any case, all three books are excellent reads.	2000-07-07

Badly treated by the powers that be, he soon forms some unlikely alliances, with funny and happy results. Interesting for the cat's literal acceptance of proverbial expressions (helpful to young  readers who themselves may not understand them) and his maintenance of some  of his feline characteristics. Tudbelly is by far the most interesting  character in my opinion, and any parent who can explain his fractured Latin  to children will be adding to the experience of reading the book.	2000-07-06

To this end they must not  only transform themselves into whales, but must also manage to avoid Nita's  parents without lying, because a wizard dares not lie. In this second  volume of the wizardry series, the wizards' need for freedom in their  struggle mirrors most adolescents' need for freedom, but with this  difference: Nita and Kit know why they need their freedom and what they're  going to do with it, a knowledge that justifies their and, by extension,  all adolescents' struggle for freedom.  On the simple wizardry front,  this book is a great deal easier to follow than &quot;So You Want to Be a  Wizard,&quot; and it fills out many details that were only adumbrated in  that book. From my adult perspective, that ease, combined with the  adolescent issues, made it a bit less enthralling than the first book, but  I suspect that the flaw is in me and not in the book. I certainly never  considered not finishing the book.  Wizardry as Duane construes it  requires good character, discipline, perseverance, and also not a little  scientific ability (as when all the ocean-going participants need to figure  out how much air they will need for their trip). The wizards set good  examples while doing really cool things, a fantastic combination.  My  favorite character was the shark. Like Milton's Satan, he really steals the  show.	2000-06-29

If you're struggling with Goethe or Thomas Mann, you need  something that will show you that German can be fun to read, and this book  will do the trick nicely. I suppose once could carp at a few things here  and there, but this translation is so superior to the French translation  that I wouldn't waste my time doing that, except to mention that Hermione's  name has for some reason been changed to Hermine.

The prose is awful, stilted, and breaks into inappropriate italics in unexpected places, making for odd emphases. Also, the villages  all sound the same from the descriptions. <br />And here's the good part: This  book refers to villages that you will find nowhere else (at least not in  English), including the excellent Michelin Green Guide for the region. Many  of these villages are wonderful gems, tucked away where most will never  find them, and there are references to further villages within many of the  main descriptions. A number of these are ruined and require some hiking to  get to. Finding one adds that certain something to your vacation that will  distinguish it from more mundane vacations.

For one thing, there's a real, live,  gross but pathetic villain; not everyone is nice. Questions of corruption  and bribery arise, as do those of the death of a parent, retribution, and  race relations (this last in a rather casual but good manner). The boy's  training for his free throw is a great example of discipline, and the  dismissal of rap as an art form will please many parents. Without drowning  anyone in Dostoevskian depths, the book still offers its young readers a  pretty fair amount of stuff to chew on, and will stretch their brains  without their even noticing.	2000-05-31

Nita, of course, with her newfound friend  Kit (Christopher), also a novice wizard, goes much further than just  finding the book: she's able to do the spells in it, too. The pair is soon  involved in a classic test that involves outwitting the prince of evil  himself.<br />I read the 350+ pages of this book in a single sitting, and I  know I didn't take it all in. It's satisfying at the Harry Potter level,  with spells and whatnot, and also at the C. S. Lewis or Charles Williams  level, where eschatological catastrophe looms. I'm waiting with great  impatience for my eight-year-old to finish the book so that I can reread  it. The plot is probably too complex for an eight-year-old, but the details  keep his head firmly in the book. The author's inclusion of both a boy and  a girl as protagonists helps the book to escape gender stereotyping, and  the fact that they have separate strengths and must work together is good  for role modeling.	2000-05-26

Whether the new images will be comfortable or not is another question. In some ways Williams's picture of heaven is, if  anything, more frightening than the conventional depiction of hell. It's  certainly considerably more compelling. His dead protagonist was one scared  woman--and so was I, for most of the novel. In &quot;All Hallows' Eve&quot;  Williams gives his eschatological images expression in their leanest,  purest form, mingled with other terrific and similarly life-threatening  images of the war that was then engulfing the world.

Two caveats in using  the book with children: (1) average lifespans are given for each breed, but  nowhere is it said that these are just averages (our children think of  these numbers as gospel); and (2) the helpful charts giving each breed's  relative needs in exercise, food, grooming, and house space, rated from 1  (lowest) to 4 (highest) make children think that a dog with a 4 in, say,  food, needs to be fed four times a day! These are minor issues, but because  of the book's small size and convenient handling, it is especially  attractive to children, so it is worth mentioning them. Overall this is a  lovely little book and a great introduction to breeds.	2000-05-24

All the &quot;Mr. Putter  and Tabby&quot; books are good, but this one has an internal narrative  power that the others sometimes lack. In effect this is a story of mutual  redemption, with a happy ending but (for adults) a poignant aftertaste.	2000-05-24

Unfortunately this is  not a book  that most parents are going to enjoy reading again and again,  and pedagogically speaking, it would have been nice if the rest of the  alphabet had crowded around to help in the birthday celebration. But it's  not a bad story for the younger age bracket, and the conceit of using the  letters is a pleasant one.	2000-05-24

Unabridged it runs seven volumes, and it deals largely with issues of sexual morality that are incomprehensible in  modern terms. But don't underestimate the book's power: Even though you may  want to slap Clarissa, her idiotic relatives, and everyone else in the  novel, if you persevere, the book lures you deeper and deeper into an  anatomy of despair. You may not want to go there, but you will be unable to  resist the fascination of the underlying horror delineated in this  outwardly stiff and punctilious work.	2000-05-24

It demands that you reach out and touch it, turn the pages, and look, over and over again. Each page has so much visual material that it will take a long time before this book becomes too familiar. You're  not necessarily going to catch the diaper on the baby robot the first or  second time through, but these touches make it wonderful for children  whether they can read or not. In fact, the main problem in reading it aloud  is getting them to let you turn the page. I would recommend this book for  any child. Two minor caveats: The story is not up to the illustrations, but  very few stories could be, and it's enough to give the illustrations  meaning;  and one page has white text superimposed on a full-page  illustration, which makes for hard reading, especially in less than perfect  light.	2000-05-22

Dahl's superb imagination has created a character, the BFG, who talks so whimsically and winsomely that I laughed out loud while reading this book. His child friend, Sophie, has no trouble understanding him, however,  although she sometimes has to translate for less flexible or more pompous  adults. The BFG's interactions with his fearsome peers demonstrate a high  level of courage, particularly for a comic figure, and his nighttime  activities indicate a delicacy of perception that few of us could attain.  This is no two-dimensional character, but a real person that one would like  to meet. The only fault I have to find with the book is that Sophie's  strategy works too flawlessly, leaving no loose ends, no monsters at large  who need to be chased. The relaxation of dramatic tension is complete. But  then, I'm an adult; children who look under their beds each night would  certainly prefer Dahl's ending. When I started reading this to my children,  my first-grader, not an eager reader, could not bear to have me stop at the  end of a chapter, and actually went on to read the next by himself.  Parents, take note!	2000-05-22
US	52631617	R2PZWCSIGRNKC6	0590475975	99010119	The Bull and the Fire Truck	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Clever plot motivation	It's a well-known fact (or legend) that bulls hate red, but why? The author gives a semi-plausible reason for one particular bull's dislike of the color and expands it into a pretty funny story. The text has enough  repetition to give beginning readers a rest between assaults on harder  words and phrases, and the pictures provide excellent visual clues for  beginning reading strategies. For the adult working with the beginning  reader, it's heavy going, though, because it lacks those little barbs of  adult wit that make other stories stand out. Definitely not a book to read  to a child; rather, a book for the child to read to you.	2000-05-22
US	52631617	R26VTT8DU151ZY	0440414326	813275519	Off and Running	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Enjoyable, but lacks convincing suspense	&quot;Off and Running&quot; is a quick read with pleasant characters and vignettes, but although the central event--the election for student body president--should quicken the pulse, it fails to. Everyone is just too nice. Miata, the very serious girl, is portrayed fairly realistically, as  are her modest goals if she should be elected (sprucing up the school,  creating a &quot;lake of flowers&quot; around it). Her opponent, Rudy, is a  buffoon, but not a nasty one, which is not so realistic. No one gets hurt  very much, and there are no hard feelings, which, given the intensity of  children's emotions, is a little hard to believe. If only it were so  simple!  Of particular interest is Miata's desire to connect to older,  successful politicians, to learn from them.<br />No child will have nightmares  from having read this book, and it's possible that it might inspire a  little desirable imitation. It's not demanding and will help children  maintain reading skills during the summer.	2000-05-17

Without our Michelin guide, we would have very  little sense of the context of the tiny hill towns we visit; with it we not  only have that sense, but we have also transmitted more about the history  of this region of France to our children than they know about the United  States. But it's not just history and art history. Excellent directions to  scores of wonderful sites, hiking trails, warnings about towns that have  few (or in some cases no) places to eat, surprisingly accurate information  about seasonal openings and closings, hours, and admissions, and  cross-references to Michelin maps make this little book indispensable.  Sites are starred very conservatively--a one-star site is definitely worth  a detour--and the times given for looking around are realistic. Even the  index is decent. Caution: the type is somewhat small.	2000-05-10

Most readers will never have heard of any of them, but they occupy a far-flung territory from Easter Island to Australia. Many are dying out; Lynch gives figures for the number of speakers of some  languages, and these are a real revelation to those of us who speak English. Fifty speakers? Astonishing. Six speakers? How can this be? Lynch lives in Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides), and his dicussion of Bislama-the creole that the native French and English speakers of those islands use with each other in preference to either English or French-is particularly interesting. In general the linguistic diversity of the region is mind-boggling. As the only book ever to attempt such a survey, this must rate five stars, and I doubt that anyone would ever be able to do a better job.	1998-06-27
