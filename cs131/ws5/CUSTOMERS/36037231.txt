In conjunction with the British journalist and former Times correspondent J.O.P Bland, he had authored two best selling books about the Chinese Royal Court at the Forbidden City, Peking (now Beijing).  Backhouse, by the time of his death, had lived in China for nearly 40 years.  The high esteem in which he had been held by students and scholars of Chinese history collapsed upon publication of this book by Hugh Trevor-Roper (HTR).  Trevor-Roper of course is the esteemed British historian and author of the classic \\"The Last Days of Hitler\\".  The \\"Hermit of Peking\\" is the first full biography of one of history's greatest scam artists, Sir Edmund Backhouse.  The pinnacle of Backhouse's achievements, the publication of \\"China under the Empress Dowager\\" in 1910, was found to be based on a forgery, one of many forgeries as it transpires, perpetuated by Backhouse, the ramifications of which continue to this day. <br /> <br />I first read of Backhouse in Diana Preston's book \\"The Boxer Rebellion\\", (a modern account of the siege of the Peking legations in 1900 by the Chinese Boxers) and again in Sterling Seagrave's \\"Dragon Lady\\", a revisionist biography of Tzu His, the Dowager Empress.  Both authors are not charitable about Backhouse, and both give a potted biography of the man, particularly in Seagrave's book.  In fact, Seagrave is particularly scathing and rightly so.  As a direct consequence of Backhouse's forgery of a diary supposedly by a high Manchu court official, and subsequent book publications based upon the diary, popular history regards the Dowager Empress as an evil, scheming, and manipulative woman, who went as far as having her own son murdered to maintain her grip on the regency of China.   <br /> <br />The \\"Hermit of Peking\\" gives a much fuller account of the life of Backhouse, and fills in more detail about the numerous frauds that Backhouse tried pull off.  Not only was Bland as co-author of \\"China under the Empress Dowager\\" a victim (Bland believed until his death that the diary could not have been a forgery) of Backhouse's fraudulent activities, but also G. Morrison, the renown Times Correspondent.  Even Oxford University and the British Government were taken in as HTR gleefully relates.  It is amazing that Backhouse got away with what he did without the greater world being aware of it, but HTR shows the reader how he did so (Backhouse's victim's embarrassment was one reason).  In part, \\"The Hermit of Peking\\" is a detective story as HTR pulls the threads of this tale together, sorts fact from the many fictions.  It is well written, and only in the final chapters does HTR delve into the literary pornography for which Backhouse is now famous for, and HTR does so with taste, sparing the reader the graphic details (Seagrave doesn't spare though).  Trevor-Roper relied on a number of sources, which in the main is the private correspondence of Bland and Morrison.  The author also had access to the archives of the Foreign Office and of one of Backhouse's former employers.  And of course, HTR uses Backhouse's own writings to point out historical contradictions and fabrications which can be verified with certainty.    <br /> <br />If there is a quibble with the book, it is that HTR doesn't dwell on the historical consequences of Backhouse's frauds and how it contributes to a long and widely held misconception of the final days of the Chinese Royal Court, the role which Tzu His played in it.  Many histories of China have relied on the writings of Backhouse as a historical source and reference, thus perpetuating the popular myth of the Dowager Empress as a ruthless leader of her people.  At times HTR is typically given to eloquent turns of phrase, making reading a little slow at times.  None the less, \\"The Hermit of Peking\\" is a stirring read, and despite its age, should be viewed as a companion to the much more recent \\"Dragon Lady\\" by Sterling Seagrave to flesh out one of the main characters of early 20th century Peking. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

The occupations of the people whose stories are relayed in this volume are varied, and range from those working as office workers, those who are students or who are serving in the US military, and of course those working as the obligatory ESL teacher.  The nationalities are as diverse as the occupations - as well as people of Korean descent, there are also Americans, Japanese, Filipinos, and New Zealanders, all of whom have interesting stories to tell about various aspects of their lives in Korea. <br /> <br />The book is split into 6 main sections, each dealing with a particular general aspect of life in Korea. One section is about working in Korea, another discusses social relations in Korea.  People of Korean descent share their experiences in one section, and students in Korea get another section.  A particularly interesting section is dedicated to those people who have formally made Korea their home, including one white US male who renounced his American citizenship to become a Korea.  The final section, which I suspect will be the cause of most people's interest in this book is teaching in Korea.  This is hardly surprising since ESL teaching is a relatively high profile and popular occupation for many young foreigners in Korea. <br /> <br />All but one of the contributors to the teaching section have taught in Hagwons, the most common employer of ESL teachers in Korea.  The sole exception was the contributor who had only taught as an university instructor, although a number of the Hagwon teachers also went on to teach at a university - again hardly surprising, since it is quite a popular gig, usually teaching 15 hours or so a week, for nearly twice the pay of a Hagwon teacher.  This section will be of most use to those readers who plan on teaching in Korea, as a number of the contributors discuss the common pitfalls for a novice in this field, and tips to help get by.  This isn't to say the other sections aren't of interest.  Many of the contributors give interesting insights into life, love, work and play in the Land of the Morning Calm.  Recommended reading for those wanting insights into life in modern Korea, as well as those considering teaching in Korea. <br /> <br />    <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-10-10
US	36037231	R39QV96DTZPHFB	1550025236	409665833	The Arctic Fox: Francis Leopold-McClintock, Discoverer of the Fate of Franklin	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Recommended for those who enjoyed Barrow's Boys	Leopold McClintock is one of many British Naval explorers of the Victorian era, a period which seems to becoming increasingly popular with historians.  In exploration terms, Fergus Fleming started the recent trend with his book \\"Barrow's Boys\\", which for me popularized Arctic and Antarctic exploration of the Victorian era.  The Arctic Fox is another excellent addition to the growing library of historical accounts of the pioneers of Arctic and Antarctic exploration.  The author, David Murphy, is an Irish historian with an interest in British Naval and Polar explorers, and thus it is only fitting that he write this biography of McClintock, an Irishman.  To do so he draws upon British Naval Reports of expeditions in which McClintock was a participant.  He also uses McClintock's own writings, which include expedition reports, and letters to Lady Franklin.  Contemporary sources are also referred to. <br /> <br />The Arctic Fox is not a particularly lengthy book, numbering fewer than 200 pages, so readers will quickly run through this book in a couple of solid afternoon reading sessions.  The brevity of the book is also partly explained by the fact that McClintock's claim to fame stemmed largely from (as the subtitle of the book suggests) being \\"The discoverer of the fate of Franklin\\".  Prior to this, he had not enjoyed quite the same profile as other British Naval officers serving on expeditions to the North, such as Ross (leader of the first expedition to try and find Franklin in 1848, and under whom McClintock served), Back, and Parry.   <br /> <br />The main focus of the book is on those expeditions mounted by the British admiralty and later by Lady Franklin to try and find survivors or determine the fate of Franklin's ill-fated expedition.  In fact, the subtitle of the book is a little misleading, as it was John Rae who really determined the probable nature of the demise of Franklin's expedition, much to the displeasure of Lady Franklin. McClintock merely confirmed the suspicions of Rae by finding human remains in 1859, which Rae had failed to do.  There is more discussion of this in the final chapter of The Arctic Fox.  McClintock certainly made the most of his opportunity in the public eye following the successful expedition, writing numerous accounts of his exploits, with the British public clamoring for Arctic heroes.  However, the book does discuss McClintock's life, both his younger years, and touches briefly on his post arctic career. <br /> <br />Although there are no glossy pictorial plates, there are numerous black and white illustrations throughout the book.  The Arctic Fox is an easy read, and I would recommend it to anyone who had enjoyed \\"Barrow's Boys\\".    <br />	2005-10-02

I was pleasantly surprised at just how good the Insight guide was. <br /> <br />Illustrated in full colour throughout, the book gives the usual history of the capital of China, as well as sight details of all the major sights in Beijing and the surrounding vicinity, including of course the Ming Tombs and the Great Wall. However, I don't think the book lists quite as much activities and sights as the LP book, but for short term visitors I don't think this would be much of a problem.  Usually when travelling I struggle to do even a quarter of the activities and sights that are listed in guidebooks.  I note that the maps are quite good, a little better for detail than the maps found in the LP book. <br /> <br />In a neat touch, it also includes a seperate map of resturants in a little pocket on the inside back cover.  Structurally, the book is very sound, with a good tough binding to cope with the usual rough treatment that travel accords guidebooks.  It even has a piece of cardboard designed to fit around the pocket holding the resturant map on the inside back cover.  <br /> <br />This guide is recommended as an alternative to the Lonely Planet book - it helps that this edition of the Insight guide is 6 months newer, and a little cheaper, than the equivalent LP edition for those you note such things.  But guidebooks are out of date the moment they get printed, particularly for a city such as Beijing which is rapidly developing for the Olympics in 2008.   <br /> <br />If you are planning to visit Beijing in the next few months, be aware that a lot of the major sights such as the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven are under restoration (for the Olympics), with scaffolding to be found in abundance.  Some portions of the Forbidden City were closed off when I visited in July.	2005-09-02

There are inserts of colour photography for those of you so inclined.  The Language section is OK, and chinese is used on the maps to assist you when dealing with taxi/bus drivers. <br /> <br />Generally speaking, the LP Beijing City Guide will do the job for short term visitors to the city, and these short term visitors are the target audience for these books.  Those staying long term as ESL teachers or in other capacities will find it lacking after a while, but there is only so much you can squeeze into these books anyway. <br /> <br />Just a note to those planning on visiting the city in the next few months.  A lot of the major sights, such as the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, are under restoration as part of the city's preparation for the 2008 Olympics (see the Olympic countdown clock outside the main entrance of the Museum of Chinese History), with scaffolding and workmen all over the show.  You can still get into these places, but may not be able to see all the sights mentioned in the guidebook.  But be sure to get a photo of the Starbucks which is slap bang in the middle of this historic city.  Commercialism at its finest...  <br /> <br />I'm normally a devoted LP customer, but I have to admit to making an impulse decision to purchase the Insight City Guide to Beijing.  I found the Insight guide to be almost as good, particularly where maps are concerned.  The Insight guide was also cheaper than the LP book, although I think the LP listed more activities.  For me though, Lonely Planet still sets the standard for Travel Guides.	2005-09-02
US	36037231	R1U1UENGRFDJW8	0060934433	657007054	In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo	Books	5	4	5	N	N	So surreal it's almost unreal - an excellent account of Mobutu's Congo	President Mobutu, former president (dictator) of the Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) was the prototype African dictator (albeit without the bloodlust of other famous African dictators) squandering the natural resources of a rich and fertile country, and pillaging the country's revenues for his own ends.  In the Footsteps of Mr Kurtz is  Michala Wrong's (a journalist who has spent a lot of time in Africa) account of Mobotu's Congo, what happened to the country, and its future.    Wrong meets several of Zaire's citizens, ranging from disabled merchants in Kinshasa to European farmers, and relates their stories through vivid written portraits, and the impact of Mobotu's legacy of greed and corruption on their lives.  Time and time again, I was astounded at the stupidity and greed of the vast excesses of the man and his cronies.   Although he constantly changed ministers (usually once or twice a year), such was the mindset of the replacements, that they would immediately set out and pillage what they could while they could.  Vehicles, properties, office furniture quickly disappeared with each new minister.  It is a marvel that he managed to stay in power for as long as he did, but as Wrong discovers, Mobutu did have a lot of charisma in his day - and managed to starve off a number of attempts to wrest power from him.  His family, cronies, and Zaire's bank accounts were key to that.  Just the same as Joseph Conrad's key character Mr Kurtz in The Heart of Darkness, Mobutu, once an idealistic leader, was corrupted by the dark heart of Africa.    But it was not just Mobutu to blame for the state of the country; Wrong points a finger at the Western governments, who continued to bankroll the president at a time when Communist and Western Governments were seeking influence in Africa - Mobutu superbly playing the Western and Communist governments against each other, in attempt to get as much money out of them as possible.  The US won the day, and continued to pour money intothe country, knowing that Mobutu was skimming it.  But with the fall of the Communist states, the funds dried up, and Mobutu pillaged his own country even further, leaving his own people to face the burden for his excesses and vanity projects.  Wrong visits Mobutu's old palace retreat and discusses the fittings and finishing's of the palace, which has fallen in shambles after it was looted when his government fell.  Another of the vanity projects, a nuclear reactor, is in a dangerously run down state and may well provoke a nuclear crisis in the country.       However, I note the recent G8 summit (June/July 2005) made inroads into the consideration of writing off debt to impoverished countries of the world - but Congo probably won't benefit until the Congolese Government makes changes.  Although Mobutu is long gone, the Government which overthrew him is little better at helping its people.  The future appears to be bleak for the millions of the Congo.    In the Footsteps of Mr Kurtz is a readable account of the excesses of a single man, and the impact it had on his country.  This is recommended reading if you are interested in modern and colonial Africa.	2005-08-25

Korea is a fascinating country, full of contrasts that can delight or infuriate a foreigner.  I definitely fall in the former group.  I lived in Gumi, north of Daegu, for a year in 2001/2002 working as an ESL teacher.  US military personnel aside, probably the majority of foreigners in Korea find themselves in this profession.  I didn't read this book until well after I left, and I wish I had read it before I went to Korea in the first place.  Anyone who has lived in Korea for any length of time (the author, Michael Breen, has lived in Seoul for many years) will find themselves nodding in agreement with many of Breen's experiences, and his explanation of them.  Amongst other things Breen talks about the drinking habits, queue jumping, and the very bad driving that prevails the country, in a humorous and informative manner.  He also discusses the conglomerates, the \\"company life\\" and the all important concept of saving face, in a country steeped in Confucian values.  The love he has for his adopted country shines through the written text. <br /> <br />As well as serving as a social commentary on Korea, The Koreans also acts as a potted history of this turbulent county, which it needs to be to explain the Korean psyche.  Korea has risen from a predominantly agricultural society at the time of the Korean War, to a modern day superpower, at the forefront of technological innovation.  The Koreans discusses the rise of Korea from the ashes of the war to the bustling powerhouse it is today.  It doesn't neglect more ancient history if it relates to a key discussion point - for example, Breen discusses the creation of the Hangul alphabet, a system of writing formed hundreds of years ago by a Korean king, which has ensured that the literacy rates of the general population are well above the world average.  It is surprising just how much pride Koreans take in their written language even today.  However, it has to be said that \\"The Koreans\\" is no substitute for a proper history of the country - try \\"The Two Koreas\\" if that is your interest.  <br /> <br />First published in 1999, The Koreans has been updated to take into account some of the key developments on the Korean peninsular, particularly the ever so slightly warming of the South Korea/North Korea relationship, with South Korean conglomerates beginning to invest in North Korean ventures (although the more cynical of observers speculate this has more to do with a North Korean need for cash in its cash strapped economy than a genuine desire for reconciliation).  The South Korean/North Korean relationship is debated at some length.  Another key development since the first edition was of course the joint staging with Japan of the 2002 FIFA Football (Soccer) World Cup.  The fervent passion shown by the Koreans, many of whom will have never shown any interest in the sport, helped propel their national team the Red Devils into a World Cup semi-final showdown with Germany, which they sadly lost.  The whole month of June 2002, while the tournament absorbed the whole of Korea, is probably my personal highlight of my time in Korea.  I recall vividly cheering on Korea in the round of 16 match against Italy amongst several Koreans gathered around a TV setup outside a 24/7 shop whilst eating watermelons that a seller passed around. <br /> <br />If you want to learn anything about Korea, this should be your first port of call.  I particularly recommend it to all those seeking jobs in Korea as prospective ESL teachers as it will help your understanding in dealing with the people, but anyone intending to stay a while will get just as much out of it. <br />	2005-08-25

This is what I have found about the previous books I have read by this author, Barrow's Boys and 90 Degrees North.  However, this time, Fleming's knack for snagging me as a reader and pulling me into the story has deserted him.  The Sword and the Cross, which should have been a riveting tale of Saharan exploration, ended up being dull and listless, and it was a relief to finally finish the book.<br /><br />The Sword and the Cross is nominally about two Frenchmen - Henri Laperrine, a career soldier, and Viscomte Charles de Foucald, once a Parisian layabout, but now a fanatical monk, having divested himself of all his world possessions and trappings, both men forging reputations in the Algerian desert.  The backdrop to the tale of these two characters is set against the French colonization of Algeria, which later fell apart in the 1950s as Algeria sought independence from its French masters.<br /><br />It is an interesting premise to contrast the differing motivations behind the lead characters.  Laperrine is a dedicated military man, who established a French Camel Corp to combat the native Taureg raiders in the desert.  Foucald tried to spread Christianity through his wanderings of the desert, although he was remarkably unsuccessful, attracting only one member to his harsh order.  Together, each man played significant roles in establishing the French colony, Foucald as a spy who provided intelligence on the leading Arab personalities, and Laperrine as the enforcer and soldier.<br /><br />Part of the problem for me with the book is that Foucald, as revealed through his writings and subsequent events, is actually a rather unpleasant character, given to constant bouts of moaning.  It is extremely difficult to empathize with him through his self inflicted hardships.  The enduring perception of the man is that it seems that he was closer to lunacy than to God.  Not much is revealed about Laperrine as an individual, as there is nowhere as much literature about him as there is about Foucald. Another niggly aspect is the lack of plates in the book - although there are portraits of Foucald and Laperrine on the endpapers, there are no other photographic images provided which is a shame.  There are a couple of maps for the reader covering the regions traveled.<br /><br />Whether it is the story itself, the characters (which I feel is the main failing), or the writing, The Cross and the Sword unfortunately does not capture and enthrall the reader in the same manner as Fleming's past books have.  Despite this, the book is a useful addition to the history and exploration of Northen Africa.  If you are interested in this subject, then you may still find The Cross and the Sword worthwhile reading.  But if you are looking for an enjoyable and interesting story of human challenge and endurance, this is not it.ms that he was closer to lunacy than to God.

History of the Grand Prix Car is no exception.  Nye discusses all the teams which entered the Formula One championship trail from 1966 to 1991 (the original edition of this book covered 1966 to 1985).   <br /> <br />He naturally writes about the Grand Prix cars themselves, their successes or failures, but also sets up the story behind their design, as well the drivers behind the wheel and the managers who ran the team.  At times, it is real nuts and bolts affair, but Nye adds a humourous touch to his writing.   <br /> <br />The first several chapters are based upon the development and racing history of particularly successful Grand Prix cars, from the Lotus 49 to the Tyrell 003 to the Ferrari turbos of 1982-83 to the successful lowline McLaren MP4/4 and the first non-turbo championship winning car in 6 years, the MP4/5.  The development of the Cosworth DFV also gets a chapter. <br /> <br />The following chapters are then a potted history of all the teams that have entered Formula One since 1966.  Although the England based teams or successful teams (eg BRM, McLaren, Brabham, Ferrari) has the most coverage, what sets this book apart is the amount of detail provided about the minnows of the sport, particularly those not based in England, such as ATS and Zakspeed.  Nye has a particular fondness for the English \\"garagistes\\" such as LEC or Connew, which does shine through in his discussion of those teams. I should also note that there is also an appendix of F1 results for the period which the book discusses.   <br /> <br />A true gem of a book, which will be picked up and perused for many years to come.  It is so easy to just pick it up, and start reading from any random page.  Highly recommended for serious history of F1 buffs.	2005-08-20
US	36037231	RJ1Z0E4PL8QKG	0470821310	59969277	Kim Jong-Il: North Korea's Dear Leader	Books	4	11	11	N	Y	Entertaining reading but not particularly insightful	Michael Breen is well qualified to write about the Korean peninsular, having lived in Seoul for many years, and visiting North Korea several times.  Although no scholar (he is a former journalist) Breen is also the author of \\"The Koreans - Who they are, what they want, where their future lies\\", an excellent commentary on South Korea. <br /> <br />Access to NK is well controlled, and highly fettered; much of Breen's book is based on testimony of NK defectors to the South and conversations with other visitors to the state.  Breen has never interviewed the Dear Leader, (although he did meet the Great Leader and relates that he felt that the GL must have been struggling with flatulence!) journalists, especially foreign journalists, being treated with suspicion in North Korea. So in this respect, there is nothing really substantial to the book, and Breen has merely gathered and compiled a series of anecdotes and known facts about the Dear Leader, and added his interpretation of the man.  However, I would stress that the lack of hard facts reflect more on the subject of the book, than the author: Breen literally does not have much to work with.  <br /> <br />Breen discusses Kim Jong-il's early upbringing, quoting from school reports supposedly cited in official books about the Dear Leader.  What rapidly comes through from the quotes that Breen uses, much (or all) of the state's writings about its leader smacks of brownnosing and trying to put a positive spin on events.  <br /> <br />The section about Kim Jong-il's adult life is much more based on hearsay - as Breen acknowledges, there are large sections of the Dear Leader's life about which very little is known.  It is known that Kim Jong-il integrated himself to his father, although always remaining in the background, even for a time after his father's death in 1994.  Even then, Kim Jong-il did not take his father's title as the Great Leader, instead preferring to use the Dear Leader, playing the dutiful son to the end.<br /> <br />As well as relying to an extent on hearsay, Breen also uses the Communist state's own writings - it transpires that the Dear Leader is quite a prodigious author.  Although the Dear Leader probably didn't intend it that way, considerable mirth can be found in his works which are quoted by Breen, which cover topics such as movie making (Kim Jong-il is such a movie buff, that as Breen relates, he organized the kidnapping of a prominent South Korean director and his actress ex-wife) and journalism.  Breen does at times go overboard in ridiculing the Dear Leader - comments about the \\"big hair\\" are rife throughout the book.   <br /> <br />\\"Kim Jong-il: North Korea's Dear Leader\\" is not just a biography, but is also a commentary about North Korea, and how the population and military accepts his, and his father's, leadership of the country despite the dire state in which the average North Korean citizen lives.  Despite numerous famines, and despite (or because of) the majority of North Korea's resources being channeled towards the military, the Dear Leader continues to have a firm grip on power.  However, there are encouraging signs of increasing warmth towards the South, particularly as South Korea continue to increase their investments in North Korea, although this could be seen as a cynical move, giving the need for cold hard cash in this cash strapped country. <br /> <br />Although not a substantial book, and light on hard facts (through no fault of the author), I would still recommend this book for those interested in North Korea and its leader, especially for those who shy away from the heavier, drier books out there. <br />	2005-08-18

Dragon Lady is a biography of the Last Empress of China, Tzu His.  In a highly readable fashion, Seagrave debunks the popular history of Tzu Hsi as a highly sexed, manipulative and ruthless woman.  Instead, Seagrave portrays the Dowager Empress as a mere tool, being manipulated by powerful Manchu Princes and other figures behind the throne of the China for their own ends.<br /><br />The general and popular view of Tzu Hsi has its origins in reportings and books by JOP Bland and Sir Edmund Backhouse.  In particular, Backhouse, in the late 19th and early 20th century presented himself as an expert in Chinese Royalty, with particularly close ties to the throne.  Of course, Backhouse has long been exposed (since 1974) as a historical fraud, but this has not changed the general and traditional view of Tzu Hsi as being a particularly ruthless and unpleasant character in Chinese history.  In fact, in my recent trip to Beijing (formerly Peking) last month, as I toured the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace, my tour guide during her narration of the sights mentioned several \\"facts\\" about the Empress and her activities which have been debunked by Seagrave as lies and fabrications from the pen of Backhouse.<br /><br />Seagrave easily and deftly fills in the background to the history of China in the 18th and 19th century leading up to Tzu Hsi acceding to the throne as Regent, at the time of an increasing foreign interest in China.  Characters are vividly sketched out, ranging from the perceptive Prince Kung, the Empress's brother-in-law who played a significant role in shaping the direction of China for the first decade of Tzu Hsi's rule to Viceroy Li, reputedly at one time China's wealthiest man to the stirrer and malcontent Kang, who played a key role in establishing a negative perception of the Empress in the eye's of the Western world, a perception which many hold to today.  Dragon Lady is as much the tale of the myths and legend makers of Tzu Hsi as Tzu Hsi herself, and how they (Backhouse in particular) achieved what they did.<br /><br />Dragon Lady is recommended for those interested in Chinese history, particularly the 19th and early 20th century, and the characters, both Chinese and foreign that played key roles in the downfall of the last Chinese dynasty.  Dragon Lady draws upon many sources, some of which is Chinese.  As discussed by Seagrave, popular histories of China by Western authors have tended to rely directly on the writings of Backhouse, or rely on books which relied on Backhouse for source material.  By avoiding these, Seagrave manages to achieve a much more interesting, and balanced, account of a fascinating period in Chinese history.ablishing a negative perception of the Empress in the eye's of the Western world, a perception which many hold to today.

US	36037231	R2PENIIWKHZ660	185960837X	961943363	Emerson Fittipaldi  Heart of a Racer	Books	3	4	4	N	Y	Decidely Average	Karl Ludvigsen is a well known journalist and motorsport historian who has written a number of motorsport themed books, including Formula One, Indycar and marque histories.  Heart of a Racer is part of a series on notable F1 drivers - other driver biographies in the series include Jackie Stewart, Bruce McLaren, Dan Gurney, and Alberto Ascari. <br /> <br />While being very well presented on glossy paper with a lot of black & white images, Heart of a Racer lacks substance.  As the previous reviewer, M. L. Rosen, has noted, Ludvigsen regards Emerson as a personal friend.  However, there don't appear to be any interviews with Emerson specifically for the book - published in 2002.  All the quotations that Ludvigsen attribute to conversations with Fittipaldi appear to date back to interviews for articles published in the early to late 70's. <br /> <br />The coverage of Fittipaldi's racing career is broken down into sections - his Lotus years, the McLaren years, and the Fittipaldi years in formula one is largely glossed over in a few pages per section - there are more pages dedicated to photography in section than text.  Some of the photos aren't fantastic in quality either.  Apart from the opening chapter, which details the attempts at the Indy 500 over the years, there is only one other chapter which covers Emerson's Indycar career, which spanned 12 or so seasons. I was disappointed that there was not more material about Emmo's relationships with his teammates and competitors.  The rivalry with Ronnie Peterson as a Lotus teammate is only slightly touched on here.  And the story of Fittipaldi, the Formula One team, has really yet to be told - the chapter that relates to this period of Emerson's life is quite sketchy.  <br /> <br />By and large, I was disappointed with Heart of a Racer - it really is not much more than a coffee table book - mostly pictures and little substance.  Which is a real shame, as there are surely many interesting tales that Ludvigsen can relate about Emmo's time in motorsport.  Look elsewhere for the definite story of Emerson's motorsport career - a good place to start might be Gordon Kirby's book, \\"Emerson Fittipaldi\\" written in 1990, which is often referred to by Ludvigsen in his own text.   <br /> <br />	2005-04-17

For a start, the heroine is flawed with some mental and physical scars. Grey, the heroine, is obsessed with finding a film on which horrific footage of the Nanking massacres exist.  As we find out during the course of the book, for Grey this is a particularly personal quest.   <br /> <br />During her efforts to find and view the film, we are taken through 1990 Tokyo, with a well written cast.  Jason the weird guy, the Russian girls, the Chinese professor who witnessed the crimes perpetrated in Nanking, and a mysterious Japanese gangster and his \\"Nurse\\", although only a couple of these are sketched out in great detail. The author isn't afraid to leave certain elements and characters of the story relatively vague, which makes for a more mysterious and dark feel to the story. <br /> <br />\\"The Devil of Nanking\\" is very well written, the author brings to life both the bright lights of 1990 Tokyo (her own experiences of night clubs in Tokyo no doubt proved useful material to draw upon in the writing of this novel) as well as the desperate dark period of December 1937 in Nanking.  At the conclusion of the book, despite the revelation of what is revealed on the film (which I actually thought was fairly well signposted) Grey seeks and ultimately finds, you are left in an almost contemplative mood.  I haven't read many books that have left me like that.    <br /> <br />I don't normally read fiction, but I have developed a fascination with East Asia, having lived in Korea and visited both Japan and China, which attracted me to the book.  I was not disappointed.  The Devil of Nanking is defintely worth a read.  Highly recommended, especially if you like more unusual novels and settings.   <br /> <br />Postscript: If you are after some historical background information to the Nanking massacre, I recommend \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" by Iris Chang for a well written but controversial account (judging from the number of reviews for the book on Amazon) of the horrors that occurred in Nanking December 1937.	2005-03-28

As we well know, Ferrari took another 4 years after the period which this book covers to achieve the Drivers/Constructors double in 2000, having secured the Constructors title the previous year.  They have since gone on to dominate the sport in a fashion that few rivals could hope to match. <br /> <br />Alan Henry, the current Autocourse editor, is a prolific author with a tremendous output in the last 10 years or so.  Sadly some of his works, especially the more recent works, tend to lack substance. His earlier efforts were much more noteworthy.  \\"The Battle for Revival\\" doesn't quite fall into either category - by no means his best writing, \\"Battle for Revival\\" is not bad either.  It begins with Prost's championship challenge in 1990, and finishes with the San Marino Grand Prix of 1996, where Schumacher finished 2nd, and Irvine 4th. <br /> <br />Inbetween these, Henry discusses the trials, tribulations, and the fortunes of the Ferrari Grand Prix drivers of the early to mid nineties.  Henry also goes through the infrastructure changes that the Ferrari team went through at the time.  To go along with the text, the book is illustrated with colour photography throughout.  \\"Battle for Revival\\" is an OK read, if at times superficial.  Most of it could be gleaned from Autosport or Motorsport magazines at time and there is nothing particularly earth shattering here. I recommend it only if you are a Ferrari buff - if you are looking for the definitive team biography of Ferrari during the 90's this is not it.	2005-03-27
US	36037231	RCMSX41Q5HZ4P	1899870547	623969965	March: The Rise and Fall of Motor Racing	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	An excellent team biography	\\"March - The Rise and Fall of a Motor Racing Legend\\" is the expanded and updated edition of Mike Lawrence's original \\"The Story of March - 4 guys and a telephone\\", which was originally in 1989.  This update dates from 2001, and really only consists of an additional chapter which take into account the events after 1989 up to the winding up of March in 1994, plus a new introduction from Mike Lawrence.  Otherwise there appears to be little or no difference from \\"4 guys and a telephone\\". <br /> <br />The author gained unparalleled access to the archives of March, plus extensive interviews with all the key members of the team, and customers, including Max Mosely, Ron Tauranac, and John MacDonald to name just a few.  In the introduction, it is emphasized by the author, and Robin Herd who wrote the foreword, that this was to be a \\"warts and all\\" history of the team, with a focus on the people of March. Amusing ancedotes and stories are related all the way through the book, and I should point out the March story is not just about Formula One.  March were prolific manufacturers of chassis for the junior formulae F2, F3000 and F3, as well as for Indycar. The text is well illustrated throughout, with many black and white photographs, and there are also 2 inserts of colour photography. There is also a detailed appendix of results for March chassis, of which around 1500 were made - for the lower formulae the results are limited to race wins and top 6 in the championship due to the sheer number of chassis that were built.  By and large the appendix is formed from March's own chassis logbooks.  <br /> <br />If I was to have a gripe with the book, it would be the formatting of the text, which is arranged in 2 columns per page.  I have no idea why this is the case, and if the original \\"4 guys and a telephone\\" was formatted this way.  Despite this, the re-release of the book is to be credited - I note that prices for copies of \\"4 guys and a telephone\\", which is pretty scarce these days, are pretty steep. The price of this edition makes the story much more accessible to newer fans of the sport. I heartily recommend this book to all enthuasists of single seater motorsport.	2005-03-27
US	36037231	RDWGOGSU26YMG	0760304475	285864970	Ferrari: The Inside Story of the Battle for the Championship	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Well intentioned fluff piece for Ferrari	Jane Nottage secured unparalleled access to Ferrari and its team members to write this book, but that same high level access obviously placed huge constraints on what could be put to paper.  Unfortunately, this has reduced \\"The Passion and the Pain\\" to nothing more than a mere fluff piece for Ferrari, a rather askew view of the Ferrari Formula One team, from their own perspective.   <br /> <br />Despite this, \\"Passion and the Pain\\", the \\"authorized\\" story of Ferrari's 1997 season, is still a fascinating glimpse into the inner workings of one of Grand Prix racing's most famous and glamourous teams.  Even if diplomatic reasons dictate that, for example, Jerez 1997 is pretty much glossed over as a simple racing accident (the whole of the Jerez weekend only rates 1 and a half pages).      <br /> <br />The story begins with a foreword by Niki Lauda (briefly a consultant to the team), then a brief introduction to the racing history of Ferrari, before going on to relate the foundations of the modern Schumacher era.  Chapters 3 to 6 go over the fortunes of the 1996 season, Chapter 7 covers the winter break, before proceeding to the 1997 season from Chapter 8 to 15.  <br /> <br />Scattered throughout the chapters are sidebars of interesting tidbits relating to such things as catering to the Ferrari team, the logistics of getting team personnell to the races, and the manufacture of the race cars back at Fiorano.  There is quite a bit of content devoted to the mechanics (Nigel Stepney and \\"the boys\\" get a credit in the acknowledgements), and of course to the glory boys, Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine. <br /> <br />Despite the constraints of being an \\"authorized\\" story, Nottage does do a very good job of relating the day to day details of the workings of the team.  However, it must be kept in mind that the book is very uncritical of the team, with the focus being to deliver the story of the 1996 and 1997 season from the viewpoint of the race team.  \\"The Passion and the Pain\\" is still a worthwhile look, particularly if you are a Ferrari fan or you are interested in the inner workings of a top flight Formula One team.	2005-03-26

It is also one of Alan Henry's better works, much better than the more recent team and driver biographies which tend to be very superficial. <br /> <br />With a foreword by former Brabham driver John Watson, the book is divided into 2 sections.  Section one covers the Jack Brabham years in 3 chapters from the teams formation in 1962 through to the transition phase which began in 1970, as Black Jack was beginning to wind down his Grand Prix activities. Naturally there is a chapter devoted to the Brabham Repco years. <br /> <br />Section 2 covers the Ecclestone era in 5 chapters, beginning with the brief period that Ron Tuaranac spent in charge before Bernie Ecclestone took over, up to the Brabham BMW years with Nelson Piquet as the number one.  <br /> <br />Photographs are scattered throughout the text, including a couple of interesting ones of Gordon Murray's racing days, before he became the reknown F1 designer for Brabham and McLaren.  There are two sections of full colour images in addition to the black and white images.  I note that there is an errata notice on the inside back cover, which displays a photograph omitted from page 226, which has an incorrect photograph - I don't know if this is true for all copies of this book.  There is also a small appendix for all the Grand Prix results for Brabham cars, including the privateers.  This appendix lists the results up to and including 1984.   <br /> <br />The writing is much more substanial than Henry's later efforts, and he has interviewed a number of key former or current (at the time) Brabham personnell.  A number of interesting issues are discussed - the Repco developments, the Alfa era, the trick hydro-pneumatic suspension and the brief introduction of fuelling midrace to mention just a few.   <br /> <br />Brabham: The Grand Prix cars is highly recommended for those more interested in the golden age of Grand Prix racing, when Bernie was just a mere team owner rather the kingpin he is today. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately some may say) the book hasn't been updated to take into account the sad demise of this once great Formula One racing team.  <br />	2005-03-26

In all that time, Hazelton have never really done much substanial changes to the general format of the book bar the typical font changes to update the look of the book. <br /> <br />This year (unfortunately) Hazelton have done away with the usual jacket size image of the year's Drivers World Championship winning driver. Instead, as well as a large image of Schumi in his Ferrari, arms triumphantly raised, there a number of smaller images clustered together under the title banner. This just plain looks untidy, not a good start. <br /> <br />The cover abberation aside, inside, the book contents are as usual. Alan Henry, the editor, compiles the Top 10 drivers list, while adding a commentary on the seasons events in his introduction. There are the usual feature articles, one of which this year discusses Jenson and his season. Eric Silbermann and Nigel Roebuck discuss the evolution of F1 and qualities of the ideal number two driver respectively. The teams roundup is as usual, the bigger teams getting 3 pages, the lesser lights 2 pages. Race commentaries are as in previous years, although there are the odd irritating errors, particularly with the graphics of the grid which sometimes does not correlate with the times and positions detailed in the qualifying chart. The photography as always is simply superb.  <br /> <br />Formula One is the focus of the Autocourse annual, but as with previous editions, there are the usual F3000 and F3 roundups, plus the Touring cars, sports and GT reviews. Gordon Kirby contributes the commentary on the US racing scene.  <br /> <br />As can be seen, very little has changed (aside from the cover) so for this reason I'm sure many people will buy and continue to buy Autocourse. A high quality product, probably the best on the market for now, which won't disappoint those who have brought the series before.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-19

Even the book jacket, a delightful shot of a Ferrari (what else?) speeding across the cover, instead of a series of portraits of the F1 drivers (as was the case with 2003 \\"The Season\\") is an improvement.  The improvements are not confined to just the cover.  This comes somewhat as a relief, as in my review of \\"The Season\\", I swore that I would not buy another annual of its ilk, but this year, I had more money than good sense and once again purchased the book to go along with the customary \\"Autocourse\\".    <br /> <br />This Annual is published by the Haymarket Publishing Group (a glance at the credits page shows input from Matt Bishop and Stephane Samson of F1 Racing as well as Mark Hughes from AutoSport) and Haynes instead of FOM, the publishers of the now defunct F1 Magazine.  Despite this, Bernie Ecclestone still contributes the foreword.  <br /> <br />Eddie Jordan looks at each of the drivers and gives a brief assessment of how they rank against each other.  There is also a section which looks at the technical aspects of the cars of 2004, with the Technical Directors of all 10 teams making a list for \\"Car of the Year\\". There is also seperate article with a focus on the Ferrari F2004.  Additionally, following the race roundups, there is a season roundup of technical developments for each team although the coverage for the lesser lights (Jag/Jordan/Minardi) is slight. There are additional team statistics (the usual: wins, starts, points and so on) and technical details of chassis/engine as well as key staff for each of the teams. <br /> <br />Jenson Button, Juan Pablo Montoya, Fernando Alonso, and Kimi Raikkonen all contribute a two page spread discussing their own seasons and performances. The race roundups are OK, similar to the style of F1 Racing, with a little input from key technical figures such as Pat Symonds of Renault, David Pitchford of Jaguar and Montoya again. The graphics presented for each race are nice, and there is a sentence or two from each race driver summing up their performances.  The race roundups are probably the biggest improvement from the previous year's annual.   <br /> <br />The Test drivers have not been neglected: there are a couple of articles dedicated to the \\"Lost Boys\\", as well as a statistics section- did you know it was not Ferrari that covered the most testing mileage for 2004, but Toyota?  And Williams were second? <br /> <br />On the downside, I note there is some advertising material, and it seems to me to be more advertising than in the past.  Still it is not such a huge issue for me.  More indepth discussion from other drivers apart from those already contributing articles as mentioned previously would have been nice- at least the 2003 edition did discuss each individual driver. <br /> <br />Overall, this annual, while probably not a serious threat (oh, how I long for an annual to rival the 2001 and 2002 editions of F1 Annual) for Hazelton and Autocourse, does offer a genuine alternative for those who are tiring of the Autocourse product.	2005-01-22

Spearheaded by Sir John Barrow, Second Secretary of the Admiralty, the British Navy sent out a number of ships to diverse areas of the globe.  Notably Fleming does not focus solely on the Arctic explorative efforts for which Barrow is most well known.  Fleming argues that Barrow could well be considered the father of Global exploration. British explorers penetrated the frozen wastes of the Arctic, and Antarctic, as well as the African interior, all in the name of Science and Knowledge.  <br /> <br />Fergus Fleming is a particular favorite of mine, since I picked up his book \\"90 degrees North\\" a couple of years ago.  He has a particular knack for drawing fine textual character sketches of the individuals whose tales he tells.  Barrow's Boys is no exception.  Fleming relates with ease the characters and adventures (and tragedies) of John and James Ross, of Parry, Back, Richardson, and the doomed Sir John Franklin.  <br /> <br />Lesser known names in the annals of British exploration are not neglected: Lyon and Ritchie's mission to find the source of the Congo via the Sahara is discussed, as is James Tuckey, on which the book first begins it's exploration narrative after having introduced Sir John Barrow in the first chapter.  The stubborness and arrogance often found in Victorian Englishmen that often rendered them inflexible to changes in their environment- for example the wearing a heavy woollen navy uniform in the suffocating heat of Africa- is well portrayed by Fleming. <br /> <br />Barrow's Boys covers the period between 1816 (Tuckey sails to the Congo) to 1859 (the efforts to locate the missing Franklin exidition).  A neat touch is the epilogue, in which Fleming relates briefly the lives of the British explorers after they had their moment in the sun.  Barrow's Boys is authorative, but by no means academic, as it is a very easy read.  Recommended for those with an interest in exploration, particularly from the viewpoint of the British.	2004-12-22

Korea doesn't seemed to have grabbed the imagination of the Victorian traveler in quite the same way as China or Japan, so as a consequence there is much less of a visual record of the colonial era in Korea. To compensate for this, Korea: Caught in Time helps me visualise what the people, and the places, were like as Korea moved into the modern age. As they say, a picture is worth 1000 words.    A number of photographs were taken by Herbert Ponting, who later accompanied Captain Scott to the Antarctic, and by Felice Beato, who is the first known photographer to have worked in Korea, having being part of the American Trading expedition in 1871. Other early western photographers have their images reproduced here. A number of Japanese photographers also worked in Korea, during the time of the Japanese colonial occupation, and a sampling of their work is included.There are images taken from the first significant foray by the Western world into Korea by America, American ships making their presence felt on the Korean peninsula in 1871 and capturing, probably for the first time ever, photographic images of Korean people.    There are samplings of the initial contact with the outside world, and of some of the minor ensuing conflicts. Farming and industries are depicted as is daily Korean life in the cities such as weddings and funerals, and general street scenes such as cobblers plying their trade. There are a number of formal portraits of members of the aristocracy and government officials. There are also hand coloured photographs of members of Korean embassy staff in Japan, which are interesting for the ceremonial costumes they are wearing.    Having worked in Korea, and having visited Seoul many times while I was there, I have developed a keen interest in Koreanhistory. This book was a very useful addition to my Korean history collection as it is the only one that is extensively illustrated. I can highly recommend \\"Korea Caught in Time\\" if you have an interest in Korean history.	2004-12-11

Gaining press creditials from FIFA to cover the World Cup, he traveled through Japan to catch a number of the World Cup games live, and several more in local pubs, along with his Japanese friends. <br /> <br />The book is a relatively slim volume (190 pages-there is also 8 pages of colour images, mainly photos of the rabid fans and supporter, in the centre of the book), full of his personal memories, experiences, and observations of both the Japanese locals and the tourists that visited his adopted country for one the world's greatest sporting events. It is particularly interesting for the insights into the Japanese culture and identity, and it is very clear that the author identifies much more strongly with the Japanese, than with the sometimes brash and ignorant Western tourists present for the World Cup.  <br /> <br />\\"We are Nippon\\" is a delightful little read, especially for those who actually made the long haul to Japan or Korea for the 2002 World Cup.  This book was of particular interest to me as I was based in Korea for the cup, which was one of the highlights of my life thus far, and I wanted to catch a feel for what the Japanese side of the event was like.  I was not at all disappointed, and wish someone would write something similar from the Korean viewpoint.  A recommended sports book, especially for those who were there. <br />	2004-08-22

While in recent years, my usual anticipation of recieving my Autocourse has receded somewhat, due to what I feel is lower quality product than in past years and superior annuals from other publishers, this year was a little different.  This stems from the fact that earlier this year I purchased the F1 Annual-The Season, the latest effort from Bernie Ecclestone's mob.  In stark contrast to the F1 annuals of 2001 and 2002, the 2003 edition was extremely disappointing.  Since then I have heard that Ecclestone has shut down his F1 magazine (on which the F1 annual is based) so it's probably unlikely we will see another edition of the F1 annual.  <br />So unlike past years, I was actually looking forward to getting my Autocourse. Having now recieved after my first order went missing in the post (Amazon resent the entire order with absolutely no hassles! Good on you Amazon), I can say that Autocourse is easily the superior product of the two.  As usual it has the Editors top 10 drivers, always a source of contention amongst F1 fans, the teams review (much better than F1 Annual this year although I wish Autocourse would take on board what F1 Annual did in 2001/2002 in this area) as well as the race coverage.  Photography is excellent as always (Darren Heath is now onboard as chief photographer).  The results pages (far, far superior to F1 annual this year) has been spruced up with nice graphics displaying the qualifying positions, but if I have a gripe with Autocourse this year, it is that they changed the format a little halfway through the year by starting to include the 2nd practice times from saturday midway through the year instead of from the start.  A very minor point though.  For 2003 however, there probably is'nt a superior annual of the Formula One season than Autocourse, and it sure spanks F1 Annual this year, but that is more to the poor editoral content of F1 Annual than any improvement from Hazelton.<br />So all in all, Autocourse for 2003 is much the same as 2002 and 2001 and... you get the picture.	2004-03-11

The Expedition sailed from Norfolk, USA, carrying the scientific and exploratory hopes of the United States on a trip to South America, Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands and Asia that encompasses nearly 5 years.  Over 500 men, in 6 ships left in 1838, to return in 1842, much reduced in number, but with enough scientific specimens (over 4000) to form a large portion of the Smithsonian collection.  Commanded by Lieutenant Wilkes, the story of the US Ex. Ex has largely been forgotten, but Philbrick has produced a book which hopefully will bring to the forefront the achievements of the US Ex. Ex and its' men.<br />\\"Sea of Glory\\" is truly a spectacular rendition of events, as Philbrick portrays the deterioration of the relationship between Commander and his men, while journeying through some of most inhospitable seas in the world.  Wilkes comes across as a near megalomaniac and odious character (almost immediately after beginning the expedition, he promoted himself Captain!), belittling the achievements of his underlings and inflating his own.  It is a miracle that he was succeeded in bringing the expedition home largely unscathed.  Nor does the story end there.  The final chapters reveal the trials and tribulations of Wilkes (and other members of the expedition) as he realizes that he may be held accountable for his actions.  Upon return of the expedition, there were no fewer than 5 court martials involving Wilkes and officers of the vessels comprising the expedition, largely petty incidents raised by Wilkes as revenge for perceived slights by the officers.<br />Philbrick writes extremely well, in a very fluid and easy manner, and it takes little effort to read.  Large portions of the book are based upon the journal of Midshipman Reynolds, once an ardent admirer of his commander but by the conclusion of the expedition despising him.  Philbrick superbly brings this out, contrasting parts of the journal from early on in the voyage to sections of the journal written much later, the journal's author much jaded and embittered by the actions of his commander.  But Philbrick does not focus only on Wilkes; the achievements of the expedition are also discussed, and the sometimes incredibly imposing situations the expedition faces, such as the attack by natives on the expedition in the Fiji Islands which resulted in the death of Wilkes' nephew.  A book of this type benefits from having illustrations and maps, and on neither account does it fail.  There are a number of maps produced in the book, although I have to say the main map (in the preface), which traces the voyage of the expedition throughout the 5 years it spent abroad, is a little hard to follow due to the back and forth nature of parts of the expedition, and also when the expedition split up for short periods of time.  There are two sections of very nice illustrations which show the main characters involved and some events that occurred. <br />\\"Sea of Glory\\" is a true story that ranks alongside the best of adventure books, and I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  A worthy addition to the library.	2004-03-06

I thought Dreadnought was a superb book, and held high hopes for \\"Castles of Steel\\".  I'm pleased to say that I was not disappointed, although I had a few reservations.  <br />I have always enjoyed Massie's writing style, and he is true to form here.  All the main players from Churchill to Jellicoe, from the Kaiser to Hipper, are portrayed in vivid character sketches which is something Massie does particularly well.  Beattie in particular comes off as a love-struck pompous individual!  As always his words flow very easily, which is always helpful when reading a book of this size; nearly 850 pages!  Massie, as in \\"Dreadnought\\", deals with all the complex political intrigues very nicely from both the British and German perspective.  The Naval actions are vividly described and make for riveting reading.  I particularly enjoyed reading of the Falklands and Coronel engagement for as a WWI novice I had not known of either action.  <br />There are 6 maps produced, but the one for Jutland, which was the largest Naval engagement of the war, was relatively large scale showing the general approach of the two opposing fleets rather than individual ships.  I would like to have seen a few more images, but what is reproduced are very nice pictures of the main characters and ships.  <br />I was a little disappointed that the book seemed to tail off after 1916; after Jutland, the prime focus seems to be the U-Boat war.  The surface fleet is neglected after this time, but that could be that there were no significant or even minor actions taken by either side after this time; I'm not a Naval scholar so I don't know.  To me, Massie does'nt seem quite as enthused when writing about the U-Boats and the counter actions by the British, but none the less, it is still very interesting.  \\"Castles of Steel\\" is definitely highly recommended to all Naval and WWI historians and European political history buffs.	2004-03-06
US	36037231	R1WZP836JYTQ6T	1861263392	491638361	A-Z of Grand Prix Cars	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Nice addition to the F1 collection	David Hodges is a noted Motorsport journalist and this is his own pet project, which sadly he was unable to see to fruition as he passed away shortly before completion. Fortunately, Mr Hodges efforts were not left unpublished, with Graham Robson and Charles Herridge seeing this book through to completion.<br />A-Z of Grand Prix Cars is a complete rendition of all the marques to ever race in Grand Prix, from the very first French GP in 1906 through to the Japanese GP of 2000.  Not only are all participating teams included, there are also notable marques that attempted to put together an F1 effort but for wahtever reason did not race in anger, for example DAMS, and Alpine.  The latter was a total suprise for me as I had never known that Alpine had put together two different F1 cars.  <br />For each marque, there are brief individual entries for each unique design. There are numerous black &amp; white photographs for most of the marques, but space prohibits the publication of photos for each of the individual designs.  Still, there is plenty to peruse.  Irritatingly, given the price of the book, there are a few typo and factual errors. For example, Mario Tolentino, designer for both Dallara and EuroBrun, is referred to as Marco Tolentino in the entry for the Dallara BMS 189.  The Arrows A19 did'nt score 3 points in the 1998 season as the book claims, they scored 6.  Another annoying thing about this book is that although organized alphabetically, major marques such as Ferrari, BRM etc.. have whole pages set aside for them which tends to disrupt the flow of the book.  But this is relative nitpicking, as given the extensive nature of the book there is plenty of material to be covered.  <br />One of the strengths of this book is that is covers both pre-war and post-war GP cars, which I think is relatively unusual for a single volume, and this is a worthy addition to the motorsport collection for this reason.  There are superior books out there for either pre or post war F1 cars, most notably Doug Nye's History of the Grand Prix Car, but it is hard and expensive to get a hold of so A-Z of Grand Prix Cars is much more accessible for those wanting a brief overview of F1 teams and their cars.	2004-01-20

Quite what the publishers were thinking I cannot begin to fathom as had they continued with the previous years format I am sure they would have made inroads on the market Autocourse cater for.  So just what does set this edition apart from the 2001 and 2002 F1 Annuals?<br />The main factor is the simple fact that the 2003 Annual has nearly 300 fewer pages than its predecessors (Note: the product details for this book gives the number of pages as 670; this is actually INCORRECT, this book has 384 pages).  Admittedly, 90 pages in the past annuals were devoted to a complete record of past F1 races from the inception of the F1 Championship and I'm not too suprised that this has been cast to the bin for the 2003 Edition.  But that still leaves over 200 pages that has been excised. The majority of those 200 pages has come from the removal of the team's race by race performance.  Probably one of the stongest features of the past annuals (for me), the team's technical/commercial/drivers and race by race record has been cleaved and pared to a mere few pages, nowhere as comprehensive as previously.<br />Coverage of technical developments is now confined to the major developments each race weekend.  Another absentee is the strong statistical breakdown of the races; no lap charts, fastest/slowest, pitstop times, speedtrap times.  There is no lap by lap summary of the individual races. There is no graphical representation of qualifying results. The results are now consigned to the back of the annual, a mere 3 pages encompassing the years results, which are confined to qualifying times and race results in bland black and white tables (No fastest laps!!!).  Circuit maps are black/white/grey scale, nowhere near as interesting looking as previous years. There also seem to be a few more pages of advertising than in the past.<br />However there are a few bright spots (although precious few); photography is excellent with Rainer Scheglemich providing many images.  There are reasonable drivers quotes (summing up their feelings about the season just finished) in each of the driver summaries, which feature all drivers participating in 2003 bar Baumgarter and Gene.  The team chiefs and technical directors/designers also contribute quotes in the Annual's sum up of the F1 teams. There is also 4 pages devoted to the new circuits to F1 for next year, Shanghai and Bahrain.<br />After stealing the ball in a big way from Hazelton/Autocourse in 2001/2002, the F1 Annual just dropped it big time with the 2003 effort.  There is no way that I would consider purchasing the next edition of the F1 Annual, should it stay in it's current format.ew bright spots (although precious few); photography is excellent with Rainer Scheglemich providing many images.

Given the subject matter of the book, the exploration of the Libyan desert (this forms the historical basis of the movie &quot;The English Patient&quot;) and the subsequent forays of the LRDG in World War II, one would expect a gripping tale of explorers, adventurers and action but instead, the author contrives to make this one of the most driest narratives to be found outside of the Gilf Kebir!<br />The biggest fault is the authors tendency to throw both personalities and place names about with abandon, something tighter editing I'm sure would have resolved.  I found myself constantly having to flip back to previous pages to find out just who is this person the author refers to.  Place names are also just as overwhelming. It may have been helpful to have maps alongside the text showing the various journeys undertaken, as it was all to easy to lose scope of just how immense some of the exploratory trips undertaken were.<br />Despite the tedious nature of the writing, I found &quot;The Lost Oasis&quot; still quite interesting in places, particularly the show of Italian brinkmanship over the Libyan/Sudan border.  Also, as I came to grips with the distances and places travelled, I became aware of just what an extraodinary time Bagnold and his chums had travelling the desert searching for the Zerzura Oasis.<BR>If you are a diehard desert fan, you probably would get this book for your library, but I would recommend for a casual reader (like myself) to look elsewhere if you want a good read of what was a very exciting era of modern desert exploration.	2003-12-31
US	36037231	R12RUU7C96KGEW	0864426976	598170145	Lonely Planet Korea	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good enough for me.	I was lucky enough to live in Korea for a year teaching English and while I was there, the LP Korea was pretty much my travelling \\"Bible\\". While other people may not consider it indepth in locations to visit, it still has more than sufficient details for your average visitor who is going to travel around for a month or two. I was working so my travelling time was limited to weekends, so as it was, the LP Korea was perfectly adequate for my needs. There was always plenty to see and do.  I wanted to see the most important and interesting stuff, which typifies what Korea is all about.  If you are going to be visiting Korea for an extended period of time, or living there, then maybe after a while the guide book may appear to be superficial.  However, all the major regions are covered, including Jejudo Island (and North Korea gets its own section at the back).  All the usual hotels, resturants and transport details are there, as well as the bog standard travel advice.  So if you are a short term visitor, then the LP Korea will, in my opinion, be more than sufficient.<br />Besides, if LP does not meet your needs, the KNTO is reasonably well developed, with tourist maps and info of most destinations at railway stations, bus stations, and airports. At major tourist points, guides will speak english, and advise you of other interesting features of the area you are in. University students wanting practice their english are also good travel guides. I had my first introduction to Daegu in this manner. <br />I disagree with some of the opinions expressed by other reviewers of this book. To be realistic, the minute this title came off the printing press it was out of date. For example, one cannot expect all the eateries listed to still be there by the time an individual gets to Korea. When I lived in Kumi (or Gumi, which ever way you prefer) for a year, there was a resturant down the street from where I lived that changed ownership three times, being reincarnated as something different each time it reopened. Some places stay, some go. Nor can one expect all interesting destinations to be featured; what would people want more; a small compact book with sufficient info for tourists planning to be in country for 2 months or so or alternatively an immense brick like book jammed with enough destinations to keep a traveller travelling for years and which cost a bomb and throws your back out every time you lift it. I know which I prefer.	2003-06-08
US	36037231	R3IIHII34WRFAX	0954414705	672985147	The Official 2002/2003 Formula 1 Annual	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Throughly comprehensive.	The 2002 F1 annual will be familiar to you if you already have read or leafed through the 2001 annual as the lay out and format is the same as the previous edition.  It also is just as comprehensive with seperate chapters for the drivers, teams and races.  <br />The drivers each get a least two pages, summarising their season, results and perceived failures.  The team summary, covering both drivers, team personnel and commercial activities also includes race by race summaries including practice and qualifying, so the reader obtains a much more complete overview of the race weekend for any particular team, and this is one area where the F1 Annual is clearly superior to the Hazelton Autocourse series.  <br />In a double dose of information since you get a team summary of each race in the teams chapter, there is also a chapter relating to the overall picture of each race of the season, including what I think are quite nice circuit graphics.  Also covered in this annual is race by race technical profiles of changes to the cars at each race, including drawings by Giorgio Piola, another clear advantage over Autocourse.  The last chapter is a results section, giving the race results for every Grand Prix since 1950.  Also included, unusually I think for an annual, is an index.<br />On the downside, the photography at times is not the best. I'm not sure, but I think some of the images are screen captures from the Digital TV feed.  The picture quality, or lack of it, is further amplified by the paper itself, which is quite lightweight.  Having said that, if the paper was of a heavier bond, the book would weigh more than its already considerable weight!  While the results from 1950 onwards is nice to have, I wonder whether it is really necessary.  If the producers of F1 Annual choose to keep with the Statistics section, then I would think having some further stats relating to drivers and teams, most GPs, most wins &amp; poles etc... would add to the merit of this section. I have also noticed a number of typo errors, which for the amount of money invested into this book is unacceptable, but this is also something the producers of Autocourse are guilty of. <br />Overall, despite the deficiencies in the book, this is a throughly comprehensive review of the 2002 season, and is probably much more laden with the info that the F1 &quot;anoraks&quot; like myself like to see than Autocourse is likely to give.	2003-05-17

Man on the Moon is an indepth read of all the Apollo missions, and the numerous individuals involved in fulfilling President Kennedy's desire to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth before 1970. Man on the Moon influenced, to a large extent, the HBO mini series &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, which is my opinion,one of the best pieces of television ever made.<br />All the Apollo missions are covered, beginning with the illfated Apollo 1, when Grissom, White and Chaffee died of asphyixation, to Apollo 7 (the first manned mission after Apollo 1), to the last mission Apollo 17, when Cernan and Schmitt were the last men to walk on the moon. Some missions naturally have more attention focussed on them; Apollo 8, Apollo 11, and Apollo 13.  Despite this, Chaikin still devotes much time to the other missions, and the circumstances surrounding them. <br />Chaikin has a particularly easy reading style, which given the technical backdrop for the book, is impressive.  He introduces the reader to all the major players, Astronauts, Engineers, and Officials of NASA, all brought vividly to life.  He provides plenty of ancedotes in his discussions of each particular mission, making for entertaining reading.  If you want to know about the manned Apollo missions, get this book. You won't regret it.	2003-03-26

Peter the Great:His Life and World is an magnificient biography, I wish they all were like this. Impeccably researched and written, Massie reveals life in the Russian Royal Court in the time of Peter the Great.  Massie's writing style is generally easy reading, but it will still take many evenings to complete this book.  <br />Personalities abound throughout the telling of one of the greatest of all Tsars.  What really stands out about this particular book, is that while the book is really about Peter, Massie allows the flow of the book to follow personalties of the time as they enter and exit Peter's world.  So as well as learning about Peter, I learnt of Charles' rivalry with the Russian leader, and the battles they fought;  Tolstoy, the ambassador to the Ottoman empire, and his constant diplomatic battles with the leaders of Turkey.  The Sun King of France.  These are just a few examples that litter the book.<br />Furthermore, social and political issues of the time are discussed, some in great depth. I never realised the stuggles involved with the construction of St. Petersburg, the workers dealing with both the [danger] of the Swedish Army and Navy, as well as the marshes on which the city was built.  That the establishment of the Russian Navy was initiated by Peter, was another surprise. I would have thought that a major empire such as the Russian would have already had a navy.  The political intrigues between the Royal houses of Europe was another eyeopener for me.<br />There are always faults with any book; Peter the Great is no exception.  Some details would be repeated, some to the point of numbness.  How many times do we have to hear about Peter's fondness for the sea? Or the sciences? Still, many people like myself will overlook these and instead, look at the book for what it is; a stunning and comprehensive look into not only the life of Peter the Great, but the world of Eastern and Middle Europe.  I began reading the book to learn the story of Peter the Great. That I got a history lesson about Europe in the 18th century is a real bonus.	2003-03-22

Once again Hazelton and Alan Henry combine to produce this season's Autocourse.  As usual, it is decorated with superb photography, and contains Henry's Top 10, Team review, Race reports, plus F3000 and Enduro racing, American racing and comprehensive results. In that respect little has changed from previous years, and generally Autocourse satisfies me.<br />However, normally I would eagerly await the arrival of my Autocourse at the end of each year, but this year I was a little restrained.  The reason for this restraint was that I recently purchased the 2001 F1 magazine annual, which is from Bernie Ecclestone's outfit.  In perusing Bernie's annual, I realised that Autocourse are lacking in a lot of areas.  Driver, team, race reports and technical reviews are all superior in the F1 Annual, shading Autocourse by quite a margin.  I still chose to purchase this year's Autocourse though largely to continue my collection, but also because of the superior production quality and photography. Also, I bought simply because I could afford to.  I intend to buy the F1 annual at a later date.  For those on a budget, who intend to choose between Autocourse and F1 Annual, I would recommend F1 Annual, for the superior quality of information it contains. <br />For those who always buy Autocourse, and are happy with it, don't worry, nothing has changed.  Which will be a problem for Hazelton since the F1 Annual is in many ways a superior product.  I'm sure many people will opt for the F1 annual.  Hazelton will need to lift their game in the future if they want to keep their readership.	2003-01-31

Steve Matchett, the author of this book, is if you did'nt know, a mechanic.  Not only is he a mechanic, he is a mechanic for the Benetton Formula One team.  A mechanic writing a book is a rarity indeed, which makes \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" very special.  Matchett, thankfully, also is a good writer (or maybe he had a good editor), and he has a great story to tell about his experiences in Formula One.<br />Basically covering the 1994 Championship winning season, the book runs through all the rounds of the Championship from Brazil to Australia.  Benetton had a particularly turbulent season, as there was a lot of pressure on the team, what with being Championship contenders, the lauch control affair, Senna's death, the fuel fire in Germany (Matchett was the guy on the rear jack), the fuel filter affair, and Schumacher's collision with Hill at Adelaide.  All these are in the book, and Matchett gives his (or Benetton's) side of the story.<br />Matchett has done extremely well with this book by choosing to present his tale in a personal way.  You learn about how he has his coffee, how he did the decor in his cottage.  You also learn about the struggles of an F1 mechanic for the Benetton Formula One team.  The early morning starts, the late nighters, the trials and tribulations of travelling across the world to 15, 16 different countries is related very well in an easy to read style. There many little interesting tidbits that Matchett tells us about; Michele Alboreto coming in for a seat fitting for the Benetton as an outside candidate for the vacant number 2 seat prior to the start of the season.  His tales of nights out with fellow mechanics.  His desire for \\"his\\" driver to well; Matchett was mechanic for Jos Verstappen, JJ Lehto, and finally Johnny Herbert during the season. If there is a downside to the story, it is that Matchett can say no wrong of anyone in the team.  However, he did have to continue to work with the team after finishing his book, so I cut him a little slack on that one.<br /><br />All this makes for a captivating read.  A recommended read, and if you like this book, you should try the follow up book \\"A Mechanic's Tale\\", which covers the other years in Matchett's career with the team before he quit in 1997.e slack on that one.<BR> <BR>All this makes for a captivating read.

The Great Fire of London was a catastrophic event, destroying much of London in 1666, and is the basis of Hanson's excellent book.  He sets the scene superbly, beginning by describing the life and mood of London in 1666 in a vivid manner.  By bringing to life some of the characters of the time, such as the baker Thomas Farriner, in whose premises the fire began, and King Charles II, the story is given a neat personal touch and makes for much more interesting reading.  <br />Once Hanson has described the setting, and filled in background issues, such as the plague of the previous year and the (un)popularity of the King, he commences on the initiation and spread of the fire in a breath taking fashion. It literally is quite gripping reading, and I was glued to the pages, unable to put the book down.  It only lets up once the fire is out, and the great loss of property and personal items is realised and the enornmous task of rebuilding greater London begins.<BR>   <BR>Hanson also describes the mob mentality of the Londoners in seeking out would be arsonists, assumed to be foreigners (England was waging a war against Holland at the time).  The person hanged for the alleged arson, Hubert, was as Hanson tells us, most likely innocent.  There are other suspects, even the King himself.<br />To sum up, this is an excellent read of an important event in London's history.  People interested in London history would no doubt enjoy the book, but Hanson's literary style will appeal to many people just looking for interesting reading.	2003-01-05

Once you get over the arrogance of the subtitle: \\"Jack The Ripper, case closed\\", and start reading the book, what the reader finds is a collection of mostly circumstantial evidence. A previous reviewer had already mentioned the mDNA evidence. At best this proves that Sickert wrote some hoax letters. From what Cornwell describes of Sickert's unpleasant character, I can readily believe that he indeed did pen some hoax letters. This is the strongest thread connecting the Ripper to Sickert. As for the rest, it is merely circumstantial. The case for Sickert as the Ripper that Cornwell builds is certainly a possibility, but nothing more than that. A possibility. For Cornwell to describe the matter as case closed is a case of sheer arrogance. She does very little to rebut the case for the other key suspects. Druitt is a suspect she does dwell on, as is the Duke of Clarence, for a short while in the book. There are as most Ripperlogists will know other likely candidates; Ostrog and Chapman are two such candidates that spring to mind. <br />Cornwell's book is interesting reading, mainly because it is a splendid example of fitting the available evidence to suit a particular suspect.  I chose to give the book only 2 stars, partly because of the title, but also because I felt the subject matter is unbalanced.  Cornwell comes across as being one eyed; she was out to get her man, and damn any evidence that might suggest some other person (or persons) may be responsible for the Whitechapel murders. It is still a worthwhile read if only to see how a case for a particular person can be built from circumstanial evidence.  <br />I became interested in the Jack the Ripper legend since watching the movie \\"From Hell\\" (which requires perhaps an even greater suspension of belief than is needed for this book; none the less the movie is quite good) and have since read a few books on the subject. Philip Sudgen's book is an excellent read, and I recommend it to other readers. What I have gathered from the material I have read, it is that we will never know who Jack the Ripper really was. Too much time has gone by, evidence has been lost or destroyed, and there are too many suspects. Any book that closes the case to this story has yet to be authored, and probably never will be.	2002-12-28

The author does an great job of revealing just how extraordinarily monsterous, ruthless, and incredibly farsighted, Joseph Stalin really was.  From his childhood to his later years, we can observe the development of one of the world's greatest tyrants and how he used people for his own ends, and how he discarded them when they were of no further use to him.  Towards the end of the book, the sense of desperation of Molotov, Kalinin and others as it dawned on them that they may be the next to vanish into the gulags is readily visualised thanks to the great litery style of Radzinsky.  If I had a gripe with the book, it was keeping track of personalities as I progressed through the book although I suspect this would not bother someone with a greater knowledge of the people involved in the Soviet Government than myself.	2002-10-07
