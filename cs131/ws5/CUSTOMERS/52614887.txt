Sometimes they seem to be talking a grandmother touching a mouse for the first time, driving you crazy with obvious details.  Other times they seem to be chatting to the boys in the backroom at Verisign, way over your head with undefined acronym soup.<br /><br />The book constantly uses terms without defining them.  The books explains in great detail how to do unspeakable acts to a certificate server without first explaining WHY you might want to do such things or why you might want your own certificate server in the first place.<br /><br />Sometimes the book reads like a sales promo for Verisign where some of the authors work.<br /><br />The book does not explain how to compute any of the digests or public/private key computations, but it does give a reasonable overview of how they work.<br /><br />For a book on certificates, oddly it shows no examples, or their format.<br /><br />The authors did a reasonable, if somewhat belaboured, job of explaining S/MIME email signing and encryption. I have not encountered one before.	2005-07-21

The third world countries soon default on the loans, and then the west takes over the county demanding compliance in UN votes, handover of infrastructure, and general control of the country. It is a first person, blow by blow account of his adventures in Ecuador, Panama, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia. He explains what is going on behind the scenes with contractors like Halliburton and Bechtel in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is also about his struggle with his conscience, gradually giving up the money to betray the poor of the third world. The author maintains a website: johnperkins.org.	2005-04-11

It is a frustrating book if you want to use it for debating others, since it has no index and no footnotes to back up what he says. It is an overview of how the Iraq war fits into history, past and future. It gives a convincing argument why Bush invaded Iraq. It explains why Bush's jihad against the U.N. is so dangerous for us all. It also explains why the USA is overreacting to the threat of terrorism.	2005-01-19

It is footnoted up the wazoo.  Ruppert does not preach. He lets his detail speak for him, so you have to pay careful attention to get what he is driving at. This is like a case for the prosecution to put Cheney and Bush away for life.  Ruppert nails them cold. It is not a flashy book. It is a relentless book.<br /><br />The scale of the crimes on the international scale that Bush and Cheney work at is breathtaking. (...)<br /><br />I want to add a comment about the straw man argument in the Raquel Baranow review. Ruppert considers Vreeland an unreliable witness, but that does not change the fact Vreeland did warn the Canadian authorities of 9/11, getting most details right.

She married Osama's older brother Yeslam.<br /><br />There is not much about Osama, other than the family, even in secret, asserted that Osama did not orchestrate 9/11.<br /><br />However, there is a tremendous amount about what life for woman in Saudi Arabia is like.<br /><br />The author paints a very unflattering portrait of herself as naive, self-centred, shallow and petty. This lends authenticity since the important things she says in passing as she focuses on the trivial.<br /><br />The first theme of the book is the fanatical segregation of the sexes.  Women are virtual prisoners.  I would say a prisoner in the USA has more freedom than an Saudi woman.<br /><br />Bizarre as is sounds, she did not even attend her own wedding.  A male relative served in proxy, holding the groom's hand.<br /><br />That black abaya (head to toe black covering) actually makes it impossible for women to see. It is like walking around at night.  Even in the sweltering heat of Saudi Arabia, they wear gloves and thick black stockings to hide every inch of skin.<br /><br />A woman is allowed to be seen by only other women, her husband and her brothers. So a family restaurant works like this.  There are locked rooms for each family.  Each time the waiter comes, he knocks on the door.  The women all cover their faces. He pours the water. He leaves. Then they take off the veils to eat. This ritual is repeated for every dish he brings.<br /><br />A man may not help his wife who has fainted up off the ground since \\"embracing\\" in public is not permitted. If he does so, religious police will beat him.<br /><br />The author insisted on going shopping for some Similac canned breast milk when servants failed to find it. But women were not permitted in a store run by men.  So they had to empty the store of all males before she could shop.  There are special all female shops.<br /><br />Women get no education, have no access to books.  The rich ones<br /><br />entertain themselves memorising the Koran and shopping by having stuff delivered.<br /><br />A man may have four wives at a time.  He can divorce her just by<br /><br />saying \\"I divorce thee\\" three times.  Adultery in women in punishable by death, but beatings and adultery by males are not grounds for divorce, only some obscure religious violations.<br /><br />You'd think the females would be up in arms at this oppression, but they are the ones who work hardest to keep other females in line. This is the most important revelation of the book.<br /><br />The other theme of the book is the belief you can't be too religious. These people are puritans on steroids.  Ashcroft and his $8000 robes for naked statues would be right at home.<br /><br />At the same time they are big on hypocrisy, with rampant promiscuityand homosexuality, never acknowledged.  Appearances are everything. Anything denied does not exist.<br /><br />She only hints at some of the decadence of the Saudi Princes (e.g. Prince Bondar).  She hints it is just too decadent to be believed but gives scant detail other than a comment about importing planeloads of call girls for parties.

Non Islamic people are not supposed to sully the Holy Ground in Saudi Arabia. That truly is the bee in his bonnet, just as he claimed.

I was eagerly looking forward to a continuation. I expected it to be about what we have learned about the soul and  consciousness.  Instead, he concocted an ecumenical soup of new age beliefs from astrology to reincarnation and wove it into an elaborate metaphysic, fluffed up with abstract words like &quot;negativity&quot;, &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;frequency&quot;.  It is a merangue -- no substance, no backing, no examples, no reasons for why anything he conjectures is true, and no way to apply it practically.<br />It reads like a channeled hynotic trance induction. It sounds good but says little.<br />He explains that you should not think it unfair to see someone homeless and that humans are superior to dolphins even in a soul sense.  This is a self-indulgent book, where Mr. Zukav treats his every intuition as divine revelation.	2004-01-27

It mirrors my personal experience. Back in the 70s I worked on a computer program called Optow, to design high voltage transmission lines. At first, the designs it produced were laughable. Each day I worked on it, the designs got better and better. One day it got as good as a human. Two weeks later it was designing lines 10% better than a human. Suddenly a design team of 50 engineers, most with masters degrees and PhDs were obsolete.<br />The progress was steady, but the effect on the workers came overnight. I anticipate that this pattern will repeat. Millions of white collar workers will find themselves overnight unemployed as gradual advances in AI (Artificial Intelligence) reach the stage it is better than humans at task after task.	2003-09-01

Unfortunately there is no room to provide anything you could not find out by looking at the JavaDOC. It would be nice, if at least on the CD, there were additional notes about the various gotchas, how the various methods are used together etc. It is a reference, not a tutorial.

The authors define design patterns as: descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customised to solve a general design problem in a particular context. A design pattern names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it useful for creating a reusable object-oriented design. The design pattern identifies the participating classes and instances, their roles and collaborations, and the distribution of responsibilities. Easy to wrap your mind around, eh? Design Pattern people are in love with the power of abstraction and generality. You might even say they prefer to impress rather than inform. However, somehow you are going to have to learn this stuff, even if only to get into the heads of the guys who designed the AWT. Try starting with the code samples in the Design Patterns book. You have to read this book at least twice before it begins to make any sense.  However, if you want to call yourself a programmer you MUST understand this book. I hope somebody writes a version of this book for Java programmers.  It is written from the perspective of C++ and Smalltalk. This is a book where the you want the hardcover version.

The book is frustrating because it spends so much time with the irrelevant Jasmin assembler and its syntax. You are interested in generating byte codes directly, not assembler. It leaves out much you must discover by experiment looking at generated class files, such as whether offsets are signed or absolute, where the base is etc. In its next revision, it should set the Jasmin aside in an appendix, and include examples and more precise documentation on the binary formats. The book is still valuable because it gives a fair bit of background exposition you will not find in the vmspec itself. You would use this book to understand the VM, then the vmspec to actually write code that generated or modified class files.	1998-07-02
