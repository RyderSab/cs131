DC followed suit and now Dark Horse is jumping on the bandwagon.  Marvel and DC have lots of history and should concentrate on their own bodies of work, but it is nice to see someone step up to the plate and take on the lesser known publishers of the Silver-Age (although technically, DC did it first with T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents). <br /> <br />Dark Horse does this edition justice.  For those of us who were not alive to see these in the original release, it is great to see Manning's comics on the printed page (and at a fraction of the cost of the individual original books). Manning was a pioneer, do yourself a favor and pick up this book, I was glad I did.	2005-02-16

To me it adds a new dimension to the story as we hear the story the way the autor hears it. King delivers a rare visit as he reads this one and I think it is well worth the money and worth giving a listen to over and over again.	2004-11-28

By the end of the book I was left thinking that this was a perfect ending to the story.  Here again we see Geordi dealing with his love interest Leah Brahams.  She has been busy moving up the chain of command and now has a crew of her own.  The crew of the Enterprise start succuming to the aliens that set off the Genesis Wave in order to save their dying civilization.  Billions are dead and the Klingons are in the unconventional roll of acting as transport ships of the injured and refugees left in the wake of a massive evacuation that has decimated much of the alpha quadrant.   <br /> <br />Makes a nice tie-in to the Star Trek S.C.E. series.	2004-09-20

This book takes the Genesis Device to a whole new level. Someone has stolen the Genesis Device technology, and weaponized it! Along with the technology that was stolen Dr. Marcus is also taken from her secret Federation facility for unknown reasons.  Terror reigns on the scale that no one ever dreamed, not just planetary but against entire solar systems.  It seems that the Genesis Device works flawlessly, but who started it?  And why?<br />This book is thoroughly enjoyable and a blast to read.  It ties in story lines from the original Star Trek and the Next Generation seamlessly.	2004-06-01

But what happens when you have an abusive father that works out to be more fit than the criminals he watches over in the prision?  What happens when that father brings all of the rage home with him?  How long until the family crumbles?  Nothing you own can be hidden from a dad like this, not even your most personal posessions.  When the dam breaks, all hell breaks loose with it.  Eddie was left without a family the night that the strain broke the already fragile family. But if Eddie's father died that night, who is haunting him now, and why is he stalking Eddie's ex-girlfriend?  Did his dad really die that night seven years ago or is this some kind of horror filled dream?  Is there any escape for Eddie from this never ending nightmare?<br />This book is quite readable and enjoyable.  Even though I figured out the ending was about 1/2 way through the book, it was still an entertainging ride.  Well written and a very noble start for a budding star in horror.	2004-06-01

These pulp style 'detective' novels are reminiscent of Chandler and others.  However Simmons takes the genre to an all new level. From page one you are drawn in and eagerly wanting to turn that next page but never wanting the book to end.  Each of the novels builds on the last but they grow with each new story.  Start at the beginning of the series, you'll be glad you did.  I can never recommend the books enough times.  For anyone who wants a novel that will keep you guessing from the first page to the last, these are the ones you want.  I didn't see the end coming in this one it sure was quite a surprise!  Buy this book, you'll be glad you did!!	2004-04-19

These reprints are on high quality paper and the artwork is fantastically reproduced.  It is obvious that DC placed quite a bit of time and effort into each and every book.

The storyline was simple and shallow.  Easy to predict doesn't even begin to describe this book. It is almost as if he is ripping off ideas from other writers (a.k.a. Terry Goodkind).  Women dressed in red leather ring a bell?  He takes pages to describe what could have been said in a sentence or two or at most a paragraph.  If you have nothing better to do than to turn your brain off for a couple of days then read this one.  I am hoping that his next one will have a little more substance.	2003-06-18
