I'd read it if he wrote a book about paper clips.  Well, he did, sort of.  He wrote a book about Lenin's activities and thoughts in Zurich, Switzerland, before the  Russian Revolution.  Lenin did nothing in Zurich.  The communist revolution  hasn't happened yet in Switzerland, in case you haven't noticed.<br />So,  Lenin's activities in Zurich are confined to his fruitless attempts to  motivate the Swiss to a communist revolution.  I get the feeling that he  came to think of the Swiss as a bunch of cows going moooooooo.  &quot;Down  with the bourgeouis (spelling?) state.  Down with the rich pigs.&quot;   &quot;Mooooo.&quot;<br />We see how the author interprets Lenin's personality.   As a thinker, a planner, a very suspicious person, with the mind of a  chess player, always thinking several moves ahead, always bluffing, never  simply honest and open.<br />In one conversation, the wealthy revolutionary  Parvus is trying to convince Lenin to release his underground Russian  forces for Parvus's planned revolution, financed by Germany.  Parvus can't  understand why Lenin refuses to join.  He is counting on the powerful  Leninist underground in Russia.  What Lenin doesn't tell Parvus, as he  stonewalls and counterattacks and raises innumerable objections about who  will lead the revolution, is that Lenin doesn't have any damn underground.   Nothing.  All Lenin has at this time is a small group of bovine Swiss  leftists.<br />I came away from the book believing that the Lenin in this book  was a sincere humanitarian interested in protecting the masses (us) from  abuse by those in power, and frustrated at our lack of spirit to stand up  for ourselves.  He was coming from a country where the peasants received an  extremely raw deal from their tsar and ruling class, the patient and  ever-suffering Russian peasants.  From this background it is easy to  understand Lenin's frustration.  Any government as oppressive as that one  needs to be overturned.  Lenin's older brother was executed by the tsar.   Now we seem to understand him better.<br />A recent book claims that Lenin was  thoroughly evil, the author of the concentration camp and the cult of  personality dictatorship.  But this book is of questionable merit because  it was written by someone who may just be an anti-communist party hack of  the new Russian regime.  Do we believe him or Solzhenitsyn?	2000-04-04

We know that the Nazis are right around the corner.  This is not a story of Nazis, though.  It's about the very active but painfully  confused lives of Jews caught in between traditionalism and the modern  world.  Warsaw is as lively as New York's Lower East Side when it was  throbbing with the vitality of Jewish immigrants.  The main character of  this book, Asa, is a young man whose grandfather was a revered rabbi, but  who doesn't really believe in anything himself.  His personal life is  shattered, not only by traditionalism, but by his own modern faults.  It's  a good book but it's something of a train wreck, which is why I don't give  it 5 stars.	2000-02-16

I'm happy to see his books still in the libraries of public schools.  He was a school principal.  When we got together for family gatherings he would often have a story for us, sometimes about exploding bubble gum.  I think he was  fascinated by exploding bubble gum, possibly because he was a school  principal.

I didn't really get a thorough education in literature as a college grad.  Clifton Fadiman shares his opinions of what  the best books of all time are.  He turned me on to a lot of great books.   There were a few I didn't care for, but if you are an independent minded  person able to go against the accepted opinion regardless of the reputation  of the author, you are sure to disagree here and there with anyone's  selections.  I have now read almost all of the recommended novels in this  book.  I don't plan to read all of the philosophy recommendations - I'm  bored by most philosophy books.  I don't expect to get far into the poetry  either.  You take what you want and leave the rest.	2000-02-16

This is the least oppressive level of Hell.  The prison camp described in this book offers plenty of food to the prisoners, no backbreaking physical  labor, and a warm bed.  Most of Stalin's prison camps are located in  Siberia where the prisoners freeze and starve.  What accounts for Stalin's  leniency?  The prisoners are scientists working on top secret projects like  a telephone for Stalin's use that can't be tapped, and a system of  identifying anonymous voices on public telephones by the voice prints,  similar to finger prints. In Stalin's evil country, you are not innocent  until proven guilty.  You are guilty as soon as you are arrested.  One  prisoner was put in jail because his neighbors wanted his family's  apartment and made up an unsupported lie about him.  They got the apartment  and destroyed his life and family.  Most of the prisoners were WW2 vets,  POWs returning from Germany.  They weren't welcomed home with appreciation  and honor.  They were lured home by lies, and immediately  imprisoned.<br />There are many great characters.  You'll remember Nerzhin and  his wife, and wonder how things will work out for them.  You'll remember  Rubin, the sincere communist caught in the web of the system he believes  in.  You'll remember Innokenty Volodin, in trouble for doing a good deed,  as innocent as his first name.  When you read a mediocre book there are no  characters to remember, just a predictable formulaic storyline and a group  of people and events you find hard to believe. This is a rare opportunity  for you to be a fly on the wall, halfway around the world, observing life  in a Russian prison camp.  The reason I give it only 4 stars is because I  like happy endings and resolved problems.  This book would make a good  movie.  There's plenty of room for a sequel (which hasn't been written)  where we can find a satisfactory ending for some of the characters.  Stalin  the insane sewer rat died eventually and was denounced by Khrushchev, so  maybe in time these people were allowed to live out the rest of their lives  in freedom.	2000-02-07

In this wonderful book you get to meet a number of  unforgettable people.  There's the father, Mr Karamazov, a sort of likeable  villain, a self centered rake who fondly recalls the ex-wife who used to  smack him around, justifiably.  His oldest son Dmitri, hothead and romantic  hero of the book, accused of murder.  His youngest son, the saintly  Alyosha, beloved and trusted by all.  His middle son Ivan the intellect.  His butler Smerdyakov the schemer.  Then there's Dmitri's two women - the  rich one who loves him because he saved her father, and the heartbreaker  you start out hating and end up liking.  How can you not read Brothers  Karamazov?  I liked Brothers Karamazov a lot more than Crime and  Punishment, so if you read Crime and Punishment and didn't enjoy it you  still may like Karamazov.  This is one of the finest books in the store.	2000-02-03

I find Helen Palmer's writing interesting  and valuable but I am more in tune with Riso.<br />One of the main differences  for me is Riso's division of each type into healthy, average, and unhealthy  levels.  Palmer accuses me and my type of faults that I definitely don't  identify with, although I would be the first to admit if they were true.   Riso places those faults at certain levels of the type - not my levels.  He  has much more accurate descriptions of me in certain specific levels of my  personality type, while Palmer mushes the whole type together in one beg  generic mass to the point where it is unrecognizable to me.<br />After reading  Riso's books in depth I found it interesting to get Palmer's views.

Books	4	9	11	N	N	Eyewitness account of Napoleon's disastrous invasion	The author occupied a military position in real life similar to that of Prince Andrei Bolkonsky of War and Peace.  De Segur was an aide to the commander of the armed forces, Napoleon.  Bolkonsky was a fictional aide to  Kutuzov.<br />Where Tolstoy's novel War and Peace is a work of fiction, De  Segur's book is non-fiction.  However, it confirms much of what Tolstoy  wrote.  There's a good reason for that.  De Segur's book came first.   Tolstoy read it and used it.<br />In the few instances where Tolstoy wrote  counter to De Segur, I am convinced that De Segur was correct and Tolstoy  was wrong.  I have to go with the eyewitness over the novelist.  The  biggest issue in conflict is the question of who burned Moscow.  Tolstoy  claims that it was just an inevitable accident.  De Segur claims that it  was no accident - the Russians burned Moscow and nearly killed Napoleon in  the fire.  De Segur should know.  He was there, and he was later related to  the Russian who was in charge of the sabotage and burning of Moscow.<br />In  one instance I'll go with Tolstoy over De Segur.  Tolstoy argues that  Kutuzov was an excellent general.  De Segur, obviously prejudiced against  Russians, disagrees in the extreme.<br />De Segur gives us a close view of  Napoleon the man, with his strengths and weaknesses.  We learn what  Napoleon expected from Moscow, and how he was totally disappointed and  crushed by Moscow's evacuation.  Napoleon wanted to be loved and accepted  by the Russian people.  He wanted to be helpful to them.  We learn why  Napoleon waited so long in Moscow.  He was waiting for a reply from the  czar, which he never received.  Most of all, we learn what it was like to  be one of the participants in the Grand Army of France.<br />De Segur isn't  perfect.  He is consistently antisemitic and he frequently refers to the  Russians as cowards.  This serves as a reminder that the French weren't  nice guys paying a friendly visit.	2000-01-11

Our hero is Leo Bloom, a Jew in Ireland married to an  Irish sexpot named Mollie.  The evil cyclops awaiting Leo is a big one-eyed  antisemite, and the cave is a bar.  The woman who turns men into pigs is a  dominatrix.  The faithful wife is in bed right now with a man named Blazes  Boylan.

I'm not referring to Send us, bright one, light one, Horhorn, quickening  and wombfruit, or to Hoopsa, boyaboy, hoopsa!  The most beautiful writing  in the book is when Mrs Purefoy has her baby.<br />Reverently look at her as  she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger  for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her  new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the  Universal Husband.  And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only  one blessing more, to have her dear Doady therewith her to share her joy,  to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful  embraces.  He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped  in the shoulders....And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe... You too  have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part.  Sir, to you  my hand.

But the book is extremely weak  in the area of political discussion.  As a political statement this book  would be a dismal failure.  Fortunately, the little bit of oversimplified  politics that was tossed carelessly into the book is fairly irrelevant to  the story.<br />This book is as good as anything ever produced in Russian  literature, in the class of Solzhenitsyn, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy.  It's  good because it's emotional.<br />For me, the main character is one who  appears for a very short time and seems to be a minor character - Bazarov's  father.  His love of his son, and the relationship between Arkady and his  father, are what the book is named after, and what it's about.  I love the  protest that Bazarov's father makes to God.<br />Two school graduates, Arkady  and Bazarov, return home to their families after years away at school.   Nihilist Bazarov clashes with Arkady's traditionalist uncle, but don't all  generations clash a little over something.  That's part of the  relationship.  Both young men fall in love with local women.  I think  Arkady and Katia would be great together.  She would treat him like a king  and lead him by the nose, and he would adore her his whole life and do  whatever she told him to do.	2000-01-10

We also meet a number of other Buendias named Jose  Arcadio and Aureliano.<br />The women are remarkable.  Pioneer wife Ursula  lives a supernaturally long life, from the superstitious wife of Jose  Arcadio who fears that her children will be born with tails, to the  Biblically old lady who is treated like a toy by the little children of the  house.<br />The book's biggest drawback for me is its sprawling confusion.   Michener has done cross-generational books like Hawaii that are direct,  serious, sensible.  Where Michener's work could be compared to a lifelike  painter like Titian, Marquez is more of a Picasso.	2000-01-10

The killer is dead.  The question is whether the accomplices should be executed for first degree murder or just put away for 20 years  for second degree murder.<br />The judge and the DA explain to the jury that  in these circumstances all of the kidnappers must be found guilty of first  degree murder.  The defense attorney argues that the jury is free to  disregard the DA, the judge, and the law, and that each juror must follow  his own conscience.<br />The author seems to be telling us that the defense  attorney is out of line, a wise guy.  But a higher authority, an ex-judge,  comments that jurors should follow their consciences even when this clashes  with the law, as part of the series of checks and balances in our society.   Judges don't want part of their job to be to decide verdicts because they  would then be vulnerable to angry protests, so they must bow to King  Jury.<br />Naturally there's a love story thrown in.  But writing about love  isn't a forte of this author.  The whole question is whether Bonnie will  finally accept Ab's proposal.  I don't know what's holding her up.	2000-01-10

Few countries would allow him to continue lecturing and publishing.<br />Chomsky is no crackpot.   He's a brilliant intellectual and a passionately ethical human being.  If  he is complaining about something, we'd better listen.<br />I'll give you a  little taste of this book.  These are some of the lies that we are told by  our media:<br />1.  That America wants to support democracy and human rights  around the world. 2.  That America opposes terrorism. 3.  That America  opposes international drug trafficking. 4.  That Noriega was ousted from  Panama because of drugs. 5.  That the Vietnam War was fought to halt the  spread of communism. 6.  That America was ever afraid of Soviet military  power.<br />If you are willing to re-evaluate every single thing you have come  to believe about your country, pick up this little book.

But this book explains that the Serbs had ample reason for their hatred of the Croats and for their  desire to turn the tables on their former tormenters.  The one ray of hope  is that many Yugoslavs live in peace with their neighbors and intermarry  regardless of ethnicity or religion, not obsessed with prolonging the  hatred.<br />The atrocities against humanity committed by the Croats against  Serbs, Jews and Gypsies (500,000 murdered) were more sadistic and  horrifying than anything since.  The evil Ustasha, the terrorist arm of the  Croats, specialized in sadistic torture prior to murder, all in the name of  religion.<br />I picked this book up to learn about Marshall Tito, the  fascinating political figure who successfully resisted both Hitler and  Stalin, and who kept the tinderbox of Yugoslavia at peace throughout his  life.  Tito must have been an amazing man.  And he didn't do it with  terror.  It is incredible how he maintained independence in that part of  the world surrounded by such aggressive nations.  The Tito period was a  time of prosperity for Yugoslavia, making even their Italian neighbors  envious.	2000-01-10

I'll give you some teasers to see if you'd like it.  There is a mythical planet where no nouns are spoken.  There is a lottery offering penalties as well as rewards, a  randomly selected future.  A man dreamed another living man into existence,  which taught him something startling about himself.  The universe is a  library.  A man, about to face a Nazi firing squad, asks God for time out -  and gets it.  A river gives immortality to a certain tribe, allowing us to  see what immortals are like.  A girl's father was framed for a crime and  committed suicide, motivating the girl to take revenge.  A hunted man  dreamed of killing his assassins, and is eventually in their presence -  what does he do?  These are just some of the situations and stories in  Labyrinths.<br />A similar book by Borges is called Dreamtigers.  There is a  character who appears in both books - the poet Homer.  Homer is one of the  immortals in Labyrinths, and is a young boy in Dreamtigers.	2000-01-07

She would have been fine if her husband Anse had cared enough about her to send for a doctor sooner.  Like her husband, Addie was utterly self-centered.  Neither cared at all  about the other or about any of their children.  Anse thought he was the  father of all their children, but Addie knew better.<br />Addie died early in  the book.  Good riddance.  Anse took the family on a journey to bury her  where she was born.  Along the way, he showed his lack of concern for his  children by not spending a dime on medical care for an injured child.  When  they finally arrived at the destination, Anse revealed his ulterior motive  for going.<br />Oh these people make me sick.  The children are much more  interesting than the parents.  I wonder if William Faulkner had a lot of  hatred within him that he was releasing by creating odious characters like  Anse and Addie Bundren.<br />This is a drab gray book, except for an incident  the daughter has in a drug store.  Buy a different book.  If you want to  see what Faulkner was about, get The Sound and The Fury, along with the  Cliff Notes.	2000-01-07

The movie versions of Don Quixote were also downers.  But the book ... this is a winner!  It's beautiful.  It's also really  funny.<br />There are no major villains in the book.  The rich and powerful  people who mock the old man do it gently, in fun, almost lovingly.  Even  the man who defeats Don Quixote isn't evil - he's just trying to help.  In  the end, his supposed enemies are by his side, encouraging him to continue  his quest.<br />Don Quixote is a man who actually lives out his dreams.   That's one thing I'll never do.  He's very brave, although that starts to  slip in Part Two.  He's a dear man.  His squire Sancho Panza is a riot.   Sometimes it's hard to tell which of the two is the star.<br />This book is a  love story, not between Don Quixote and Dulcinea, but between him and his  friend Sancho, between him and most of the characters he meets, and between  Sancho and his donkey.  It can also be a love story between the reader and  the characters.<br />There are some faults.  Every book is a product of its  time and place, and this book was written in an offensively authoritarian  and antisemitic place and time.  Somehow even though Cervantes soaked up  the faults of his society he still wrote a wonderful book.	2000-01-07

Yet, like other leading characters in Saul Bellow's books, he lives his life in a foolish way.  He has the kind of friends who eliminate the need for enemies.

His gift to Citrine is a manuscript, and  is left to Citrine after Humboldt's death.  The manuscript turns out to be  valuable, but I doubt that it will straighten out Citrine's life.

His style is known as shotokan, from his nickname Shoto.  Every karate and tae kwon do style in the world today is descended from Funakoshi.  Ancient Korean tae kwon do is  a lost art.  Modern TKD borrowed heavily from Funakoshi.<br />Nearly 200 of  the book's 250 pages are devoted to katas, the choreographed forms of  karate.  There are 17 katas carefully explained and illustrated.  I learned  some of these 30 years ago.  You forget a lot in 30 years - although not so  much if it's been drummed into your head enough.  Anyway here they are -  move by move, good as new.  They are great practice tools for when you  don't have a partner.  Doing kata is a lot more interesting than repetitive  drills.	2000-01-06

He divides all of his property between his two disloyal daughters simply because they flatter him, and he gives nothing to his  loyal daughter because she refuses to play the flattery game.  In  retrospect I can't blame the two flatterers for their behavior, considering  that their father is an obnoxious fool.  He gets his just desserts in the  end - the short end of the stick.  So there's a happy ending after all.  Shakespeare wrote it with sympathy for the old king.  He excuses arrogance  in kings.  I don't.  The hell with King Lear.	2000-01-06

The weaknesses are, for me, that the ending really sucks and that the unsuccessful plan of Friar Lawrence is  just so stupid.  His plan is to make a drugged zombie out of Juliet to  convince her parents that she is dead.  Would your priest, minister or  rabbi suggest that?<br />Friar Lawrence lacks courage and intelligence.  He  consents to marry the lovers without their parents' consent, but he doesn't  have the backbone to tell the parents what he did.  What in God's name is  that about?  And he comes up with an idiotic plan to deceive the parents.  Where did he learn to be a religious guide to others?  His stupidity and  deceitfulness are matched only by his cowardice.<br />The beauty of the  language, and Juliet's wonderful character in the play, call for 5 stars.  But the utter stupidity of the script and the horrible ending drag it down.	2000-01-06

Minus one point for the slow, boring parts of  this 3,000 page book.<br />Marcel has a philosophy about love.  He believes  love is kindled by pain.  No pain, no love.  If he is free to take a girl  for granted, he'll never love her.  But if she's unavailable and he misses  her intensely, or if she goes to another lover and breaks his heart, then  he's in love.  I'm not suggesting this as a workable philosophy.  It's just  a clue to Marcel.<br />The love of his life is Albertine.  His jealousy is  constantly inflamed.  She has roving eyes for other women, and this drives  him to distraction.  Since pain equals love to him, he's in love.  Marcel  is afraid to tell her he loves her, thinking if she knew she'd step all  over him.<br />Albertine is a lot more conservative, in her heart, than Marcel  thinks she is.  She yearns to give up her promiscuous life and marry him.   Her fear is that he will never forgive her past, and will never propose.   So what we have here is a failure to communicate.<br />There's no room to  mention all the other great characters, or even to say any more about  Marcel and Albertine.  The bottom line is that I'm really glad I read this  book.	2000-01-06

Thea chases Augie  down, despite the fact that it is her sister who Augie has a crush on.  But  Augie is led by the nose, and doesn't have a chance against a strong willed  woman.  She drags him to Mexico to bag an eagle and train it to hunt giant  lizards.

A paragraph in The Iliad might start with a description of a relatively minor wound to an extremity, a hand or a foot.  The paragraph will go on to  describe a series of increasingly horrific wounds, leading up to the poor  guy who was sliced in half or something.  It's like a song building to a  crescendo.  Then the author goes on to discuss the family members of the  deceased.  The point is clear.  War is hell, and people suffer, both on the  battlefield and back at home.<br />It's easy to understand the egos involved  in this story.  Acchiles is understandably insulted, infuriated, when his  prize lady is taken from him.  What is he, chopped liver?  So he decides  not to fight anymore for an army that will treat him with so little  appreciation.  The gods in the story are the same.  They are as human as we  are.<br />In today's world, we just assume that the Greek gods were fables,  myths, with no basis in reality.  But we take the current gods much more  seriously.  Who's to say that ten thousand years from now there won't be a  civilization on earth that thinks of our religions the way we think of the  ancient Greek religion?  Today's intensely held beliefs may be tomorrow's  mythology.  That's the way it went for the ancient Greeks, and history does  tend to repeat itself.<br />Let me put it this way.  Isn't it reasonable, if  we were made in God's image, for God to share our faults?  Isn't it  reasonable, looking at all of the amazing things in the Universe, to  believe that there is more than one God, that perhaps there are quite a  few?  I see nothing all that childish or unreasonable in the religion of  the ancient Greeks.	2000-01-05

Insane people are said to be alienated from their true selves.  It is an old fashioned term, and the setting for this gory thriller is 1896 Manhattan.<br />The book opens in a manner designed to capture your interest.   A serial killer is mutilating very young male prostitutes.  The mutilations  are described in gory and perverse detail.  If you were writing this book,  what gory mutilations would you come up with?  You'd be hard-pressed to  out-do these.<br />The most interesting character is the villain.  The rest of  the cast includes the title character Laszlo Kreizler, NYPD chief Theodore  Roosevelt, reporter and narrator John Moore, a bad cop named Connor, a  woman with a brain and speech defect, a pair of Jewish detectives with  Roman names, and a good lady cop.  I guess the bland narrator John Moore is  an everyman designed to bring the reader into the story.  He is you.<br />The  alienist seeks to discover the identity of the killer by analyzing him.   Let's see, who do we know who is violent and out of his ever loving mind?   The wheels turn in his brain, and by the end of the story he still hasn't  figured it out and the serial killer remains undiscovered, free as a bird.   Only kidding.<br />The investigation is blocked by police and clergy.  I guess  that adds to the tension.  By the way, now that I brought it up, exactly  why is the investigation blocked by police and clergy?  I can't give you a  sensible answer.	2000-01-05

Yogi's association was - What about him?<br />Mickey takes us through his World Series appearances - 1951 when he  permanently injured his knee, 1952 when Jackie Robinson told the press that  Mantle beat the Dodgers and that the Yankees didn't miss DiMaggio, 1953  with Mickey's tape measure homeruns, 1955 when the long suffering Brooklyn  Dodgers won their only World Series, 1956 when the umpire gave Don Larsen  that final strike, 1957 when Yankee reject Lew Burdette beat the Yanks,  1958 when Bob Turley returned the favor by beating the Braves, 1960 when  Casey failed to use Ford 3 times against the Pirates, causing the most  heartbreaking disappointment in Mantle's baseball career, 1961 when Maris  outpaced Mantle and substitutes won the World Series, 1962 when McCovey  lined out to Richardson, 1963 when they ran into  Koufax-Podres-Drysdale-Koufax, and 1964 when Whitey had a sore arm and  couldn't pitch to St Louis.<br />Mickey blamed himself for failing to do rehab  on his legs.  He endured constant pain, and it was a miracle that he had a  baseball career at all.  He rated himself as equal to Mays in fielding,  faster than Mays on the bases, but without the longevity.<br />If you look at  the incredible Yankee dynasty of the 1950s you see a team that wasn't great  on paper.  The Cleveland Indians were at times as good or better.  The  Brooklyn Dodgers had much better hitting.  It wasn't like the awesome  Yankee teams of 1998 and 1999.  The Yankees of Mickey's day had no business  winning so many pennants and world championships.  What they had was Yogi  Berra, Whitey Ford, Gil McDougald, and above all Mickey Mantle.<br />Did you  ever see him swing a bat?  He hit the ball harder than Babe Ruth.  He had  the best swing in history, combining the grace of Ken Griffey Jr. with the  power of ...... of nobody but Mickey Mantle.  McGwire is a deep popup  artistlike Babe Ruth was.  Mantle would drive the ball through a brick  wall.  He was the most powerful hitter who ever lived, and had the Olympic  class speed of Rickey Henderson.	2000-01-05

The idiot narrating the first chapter is Benjy Compson, down syndrome adult, and the sound is his bellowing every time he is reminded of his beloved big sister  Caddy, who no longer lives with him.  Some of the fury comes from Quentin  Compson, Caddy's oldest younger brother, who can't bear the thought of  Caddy's boyfriends taking her to bed.  There is more fury from youngest  brother Jason Compson, an intolerable little brat who grows into a  thoroughly evil adult.  And there is Caddy's daughter Quentin (named after  her uncle) who suffers the bullying of uncle Jason until she's had enough  of it.  She lives with uncle Jason and with her worthless, infuriatingly  stupid grandmother.<br />The book is divided into four parts, each part told  by a different person.  Part One is told by Benjy, Part Two by brother  Quentin, Part Three by devilish Jason, and Part Four by the black servant  Dilsey, who has more sense than all the others combined.<br />Benjy's chapter  may be the most amazing ever written.  Faulkner gives it the oddest stream  of consciousness structure.  Benjy's mind constantly shifts from the  present to the past.  Faulkner wanted to minimize the confusion by color  coding the paragraphs to let the reader know when Benjy was shifting from  one time period to another, but the publisher didn't go along with color  coding.  All you have are a few italics as hints that something is  changing.  It's not enough.  When you pick up this book you will need to  pick up the Cliff Notes at the same time.  Cliff Notes give an excellent  and clear explanation of what in the hell is going on in the otherwise  impossible to understand first section.  Without the Cliff Notes, the sound  and fury will refer to you smashing the book against a wall and screaming  at Faulkner - Why are you putting me through this, you idiot!  Why don't  you just write in plain English!  But with the Cliff Notes the chapter  becomes really fascinating.<br />I'll give you a clue.  Benjy is standing by a  fence looking into an adjoining yard where people are playing golf.  Benjy  is supervised by one of Dilsey's children.  If one of the golfers calls to  his caddie, and the young black child then says Hush Benjy! that means that  Benjy has just had his heart broken for the millionth time hearing his  sister's name but not seeing her, and he is screaming his fool head  off.<br />The first two parts of this book are like love letters to sister  Caddy, who was expelled from the house for promiscuity.  In this  disfunctional family, promiscuity seems pretty understandable as an escape.  The mother is a useless waste of protoplasm.	2000-01-04

Wealthy Mrs Newsome wants her son back.  Chad has been playing in Paris for I don't know how long.  He's  probably involved with a French woman, God forbid!  So she sends her  fiancee Strether to go get him.  Not completely trusting Strether, she  sends her spy Waymarsh along with him.<br />Guess what.  Strether likes it in  Paris.  He doesn't want to advise Chad to leave his French girlfriend.   Waymarsh rats him out, and Strether is no longer a wealthy lady's  fiancee.<br />So Mrs Newsome sends in the big guns - big Sarah Pocock and her  pretty daughter Mamie, the bait.  Wouldn't it be nice if Chad married Mamie  and CAME HOME!<br />Will Sarah Pocock grab Chad by the ear and drag him home  to marry her daughter?  Will Sarah go wilding through Europe with Waymarsh?   Will Strether marry Marie Gostrey, the woman who attached herself to him  in Paris?  Will Chad remain in Paris with his desperate but charming older  woman, or will he return to New England to sell clocks?  Will pretty Mamie  Pocock fall for Chad or for Chad's friend Bilham?  Is Bilham serious about  Mamie or anyone else?  Have you ever noticed the resemblance between  classic literature and soap opera?<br />The biggest problem with this book,  for me, is that all of the characters seem to have a vague,  in-between-the-lines way of expressing themselves.	2000-01-04

This book is set in 1927 China at a time when the communists and Chiang Kai Shek's nationalists were  joined in an uneasy alliance.  But the alliance is already cracking by the  end of the book, the nationalists are demanding that the communists disarm  themselves, and the communists are trying to assassinate Chiang.  This is  not a history book, though.  The book is about its leading characters, not  about the course of history.<br />Just to give you a taste of the people you  will meet in the book, there is Kyo Gisors (half French, half Japanese) and  his wife May (German).  Being good left wingers, they believe in free love.   But when May tries it, Kyo finds out that theory and practice are two  different things.  She suggests that he try it himself, but to him that's  not the point.  Reality has intruded in his life of theory, and he is not  about to get over his feelings of jealousy and betrayal.<br />This is an  interesting story about interesting people but it doesn't have the  sustained intensity of a thriller.	2000-01-04

His eventual capture is a highlight in his life because he falls in love with Clelia, the warden's daughter.  The author isn't too kind to the loving couple.  Their  separations are for moronic reasons, and their meetings have moronic  restrictions.  The ending isn't exactly like popping the cork on a bottle  of French champagne.

Chekhov described his depressing play  as a comedy.<br />Julien Sorel is a poor young peasant in France.  He becomes  a tutor for a rich family, so of course he has a love affair with his  employer's wife.  The next time he works for a rich family it is the virgin  daughter he falls in love with.  The book is French, don't forget.  Similar  to romance in Proust, the lady despises Julien for loving her, but falls in  love with him when she thinks he loves someone else.  The stakes are raised  when his earlier lover, the married woman, returns to the story to break up  his new relationship.  Is it hatred?  Is it love?  Right here we have to  break off because things start happening fast and we can't ruin the ending  for you.<br />I like happy endings.  I wouldn't compare this one to a Yankee  fan watching the Yanks win the World Series.  Be prepared to chuck it all  and just laugh.	2000-01-03

Then he  refuses to do something else, and something else.  You know, come to think  of it, he's not doing a damn thing.  I guess you're not surprised to learn  that he gets fired.

His wealth didn't do him or his family a bit of good.<br />His beloved wife died young, leaving him two adored  daughters, Anastasie and Delphine.  Goriot gave away all his money to them  when they married.  He wasn't allowed to live with either daughter.  After  all, he was just a baker and they and their new husbands were high society.   So the old man spent his life in a flophouse.<br />In this world of French  high society, family values go something like this.  Everyone commits  adultery openly.  Husbands give their wives very little money to live on.   Instead they spend on their girlfriends.  Wives fall desperately in love  with scoundrels.  As Frank Zappa once said, I'm harder than your husband -  to get along with.<br />Enter our hero, Eugene de Rastignac, the one innocent  person in the book.  Granted that his values are distorted and his ambition  in life is to be a high roller in society, but he's French so what do you  expect?<br />It's a small world.  He lives in Goriot's flophouse and they are  great friends.  He enters society and meets a terribly unhappy wife and  jilted adulterous lover, a girl named Delphine.  Where did we hear that  name before?<br />Will Eugene and Delphine fall in love?  Will Eugene make it  in French society, as if we care?  Will old pere Goriot's daughters come to  visit him before he dies?  Some of these questions might be answered by the  end.	2000-01-03

But when I read this book and a number of the author's short stories I couldn't escape the conclusion that Nathaniel Hawthorne wasn't a great writer.  He doesn't belong among the immortals of  literature.  His short stories are predictable.  After reading Hawthorne I  read some Herman Melville and found him to be far better.  The one thing in  Scarlet Letter's favor is that it is politically correct.  It's satisfying  that the intolerant religious fanatics are the bad guys.  The villain of  the story is respected Roger Chillingworth, and the heroine is his wife  Hester Prynne, adulteress.  Would you consider it adultery if the husband  was missing for years and assumed dead, as is the case here?  It's not  enjoyable to read about religious intolerance.  The book gets quite dopy  when something magical happens to Hester's boyfriend at the end, something  right out of The Exorcist, and typical of Hawthorne's silly writing.  It  gets even dopier when Hester deserts her happy family to return to misery.   Hawthorne has a thing for magical events and foolish endings.	1999-12-30

Riso divides each of the 9 personality types into 9 levels, giving us 81 different readings.  The readings are in depth and on target.   The levels bleed into each other, so you may find that you identify with  levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 of your type, for example.  Riso also does an  excellent job of describing the two wings to every personality type, so if  you know your type you will probably be able to recognize your wing easily.   I'm sure there are other possible systems of differentiating people from  each other by type, besides this and Myers-Briggs, that haven't yet been  discovered, but Riso's enneagram should be more widely known than it is.   Educated people should know their type.  Some people make the argument that  individuals are all unique, that there are no types, but this attitude  basically tells us not to try to understand human nature because it's too  complicated.  This excellent book gives us a good system to understand  people.	1999-12-30

Some of it is boring, slow reading.  Marcel, how about submitting this to an editor and whittling it down to size?  We don't all have seven months to kill.  But even with this serious  complaint, I give this book 4 stars out of a possible 5.  The characters  are great.  The protagonist (let's call him Marcel for argument's sake) is  quite a character.  His sweetheart Albertine is unforgettable.  He loves  her but is afraid to tell her so, fearing that if he reveals his  vulnerability to her she will step all over him.  But she already knows  that he loves her, so he's completely off the mark.  She fears that he will  never forgive her for her sexual experiences, particularly for her  bisexuality, and will never marry her.  A marriage proposal from him would  solve both of their problems and would end her days of sexual promiscuity,  but Marcel blows it.  When he is told that she's gone for good, in more  ways than one, he is heartbroken.  And yet, the funniest part of the book  occurs years later when Marcel is vacationing in Europe and receives a  letter bearing the signature of Albertine.  By this time, Marcel is  interested in another cute girl, so he tosses the Albertine letter in the  garbage.  After all those tears!  Another hysterical and ridiculous  character is Charlus, social lion and seducer - of young men.  His  reappearance later in the book as an old man getting tortured is  pathetically funny.  It reminds you of the old joke Ow! Don't! Stop! Don't  stop!  The recurrent theme of the book is that love is born of pain.  We  don't fall in love with someone until that person causes us pain or  abandons us.  Love is agony.  Leave it to Marcel Proust to come up with  that one.	1999-12-30

What would a respected scientist have to say on the subject?  What would he think the  aliens would be like?  Unfortunately Carl Sagan didn't write the book I  thought he wrote.  We don't meet any aliens in this book.  In order to make  contact, it's not enough to just make contact with ourselves.  Without  spoiling the ending, I'll just say that the characters don't end up shaking  hands with Bob Schultz from the planet Nebulus.  What this book is about is  the stubborn, corrupt stupidity of the scientific establishment and the  cowardice of our space travelers who knuckle under pressure.  It's a stupid  book.  It's about as satisfying as banging the top of your head against the  inside of your car after you return the ice scraper to the glove  compartment.  This is the only case I know where the movie is far superior  to the book instead of the other way around.	1999-12-30

His two best sellers, Heaven Knows What and Astrology for the Millions, were printed in mid-century yet aren't the least bit outdated.  They remain two  of the best astrology books in existence.  In Heaven Knows What, Lewi does  a page on every possible Sun-Moon combination, explaining how an Aries with  an Aries moon differs from an Aries with a Taurus moon, etc.  His readings  are obviously built on his personal observations, not just on theories  about what the signs are supposed to be like.  They are very unique.  The  back section of the book explains natal aspects (Sun conjunct Mercury,  etc.).  As for his quick horoscope calculations, I just ignore them.  If  you want your chart done, get your chart done.<br />In Astrology for the  Millions, Lewi goes the more traditional route, explaining the effect of  the Sun, Moon and planets in all of the signs.  His unique style shines  through, and he is right on target, which is why he is the best there ever  was.  If all astrologers were as good as Grant Lewi was, the field of  astrology would be a respected field instead of being considered by most as  a pseudo-science.	1999-12-30

This is a book that should be required reading in schools all over the world.  It tells the truth about slavery in our time.  There are young African girls being enslaved in major cities like Paris, half-starved and  tortured.  There are little children in India and Pakistan working  unbearable jobs all day every day for no pay.  There are the sex slaves  working in Thailand, unable to escape, picked up by the corrupt police when  they try, and beaten, raped, and returned to the brothel where they are  beaten and raped some more.  There are the slaves of Mauritania, Brazil,  and on and on, each with their own story.  Of course there are topics not  covered in this book, like the kidnapping and forced prostitution of  French, British and American girls in the Middle East and Japan.  But this  book will motivate you to join Anti-Slavery International and become a  modern day abolitionist.	1999-12-29

It's incredible the way Arab women allow themselves to be treated by their men.  They've got to be the most spineless creatures on earth.  This true story tells some of the atrocities that Arab men commit against their wives  and children.  The Saudi Arabian princess who told the story is an  activist, but not much of one.  She simply gives her word that she won't do  anything.  Why?  Anyway, an interesting book, and very fast reading.  The  title is misleading because Princess Sultana's daughters aren't the main  characters in the story.  I like the way she reveals how quirky, how odd,  she is.  Actually, her husband comes off very well, a patient, tolerant,  gentle man who puts up with a high-strung wife.  Why expect him to be more  of an activist for women's rights or anything else.  He's filthy rich.  The  only member of Sultana's family who takes positive action in a just cause  is her son.  Maybe the enlightened men of the Arab world will straighten  things out.  It doesn't seem like the women will.  They're too afraid, too  beaten down.	1999-12-29

The war is Napoleon's invasion of Russia, a complete fiasco because Napoleon failed to make provision for the Russian winter and the absence of food for his invading army.  It's a long but generally quick read, sometimes as hot and  scandalous as the gossip on TV.  The strength of the book is in the  characters.  There are five Russian families to follow - the fabulously  wealthy Bezukhovs, the slimy Kuragins, the cerebral Bolkonskys, the  spirited Rostovs, and the crafty Drubetskoys.  There are few characters in  literature as memorable and adorable as Natasha Rostova, as a child and as  an adult.  Don't be intimidated by the size of the book.  This isn't Proust  or Joyce.  It's not that difficult.  And it's a really good story.<br />It's  not perfect.  Tolstoy throws some rather crackpot ideas in.  He believes  that Napoleon and other historical figures (we can assume Hitler and Stalin  would fit his criteria) have no influence on history - they are simply  pawns in the game of fate.  Why not just  say that everything that you and everyone else has ever done and ever will  do is nothing but preordained fate, having nothing to do with you, beyond  your control or influence.  Tolstoy is a much better storyteller than he is  a philosopher.  The only way to make any sense of his philosophy is to take  it in small doses and just admit that world leaders wouldn't have risen to  power unless they met the perceived needs of some of the people they  governed.	1999-12-29

I liked Brothers Karamazov very much but I found Crime and Punishment to be pretty annoying, without any payoff.  We have to follow the convoluted mind of a  moron.  The police detective just assumes that he will confess sooner or  later because he's a gentleman, not a poverty-stricken crook.  What's that  about?  Why the hell would you assume that a murderer would confess?  Must  we suspend our disbelief and our common sense before opening the book?   Raskolnikov is an annoying person to read about, and I don't find him  terribly realistic either.  If he is such an idealist, why doesn't he  regret, most of all, killing the shy lady?  Why does he forget her as soon  as he dispatches her?  And that ending - I'm not going to spoil it for you  but I'll just say I don't believe it.  After reading this thoroughly  mediocre book I was really amazed at how good Brothers Karamazov is.	1999-12-29
