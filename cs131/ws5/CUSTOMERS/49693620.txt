The author pairs archival photos with current photos to give the reader an idea of how places in the Bay Area have evolved. <br /> <br />I think this is a good book if you are into \\"How Buildings Learn\\" by Stewart Brand. Its also a good book if you are an older person and want to show the kids what the old town was like way back when. <br /> <br />What I found particularly interesting was how some places change more than others. Alameda, for example, is like The Land That Time Forgot. I used to joke with people that it was the only city in the Bay Area where you could order chicken a la king in the 21st century. One architectural detail that went by the wayside are these balconies that the Victorian buildings had on the second floors. Pity, they must have been nice to stand on on a sunny day. Places that had any kind of money (other than Alameda) had the misfortune of the land becoming so valuable that the lovely buildings all were mowed down for more contemporary buildings. A sad example is the Lake Merritt area, which is littered with ticky tacky apartment buildings with thin walls.  <br /> <br />Anyway, if you like architecture, memories, buildings, or the Bay Area, this book may be for you.	2005-10-04

For a pilot, it is important to understand what sort of weather you are going to be flying into. If you don't spend a lot of time studying meteorology, it can be difficult to conceptualize what kind of cloud formation is ahead of you. Some of the pilots' literature have rather weak illustrations. <br /> <br />This book is an excellent supplement to any pilot's training manual in providing visual aids for learning about spotting weather phenomnena. <br /> <br />Also, in general, it is very enjoyable to page through the book, as the quality of photography is very good.	2005-10-04

It is the same driving curiosity that has people going to open houses. They're not after buying the house, they just want to see what the neighbors did with the place. <br /> <br />This book is refreshing because, face it, no one but yuppies in McMansions and the inaccessible rich have very large houses. The magazines and books feature houses that make the majority of people (who live in cities) sigh with despair. <br /> <br />This book shows how people have done up their abodes. The humblest was a Columbia student's dorm room (like a trip to the wayback machine - I think I had a few beers in that room 20 mumble years ago). On the other end of the spectrum are some glossy apartments owned by well to do men of Good Taste. In between are a grandma, some young folk, people who just love rent control, and artists. <br /> <br />I keep the book by my bedside and enjoy looking at how people can  make the smallest of spaces comfortable and distinctive.	2005-10-04

Dr. Grandin does not talk with the animals, but she takes the time to think deeply about what is on their minds.  While many of us will walk into a situation with animals and think nothing of it, Grandin will take the time to deeply observe the environment and think about how she would react to it as an animal.    Her fascination with animals has lead her into a career where she advises stockyards on humane treatment of animals. Her rules for running a stockyard are simple - she breaks it down into a short list, mostly an observational one. If the animals limp, cry out, need to be prodded, or are not humanely killed, she will flunk a facility. She says that a facility does not need a long worksheet to check off - it simply has to meet her short list of rules, which are result oriented. If the animal is uncomfortable in one of the ways described, no amount of paperwork is going to cover it up.    Grandin describes the emotional makeup of animals, mostly focusing on hoofstock, which are her professional focus. She does describe at great length, dog behavior. There are different kinds of aggression, not just one, and she does an excellent job of describing why an animal will behave in an aggressive fashion.    She does make some generalizations that I don't necessarily agree with. She thinks animals with pale pelts and blue eyes show a tendency toward instability. She also asserts that marmalade cats are fearful. (She's never met some of the affable ginger cats that I've met.) This probably arises from the fact that her book tends to be observational rather than a compilation of other writings. She does say that she is visual and not verbal, which explains why her personal experiences have more weight in the narrative.    She claims that her ability to view the world as an animal would comes from her autism, but I honestly think she is just gifted with a kind of patience and sensitivity that not very many other people share. (I say this as the friend of an autistic person and a friend of  a parent of an autistic child).     I will say that because of how her mind works and how she is visual and not verbal that the language of the book is very accessible to the lay person. She does not bludgeon us with technical vocabulary, which many PhDs will do in their books. Her sentences are short and simple and she gets her point across in a very concise way without a lot of jargon and technical terms. (We know a horse is a horse - of course, of course - and don't need words like \\"equid\\" and so on.)    As an urban person, I found the book valuable in understanding cattle and horses, which are not really in my world. Next time I see a cow, I will have to resist the urge to lie down in the field and see if she will come up and say hello...	2005-10-02

She was a pleasant surprise - a beautiful woman who was unselfconsciously funny. <br /> <br />The earthy title will give you some clue as to how Ms. Alley expresses herself. She's blunt, funny, honest and about as vulgar as most people I know these days. Its an interesting memoir. I've wondered about her Scientology. She does not preach about it, but treats it as a useful tool in her life. <br /> <br /> She discusses her weight with a kind of honesty I appreciate. She cops to the fact that she was just eating a lot and needed to stop.  <br /> <br />What I found most remarkable about her is that she just pragmatically goes and does things. She had a few different careers and just decided to go to LA and become an actress. Just like that. She did, appearing in the Star Trek movie when she was almost 30 years old.  I wish I had that kind of confidence. <br /> <br />The  book is a breezy read. She cribs a few Bridget Jones-isms in her narrative, which is noticeable, but does not detract from it. Her stories are funny and unflinching. <br /> <br />If you want a diet book, this is not it. Its a memoir and a breezy one at that. If you like Kirstie Alley, read it. Its fun!	2005-09-25

Little did I know it was populated by flocks of hard core adventurers who drop everything and fly cross-country, hire guides, endure hip deep snow, vomit prodigiously off the sterns of boats, and live for days on peanut butter and pretzels for the thrill of spotting 700+ tweeting,hooting,squawking,shrieking birds all in the space of one year.     The rules of the game are simple. You find a wild bird, spot it, and document it. How hard can that be? Well, you cannot go to the San Diego Zoo to do it, for starters. (That's what I'd do.) Oh, yes, there's the little detail that there are about 670 different birds native to the United States. Note the number 700+, above. You must be able to spot stragglers who have been swept into the country via storms, confusion, or accidental introduction as a non-native. This takes a sharp eye and lots of study.    The challenge to do in one year what many birders do in a lifetime not only drew in the three main protagonists of our story, but an entire subculture and small industry. I was particularly interested in the description of one salty woman who takes people on special boat tours off the coast of California to view pelagics, birds who spend their entire lives offshore.     The writing is what makes this book. The author took three birders as his central focus, but extensively interviewed other folk peripheral to and involved in the drama. The pacing of the writing not only made sense out of the birders' erratic schedules, but also gave their stories a sense of excitement in the competition.     It definitely changed my attitude about birding, big time. Maybe I'll dust off the bird book a friend gave me and see what I can find in my own town.	2005-09-10

Levitt. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this thought-provoking book for its accessibility and its fascinating, albeit controversial, look at trends in crime, education, safety, and child welfare. <br /> <br />Its no \\"spoiler\\" to know that his position that abortion is the primary reason for the precipitious drop in crime since Roe v. Wade. By comparing the trend with the trends in Roumania when abortions were outlawed and the citizenry was basically ordered to produce children as fast as they could, he made some very strong points for the case. <br /> <br />This may deter many pious folk who believe that abortion is murder, however there are many other topics in the book that pertain to the welfare of those who have already been born - children. He analyses how certain economies can have a detrimental effect on child welfare in a way that goes contrary to what one may believe. If you are a pro-lifer, you may grit your teeth through that part, but find the rest of the book to your liking. <br /> <br />For example, if you give a teacher a large bonus for improving her charges' test scores, do you get better scores, a better teacher, a good syllabus, or mass cheating? <br /> <br />If you charge day care parents a sum for picking up the kids late, do you get angry parents, a cheap babysitting service, or kids picked up on time? <br /> <br />I could go on and on, however, I do recommend this book. It is not at all a slog or a boring tract. It appears to be a collection of related essays. Interestingly enough, most of them have to do with the education and prospects of children as they grow up.	2005-06-20

I do have two critiques. One is that the colors of the squares are a bit muddy. I am not too crazy about some of the color choices. Another is that a friend of mine went nuts trying to figure out how to start a circular run and the drawing of how to start a circle (chain, then link the chain in a circle) was incorrect. I thought she was exaggerating, but the drawing is, indeed, incorrect. It shows the thread of yarn coming from the wrong end of the short chain.  Fortunately, it only took a two minute explanation to clarify it. (Novices might want to consult another book or a friend in case they get confused.) <br />	2004-09-15

Most of this research is based on readings of scientific reports and journals and some is based on her conversations with experts in various animal-related fields. The result is a compendium of anecdotes and excerpts rendered into a witty and accessible form for the layperson.  <br /> <br />Normally, scientific literature can be pretty arcane and not exactly snappy reading. Ms. McCarthy flavors her excerpts with witty parenthetical commentary and questions that, in no way, detract from the matter at hand. <br /> <br />She covers not just tigers, but birds (her favorite seems to be a very clever parrot species called the kea), primates, and other mammals. She describes interesting stories about how young animals practice behavior when no one is looking (such as baby birds who test vocalize sotto voce), animal cultures (where one troop of primates would suddenly start performing some behaviors while other troops would not), and how animals need to see members of their own kind in order to socialize and mate later on. <br /> <br />	2004-07-27

My foodie friends in Berkeley jokingly refer to Alice's books as &quot;food porn&quot;. I have actually cooked a couple of the recipes and, while they are correct, they are exhausting. In Berkeley, CA, where the author's restaurant is thriving, it is easy to get the interesting and seasonal ingredients that are described in the book. However, the complexity of preparation of the recipes makes the book less acessible to most readers and home cooks.<br />The illustrations are lovely, as are the narratives. It is fun to just read the book and fantasize about being a hemp-clad, kinder version of Martha Stewart. However, it is not the most practical cookbook to stick in the cookbook holder when putting the family's meal together.<br />The real lesson behind this book is that foods that are in season taste better, are less expensive, and are fun to eat. Changing the menu as the seasons change keeps the experience of dining and cooking interesting and entertaining. Also, buying seasonal food is better for the environment than flying foods out of season from another hemisphere.<br />Take that wisdom, go to your store and get seasonal fruits and vegetables and use an easier and more accessible cookbook like, &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot;. But do keep this one on the coffeetable for those days you want to fantasize about being a world class hippie chef.	2003-12-27

I also love to jokingly compare people (most notably in a corporate setting) to primate groups.<br />What fascinated me about Will Self's book is how he managed to map chimpanzee behavior onto middle class English society. He came up with intriguing descriptions of how chimps who would be capable of creating a civilization analagous to ours would live in their households, behave toward each other, \\"talk\\", drive cars and so on.<br />Actually, some of the descriptions of the chimps driving and talking (using sign language with hands or feel, depending on how they are driving) fascinated me no end. <br />I got so wrapped up in the dystopic fantasy of waking up and finding oneself not only in \\"Planet of the Apes\\", but turned into one of the apes, that I really don't have a lot to say about plot or to make any clever comparisons with great satirists, like Swift. To me, the book was a rollicking good \\"What If\\" fantasy and I think, if you think great apes are, well, just great, you may like this one a great deal.	2003-02-24

In the first book, a bored suburban woman develops a penis. She doesn't develop a true, honest to God, do-I-dress-left-or-right one, just a nub. There just is not a lot driving her, either. She just seemed like a sad little person, who never goes anywhere. In the companion story, a macho man develops a vagina on his leg. To use the AOL-type acronym, WTF? Why not commit? Why not put it where they generally are located? You certainly won't find one on someone's leg!<br />Both stories were too weak. He doesn't wake them up completely switched in gender, he does not really show how society treats men and women through the fresh eyes of someone who has undergone a full transformation. He just makes these oddball half-baked chimeras and has all of the consequence of the mutation be a result of their own internal ruminations.<br />Best ignore this one and enjoy his other, more entertaining books.	2003-02-24

It is not just your regular celebrity expose. It is also a look into the life of an academic family, the family of a severely handicapped person, and a look into British life.<br />Jane Hawking married Stephen Hawking, believing that his life would be a short one. They hoped to jam as much love and fulfillment into what they thought would be short years together. They married fairly young, had children right away and set to keeping house. (Boy, wasn't everyone surprised at his staying power!)<br />Jane (May I call her Jane?) describes the domestic details of a young family as well as the intrigues of her tweedy academic society at the University. Its a delightful look into how academes live, describing the politics, the society and the passion for learning. At various points, they travel to the States and other places in Europe and she enlightens us on the life of the learned in those places, as well. If you contemplate a career in academia, this book can be enlightening.<br />She, for many years, was an astounding caregiver, dealing with Stephen's (May I call him Stephen?) progressive physical decline and heavier demands. She managed to run the household, raise the kids, and literally haul him around for years before a serious respiratory incident forced her to bring professional nurses in full-time. She recounts battles with the British health care system, battles for access with the University, and the domestic friction that one would expect when one member of the family is so handicapped.<br />Jane got a PhD in her own right (you GO, girl!) in Spanish poetry and here is where the book loses a star. The book's a bit more wordy than it needs to be, on a number of fronts. My PhD buddies tend to write non-thesis material like that. I recognize the style. A bit of editing may have been nice. <br />Still, a worthy read for moms, academes, caregivers, stargazers, Spanish poets, Baroque musicians...	2003-01-15

The prose is bubbly, a touch over the top, and very upbeat. It is a pleasant book to read when you want a little pick-me-up. It borders on science fiction because, let's face it, the male object of interest is an extremely thinly disguised Richard Branson (CEO of Virgin Records) and the heroine is a sport shopper. This will not happen on our planet!<br />I found it gave me encouragement as I was planning to do some clothes shopping and the frothy tone of the book and the sheer joy of shopping convinced me the odious task of pawing through the racks at the Jones New York Outlet might possibly be jolly good fun. But, I digress.<br />Structurally, the book is good. There are no glitches in the plotline (a problem with genre fiction) and the story flows along nicely.<br />The only thing that weirded me out was the borderline pathology of her addiction to shopping. The author skates along the DSM IV in a teetery way. But of course, a literary character who is uncomplicated can be so boring.	2003-01-15

The book can be regarded as an excellent primary source of information from a historical point of view. These are anecdotes from people ranging from sharecroppers on up to highly placed executives, politicians, and professionals.  Terkel leaves no stone unturned, as these stories (grouped by occupation and social stratum) show how the Depression affected people in all walks of life in the United States.<br />No secondary source is going to prove as truthful as the stories themselves. No high-flying armchair analysis by a detached political commentator, PhD or windbag is going to give you the true flavor of what our country went through after October, 1929.<br />We are in the midst of an economic downturn that has 800,000 American citizens without unemployment insurance, a looming health crisis among unemployed members of the middle class, and a war on the horizon. If you want to be prepared and to understand the ramifications of this situation, I urge you to not only read this book cover to cover, but also to go out and find people who lived through this time and listen to their stories. Go to your grandparents, parents, elderly relatives, the old guy on the porch across the street, the local senior centers.

(For example, a lot of people do \\"fan fiction\\", where their favorite movie and TV characters have postively Baccanalian sex lives, and those writers gleefully share with their friends.

In a number of the stories, we see the world we already have, with some interesting and even humorous twist added. In other cases, the view is crafted in a spare manner that keeps to the story and doesn't indicate a fascination with recreational typing. The book touches on politics, science, computers, and a delightful Victorian secret society that I'd like to join. The vocubulary is a bit too rich for the kidlets, so give them the Potter books.  <br />And, yeah, I know Charlie.

I'd give this to a recent college graduate, for example.<br />I recently picked up the most recent one and found that old Paul's gotten much darker and more cynical about the workplace. I love him madly for it. He compares corporate types to primates and compares the bum-kissing at the office with literal bum-kissing (&quot;tuberosity maintenance&quot;) in primate troops. &quot;Demented&quot; is the word that came to mind. I thoroughly enjoyed this edition - relished it. After you read this book, rent &quot;Office Space&quot;. It will cheer you up in Dark Times. Unlike &quot;Dilbert&quot;, Lareau lays it out for you and gives you some commonsense rules to keep upper management happy and make your work life simpler and more productive.	2002-03-28

There are several pages, outlining the history of the concertina, some tips on playing and concertina care, which one can find on the Web for free.<br />There are two pages of useful chord diagrams. These are only useful if you play the 30 button Anglo. Those of us (beginners) who purchased a (cheaper) 20 button are out of luck on those. The same can be said about the fingering chart provided.<br />Therefore, I think he should have titled this thin tome, &quot;Handbook for the 30 Button Anglo-Chromatic Concertina&quot;.<br />Then, there are 10 songs printed out. One can do better than that, especially for songs in the public domain.<br />If someone is serious about finding tunes, they can be found in various web pages or in actual compilations of music that have more songs than this one. Given that concertinas are used for folk songs, one can find large compilations of tunes in the public domain. Also, one can just learn to play by ear.	2001-09-23

I got curious about California impressionism a few years ago when someone saw my sketchbook and pointed out that what I was doing was called &quot;plein air&quot; art. One of my favorite things to do is to go up into the hills over Berkeley with my sketchbook and get pastel dust all over my nose and on some paper. I poked around for quite a while to find more images of this style but felt like  the images I was seeing were not the real deal. They looked  a bit flat and dull.<br />I had the good fortune of seeing an exhibit in Oakland, California at the museum there and got hooked on the luminous colors in the paintings. I managed to view the collections in Irvine and Laguna beach. I don't recall where I got this book, but I took it with me to Laguna Beach and held the pages next to some of the originals. <br />This books is the only book I have seen that comes even close to reproducing the beautiful and luminous quality of this genre of painting.  For me, this book is helpful for those occasions when I struggle with picking a color in one of my own works that hits the quality of light I am trying to arrive at. Plus, it is wonderful to just sit back and say, &quot;Wow.&quot;<br />I will be the first to admit that I have not read the text carefully. I just skimmed it. But the color quality and selection of images merits two thumbs up, a gold star and a California sunset.	2001-03-30

But, right away, Goad describes the horrors of indentured servitude among the white underclass. While slaveowners mistreated their slaves, they knew that they had an investment in the people they owned. Indentured servants, because of the finite term they served, were used as hard as possible to get the most work out of them before their term was up. This caused a huge rate of fataility among such people. This is one of the number of tidbits of history you don't get in your &quot;normal&quot; history book.<br />I think that the material covered is valuable for many an armchair historian and fear that the tone of the book and Goad's free hand with profanity and ethnic slurs (which I suspect are intended to amuse and make a point of &quot;we're all in this together down in the underclass&quot;) will deter the more sensitive reader from taking in the information in this book.	2001-01-15

This is a great reference for artists who want to create  realistic images of animals in motion. It's a fabulous settler of bar room  bets. It's a source of animated gifs for web designers (I have the running  cat image that's been going around.)<br />For people who want to understand  animals in general, this is a good reference. I never thought that all the  ways an animal can go from point A to point B each had a name to it and  that a quadruped can have so many ways to move.<br />Its an interesting  historical piece, too. People do not see horses doing useful work any more  and it's a reminder that we all had a life before internal combustion. Its  an interesting chapter in the history of photography and the history of  art, too. (Painting was never the same after people figured out how animals  really moved.)	2000-08-16

It is hard to get your friends to peel off all their clothes and suspend themselves in midair, I will grant  you that. <br />Also, it does not fill up half the book with those inevitable  chapters telling the reader, &quot;This is a pencil, you can draw with it  and use an eraser, too. This is a watercolor brush...&quot;<br />However, most  of the poses in this book are unnatural poses of people making gestures I  don't see in real life. A large majority of the images are of women, and  skinny L.A. style women at that. (Interesting shave, there, missy.) Some of  the photos are very, very dark and don't reveal anatomy at all. Also, they  are very grainy. I don't know if this is a function of the film or the  printing process (to keep the cost of printing an all-photo book down.)<br />I  have to say, it was one of the better ones in the bookstore, but it leaves  a good bit to be desired. It would have been nice if there were more males  in it, the poses were more natural, and there were people of different  sizes and (hello?) colors in there, too.<br />I have been using it to draw  from, but all the flying in the air spreadeagle poses are not going to make  it into my sketchbook. I think I will invest in a good magnifying glass and  do some drawings from Muybridge's photo collections of people and animals  in motion.	2000-08-16

For example, he had men shouldering  rifles, women walking up stairs, men playing baseball, a little kid  crawling, people with disabilities walking,  people carrying objects and so  on. Not only were the collections in the form of sequences of shots showing  the movement, but they were done from several angles at the same time, so  you could see the activity (throwing a bucket of water) front, back and  sideways.<br />Some folks I knew at Autodesk scanned these images into their  computers to test early versions of their Animator products. Others have  made animated gifs out of Muybridge photos for their web pages. Others just  sit and look at them because it's so interesting to see the care in these  shots (not to mention all those charming Victorian hairdos :-)). My only  (and this is only) beef with it is the images are quite small. <br />It, and  the companion book about animals are very useful and enjoyable, indeed, and  there isn't a lot of chatter.	2000-08-16

The book has hundreds of photo-watercolor pairs to help a  watercolorist who might be struggling with a particular problem in  representing a scene in nature in watercolor. <br />There are pages on basic  techniques and what they look like.<br />There are very specific examples. I  had to chuckle at the sheer number of pages and pages of different kinds of  cloud formations, for example.<br />The reason why I give it 4 and not 5 stars  is that some of the examples were flat and the descriptions too pat. The  best advice to give a budding landscape artist is to go LOOK at the world  and   (as Frida Kahlo said) paint what you see. The examples were a little  too cookbook and there is the danger of the student spending too much time  at the feet of the master and not enough time at the feet of Mother  Nature.<br />So, go look at a nature scene, take a crack at painting what you  see, maybe take your own photos of it for draftsmanship later, and then  refer to Petrie's book if you get stuck. Or just enjoy it over a cuppa tea  when relaxing at home.	2000-08-09

However, there appear to be no  thematic groupings or progression of information in this book.  There's  working with white, then using a limited value range, then emphasising  texture, then monochrome, then a focal point. <br />It would have been better  if it started with how to handle to materials, then how to compose the  work, then how to edit the image (simplifying the composition), then form,  then color.<br />If you already know what you are doing, it's a nice book to  flip through. If you feel discouraged because you think &quot;it can't be  done&quot; when you are looking at some complex pattern in nature or a  photo, just look at the illustrations. The artist can handle some pretty  dicey things like complex foliage.<br />The desert scenes, I'd like to say,  are yummy. Wonderful. I think that desert scenes are the illustrator's  forte. If he or she did a book just on desert painting, I'd get it.	2000-08-09

I have the older edition. It's got some campy early  80's scenes in it, but I found it essential in understanding how color hits  building materials. If you are an architect or architectural student, you  will need this book so that you can put some life into your drawings. If  you are just an amateur like me, you still need this book.<br />Learning how  to draw using Doyle's techniques is useful for travel diaries, sketching,  and so on. Since you are using color markers and pencils and blending the  colors, you get a kind of richness and depth in drawings that don't come  from just one medium alone. Also, the media (markers and pencils) are dry  and won't spill in your backpack or attache when hauling it around places  to do sketches and so on. (I took a mess of pencils and markers to Europe  and it was easier to deal with than the trip I took after, where my  watercolor paint froze on the travel diary!)<br />I'm gonna put the latest  edition on my wish list and hope Santa is good to me this season :-)	2000-08-09

I adored Paul Fussel's &quot;Class&quot;, and enjoy this book quite nicely. He does admit right up front that he (at the time of the writing) is 55 years old. He starts off by describing the concept of  shame in a cross cultural sense and maps its decline along the lines of out   of wedlock births. There are some very telling graphs showing a somewhat  constant rate, which suddenly skyrockets in the 1960s. He goes on to skewer  television and how it glamorizes anything that rivets the attention of the  demographic most likely to try new products. He  nails some media icons who  are noteworthy for nothing more than their apparent lack of shame at the  misdeeds they have perpetrated or have had perpetrated on them.<br />He also  describes and correctly uses the word schadenfreude, which makes me love  him dearly. A curmudgeon with a glorious vocabulary.<br />The downside to all  this, of course, is that the man is shouting into a wind tunnel. As people  who lived before the advent of the 1960s (or whose parents raised them with  pre-TV values) die off, there will be a whole new culture of vulgarity left  behind. But, in the interim, it's nice to know one is not alone in  wondering where the constant boundary-pushing is ever going to end.	2000-08-01

Her earlier works were bits and commentaries on life, but this one takes a group of characters and builds a web of stories and community. Each  character is unique and interesting as a character, something you just  don't often see in comics.<br />For example, although Watterson's &quot;Calvin  and Hobbes&quot; series has some wonderful characters in it, they never  change. He took a moment in a child's life, froze it, and riffed on that.  Bechdel starts at a time in her characters' lifes, shows a lot of  personality within one or two panels, and moves them forward through time.  Their characters have an arc and they do change.<br />These strips are all  from a series published as she went along. So, it's all rather Dickensian,  isn't it? I wonder sometimes how she decides how things will go. Given that  they are published in real time, she has an opportinity to map the  character's lives to those of her community and to current events.<br />I view  this as the only &quot;soap opera&quot; worth following.<br />For those  unfamiliar with her work, be advised that the subject matter (certainly in  the supplemental bit added to the end of the book) is on the mature side.	2000-08-01

I was in the mood for cartoon books, picked up hers, and noticed that her characters had four fingers to go with their thumbs, were  mostly female, had women of all races and shapes, and they were drawn in a  reasonably anatomically correct manner.<br />Although I am not a lesbian (but  am a friend of the family), I was drawn to the richness and humanity of  Bechdel's characters. When I saw the drawing of one woman cowering under  the bedcovers and her partner going after a stray bat (animal) with a  tennis racket, I roared with laughter and took the book to the checkout  line.<br />If you are straight and want a gentle and humorous look into  lesbian life or are lesbian and just want a warm &quot;me too&quot; kind of  chuckle, this is the book for you.	2000-08-01

I had found an abandoned rabbit in a vacant lot and planned to catch it on a Saturday. I went to a pet store that morning, grabbed this book, which was the only one on rabbits in the store, and used it to just get started. I caught the  rabbit that night and sat on the bathroom floor in a pile of oat hay and  carrots, flipping through the book and just not seeing answers about how my  little friend was going to fit into my life and household. <br />It had a few  basics that I really needed to know, but just did not delve deeply enough  into how to care for rabbits. It also seemed to focus on the topic/issue of  children as rabbit owners, which contradicts a bit the advice in the more  complete Harriman book on house rabbits. (Children are a bit too rough and  tumble for timid and fragile rabbits and Harriman recommends waiting till  the kids are big or just getting a really big rabbit.)<br />I would recommend  it for a child to read to get a general idea of how to care for a rabbit,  but not for someone who seriously wants to take excellent care of a rabbit  as housepet. The photos were lovely, I must say, and it does describe  breeds a little bit.	2000-05-03

It is very practical about how to get rid of clutter and ways to think about it.<br />Then she ruins it in the last chapter by going off on a tangent about how your average person has a colon full of  things from years past, has a ridiculous drawing of a wiggly colon and  insists that the reader rush off to an herbalist for a colon cleanse to get  rid of all these accretions from days of yore.<br />I have an acquaintance who  is an herbalist, who said it was total nonsense and said that a  sigmoidoscopy is going to reveal a smooth, pink interior to one's plumbing  and not accretions and agreed it was all very strange.<br />I would suggest  Ms. Kingston keep to what she is good at and keep her crackpot theories to  herself.

When you get it, you really do have to assume some knowledge and practice of making art and the media, however, she goes over materials and techniques, which can serve as a good  refresher or   initial exposure.<br />The best part is a discussion early on  about how to pack all the materials so you don't keel over from exhaustion,  hauling too much art gear, along  with the usual standard hiking goodies.  (I especially needed help with that, given my childlike adoration of way  too many pretty colors.)<br />The emphasis is on SKETCHING, not doing the Mona  Lisa. This is important in outdoor work as light changes and speed can be  of the essence. I sometimes pick up this book so that I can just relax my  techniques a bit. <br />The examples in the book, in many media and in  monochrome or color are a delight to view. Sometimes, it's just fun to sit  down with a cuppa and flip through the nice drawings of objects and scenes  in nature.	2000-04-14
