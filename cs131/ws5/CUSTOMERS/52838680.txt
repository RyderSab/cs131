I was getting pretty bored with wearing black suits with different color shirts every day. The authors of this book offer some great color photos with bright colors that mix well. I've tried some of the combos and it really does make you feel more cheerful during the day. They recomend saving black for elegant occasions--which really does make black more special. There is a lot of info about selecting undergarments. Proper foundation garments really enhance the mature figure and it's something I need to review more often. Only very young girls can get away with minimal or no undergarments.<br /><br />There is a big section on dressing well for pregnancy. I wish there had been a book like this when I was pregnant. I will hold on to this book just in case my daughter gets married and pregnant during the next couple years. This book would make a great gift to the newly pregnant. :)	2005-09-04

Her diet looked a lot like the South Beach Diet--which my husband and I both love--and lose weight on whenever we can get up enough energy to cook. :)<br />I have not tried any of her recipes yet and the only exercise I get is walking the dog every day--so can't tell if I would lose weight or not.<br />I did go in to my regular doctor and he had the lab run all the blood tests for hormones on me and I was pretty low. Also had the Dexscan and I had lost bone in my hip. Although he did not know much about the natural extract hormones--we do have a compounding  pharmacy in town--so he sent over the blood tests--and the pharmacist made up the hormones.<br />The first month--the dose was all the same and too strong--but the second month--he cut back on the overall dose--and rotated the hormones to give me a cycle.<br />Here has what has happened so far.<br />My body temperature has stabilized and I feel normal temperature again. Before--I was cold all the time.<br />My husband tells me that he sees more muscle tone--especially in my face.<br />I had a small period for a few days--but no PMS or cramps<br />I feel slightly younger and even bought a pair of high heels and have been wearing them.<br />I don't seem to be having any negative side effects. About ten years ago when I went through menopause--I tried synthetic hormones for about six months--but went off of them because they made my skin and hair coarse and made me feel really odd.<br />Suzanne's book explained very carefully how to go about getting the natural hormones, gave names and addresses of specialists, and told you how to get them if you had a supportive general doctor or compounding pharmacy in the area.<br />I was not even aware that this was available before I read her book.<br />Not many folks can afford to go to top of the line specialists and learn how to get and use these hormones--but obviously Suzanne Somers has the time and money--and she certainly has got good results. I think this book is a bargain and gives the rest of us that do not have this kind of access to good information a chance  without having to spend the thousands of dollars to experiment. I'm thankful that she is sharing this information with us.<br />Older women get very little real information of value when it comes to aging.<br />I'm even inspired to try and exercise more and go back on the South Beach Diet--if I could lose ten pounds before Christmas--I could look really good for my children when they come home for the holidays.

I've fallen in love with scrappy quilts, strip quilts, and quilts that grow a design as you work. Pattern quilts are pretty and fine--but process quilts are so fun and surprising that I look forward to working on them. What I love about this book is that the authors show you how to easily make transition blocks with motion added to them. They work with a 7\\" block that becomes a 6 1/2 inch block after a strip insertion--which is wonderful--because<br /><br />I can add all kinds of process blocks that are freeform to these and cut them out with a 6 1/2\\" square--which adds zillions of possiblities. I like the way the author treats value as important as color--but what I really love is now I can put motion into my process quilts. Most of the process blocks I have been putting together are variations of the blocks in Gwen Marston's books--but Sandi and Karen--bring in some refreshing new shapes,like the inserted strip block and irregular checkerboard block. The little block within a block is fun too. I know it's not<br /><br />new--but the way it's used as a small block sprinkled through a quilt is very fresh.<br /><br />I was forced to buy this book to take a course at a local quilt shop and now that I've read it--I'm glad I did. The color plates of the quilts are clear and bright and it is a joy to look at the blocks and the quilts. There are some great ideas for backgrounds<br /><br />with depth and movement against applique foregrounds that really get my eye used to a dynamic quilt. So far, we have made two of the blocks in class and they were very easy and fun and allow you a lot of time to play with the color, value, and motion without worrying about the block. Also--striped fabrics are explored--and<br /><br />I'm now on the lookout for striped fabrics to add to my stash. :)<br /><br />The Accidental Quilter<br /><br />[...]	2005-09-02

I have been waiting for this book and like it even more than Gwen's Liberated Quilts. (and I love it!) Liberated String quilts focuses on process instead of patterns and draws on color photos of antique quilts made in this manner to inspire more modern versions of string quilt process. I have made samples of Gwen's process and it is fun to make a quilt this way. If you have recently been bit by the scrappy quilt bug--you will be particularly thrilled with this book. Some of the types of quilts covered in this book are: string bars, pinwheel strings, strings and stars, Amish string, chevron sting bars, slanted bars, string tulip block, string baskets.<br /><br />The color plates of the quilts are clear and detailed and you could tell a lot about these quilts' construction by them.<br /><br />Gwen writes her directions and discussions with enthusiasm and clarity. I took her string quilt class a few years ago, and her books really do reflect her great quilting personality as well as offer good directions for string process quilts.	2005-02-21

I love the characters in this book. They have flaws and virtues and could all realistically exist in the pretend neighborhood of Anna Casey's world. (which is loosely based on a a very real neighborhood that is located a few blocks from the school where I am a media specialist.) Many of the students that have already read, \\"Crossing Jordan,\\" eagerly read this second novel of Adrian Fogelin and enjoy it very much. Not only because they recognize characters from the first book, but because there is much adventure and character driven<br /><br />comedy in this book as well.<br /><br />I have always felt that the cover of this book did not reflect the quality of the story within. I noticed that the cover has been changed--but it is still a cover to attract elementary school girls--while there is much in this story to interest both elementary and middle school boys as well. I'd like to see the Vietnam vet portrayed with a wooded scene and the two main characters hiding from him on the cover. This book is well written and entertaining and still deserves a more intriguing cover.	2005-02-20

She builds unique and fascinating child and teen characters and lets conflict build naturally with the characters and their circumstances bumping into each other. This is not the easiest way to build a plot in a young adult story--but it creates a bond between readers and characters that is seldom attained by most of today's young adult writers. \\"My Brother's Hero\\" not only has sea adventure and unique characters--it also has detailed nautical description of the Florida Keys.  Adrian also captures the love/hate relationship between siblings with believability and humor.<br /><br />This novel is enjoyed by both boys and girls in our middle school media center.<br /><br />This is a good read. An adult reading it aloud with a child would<br /><br />find much to enjoy too.	2005-02-20

But there is much more in this book. It opened my eyes to what a great quilting toy an all in one printer/scanner could be in quilt making. And I admit--within a week of purchasing this book--I ordered a HP all in one copier/scanner/printer/faxer--to replace my ailing printer which only did one trick before it began to fade and smear. :) It has not<br /><br />yet arrived, but when it does--I'll try and write a review of it too. :) There is much information about how to treat fabric with bubble jet set--which is something that would be helpful to a graphic artist/quilter who may want to treat huge quantities of it at home instead of buying the already processed/printer ready sheets. I made a photo quilt several years ago and had to print to iron on paper that I applied to muslin--which is a pain in the brain--so I was particularly interested in a fabric sheet that allows your inkjet to print directly to the fabric. All of these new updates in the scan and print world are presented in a quick and easy format with handy color photos. I also like the compact size of this book, because I can keep it on my computer desk, or take it around my studio to consult when trying new methods for the first time.l<br /><br /> Directions in this book include how to scan three dimensional objects, piecing oversized images , using virtual applique to combine photos and copying photos to fabric.<br /><br />Carol offers many troubleshooting tips, and offers practical advice right up front. For example, if you are scanning flowers and nuts to make fabric--she also tells you how to protect your scanner bed from scatching. If there is any stupid mistake that I'd likely make--Carol tries to steer me clear in advance. There is a short resource section at the end of the book and a table of<br /><br />contents.<br /><br />Tallahassee is a paradise in March and April with flowering trees and bushes everywhere.

(this is not an applique book)<br />This book is divided into ten main chapters that address the basics of quilt making from beginning to end. Chapters include an overview, templates (and how to make them), squares, rectangles and half-square triangles, triangles, polygons, circles, curves, and arcs, finishing the quilt top,backing , batting, basting, quilting, binding and labels.<br />Lots of diagrams, template patterns, and color plates, and a cute bunny cartoon character in boxes giving extra tips. I liked the power checklists in bold, large font. It lets you check at the end of a section to make sure you've done everything and the print is big enough to read without glasses.<br />The chapter on quilting is the most innovative I've read, with Michelle advising the beginning quilter to quilt by machine where<br />it doesn't show and quilt fancier patterns by hand where it does.<br />She also recommends a big needle and #8 perl cotton to give big bold stitches for the beginner instead of the tiny stitches that<br />drive new quilters wild.<br />There are also clear pictures of how to miter a border and how to<br />automatic miter the binding.<br />The book is very logical, helpful and fun in it's layout and I anticipate referring to it again and again.<br />:)	2003-03-18

I spent several hours relaxing with this book and read many of the directions for holiday projects that someone less exhausted than myself could have made one or two of before the holidays.<br />There was even a section on food projects such as Sand-Painting Brownies and Hot Chocolate Mix that looked delicious as well as speedy to do. And I would have done it if I had not found a new all time low in holiday cooking. (I ordered cookie dough from an Italian restuarant while I ate chicken marsala, and the nice chef delivered it to my husband at work and all I had to do was tie on an apron and slice and bake.)<br />Anyway, I fell so in love with many of the projects in this book that if I only made one a month for this coming year--I'd have all my gifts done for next year. My favorites are: Partridge Pincushion.(To die for-with real feathers--and I know where there is a taxidermy shop over the state line.),birdhouse welcome home banner,wreath pillow, French hen tea cosy,flying geese placemats,<br />French hen address book, calling bird Christmas cards, six geese a laying quilt,goose wall quilt,seven swans a swimming vest, Christmas cactus and currants pillow (this is stunning and if I ever make it, no one else is getting it.),lord of the manor apron and chef's hat( something a man in the kitchen would really like to get.), wreath door banner (this is really nice--not at all cutesy--but three wreaths from pieced triangles  with red bows and bells and the squares in the middle are naturals for custom embroidery--maybe your dog or cat's face?) twelfth hour quilt, and much, much more including menus and recipes for Christmas dinner and Christmas brunch.<br />This is my kind of Christmas book.

I have never met her or had her for a class, but I have learned as much about quilts and constructing folk art quilts from her books as I have with many terrific courses with big name quilters. Scrap Quilts is a workshop in a book! There are no patterns--she makes you create your own paper appliques in a chapter near the end of the book.<br />She also has a chapter of pieced block diagrams that work well with scrap quilts. She does not waste your time printing templates of classic blocks that you already have in other books.<br />Also--you can glance at the diagrams and rotary cut the pieces to<br />whatever size you want--so you are not locked in to a certain size block. The color plates of the the scrap quilt examples are awesome. (So are the photos of Roberta's toy sewing machine collection in the sidebars-- a bonus for all you tiny stitchers!)  Roberta has taken her evaluation of the scrap quilt process a step further than Gwen Marston in Liberated Quiltmaking (which is also an awesome primer on creative scrap quilts.)Gwen focuses on the process--but Roberta focuses on how to manipulate<br />color and design to enhance the process. She also shows you how to add freeform applique to pieced quilts and still retain the scrap quilt flavor. There is always attention to value, color, and fabric so that your quilt will end up a piece of original art<br />and not an imitation of someone else's work.<br />If you see your quilts as identical blocks of classic patterns--this book will confuse you. If you hunger to quilt your<br />life--this book will help you immensely.<br />For instance, Roberta has a picture of a quilt about her Singer Featherweight. She loves that featherweight and it shows in the quilt. It inspired me. I spent most of last night on my EQ designing a wall quilt for my Elna Grasshopper. I love it--but it<br />has a totally different personality than Roberta's featherweight.<br />My quilt will be very different--but she has several ideas that I will probably borrow. (such as the plaid background around the machine.) Also, her idea about using old sets of scrap blocks for a border has got me thinking and looking. I want to call my quilt<br />&quot;Grasshopper in the fabric stash&quot; surrounding an applique center block with scrap rail fence fabric--but I may audition some scrap<br />pinwheels that I pieced at random in Gwen Marston's suprise quilt class.<br />That's one of the things I love about Roberta's books. She gives me lessons that fit in perfectly with the classes I've had with<br />Gwen Marston, Joen Wolfron, and Margaret Miller. I can take projects I've started in their classes and incorporate them into<br />something she's pushed me to dream up.<br />A great book--don't miss it!<br />:)ideas that I will probably borrow.

I would still buy this book for this pattern alone. Plus it's laid out one block at a time, so that you may have your very own block of the month club right in your own home. Sewing an entire quilt at once is too overwhelming for me, but one block at a time is great. The print in this book is easy to read, and the directions are clear.<br />The applique patterns are clear line drawings that will<br />be easy to trace from the book to freezer paper. There are many smaller projects to make that compliment this grand wall hanging.<br />I may try one or two on my way to completing this quilt. I particularly like the sunflower wall hanging and the chickadees in the window wall hanging. There is also a wonderful baking day wall hanging for the kitchen, and a small squirrel wall hanging that is displayed on a branch hanger. Some of these smaller projects would look great in a mountain cabin or in an office to<br />bring a little of the outside season indoors.<br />The color illustrations are very clear. You can even see the quilting stitches on some of the wall hangings. I always have a hard time deciding what to quilt in the blank areas around applique, and Lois Fletcher has some great ideas for simple, yet effective quilt patterns in these spots.<br />For any of you dulcimer players out there,directions for an autumn leaves bell pull is included. If you were to widen this panel a few inches, it would be perfect to place your wall hung dulcimers over to give your instrument a little cushion against the wall.<br />I'm glad I bought this book.	2002-08-03

Stickle Quilt	Books	5	97	101	N	N	recommended by the accidental quilter	If you have any interest in vintage scrap quilts or quilts of the nineteenth century, this book is for you. I became interested in this book when my local quilt guild chose twelve squares from it<br />to make for the block of the month auction. The patterns are very<br />old fashioned, but satisfying.The blocks are tiny. 4 1/2 inches!<br />There is a photo of the actual quilt which has 225 blocks. Brenda<br />has drafted out a pattern for each and every one of them. If you know how to enlarge a pattern--many of these patterns would make<br />a wonderfully unique vintage sampler. Or you may want to use your<br />favorites to make a crib quilt. Of course, like Jane Stickle, you<br />could make the entire quilt. It is indeed a masterpiece and would be a way to use up a full scrap bag. And the rest of your life! The author shares much of Jane's history with us in the introduction. I particularly found the inscription on the signature block to be enlightening.<br />&quot;In war time 1863 pieces 5602 Jane A. Stickle&quot; Although this quilt is inspiring, it is not a fancy piece of art like the Baltimore Album quilts from this period. It is a huge sampler of pieced and applique blocks that might be seen on a quilt made for<br />the bed and warmth. All 5602 pieces counted and stitched while waiting for a war to end. Even if your interest in quilts is only<br />to bid on vintage quilts on ebay--studying these squares would help you be able to identify lesser known block patterns  from this period. I've browsed this book and read the history many a night in bed before I go to sleep. It's a great quilting book, but a nice documentation of one quilter's history too.	2002-08-03

I also love quilt books that come with CD software to help with design and pattern.<br />Although Barbara Brackman focuses on states to build a family story quilt--it can be the foundation for so much more.<br />The book itself is gorgeous, filled with facts and art from all fifty states. The software loads easily and is the same format as Electric Quilt which let me use it immediately.<br />I grew up in central east Florida in a neighborhood called Palm Bay Point. It's a small peninsula that juts into the Indian River. Hibiscus and orange trees decorate front lawns. Giant oaks  hold heron nests and palms sway in the salt breeze of the Indian River. Pelicans and dolphins are plentiful.<br />I designed a Palm Bay Point quilt as a test. Here is what I found. The applique designs as well as the state blocks were interchangeable. I was able to use hibiscus from Hawaii and Pelicans from Lousiana as well as Orange Blossoms from Florida.<br />Since the point is surrounded by water and sailboats are a frequent sight--I borrowed the Mayflower block from one of the New England states. The end product was a quilt that told a visual story of my childhood neighborhood.<br />I particularly liked the attention given to border(applique) design as well as the body of the quilt.<br />I can imagine designing many personal story quilts using this software and book.<br />I'm a fan of Barbara Brackman (although I have never met her.)<br />She researches her material well, her writing voice is easily read and understood. She has been on many quilting journeys of history and design and she is generous to share the highlights with others in a beautifully designed format.<br />I'm already having fun with this book. So far, it's my favorite book this year.<br />:)	2001-12-28

Fifty memorable quilts with discussion on inspiration and technique. This collection has quilts that could propell you toward a lifetime of quilting. Every quilter represented is not only an exceptional fiber artist, but she/he knows how to tell a story. (something that is often missing in the quilts of many traditional quilters.) There are many European quilters represented whose work I had never seen before in other collections.<br />The color plates are lovely and the slightly oversized volume allows the gazer to take in the small details often missed in smaller photos.<br />My favorite quilts are: Mom's Bread by Sandy Bonsib. (If you are interested in photo transfer quilting--she offers a wonderful example of how it can be used to tell a quilt story instead of being a collage of unrelated photographs.),My Heart's Delight by Mary Mayne. (I keep seeing this quilt in my dreams as a red and white quilt combined with redwork.), Bristol Stars by Judy Mathieson. (I made one Mariner's Compass block and I can't even imagine making a whole quilt of them--let alone in a circular arrangement--but I love to gaze at this color plate because it is<br />so wonderful to behold.) Also wonderful to behold are: Ginkgo Biloba by Ruth B. McDowell, Umbrella Thorn Tree by Maurine Nobel,<br />and The Greek Quilt by Sheena Norquay.(Study this quilt if you are interested in designing any type of quilt based on American Indian pottery or early cave drawings.)	2001-12-15

Jane Sassaman is a fiber artist in the zone. The color plates of her quilts are both awesome and inspiring. Her designs are inspired from nature and from historical designs. I particularly like the way she has taken the tree of life design and gone wild with it in &quot;Willow&quot; and several smaller studies.<br />There are some practical chapters in this book which should inspire and help quilters that are intrigued by the art quilt, but are not sure how to get started. (How to gather ideas and keep a sketch book, how to simplify designs for fibre construction, stylizing, adding depth and interest.) There is also a section where she explores machine embroidery with the quilting process. I love machine embroidery and I'm always looking for artistic ways to blend it with my quilting.<br />If you are a serious artist, collect this book so you can see what Jane is doing. If you're currently working in the zone--you are going to see some of these visions there.<br />If you are a beginning or intermediate quilter and are willing to<br />read and look at this book from cover to cover--it may influence your work when you get to the point you need to use design and color in innovative ways. Definitely a quilter's quilter book, but worth every minute you spend between its covers.	2001-12-15

I have very little practice in drawing, so when I saw this book of continuous line drawings, I bought it immediately. I would have bought this book for all the drawings of Pelicans if for no other reason.<br />Laura gives great instruction on how to set up an overall pattern, by choosing a focus design, then filling the background<br />with complimentary patterns. She also offers tips on the density of background stitching so that it does not become jumbled.<br />The book is presented clearly, and the continous line patterns are numerous. These are nice, solid, nature insprired patterns that I forsee using more than once. (I hate it when the designs are so cutesy that you never use them.)<br />I am already using this book to train my hands and eyes. I've tried sketching some of the leaf patterns onto a quilt border, and I trace around the continous designs with my finger to get the feel of them.<br />If you are already an accomplished machine quilter and have substantial art background, you won't need this book. But it is perfect for me in helping me in my quest for nicely designed machine quilting.<br />:)	2001-12-14

I took it with me to the quilt shop when I picked out the material for the 1912, Lady In An Elegant Red Hat workshop given by Linda Cantrell. My appliqued lady looked almost magical because her dress was of a cotton popular during this time. The book is broken into sections that reflect historical changes in textiles in the United States.(Pre-1830,1830-1860, 1860-1880,1880-1810, 1910-1935, 1930-1960. Color plate swatches are arranged by color and color examples are given of fabrics in faded colors as well. This is a boon to history buffs in documenting quilts with faded fabrics. I love redwork and have found the red examples in both the 1880-1910 and the 1910-1935 section to be helpful in selecting period appropriate reds. The 1830-1860 and the 1860-1880's swatches have helped me identify fabrics to use for Civil War reenactment. Truly a great resource for anyone interested in reproducing or identifying historical quilts.	2001-04-08

The instructions and patterns are clear and the designs are awesome. I particularly like the simpler patterns like double hearts, fleur-de-lis, and you are perfect (a pineapple design). I think it may be possible to machine applique as well as hand applique these designs. Of course, there are many intricate designs too--many that require rouched flowers and curved stems and intricate applique that I can only imagine being quilted by the most devoted. The directions on how to cut out the  patterns with paper folding are clear and helpful. You could spend a lifetime making the quilts in this book--and what a beautiful life you'd have!	2001-04-08

I bought this book immediately and I was not disapointed. Liberated quilting focuses on a process of scrap quilting that was used by our grandmothers and great grandmothers  to piece the homey utility quilts that our families slept under.  These are not the art design beauties that are crafted for quilt shows, but the home bound beauties that collect the scraps from out family lives. These are the quilts you take on the picnic--the quilts that are threadbare from love and use.  The process creation is almost magical and has a soothing effect on this quilter. The directions in this book are clear and inspiring. Thank you Gwen for discovering and passing on this method of quilting that is nearly lost in the modern world of quilting.	2001-04-08

I used to love  them, and I'm not sure why we never go on them anymore. But this book is a visual picnic of quilts, foods, and color plates of antique cars and wildflowers and cello's and wild countryside with fine china and the soul of every fine picnic you have ever dreamed about. This volume is full of the kind of quilting projects I like best--practical and beautiful. There is a bee and bee hive quilt tablecloth to make for your patio and there are recipes for poached salmon and mango salsa to set on it. There's an Indian Summer quilt to spread on the ground beside your old black convertible to nibble on your sweet hazelnut pound cake. There's even a pastel dream house quilt to drag out to picnic at the building site of your new home. The book is a nice size and has full sized applique patterns and detailed color photos of quilts, accessories and country vegetation at it's peak. The directions and recipes are clear and there's a chapter at the end on quiltmaking basics. The best part of this book is that after browsing it for a lazy Saturday afternoon--it incited me to plan a picnic--maybe I'll make one of the fabric lined baskets and invite my husband to a ride in the country on his old silver wing. I've got a t-shirt quilt with dragon flies quilted on it and the dogwood and azealias are in bloom.	2001-04-07

I loaded the CD in my CD alarm player and it plays every morning and is a delightful as well as gentle awakening to each day. Each cut is of a different dulcimer player and the selection is diverse. Since I am new to dulcimer playing, it gives me a way  to listen to a multitude of styles on the mountain dulcimer. There is the guitar blues style of Janita Baker, Don Pedi playing  his Appalachian style, Mike Casey with his hard driving Celtic pieces, Madeline McNeil on a tenderly rendered, Fanny Power.  Some other artists that are included are Jerry Rockwell, Susan Trump, and many others that I have heard for the first time. The book has a black and white photo of each artist, a short bio and full tablature and playing tips for his/her tune on the CD. I anticipate the photos will be helpful when you attend a dulcimer workshop and festival as you will be able to identify faces with playing styles. The only major player that I found missing in this collection was David Schnaufer. This collection is clear and thoughtfully arranged and would be a great addition to the library of any dulcimer player.	2001-03-15
US	52838680	RM08SWJ68Q3BP	0961493925	73893427	The American Dulcimer	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Most helpful beginning book	This is one of the best books I have seen written for a beginner. Rockwell uses several folk tunes that are widely known for examples and takes each tune through several techniques (single string melody, chording, fingerpicking)in two different tunings (DAD and DAA). Since you are likely to already know the melody--you do not have to struggle with memorizing a strange tune at the same time you are learning fingering and strumming and fingerpicking. Some of the tunes are: Simple Gifts, Streets of Laredo, Banks of the Ohio, Oh Susanna.  Rockwell understands that it is better to know a handful of songs  well than it is to play choppy renditions of many tunes. If you already play another instrument--you can apply this method  to your tunes on it. Once you master this method, which the author explains clearly and simply--you can go on and add any song you know by ear. The tabs are clear and easy to read. You don't even need a CD to go with it--but I highly recommend listening to one of Rockwell's Cd's as he is one of the best dulcimer players to have  ever existed.	2001-03-05

This book is for me. Layouts for sixteen quilts and all of them use straight line piecing. There are full color photos and advice on fabric choices. Best of all there are sample layouts to play with. I've always liked Margaret Miller's  approach of playing with design by breaking a block down to a couple basic shapes and playing with it. I'm glad that she's extended this method to quilt settings.	2001-03-04

Madeline MacNeil offers a map and directions and black and white photos to direct you on a modern pilgrimage of this trail, if you would like to experience the modern trail first hand. This is a trip I would like to take in the future. The history is straightforward and clear, and dulcimer tabulatures are given for tunes that came from different locations along the trail. Fascinating material to be used for entertainers, reenactors, storeytellers and dulcimer players. Audiences enjoy knowing brief histories and how tunes fit them. There are many early tunes in this instruction manual. The tab is clear and many early appalachian tunings are used.  The only recommendation that I would make, is it would be nice if  Madeline MacNeil and Ralph Smith had made an accompanying CD of all the tunes in the book. I would buy it!	2001-02-27

The concept of a young girl married to a young boy with TB so that her dowry may be used to buy medical treatment is a subject of fascination and interest to middle school students at my school. I read a great deal of YA fiction as a middle school media specialist, and I enjoyed this story as an adult.  Whelan has crafted a good tale with exotic detail that sweeps the  reader across the world. Boys and girls alike enjoy this story in  which Koly is able to use her creative talents to rise from a near impossible situation. Adult issues are addressed from a child's point of view and it is done well in this YA novel. The artwork on the cover is especially noteworthy. It is the exact right size to zoom in with a macro lens and tape for a booktalk. The girl in the drawing looks exotic and mysterious and  there is a look of yearning on her face that arouses the interest of readers. This is truly an example of a book cover that is an excellent and fitting visual introduction to a truly engaging tale.	2001-02-22

Then I discovered the CD and all the extras it includes--quilting stationary, quilt labels, gift tags, tutorials  on all the major techniques covered in the book and  a fun program that lets you change quilt colors when planning your quilt. It's not a big program like Electric Quilt, but it's user friendly and a chance to try out a quilting software feature. There is even printer fabric included on the back cover, so you can print out some of these great designs immediately. There are clear color plates and diagrams all through this volume and the directions are truly multimedia. The designs are fresh and whimsical. My favorites are the nuts and squirrels, my first quilt(sewing notions theme), my first home, and I need someone to love (kittens in baskets.) There are bed quilts as well as many house projects included.  I've had more fun browsing this book than any other quilt book I've seen this year. Pam Bono writes with a friendly voice that makes you feel like you are in her studio in Durango with her husband and bulldogs creating a quilting experience especially for you. I gave this book my Accidental Quilter's Book  of the Year Award.	2001-02-18

I read award winning young adult novels constantly, so it is a rare story that makes me cry.  This is the first YA novel that has made me cry since A Day No Pigs Would Die. Although the two main characters are girls, middle school boys constantly ask for this novel to read.  The characters are well developed and the plot moves at a steady pace--neither too fast or too slow.  Although the characters and setting accurately depict the west side of Tallahassee--this story is so much more than a regional novel. It is a story of friendship and neighbors and how hearts are stronger than bigotry. Fogelin knows how to build a story that is timeless in scope, but particular enough to feel the hope and forgiveness of the human heart.	2001-02-09

The history is a resource for historians and reenactors alike.  The vintage photos are mostly ones I've never seen before. This collection has the most vintage photos of lady banjo players  I have ever seen. The 1860's photo of a young woman playing the banjo on page 93 has enough detail for a reenactor to duplicate her dress and accessories as well as her banjo. The same is true of an 1895 photograph of a woman playing a Fairbanks Electric. The turn of the century all woman banjo band on page 10 is inspiring. It's great to know that there have always been lady banjo players and these photos give the lady reenactor a place to  start when planning a period costume to go with a period banjo.  There is a section of breath taking color plates in this book that allow you not only to see detail on some rare banjos, but also depict antique banjo clocks and memorabilia. I never knew such pieces existed until this book. A great book and a must have for anyone interested in vintage instruments and pickers.	2001-01-27

I bought this book for the instructions and cat designs which are both fresh and humorous! Cat accessories have been popular for so long that many designs out there are cliches, but these are new and wonderful. The &quot;Bowl Me Over&quot; wall hanging displayed on the cover is worth the price of the book all on its own, but my favorite design is the cat and mouse table runner. Well, maybe not--the painted mailbox and the appliqued wool-felt purse are adorable too.  That is one thing I really like about this book. Shelia Haynes Rauen focuses on cat motif design and gives directions for a multitude of crafts to display them. There are quilts, pillows, painted flower pots and dishes. If there is anyone on your gift list who is crazy about cats--this is the book for you. :)the accidental quilter	2001-01-01

Yes--this book is full of compelling kitchen decoration projects, but it is so much more than that. There are quilts, tablecloths, curtains, chair covers, totes, pillows, pot holders and matching directions for folk painting objects to go with the theme kitchens. There are four main kitchen themes. Vintage Kitchen is in red and white patchwork with redwork inserts. I'm crazy for redwork, country kitchens and antique oak. I have an antique wooden office chair that I have failed to paint and I'm going to make the chair cover in this book. The Koffee Klatch Kitchen is a log cabin theme in bright red, blue, yellow and white. I've got to make the  table runner! Antique Fruit Kitchen has an apple quilt to die for. Folk Art Rooster Kitchen is warm browns, tans, and deep red. There are folk art pillows,a table runner,and a rooster on a stick that make me laugh and will no doubt make me sew! There's a chapter on kitchen completers too--more nonfabric projects! The color plates in this book are awesome and  I want my kitchen to look like everyone of these themes! The directions are clear and have color pictures and diagrams!  This book took an honorable mention in the Accidental Quilter's Quilting Book Award 2000. :)the accidental quilter	2000-12-29

Not only does she give patterns for earth toned, home warming projects--she gives tips on how to display each quilt to its full potential in your home.  I'm a beginning quilter with limited time and appreciate Lynette's clear, step by step method. She numbers each step--so if I need to stop in the middle of a project--I don't get lost when I go back to it. Also, her directions for rotary cutting are  logical and fit the size of standard fabric. I hate cutting out odd size pieces for a pattern and the author does not make me do this. Whenever possible the dimensions fit cutting right across the fabric as it comes off the bolt.  The sidebars have helpful suggestions and amusing stories. The color plates of the projects are clear and large enough to refer to when making a quilt.  There are projects for wall hangings,lap quilts, bed quilts and even a table runner(a sunflower theme), a Christmas Stocking, and a shower curtain(nine patch).  My favorites in this book are: Oak Leaf Basket(wall hanging--pieced and large applique--I'm going to make this one for my home--but I can see it in a mountain cabin too), Hide Away (small wall hanging of a bird house), Star Patch (small wallhanging--24&quot; square of a star surrounded with minature nine patch. I may use this pattern for a large central square in a Saturday Sampler I'm working on), Little Red House (a small quilt with a pieced house that doesn't look too complicated for me),and Cherry Basket(I must have this for my bed! It's a variation on the flower basket--but has cherries instead. I will probably use  fall colors instead of her spring colors although the spring colors are lovely.)  I actually love every quilt in this book, but these are my favorites and the ones I'll try to make.	2000-12-03

So many books for reenactors are one dimensional, but Civil War Women is multimedia like in its approach. Each chapter tells the story of a real Civil War era woman to give you a feel for historical setting. Then she presents a historically inspired quilt that she feels would be the type of quilt that woman could have quilted. There are directions for these quilts which are mostly appliqued. Then she offers a suggested activity for a lady reenactor. The color plates in this volume are clear and breathtaking and there are many black and white historical photos that I found instructional. I learned many new things, such as an explanation for the bloomer reform dress, that caused me to consider impersonations that I had not thought about before.  I have heard some local ladies criticize the author's selection of quilts as being too Union--but I personally found their designs refreshing and a nice alternative to Baltimore album quilts. The quilts that are my favorites are: Tobacco Worm, Seven Sisters and  Democrat Rose.  I enjoyed reading about Lucy Stone and her &quot;poodle&quot; husband.  I am currently musing over the reenactor activity suggestions.  The womens' rights orator and the letter writer both seem creative and do-able impressions that could be accomplished by a single reenactor. I really believe that this volume would be a great candidate for a companion CD that could have some video how to's and print outs  of quilt patterns.	2000-11-11

However, after previewing it, I was stunned with the art and the story of Molly Bannaky. It is a compelling story that would hold the interest of  middle and maybe even some high school students. Students who enjoy picture books for the art work will find this a treat. The lighting in this is particularly memorable and I think many young artists would be inspired.  This is a wonderful picture book with a compelling story of a lessor known historical character with inspiring illustrations. I've ordered it for the media center. :)MZ Cox	2000-10-20

Last week, I bought a fretted dulcimer in Meadows of Dan, Virginia because it had a wormy chestnut top tooled from a local barn. It has a sweet voice and I was anxious to begin playing immediately. However, I didn't want to get started with any bad habits--so I looked over about 20 books on dulcimer playing and chose this for several reasons. 1. The author starts with simple songs and builds technique with them. For instance, there are four versions of Bile Them Cabbage Down at the beginning. The first explores single string melody, the second, single string harmony, the third and fourth have chordal fingerings. Most of the tunes in this book are in the public domain, but the arrangements are thoughtful and sound nice as well as build technique.  2. There are several tunes with tab and music for dulcimer duets. This is something I wanted to explore and glad I did. 3. The directions are very clear, plus there are insightful notes  for fingering some of the measures. 4. A comapnion CD is available, which is great to listen to or play along with. 5. There are instructions for strumming and fingerpicking. It's been one week and I am already playing melody, harmony, and chords to three songs. By the time I've worked through this book,  I expect to have solid technique for fingering and be able to play duets with another dulcimer player. I definitely would seek out a workshop with the author of this book! Thanks for such a great book Madeline!  :) Mary Z. Cox	2000-10-16

Aspiring and experienced Eastern sock fanatics! This is your book! Full color photos and charts and sketches of how to knit Eastern socks. Shows many historical beauties in enough detail to  copy.  Here are my thoughts on knitting these socks. They are dreamy and historically compelling--but the foot of yesterday's Eastern women is shaped totally different than my foot. I need Western socks with western shaping.  Would I ever knit a pair of these socks? Why sure--when I die and go to knitting heaven and get 20/20 vision and magic knitting needles that lead my hands to create these art socks. Do I reccomend this book? Of course. I've spent many wonderful afternoons in the hammock with this book, dreaming which ones I'll knit. I usually pick the Eastern Anatolian stockings as I think the lovely russet shadings will look great on my feet as I hop from cloud to cloud. Now--down to earth ! The best part of this book is there are directions for minature samplers of the major sock styles in this book. You could knit these as a collection and display them as an art grouping--or sew them into quilt squares for a stunning wall hanging. I think it's a very pratical application if you desire to try your hand at knitting these intricate designs successfully.  This is a beautifully well thought out book and has given me many hours of pleaure reading and viewing these socks and the directions for making them. :)Miz Socks Cox	2000-09-30

There  are also many black and white vintage photos of North Carolina's quilters  in period dress.

Margaret Miller encourages the reader to play with two basic geometric shapes. This frees  up the beginner from being overwhelmed by complicated construction  techniques and able to play with quilt design. The quilts selected for  inclusion in this volume also have a great deal of motion built into the  design, so it gives the reader a chance to study how this is done. If you  want to learn more about design, color, and motion of quilts--this is an  excellent resource. Color examples that are my favorites include Marty  Kutz's &quot;Fall Frost&quot; (pg. 60),Grace Crocker's &quot;Quilt  Virus&quot;(pg. 66), Maureen Roy's &quot;Sisters&quot;(pg. 100), and Nancy  Meyer's &quot;The Inside Story.&quot;(pg. 51). All of the examples in this  book are contemporary style quilts. mary cox the accidental quilter	2000-08-17

This  is not a &quot;how to&quot; manual. It is a history of classic Hawaiin  quilts accompanied by color plates that left me spellbound. The designs are  incredible and well worth study.  I've held a fascination with the possible  direct connection between early Hawaiian quilts and the Baltimore Album  quilts of the the Eastern coast. This may be the only book with color  plates of some of these beautiful early quilts that would offer clues to  this connection.  My favorite designs in this volume are Anthurium by Mary  Manoi and Coconut and Pineapple by Meali'i Kalama.  It is of no consequence  to me that this is not an instructional manual as I do not anticipate ever  being able to quilt one of these masterpieces. It is, however, a one of a  kind book and I urge you to treat yourself while it remains in print. Mary  Z. Cox	2000-08-12

It's a good intro  to paper piecing and the vests are great. There are three major pattern  styles--but endless possibilities. I made my Mom's birthday vest from the  pattern in this book, and I made a sewing vest for myself out of quilt  scraps. These are art vests and if you don't wear vests--they look great  hung on the wall too. Carol Doak is clear and accurrate and she doesn't  leave out any of the steps. Vests, paper piecing, a creative jumpstart--are  all here--what more could you want?  Mary Z. Cox the accidental quilter	2000-08-12

There is a color photo of a quilt called  &quot;The Dream&quot; in the Visual Dance that I recognized immediately.  I'm a writer and the same image has been coming to me in a short story  format. I bet there are musicians and potters and all kinds of folks out  there that will tell you the same thing.  I took a workshop in quilt design  from Joen last March and it really encouraged me to put in all the design  time before embarking on a quilt. Just thumbing through this book and  gazing at the quilts is like a graduate class in fabric design. :)mary cox	2000-08-07

What are you going to do with them? Beautiful  color plates show how the movers and shakers in the quilt making and quilt  collecting world display quilts around the house. I was particularly  intrigued with the chapter on Sewing Studios. They are warm, homey places  that employ many antique pieces for storage and decoration. And every idea  doesn't require a show place of a home either. On page 35--they show  several old quilts tucked into an easy chair and covering a table--it would  look cosy anywhere!	2000-08-07

Perfect stitch, perfect thimble,  perfect needles--PERFECT-PERFECT-PERFECT!  Every quilter needs a copy of  this book to see the standard for perfect  quilting. Roxanne was a  marvel--she immediately began hand quilting with a tiny, even, perfect  quilting stitch from day  one--then sprung into action to research what  fabrics and threads quilted best. What's more she published the names of  the companies with perfectly woven material and mentions the companies that  are slackers! I read this book from cover to cover without breathing !  Roxanne defintely lived a charmed quilting life, and her daughter carries  on Roxanne's thimble, needle, and book empire.  I admit it--I buy her  needles and took out a bank loan to buy her thimble. Strangely, I find it  relaxing to sit and read her book over and over as I slip further and  further into debt buying all the perfect notions and materials. Best of  all, when you ask for Roxanne notions--all the ladies in the quilt stores  fawn all over you and assume you are a master quilter or something.	2000-08-06

Carol  Doak uses paper-piece to create beautiful stars in this book as well as  provides a CD to explain her techniques. If you want to piece beautiful and  accurate stars--this is the book for you.

Books	5	344	350	N	N	Reccommended by the accidental quilter	You too can read this book and feel like a quilting bee! I love this book because Carol Doak explains every stupid little detail you need to know in  order not to screw up big time with  quilts. It's not easy to sew all those  little pieces together and have them come out symetrical. If you wack off  the excess with a rotary cutter, (which seems pretty fun at the time), the  block is the wrong size. Carol has a gentle and humorous voice and this  book must be written at about the third grade level because even I  understand it. I like the black and white shaded diagrams because it's  easier to keep your colors straight if you use different color combinations  for the same quilt. Best of all, there are simple projects in this book  that are beautiful and truly suitable for a beginner. I made a variation of  the simple stars quilt for my Mom for Christmas and she loves me again. My  daughter has been whining for one of her own ever since she saw Grandma's.  I ironed on wonderful antique photos of four generations of mothers and  daughters in the star centers--which made the quilt an instant family hit.  As a result, Mom loves me second best of all the kids again, although she  probably still loves my brother the best because he bought her the weed  wacker she wanted for Christmas and she always liked him better anyway.	2000-08-06

Here are two quilters and one believes  fabric makes the quilt, and the other believes the quilting design makes  the quilt. I think they are both right! Having both these books for  comparison--gave me quite a visual lesson in quilting! What is truly unique  about Lee Cleland's book is that she photographs a quilt and shows you how  it looks with different quilting patterns. She does this with twelve quilts  and  it makes you truly consider how you will quilt your design. Truly the  quilting is itself a design element and after studying this book--you will  never make the beginner's mistake of considering the quilting pattern an  afterthought.  The color photos in this book are clear and well thought  out.  There is a pull out quilting paper in the back of the book to  practice some of Lee's patterns.	2000-08-06

It IS NOT a how  to quilt manual, rather a volume that traces Florida quilts and their  makers through the history of the state. It begins with the quilts of early  America and ends in 1988. The color plates are lovely and particularly  clear for photographs taken before the advent of the digital age. There are  black and white vintage photos of early quiltmakers scattered throughout  the book. I bought this book for my personal library because I wanted to  see how quiltmaking in Florida changed over this period of time.	2000-08-06

I ordered this book before it was available because I saw it advertised on Nancy Martin's page  and I'm always looking for quilting shortcuts.  Usually a book like this has sidebars on time management rather than actual time saving techniques--so I was totally stunned with the original twist to  this book! Also, I don't like to copy exact patterns from books--I like to  design my own--but Nancy included so many compelling patterns--that I'm  going to make some of them!  Sawtooth Mountains is exquisite! My only fear  is that every quilter will make this quilt and they will be everywhere! Sew  and Sew is wonderful with three pieced sewing machines. I've got to make it  for my sewing room! Tea Party, Three Little Pumpkins, and Quilts In the  Attic are on my list too! I love the button quilting! And since I'm new to  quilting--obvious tips like turn the square on point and add side triangles  to make a bigger block--are sweet music to my ears. The directions are  clear and the color plates are awesome! Loved the CD--its clear and focused  and shows all the time saving tips close up.

Who would have thought  a four-year-old could be sold for approximately twelve dollars and forced to work in a rug factory? Who could imagine that a twelve-year-old Iqbal could speak for the rights of children in Pakistan?<br />This book made me angry and it made me cry. Susan Kuklin describes the  lives of poor Pakistani families who are forced to sell their children into  a life of bondage. This compelling piece of creative non-fiction is aimed  at the middle school market, but the story is universal, and the black and  white photos allow the reader into a world that is not an urban tale--but  all too real. A must read for anyone that is interested in the future of  the world's children.<br />I'm a media specialist at BelleVue Middle School in  Florida. A small group of students and I read this book together. My  students were shocked that many villages in Pakistan are too poor to have  schools. They compared younger brothers and sisters to Iqbal in the  factory. They learned a great deal about mobility and what it would be like  to not have it.  This book has a helpful index and glossary of terms as  well as descriptive side-bars that make research easy.	2000-02-01

How wonderful! &quot;Her Stories : African American Folktales, Fairy Tales, and True Tales&quot; is a illustrated collection of folk stories that any child would enjoy. Parents could read the tales to a young child to introduce Hamilton's work. Then later the child could begin to read some of the easier Virginia Hamilton  stories such as &quot;Cousins.&quot; Virginia Hamilton has written books that appeal to elementary, middle, and high school students.

One day he is making bricks for his college, the next he is touring New England to raise funds. His wives and friends die of exhaustion around him.<br />I read this book by mistake. I thought it was an assignment for a class(the actual assignment was a thin biography). I took this thick and dusty volume full of footnotes on vacation to the mountains. I decided to skim it and avoid the footnotes. After the first chapter, I read every footnote and the entire volume.  These are Booker's journal entries and personal papers.  He literally steps out of the pages and you are totally emersed in the beginnings of Tuckaseegee and every aspect of his life. He makes the time and place as real as if you were there. I actually became exhausted by his energy and the mountain of activities he was engaged in at the time.  Prior to reading this book, I was not interested in him at all. After reading it, I think he is one of history's underrated characters. This is perhaps one of the most fascinating journals I have ever read on the art of leadership.	1997-08-17
