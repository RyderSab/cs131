Reads quick, but doesn't lack substance as Charles has a lot to say.<br /> My biggest surprise was in the political area: For years, I have heard that Charles is a conservative, and I always see GOP big shots try to capatalize on his fame. After reading the book, however, I don't think Charles is as much as a GOP man as even Charles himself seems to think. His views on race, wealth, big business and several other issues are light years away from anything I hear republicans in power espousing these days. His positions are much more left leaning in everything but name- which is fine. <br />In the end, its all good no matter what your politics. Charles has much to offer here, and thankfully leaves the nuances of breaking down the pick and roll on the weak side to other books. He talks about things that matter, and for this I thank him and show up here to recommend his book.	2004-06-16

I sort of doubt that all the reviewers that have commented on this book actually read the whole thing. I say that because there is no way one could finish it, (and review it) without noting the dramatic fashion in which the climatic scenes are written. I won't spoil it here, but just know the last 50 or so pages ARE NOTHING like the rest of the book.<br />Yes, there are great points of recognition about cube office life. Yes, there is laugh out loud humor ( the text book lessons with vertically arranged double meanings are brilliant, as are the descriptions of various people at the library book sale -complete with a Strawbs reference- to name just two of many great and hilarious examples). But the tone changes so much at the end, that the light Kafkaesque look at office bureaucracy and the slices of Texas life so well depicted earlier are a distant memory.<br />A lot of times you hear people say a particular book  'can't be fit into any one genre' but trust me, here is a book that combines several styles and combines them well. The result is one of my favorite reads of 2004. I really enjoyed it on many levels, so I show up here to highly recommend it.	2004-06-04

A timely book, well worth your time no matter where you are on the political spectrum. <br /> All I really needed to discern about Bill O's true colors I heard in a exchange on his radio show. Bill O was going nuts, telling his listeners to write, email, phone a well known book retailer in the hopes of them taking some rapper's records off the shelf. Decent enough point as the rapper was overly violent and misogynist. But Bill O lost all intellectual leverage in his point when an intelligent caller said '...uh, Bill if you feel so strongly about this, why don't you tell that same retailer to quit selling your book on their site - after all do you want to be associated with such a company?\\". O' Reilly went nuts and sanpped back : \\" THATS DIFFERENT AND YOU KNOW IT IS\\". End of dialogue, next caller. I'm right and you, Mr. Public, are an idiot. <br />Its really worn thin from Bill O and all the talk radio self proclaimed experts on everything. Objectively criticze them and they go nuts screaming about liberal media elite blah, blah, blah.<br /> I'm no liberal and I'm sure no elite but I've come to the conclusion this act got tired long ago.

With all the hand wringing and partisanship going on the wake of 9-11, this book arrives at a most welcome time.  Unlike the the others coming out now (on both sides) you probably won't hear this book discussed on your favorite talk radio outlet. Coll -writing without an agenda and for grown ups- gives the reader credit for digesting facts and making up his/her own mind.

Or say, in the example of Chris Matthews comments about Iraq, the stuff used so selectively edited , all the original meaning is changed. When a liberal or democrat does voice a say, the answer is often a sarcastic \\"oh, I'm just an evil,hompohobic, racist, republican\\", as if by mocking the other side's statements by adopting the \\"oh, poor me\\" role, the argument is refuted and we can move on to the next subject. The problem with that attitude is that when BG does make a valid point it is drowned out by all his whining. <br /> Look folks, you are being played by phony populists looking to sell books. While they bash 'elites', they are laughing all the way to the bank. Question: Why do you think BG knows so much about 'elites' ?- Answer: Becuase he is one ! You think this guy would take your call in a million years? Gimmee a break. More and more americans are seeing how tired this act is, and are thinking for themselves. Try it : you'll feel much better when you quit pouting. In fact,you may just end up going through life in a good mood.	2004-03-23
US	53061560	RC51EHL7VCBF5	0670032794	489272586	Inamorata	Books	5	12	13	N	N	A great book.	Occasionally a book comes along that reinforces the reasons why, in an age of bad video games and worse reality TV, time spent reading fiction is still the most rewarding form of entertainment of all.  The Inamorata is such a book.<br />Among the many positive aspects of the book are the incredible descriptive techniques that are as penetrating as I any I've read in a long time. Gangemi provides a perfectly seamless ride to his 1922 locales and once there, richly developed characters come alive. By the time this tight novel reaches its end you feel know each of them like an old friend. The subtle strengths of Mina Crawley echo throughout, as she confounds the men around her ( who are also each intriguing in their own right) in ways that will haunt you long after you put the book down.  <br /> There is not a wasted word in the novel. The clear, concise narrative moves the plot along at exactly the right pace while the reader subconsciously digests themes as diverse as a young man's coming of age, the complexities of familial relationships, and the ongoing battle between science and faith. Or it can just be thoroughly enjoyed as an old fashioned ghost story.  Either way, this a terrific book, and one I recommend highly.	2004-02-18

His new book made me feel compelled to write ths review:  It appears he has fallen right into the intellectual trap I hear on talk radio every day. What Bernie does here and elsewhere is tell the reader what the other side \\"thinks\\" before the other side even says it, thus putting thoughts and words in the mind of others.  He may have ESP, but I sure don't. Example: on a radio show I heard him plugging his book saying what the 'media elite' was thinking about in an interview he heard THAT day. In other words, how does he know \\"they\\" were discrediting a certain senator as \\"just being a southerner\\" when the interview in question hasn't even been addressed yet in the three hours since its airing? This tactic gives him the luxury of framing the other side's argument for them, making his stance appear like the correct one. Clever, but disingenuous.  ( Irony is, maybe Bernie is the one that subconsciously is discrediting the senator, but uses the other side to voice his opinion, but that's another subject) <br />This book helps expose a basic flaw in its own argument: conservatives love the free markets everywhere except the phony populist target of the \\"mainstream media\\". Ratings speak, and that's why ABC, NBC, Time and Newsweek are still more popular than Fox. The man in the street wants objectivity, not cheerleading , Look, I'm no media, and I'm sure as heck no \\"elite\\" (based on education, income, culture any other yardstick Bernie uses in this book) but I am smart enough to know this act of blaming the media by conservatives for everything that doesn't go just their way has worn really, really thin to a lot of people.	2003-11-03

Not content to be the latest in the 'flavor of the month' next big thing ( think : eggers, franzen et. al) upstart Fyodor is clearly a new force to be reckoned with and his writing is his sword. Though raw and still finding his way at times, the promise shown here is really not bad at all.  Something tells me this novel is just a prelude of greater things to come from this fresh new voice. If he sticks to what he does best, who knows what literary heights may be scaled in his seemingly quite bright future. Indeed, this writer is an upstart worth watching.	2003-10-02

I am grateful to Dallek for including so much substance and somehow still making the narrative flow for a \\"general\\" ( i.e, non scholar ) reader such as myself. The tone is clear and concise and starting around page 180 - pretty much correlating with JFK emergence on the national scene- you really can't put the book down. <br /> My only small complaint is the omission of more detailed explanation of JFKs ties to Sam Giancana. I wouldn't consider this an omission if Dallek wouldn't have referred to it himself ( according to the index, 4 times) but always in a passing fashion. Once something so potentially important as a mobster with access to the president was brought up, I felt it should be expanded upon - and either dismissed or validated - much as Dallek does on countless other topics (even ones that eventually do fall into the gossip category, as this one very well might after evaluation). <br /> As I say, this is a very small gripe in the overall context of a book that I am truly glad I took the time to read. The telling of key cold war battles is a highlight. Thanks to Dallek's style and the incredible gravity of the events themselves, the story is infinitely more gripping than any thriller you'll read. Dallek always maintains his objectivity while the action keeps moving in what is a terrific history of the twentieth century itself. The result is a volume I am pleased to put on my shelf next to other great presidential biographies that will stand the test of time.	2003-06-30

No coffee shop, no backpack in the student union - just me and the book in the suburbs. It was good - very good. Did it change my life? No, absolutely not. For a better search on 'what it all means' read Gregg Easterbrook's Beside Still Waters ,and for the fascination with our day to day lives, I prefer the first two Nicholson Baker novels. Nevertheless, I still highly recommend this book. The interspersion of the trip with Pirsig's study of values is quite well done. The Greek philosophy covered and subsequent personal interpretation more than makes up for some of the hippie stuff didn't age all that well. Another plus was the trip itself, which is much better than just about any road book before or since. <br /> While my good - but not life altering -review certainly heaps more praise than the one star ones found here, it appears such middle ground is a minority position in these parts. Still, I'll stick with 3.5 stars. Once I waded through the hype and cult like following, I am glad I finally read this modern classic.	2003-02-12

It reads so fluidly, one can forget he/she is learning history while riding along with  a fascinating narrative. I very much enjoyed it and learned a great deal from the exhaustive research that obviously went into the project.<br />My only criticism, however, keeps me from giving five stars: the co-authors seem obsessed with housing and perceived racism issues in Chicago - at times to the extent that Daley is almost forgotten in their drive to bring home a point. If this is where their academic background is based that is fine, but the reader deserves to know this going in instead of being advertised a full one volume biography type of study. This was an occasional distraction, but one that usually ended soon enough with a paragraph break - welcomed with a 'whew, glad we got back on track'- from this reader.<br /> All in all, a fine book very much worth your time, but be advised not quite what it might seem.	2003-02-05

Thier mantra: blame the media, blame the gov't, blame the education system - basically blame everyone but themselves when things don't go just thier way. <br />Guess what? The act is tired and has worn really , really thin.  Thankfully- as evidenced by books like this -the idea of the talk radio flavor of the month whiner has offically worn out its welcome on the rest of us.  You remember us; we're the real americans everywhere that are too busy working to call some silly talk show and stroke the egos of guys like this.

I agree with the raves and check in with the five stars shown above. Since others have waxed better than I can on the book's positive aspects, I will bring up a couple of semi-negatives. If you are a fan of this book and as objective as Myers asks a reader to be, I am thinking you may agree...First, if his argument is as convincing as it appears why not take on the heavy weights that the current generation of writers is emulating. Why not Joyce? Why not Faulkner or Pynchon? Clearly these three and others influenced Myers' targets, so I think Myers owes his thesis more than a passing reference as to whether he thinks the dead (or missing) masters are geniuses or frauds. I am guessing he lands on the genius side of that equation but would love to know for sure.<br /> Second, he spends an awful lot of energy telling us what he doesn't like. Why not a chapter or two about what and who is right about modern literature? A quoted excerpt here and there of clear, concise prose is just not enough. His love of books was surely the catalyst on him calling 'enough is enough', so somewhere in his library must be some favored gems that illustrate a better way of writing than his five subjects manage to.  <br /> Thus, I suppose my conclusion is this is an enjoyable and necessary book to be kept on the shelf next to your Strunk and White - I just wanted a little dessert after the main course.	2003-01-05

Right now, we are blessed by a number of young writers who possess talent but fortunately for us, don't feel the need to hit us over the head with their notions of restructuring an art form that has worked for ..oh...a few centuries now.

Feinsten has a clear and concise writing style that spells out the facts of the incident in question, but more importantly lets the reader in on the people behind the story. In dealing with human nature and personal memories, morphing the past into the present can be tricky but Feinstein pulls it off well. He definitely invokes the mood of the NBA's dark era in precise fashion and makes the reader feel like it is the late 70s all over again. <br /> If I had a small gripe with the book, it would be with the books slightly over dramatic subtitle : 'the fight that changed basketball forever'...I found only one tangible change in the game noted in the book ( going from two officials to three to help curb violence) , and while I am sure the fight did change the game in other ways - maybe some not so obvious - Feinstein never really explores his own thesis. This minor criticism noted, I whole heartily recommend this fine book.	2002-11-03

The structure of the book works great with the inning by inning chapters of SFs most famous game interspersed with a chronlogical unfolding of his life events. <br />The book's flaws are lapses into laudatory praise that is excessive ( which seems especially odd when at the very end of the book 'the sycophantic elevation of one human being over another' by others is roundly mocked) and the author's constant and ongoing obsession with her subject's religion- an obsession clearly not shared by SF himself as most of his quotes throughout the book seem to suggest. ( Proud of it and important to him? Clearly, yes. Obsessed?  At least from here, no.) This, unintentionally but ultimately, diminishes the man as an individual while trying to ascribe a group think attitude to his every action, accomplishment and personality trait.<br />Given the above minor problems, I still wholeheartedly recommend this book. As others have pointed out, it works great for the baseball fan or non fan alike. It captures the feel of a specific era, but still incorporates the modern game and its players for excellent perspective for readers of any generation. When Vin Sculley's broadcast quotes are used -combined with the book's narration- you feel you are smack dab at Chavez Ravine itself. Recommended	2002-09-30

This book is the perfect companion to talk radio - which I love. For years, my favorite author was Rush Limbaugh because when an issue was too complicated for me to figure out myself, he told me what to think. Now Sean has been handed the baton and this book proves how smart he really is. I hate the fact that liberals in this country think the constitution gives them the right to speak their mind or present a different side to an issue. The thesis throughout this book just proves how ridiculous middle ground and compromise are in todays black and white world. Thanks Sean for showing how evil the liberals truly are! Move over Rush, Sean's book is now the place I go to tell me how to think !	2002-09-17

Given the cover and the jacket blurbs accompanying 'The Ringer' I expected a sports novel along the lines of 'Balling the Jack' by Frank Baldwin ( which is a GREAT book, by the way). <br />Instead, I found a novel with literary tendencies that relied on characters, thoughts and tone over plot alone. I'm probably way off here, but it's almost as if the narrative pace is like Thomas Pynchon in his lighter moments, circa Vineland era ( and I'm fully aware of how crazy that comparison sounds). All this, while still being very funny and readable.<br />I highly recommend The Ringer to anyone looking for a fast read but doesn't want to sacrifice substance, thought and ideas about the big picture of what makes people tick. Thanks to Bill Scheft for providing reading time well spent.	2002-09-03

Cohen has an easy writing style that makes the going smooth - but yet substantial at the same time. Kind of moves along in Pynchonlite mode, but then grabs you and won't let go.<br /> Read it slow. Take it in. Catch the andecotes (e.g. 'Ron Darling smiled up at her' or 'Harry O' two part episode references). Plot is secondary. Only two things really \\"happen\\", but all sorts of stuff is going on underneath. Everything is brought together in the last few pages - pages that give the title 'Big If' a double meaning you don't see coming. If you're looking for something with substance, but not heavy ( like the books one of the main character's dad Walter might read) give it a look for your next summer choice.	2002-07-04

Does anyone else think it's at least a little funny that someone who constantly cries about a lack of exposure by the 'liberal media' is on TV pretty much every night? Coulter and her cronies spend all their time slamming others without injecting any policy (other than not liking Bill Clinton). Then, when the tables are turned and they are evaluated, their skin turns incredibly thin. When thier side loses, Ms. Coulter and others blame the messenger which - besides a being a blanket and elitist condemnation of the intelligence of the american people - is a paranoid myth that has really gotten tired.	2002-07-03

His telling the story of Ebay's founding and subsequent growth work very well. The urban myths are debunked ( i.e., the PEZ story) and the facts gain their own momentum while we see the company evolve. The writing style is concise and informative. Then -about the time of Ebay's IPO- he seems to lose his chronological compass. The information, while still interesting and well written, takes more of the form of a series of anecdotes than a history. This minor flaw is no big deal really. I still very much enjoyed the book. <br />Thanks to Cohen for his research and a very unusual story (when you think about it in hindsight) : a dot com start up that actually worked.	2002-06-21

I wonder how many of the professional reviewers here and elsewhere actually read all of 'The Company'. I mean anyone can look at it, hold it, see the blurbs and say something safe like ' Littell has written the quintessential cold war novel', or 'Littell has redefined the spy novel genre'. <br /> Well, I read it and though I'm no critic I'm here to say it is a terrific book. It is literary without being highbrow. It is action packed without being comic bookish. The narration is incredibly descriptive but still manages somehow to be sparse and concise. Strong characters are established without resorting to any undue sentimentality. In short, it has everything you want, and nothing you don't. <br /> Sure, I found a couple of very minor flaws ( e.g. an answering machine is in an average person's apartment in 1974) and once or twice the dialogue is really there for the reader's benefit and not representative of the information people in their respective postions would need to convey in regular conversation (e.g, one senior CIA veteran tells another that then President George Bush was once head of The Company), but who cares? The bottom line for this reader was I enjoyed every one of the 900 gripping pages more than I have enjoyed any novel in a long time and show up in this forum to recommend it very highly.	2002-05-29

I have read On The Road when I was 21 and I have read On the Road when I was 41. I wanted to 'get it'. I really did. The sad fact is if you are really serious about this type of literature go the masters - go to Henry Miller, go to Pynchon's 'V', or even go to Hunter Thompson and you'll see what good writing really is. <br />Ultimately, and I am sorry to disagree with a nation full of posers, this is the most overrated book of all time.	2002-03-03

After all, the stories of these guys are well documented to the point of pop legend. Mark Leibovich, however, shows that in capable hands much can be learned through looking at the past, present, and future. <br />He writes in a clear, direct tone and has obviously done a ton of research. One of the best things he does is lay out the facts objectively and let the reader reach his/her own conclusions about his subjects ( e.g, 'Are Gates, Ellison ruthless'? ) and about the big picture ( 'Does the burst of the bubble diminish tech in general' ?) It's refreshing to see an author respect his readership in such a manner. <br />All in all a very enjoyable book that I recommend.	2002-01-31

Therefore, let's just cut to the chase : this is a grand slam of a book. You want in depth analysis? James delivers. You want anecdotes? Again , James delivers. You want everything in between? Be assured, he does not disappoint.<br /> One other nice and subtle feature : for as informed as James is, he never talks down to his reader. For example, he will expand a thought by saying \\"what fewer people know is\\"    instead of boasting that  \\"FEW people know that such and such...\\". Maybe not a big deal to some, but for me it confirmed the notion the most informed writers can still be counted among the humblest.  <br /> As James points out in his introduction this is not a book to be studied, but one to be 'picked up'. By doing just that, you have assured yourself of years of quality reading. Consider it a vital addition to your baseball library - and more importantly to your library in general.	2002-01-28

His style is concise and quick moving without sacrificing depth and thoughtfulness. As another reviewer pointed out: he does not preach. He leaves the moral judgement of the role of the conglomerate up to the reader. <br />Too many times the baggage a 'serious' novelist brings to the table manifests in a ' look at me-I'm smart ' tone. Not here. This guy writes circles around his rock star persona peers ( Wallace, Eggers et al) and deserves a wide readership. A great book.	2002-01-27

A very good book for someone who does not have the time to invest in one of the massive Churchill bios ( this includes many of us, I suspect). Lukacs is concise for the most part, however I do agree with others that the footnotes are intrusive - and a bit of a distraction. Churchill is the epitome of leadership in these pages and even predicts the future ( we learn he felt the collapse of communism would come in the 1980s, for instance). If I read the last paragraph correctly Lukacs credits W.C. for saving the world from tyrany in the Soviet and Nazi forms , but predicts a new threat from others 'without as much armed might, but bringing the clouds of a dark new age'. Reading this, in our post 9-11 world, I found such an inclusion to be eerily prescient.<br /> This is a clearly written and always focused book. It provides one with a good overview of the most crucial period of the 20th century in fast paced manner, but never sacrifices important details. Recommended.	2001-12-27

It reads very quickly thanks to Mcphee's concise writing style and a rapidly unfolding plot. When you read it make Marie your focus - not Nora Mars. Marie is actually the more complex woman, even though at first glance you'll be brought in by the weird circumstances surrounding the movie star. Don't be put off by the science references - they are actually used much less than the reviews would lead you to believe. When they are used, they work quite well in tying together the big picture. <br /> If you're looking for a light read (without sacrificing substance and intellect) you will enjoy this novel.	2001-09-07

One gets the feeling he came up with a clever title and tried to mold a book around it. To this day, more efforts are made by the Stones on NEW material for NEW records than anything else. One may or may not like said efforts, but to see them in concert in the late 90s was to see them sing 'Saint of Me' with the same vigor (or actually more) than 'Brown Sugar'. All this while never being mainstream. Radio, for instance, is STILL afraid of the Stones. A new stones record comes out and programmers must filter thru the lyrics to search for objectionable content. I would argue if they have sold out they did it without contemplating record sales or radio airtime. To not separate them from the state fair 'has-been' bands is unfair and ultimately discredits ANY artist's attempt at longevity. As the stork once put it : 'What the heck we s'possed to do, ya mowron?' To use an extreme illustration ( and I am not comparing the two), when Mozart 'burst on the scene' he was a rebel who redefined all preconceived notions of music. Thankfully, observers of that age didn't share Mr. Strausbaugh's resistance to change. If they did, much of the master's work's after mid life would have been discredited. Maybe I'm just not enlightened, but I really have no quarrel with quality artists who stand the test of time. <br /> Post 9-11 thought : Anyone who thinks The Stones and The Who are irrelevant - as Strausbaugh writes in his book - must not have seen the 'Concert for New York'. Those performances really brought home the timelessness, escapism and 'unintellectualized' joy the author's targets are still capable of creating. Surely, even the most jaded critic tapped his foot (albeit with tears in his eyes) that night. I know I did.	2001-08-12

After the first section, I felt certain I was going to be bored.  I thought the novelty of a somewhat faceless narrator on his quest for miles would tire quickly. It did. The good news is Kirn knew this too, and he gives the guy a personality that subtlety develops over subsequent chapters. The plot could have been developed a bit more , but Kirn's Nicholson Bakeresque observations are great and you realize this is not a plot driven novel anyway. <br />The irony lost on some,apparently, is that this not an 'airport novel' ala Grisham or Clancy. It aims much higher than that ( though remaining light in tone) and for the most part succeeds.	2001-08-10

Cross has a clear and fast moving writing style and covers all the bases in an orderly manner. He keeps things moving and never gets too scholarly, though. The facts that matter about Cobains life are handled well, as are the issues surrounding his death. One small complaint : he does not explore the influence of Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow on Cobain - ( there is a song in the novel where teens sing about 'spirit being contagious' and ends with 'nevermind'. KC supposedly read the book many times). That very small issue aside this is the book to replace all others on your shelf when searching for the facts on Cobain's life and art.	2001-08-05

After that, the book loses steam and evolves into more of a 'why I believe' line instead of the original 'evidence' suggested by the title. The point of disproving the accidental universe is gripping and hard to refute. I don't know why that could not have been expanded -- with less emphasis put on the NDE stories. ( To me, a folly of NDE as proof of God is : are we to believe God makes a 'mistake' of when to start the afterlife transition only to say 'Wait a minute - he's not quite ready - send him back'?)<br /> A good ( not great) book that ultimately sells itself short by going for the wrong target.	2001-07-05

Unfortunately, the feeling I kept getting was someone that was writing for other writers and not a general audience. It would be hard not to fall into such a trap, I suppose. With all the raves from peers and others, the poor guy must have felt like the world was looking over his shoulder.  (for a great example of how the short story writer can achieve writing for the masses without sacrificing art, look at 'Venus Drive' by Sam Lipsyte). <br /> The master of 20th century fiction, John Updike once said writers workshops worry him because it creates an insulated environment. I'm not saying Tester is not a real talent - clearly he is. I'm only suggesting he focus next time on substance over style.  Not giving up on Tester, and I look forward to his future work.	2000-12-12

Wolfe has a keen eye for many aspects of American life. <br /> I can not give it 5 stars, though. For someone who makes his living observing others Mr. Wolfe's skin is thin when he is put under the microscope himself. His disdain for Updike is ridiculous when one considers Updike's fiction is a graceful Michael Jordan flying dunk and Wolfe's is still based on descriptions of sounds and accents being spelled out in ALL CAP phonetics on every other page.

Some of the problems cited below are very real e.g, the rambling, disjointed nature of 'Off Camera'. I see why 'reading' such a work might be frustraing.

Keep it in your car, don't be in any hurry to finish and just enjoy it a few journal entries at a time. <br /> Think of it this way : Koppel's familar voice on the topics herein are - even at their worst - infinetly better than anything you're going to get on talk radio.

It is great insight into a world a businessman like myself would otherwise never see. It dispels some of the 'Full Metal Jacket' type of myths while validating others. Ricks is one of those fluid, smooth type of writers that would make the study of grass growing sound interesting. With such a fascinating topic matter like this one, he really excels. The last chapter is an excellent overview of the future role of the US military. Its no flaw that it doesn't 'fit' with the rest of the narrative ( as some have said here) as its highly informative and most importantly - balanced. <br /> If you're a Marine reading this, allow me to say &quot;THANKS&quot; for all you do for our country (and if you haven't already done so, read this book).	2000-10-09

The reader truly does enter his world while reading these stories. A  reviewer suggests the book be read in one sitting. I disagree, and would  opt for a slow reading and re-reading to fully appreciate Lipsyte's use of  language and development of characters. Know going in these are not  minimalist tales about happy people dealing with relationships, bosses or  other trivialites of every day life. Lipsyte is going for something a lot  deeper here, and he seems to have succeeded well. <br />A great book.	2000-09-17

It is not a straight biography and therein lies its strength. It assumes the reader is intelligent and can appreciaite a more serious and artistic approach. It  goes back and forth between the stones early days and the infamous '69 tour  (of which Booth was a true inside participant). This is handled brilliantly  with Brian Jones - or at least his spirit in the latter - looming over both  eras. The most telling passage of the stones psyche is a short conversation  late in the book between Keith and an advertising executive on a plane. For  that conversation alone, you should buy this book.	2000-07-28

It has a hilarious reference to the Amazon.com review page to boot. 4 stars though,  not 5, as it tries a bit too hard to make sure you realize something was  supposed to be funny (as opposed to, say 'A Confederacy of Dunces' or  'Lucky Jim' i.e., books that just ARE funny). Also, most children of pop  culture will spot a couple of jokes from other sources : Raising Arizona  (p. 213 &quot;Simultaneously?&quot;), and Gilligan's Island of all things  (p. 89 &quot;SOS&quot;). Realizing good humor can't be analyzed, it's easy  to overlook these minor flaws and say the many postives outweigh a couple  of small negatives. This is an accesible -but smart- book you'll enjoy.	2000-07-21
US	53061560	R2BGR9U26Q6VAJ	0060976624	408140508	Thank You for Smoking	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Good - not great	A pretty funny book and a nice light read but that's it (for better Buckley humor see 'God is my Broker'). It's hip to like Buckley these days. Similar to Dave Barry reviews, the exaggerated praises wear a bit thin over  time ( e.g. 'I laughed out loud for weeks', etc).  His 'look at me, I'm  inside the beltway' act is also getting tired. All this being said, I still  recommend this book - just not the accompanying hype.	2000-06-17
US	53061560	RPOLO4VKCN7IS	0375503714	873402511	The Special Prisoner: A Novel	Books	4	8	10	N	N	great book	The first 120 pages of this book are incredibly gripping. As the cliche says : 'you won't be able to put it down'.  The action moves quickly - but not at the sacrifice of deeper themes you might see in a so-called classic.  The movement of time between WWII and the current day is handled  masterfully. Lehrer proves one can write a 'serious' novel without  pretension. There are a couple of superfluous episodes in the second half -  but they are only a few pages long and don't detract from an otherwise  brilliant book. Recommended highly.	2000-06-10
US	53061560	RT83BU1HECAUO	0399146040	349365874	Mr Phillips	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Nicholson Baker meets John Cleese	The concept of Mr Phillips is not really a new idea. As another reviewer pointed out, its very similar to Nicholson Baker's early work (i.e,the description of daily minutia that spirals into bigger themes).  What makes  Mr Phillips a winner is the humor - british and otherwise- that others of  this genre didn't have. He's actually a grown up Holden Caufield hiding out  in a big city without telling his family of recent events. What brings it  all together is the author's easy writing style.<br /> This is a light read  that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys good prose with a subtle bite.	2000-05-15

However, don't let the term 'scholarlship' scare you : while this volume is immeresed in facts, it remains readable throghout. This accesiblity is due  in large part to Aron's fluid writing style. Besides being an authoriative  look at its subject's fascinating life, the book accomplishes an even  bigger achievement that every great biography should strive for : It puts  its subject in context to his times. When that happens ( as it certainly  does here) the reader is the beneficary and a whole new world of knowledge  is opened. It can be argued the Russian Revolution was the most important  event of the 20th Century. Therefore, it would make sense that the leader  of that country at the end of the century brings events full circle. This  wonderful book does that leader justice as much is learned throughout its  pages in terms of Yeltin's background, public life, and personal  philosophy.<br /> I can't recommend this book enough to those interested in  Yeltsin, Russia, or the even broader topic of the history of the twentieth  century and beyond.	2000-04-03

A light book on the surface - but when you're finished, it begs to be read again to make sure you picked up all the subtle nuances. The unorthodox 'plot' works well and the narrative is always crisp ( my only problem with  the storytelling is that annoying habit 'serious' authors feel they must  invoke these days of an overly conversant tone - phrases like 'you see' and  'shall I say' etc). Tom is kind of an everyman trying to figure out the  daily game of life on immediate and philosophical levels. He is given the  advantage of a bird's eye view (literally) of his world and doesn't waste  the unique opportunity. <br /> I'd recommend this to anyone looking for  something slightly different, but still accesible	2000-03-21

Why everybody wants to knock it so much is a mystery to me. I kept thinking that it should have been a book of three short stories but ultimately  Garland ties things together in a masterful way. <br /> The only flaw is a  blatant and somewhat pretentious attempt at incorporating the whole  'Tesseract' theme. He actually sells his own book short by doing this. Let  a very good,tight story speak for itself. Not to compare the two, but what  if instead of Moby Dick, Melville would have called his book 'A ship  captain explores inner meaning and life's struggle with the hunt of a whale  as metaphor.'..That aside, read this book as it is brilliant in parts with  great movement through time with fascinating and gripping characters.	1999-12-29

Nothing is funnier than a good Dave Barry column, but that mentality hurts this book a bit. When DB tries to emulate himself it hurts the flow. Also, the pattern of introducing 2 new  characters every chapter early on wore a little thin. Those are really  minor flaws, though, in a very good - very light novel.<br /> (But gosh can we  please lighten up on the hero worship of Dave Barry from other writers on  the dust jacket. Yeah,sure he's very funny but stop with hyped up 'Barry is  God' praise. One wonders what pointed barbs a Barry column might take at  such silliness if it were directed at some other source.	1999-09-16

I now find myself really wanting to read the Brown bio on Augustine - as those quotes used were points to  look forward to in Wills' book. I don't know why Wills waited until the  last 25 pages to write in a concise manner (the way Brown must) and truly  explore what made Augustine's unique life so fascinating. I just wish the  first 100 pages would have been as interesting. Instead they read like an  intellectual 'mailing one in'. <br /> Heres betting this was a blip on the  screen, and Mr. Wills next effort will live up to the justified high praise  he has earned over the years.	1999-08-25

This book deserves to be a best seller and Cahill's storytelling  runs circles around the John Irvings of the world. <br /> Being the same age  as the book's central figure added to the enjoyment, as recogntion of  events - both public and private pop up on most every page.

It grabs your attention early and is stong throughout. It is not, however, a fictional autobiography. Rather it is a detailed  illustration of one example of Stalin's paranoia : his obession with  wacking Trotsky. Because of this singlemindeness the book loses some of its  power. Very little mention is made of the millions Stalin tortured and  killed - his true sad legacy. Such focus would have been fine in a book  that was titled &quot;Stalin and Trotsky&quot;, but not one advertising  itself as an autobiography.... Otherwise,recommended.	1999-06-20

A tad self aware occaisionally -- the author hints that her own Y2K peers are the only ones to have wrestled with the big questions of  life. Thats a minor criticism,though. Such a flaw is more than made up for  by the authors genuine and sincere sense of real emotion and enthusiasm for  the subject. I enjoyed this book a great deal.	1999-06-05

The English scenes where Rushdie writes like an accessible Pynchon are superb. Really, the first half of the book is terrific. <br />The later problem is Rushdie is so concerned with his  'spin a yarn' conversant style that he loses touch with reality. Example :  One of the major characters has a brother who is a serial killing, mass  murdering lunatic. The fact this would be too huge an issue for anyone -  not to mention a celebrity - to ignore is barely addressed. By the time at  the novel's end when it is 'resolved' you've kind of quit caring because  the whole dilemma is given, maybe 8 pages in a 600 page novel. The book has  bright spots - namely the first 300 pages. It just seems Rushdie was too  self conscious about writing an epic and using style over substance. Not a  bad book-, but not a great one either.	1999-05-17

He responed &quot;Money - Absolutey, no question about it&quot;. So I checked it out. After reading it, I couldn't agree more. <br /> It always  bothers me trying to say a book reflects a certain time period -i.e.,  everyone on this page says this is some sort of 80s timepiece. Do you have  to be a 20s flapper to appreciate 'The Great Gatsby'? Do you have to be a  50s beat to like 'On the Road'?  My point : If its good - its good  regardless of setting and &quot;Money' is great book for any era.	1999-04-16

After that the book describes the plight of what these days are called  (inaccurately) 'special interest  groups' and how they fit into the broader context of american history.   <br />The book excels on many levels and is readable for a non scholar such as  myself. It informs in a well written, accessible tone. The passage of time  is done so smoothly you barely notice the changing eras. This device  emphasizes the theme of freedom and is very effective. The author remains  objective (aside from the descriptions of the Reagan era) throughout the  story and has obviouly researched his subject thoroughly.  I would  recommend this book to anyone looking for a good and thought provoking  american history read.	1999-03-07

It catches you off guard at first,but moreover what it really  does is personalize the entire book. After that interlude the book comes  alive affecting all you've already read as well as what lies ahead.  <br />Guralnick's obvious commitment to his work comes across on every page  and he is able to combine thorough resaerch with rich story telling.  Together with 'Last Train to Memphis' this is all you ever need to read to  understand 'the king'.	1999-01-26

Don't be afraid of the erudite subject matter.

Rushin has a great sense of humor and uses his pop culture references like a sportswriting Dennis Miller. (e.g. The class of 1984 being linked to a &quot;eponymous masterwork - Van  Halen's not Orwell's&quot;, or getting a reception like &quot;David  Letterman's flower delivery to General Electric&quot;). Occasionally he can  be a tad condescending towards those he encounters or tries a little too  hard to be Dave Barry.<br /> The good news is when he finds his own voice he  is a great writer and this is a great book. Rushin's appreciation for  sports and America's backroads combined with his wit make this book  enjoyable reading.	1998-12-21

How the sins of one person affect countless others,for instance, is a prevalent thought provoking theme throughout. Also,the use of an ancient philosophic treatise and adapting it  to today -- and the book's major dilemma, is well done and in the end  uplifting. Additionally, contrary to common opinion, I liked the ending. It  was a climatic conclusion and handled well.<br />However the negatives of the  book can drive you crazy. Memo to Tom Wolfe : by page 720 or so I've caught  on that CHARLIE CROKER HAS A SOUTHERN ACCENT !. After the first 50 times, I  no longer require phonetic translations. Also, speaking of phonetics I know  that a loud burglar alarm goes Braannnnngg!!! and the rattle of metal goes  calckclackclak and a toilet flushing goes GlugGlugGlug. Wolfe feels this  technique enhances description,but the reality is a genius like John Updike  can write more vivid prose in his sleep and not appear to be showing off.  One last negative: Wolfe's ear for African-American slang and rap music is  awful,and ultimately embarrasing.<br /> There are good points and bad in this  novel. In the end I'm glad I read it - enjoying much of it, but be aware of  the flaws pointed out above.	1998-12-06

Mr White is sort of a cross between Ignatius J. Riley and  the Rainman. The characters in the book are all well developed and it is  interesting to watch their personal lives become intertwined with the main  question of the plot. The ending -although a good idea to bring things  together with the passing of years - is a little choppy. This is a minor  flaw,though. This is a book that is hard to put down. The suspense provided  in the description of a scene between the book's creep and young Maggie are  a narrative marvel.<br /> This is the finest novel I've read in some time.	1998-10-12

The vivid descriptions of the environment -not to mention - the characters that make up the world of big time college football are superb. The prose is almost 'Updikean' at times.  The disgusting,but necessary, gross out scene at the party towards the end of the book sums up what this world must be all about. My only minor negative comment is that the boot camp, hard coaches seem to be a little cliche. (it reminded me of one of those hokey 1970s movies starring Robbie Benson). But who knows - the author lived this experience and I didn't, so it could be dead-on accurate.<br /> I read the book based on the rave review in the August issue of Esquire and found it to be worthy of such praise.	1998-09-19

(Unlike the author blurbs on the back cover that almost talked me out of reading it). All the characters are well developed and intriguing.  The vehicle of the Dr. Morales voice reminded me of Woody Allen's use of the imaginary Humphrey Bogart in 'Play it Again Sam.'- only angrier.   The contrasts of the 2 Pauls is worth the price of admission alone. <br /> A minor criticism: It seems Menaker's first person narrator occasionally forgets what year it is - i.e, one minute he is watching Thurman Munson and wondering whether Nixon will survive his current term, and the next he refers to Michael Jordan,butt-head,and answering machines.But this is only a minor distraction in an otherwise very enjoyable novel.	1998-07-21

The writing style is fast paced and should appeal to the non-scholar general public. There is really never a dull moment as the 800 + pages fly by. The reader is always kept interested. <br />The book deserves a wide readership and in a more perfect world would be a huge best seller the way McCullough's 'Truman' was a few years back. The essence of T.R.'s fascinating life and times are captured in terrific fashion.	1998-02-24

Go to Pynchon,Updike,or Delillo.You want right-wing politics?Go to Will, Buckley or Forbes.	1997-11-21

This is the best book on rock and roll I have ever read.(and I've read a lot of them)<br />It has an excitement that runs through the whole book-and the passages on Elvis dealing with his mother's death are extremely well done.<br />All in all,a most enjoyable book that is well researched,and well written	1997-08-20
US	53061560	R24FT9JMSS3RE5	0679410341	107288819	Unto the Sons	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A Great Book	This great book is of such a high quality that a short review by a guy like me can not begin to do it justice.It reads like an epic novel,but has so much more power when one remembers its a memoir-not a fictional tale.Talese's writing style is direct and spares the reader any wordiness and over description.Anyone interested in family,immigration or even larger themes like the whole of American life would be well served by reading this book	1997-01-30
