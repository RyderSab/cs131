The narrative is not linear, with digressions, flashbacks, and other tropes which makes the book hard to follow at times.  In any case, the events of the war are so complex, covering such a long time, and in so many theaters of operation, that there is no single way to give a coherent recounting of the events.<br />All the maps are very clean, freshly rendered and easy to read.  In addition to a few omnibus maps in the back matter, there are many smaller maps throughout the book, each having only as many landmarks as are necessary to illuminate the particular passage.  This turns out to be particularly helpful.  One can find a place like Naupactus, (not obscured by too many dots and words and unclear print) and understand why it was so important for Athens to hold onto.  The other editorial matter are also very helpful.  Using the index and the notes, the reader can follow the stories of the people, places, and themes invovled.<br />If you are at all concerned about Ancient Greece, or history, this book is worth it, for the maps alone even if for nothing else.	2003-07-28

It is therefore somewhat elitist to state that this will go over anyone's head.  The ideas and the prose may be complex, but it just requires some patience.  If it's worth it to you, you'll be able to read it.<br />Strauss gave these lectures to counter what then was called historicism, the position that, because conceptions of such things as freedom and right have been so varied throughout time, that because nobody has been able to agree on what right is, that right is relative to the time.  The upshod of the arguement is then, since nothing can count as right definitively, there is no right.  Strauss argues that historicism, by being another appearance in history, is subject to the same criticism (therefore interally inconsistent) and that even if nobody has been able to agree on &quot;right&quot; doesn't mean that there isn't any such thing, but because debate has been so heated on the subject, it is only all the more evident that there is such a thing such as right.<br />I may be a slightly biased source, but i've read my share of Levi-Strauss and Foucault.  Sure, Strauss confines himself to political philosophy, but the larger issues are there.  Postmodern thought is showing strains of its own now, and Strauss pointed them out before they realized they were postmodern.  Essential reading for both camps.	2002-08-31

Garnett's translation is in irritatingly Victorian prose, and it really gets in the way of the book.  The translator pair Pevear/Volokhonsky released their own new version, and it is said that every generation needs its own translators.  P/V's translations are in much cleaner prose, and after half a century's translator's fetish with accuracy and literalism, is probably more genuine to te text, although I can't say that without having read the original Russian, which I can't.

Although many of his conclusions may not be pertinent universally as he may have thought, especially the family romance--Oedipus complex, the way he tackles the neuroses of late 19th century Vienna is indeed masterful.<br />What matters here is the method, which has matured since the early cases in the Studies on Hysteria, which this makes a good companion for.  The Dora case is unique in that Freud does not come to any sort of conclusion, the analysis is ended abruptly by the patient (or rather the patient's father).  Whereas in Studies, the method is incomplete, here, the method is simply not carried to its conclusions.  Both reveal much of how Freud's thought developed.<br />Freud says explicitly in the preface that the reader should be familiar with dream interpretation, and that he will not repeat what he had said in his Interpretation of Dreams.  It should still be possible to appreciate the genius behind the work, even if some of the conclusions about the dreams may perhaps seem like jumps.	2002-08-14

The reason was that Nabokov was against the \\"novel of ideas\\" because, he would say, it managed to achieve neither.<br />Demons is, of Dostoevsky's novels, the most ideological, yet still it is masterfully pulled off.  Let it be known, however, that at times, the plot suffers at the expense of ideology, just as one has to expect, BUT THE IDEAS!<br />This book, although in my opinion it has the nuance of neither, is a perfect bridge between Notes From the Underground and The Brothers Karamazov.  The intelligentsia, you suspect, are trying to build the positivistic paradise that the Underground man railed against, but as the novel progresses, you realize that the idealist vision has already been lost by Stepan Trofimovich, that  all that remains is his desire to feel alive, even if that means inflicting every sort of pain.  This is the same type of monster that Ivan warns against, and identifies himself with--if he were to act--in the Grand Inquisitor.<br />Also, please note, I tried once to read it in an older translation, and gave up somewhere in the 100s.  This one I plunged through with little trouble.	2002-08-04

Bertrand Russel is not an exception.  In his own eyes, the book he would have kept for posterity would have been the Principia Mathematica, which was blown to bits by Godel's incompleteness theorem.  Yet, while his own philosophy of Logical Atomism ran out of steam (and followers) by about the time he wrote this book, this book endures.  In fact, he even won a Nobel Prize for it.  And not without good reason.<br />Histories of Philosophy usually lack either seriousness (like Sophie's World, which is an adaptation of this book) or wit (like the Columbia History).  Granted, Russel can't be trusted on any German after Kant, everything leading up to the 19th century rests on pretty secure footing.  In fact, it is an indepedant study I took in high school based off of this and photocopies of primary sources that made it possible for me to stay afloat in a graduate course on Hegel at the University of Chicago my first year.<br />However, his treatment of philosophy after Kant has to be taken in context.  Russel, however fair and objective you'd expect a philosopher to be, thought that his tradition of philosophy had more or less answered the big questions.  That meant in exclusion of the Continental philosophers such as Jaspers, Husserl, and Heiddeger.  Even his treatment of Analytic Philosophy ended with Whitehead, who was important in the very early part of the Century.<br />That leaves the exclusion of Kierkegaard, and the treatment of Hegel and Neitzsche.  Kierkegaard only became important in the 20s and 30s in Continental philosphy, and only in the context of a Hegel renaissance, as a religious corollary.  As for Hegel, it is not Russel's fault that Hegel was used as an excuse for right wing apologists for Bismark.  In WWI, Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra was distributed along with the Bible to soldiers, (Hitler among them) and so it is not  Russel's fault that he blames him for Hitler.  <br />Russel admits that hebased most of this book on the work of experts, and it was thrown together in quite a hurry.  That it falls prey to the errors of its era is not surprising at all, what is surprising is how well this work has held up.  In fact, it does.  I still recommend it to my friends who are looking for a digestible introduction to the field, but of course with Caveats.	2002-05-25

English usage has shifted dramatically form its stilted 1931 usage, and even so, it is full of inconsistencies, so that Hegel's technical use of the German is lost.<br />The inclusion of the Logic defies it.  While reading The Phenomenology may, like Ulysses, require a guide, The Logic is more like Finnegan's wake--completely intractable.  Especially to introductory students to which this volume is obviously aimed.<br />If your interest is Philosophy, read The Phenomenology.  If your interest is Politics, read Philosophy of Right.

Sometimes narrative breaks for the author to sneak in some philosophical musing about memory, but somehow it fits.  Immature writer syndrome, I suppose, which i've caught in my own work.<br />It is a book about first love, and losing her, and then finding her again, but engaged to another man, who's not half the man you are.  Nabokov questions how much you're in love with only the memory, and whether finding the flesh and blood girl again will ever fill the hole that your memory and desire have dug.<br />Makes interesting reading next to Martin Amis' first work, The Rachel Papers.	2001-12-24

His translations are extremely lucid, and his commentaries are very helpful.  I came to this book with high expectations, and I was a bit disappointed.<br />The problem is that Kaufmann has really done his job too well.  The book was originally written in a time when most of the English speaking world had an impression of Nietzsche as a proto-Nazi, a myth which Kaufmann nearly single handedly dispelled.  It also served as a counterweight to the unreliable translations of Nietzsche into English.  Since the first edition, Kaufmann has translated almost all of Nietzsche's oeuvre.  All the problems this volume was meant to fix have since been fixed.<br />This book would still be a good purchase for some, those who need a gentle introduction to Nietzsche, those who are interested in Kaufmann as a philosopher, and Nietzsche competeists who want a thorough history of the Nietzsche legend.  There is also a thorough treatment of The Untimely Meditations, which could prove useful read against the availible translation because Kaufmann never got around to translating those.<br />Kaufmann's favorite of Nietzsche's works is Ecce Homo.  In his Nietzsche, Kaufmann echoes a lot ideas from that book.  For those with some experience with Nietzsche, who are willing to put in a little more work reading into Nietzsche's prose, spend some time with that instead.  Translated by Kaufmann.  After all, if the point is Nietzsche, just read Nietzsche.	2001-12-24

Then again, if you weren't willing to commit some thought to Nietzsche, then it's not worth picking up Nietzsche.<br />However, it is worth mentioning that you shouldn't pick up this book.

Now printed by Penguin, on thicker paper, portability is a challenge even for the most absurdly spacious cargo pants. Still, it is an important and interesting enough read to merit a try. Containing Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Twilight of the Idols, Nietzsche Contra Wagner, and The Antichirst, this is the ideal companion piece to the Modern Library Basic Writings of Nietzsche. In fact, Walter Kaufmann purposely avoided overlap in the two volumes so that as much Nietzsche as possible could be encompased in two volumes. I hesitate to suggest this as a first volume of Nietzsche, and suggest the Basic Writings instead, because that volume contains Beyond Good and Evil, which is a far more systematic and lucid exposition of Nietzsche's thought. (This volume contains a small excerpt from BG&amp;E, but it is not enough to serve as anything more than a sampling of the style of the work. This remark also applies to the other excerpts in the volume) Not to say that BG&amp;E is more boring for being more systematic--the prose is still dancingly brilliant, nor is it my intent to say that the literary merit of Zarathustra makes it impossible to understand. In fact, for some genuinely poetic types, I have recommended Zarathustra over BG&amp;E, but still, generally, in general, I would still suggest BG&amp;E first. Walter Kaufmann's translation is now considered the gold standard in Nietzsche scholarship. It is easy to see why his translation is so clear in his introductions. Because he too has an acerbic wit, which he deploys against other translations, and blatant misinterpretations of Nietzsche's thought. In fact, it was Kaufmann's book on Nietzsche first published in 1950 that first cleared the air of all the misinterpretations endemic in the English world, in no small part because of the translators that preceeded him. The final verdict? Certainly buy this, but along with, not instead of The Basic Writings. Oh yes, the letters, they're important too, in clearing the air of misinterpretation. His last letter before he went crazy--he suggested killing all the anti-semites.	2001-08-24

I suppose that is as good a place to start as any.  The most important thing that this volume highlights is how easily anything Niezsche said can be so easily taken out of context and abused by anyone who so chooses.  For example, his &quot;blond beast&quot; is quite literally a lion, and not an Aryan Superman.<br />Work by work analysis:<br />The Birth of Tragedy -- Only attempt this as your first Nietzsche book if you already have a good understanding of how Greek Tragedy works.  At the very least, you should have read Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Sophocles' Theban Plays, some Euripides, Aristophanes' The Clouds, Plato's Apology, and if possible, Aristotle's Poetics.  Also, as Kaufman makes clear, the last ten sections, about Wagner, should be taken with a shakerful of salt.<br />The Aphorisms -- It is very easy to take these gems especially out of context.  However tempting it is to browse them for a few good quotes, I strongly urge you against it.  They are, however, very helpful when Nietzsche refers to them.<br />Beyond Good and Evil -- This is as good a place as any to start your exploration of Nietzsche.  The problem is, even though it is supposed to be a more straightforward approach at communicating the message found in Zarathustra, this is still written very pithily.  The prose is very joyful, poetic, and requires thought.  Then again, if you weren't willing to commit some thought to Nietzsche, then it's not worth picking up Nietzsche.<br />On The Geneology of Morals -- A sequel to BG&amp;E.  I don't suggest starting here.  The prose is more straightforward than BG&amp;E, he is attemting polemic in essay form.  Yet still, it is still a voice in your head, consipring with you, coaxing you toward understanding.  Here, the prose style of BG&amp;E becomes apparent.  <br />The Case of Wagner -- This is a good shakerful of thoughtto take the last ten sections of Birth of Tragedy.  In fact, this is a good shakerful of thought to take all of Nietzsche's work.  I read this with only the very barest background on Wagner, that is I've heard one Aria from The Ring (Three minutes of Brunhilde), The Flight of the Valkeries (I still see tanks), and I know somewhere, Vahalla burns down.  Still, the work makes sense.  Stylistically, this work is absolutely amazing.  It's very relaxed and informal, again, conversational.  Nietzsche doesn't even sound angry, but just wants to clear the air a litte, almost naively.<br />Ecce Homo -- This would seem like a very pretentious work.  It is not.  He comes off almost modestly here.  This too, clears the air of all that is rotten about what has been said about him.

Infuriating style?  You're missing most of the irony.  Don't you see it?  The irony of the book has gone around like a serpent biting its own tail!  And that's the point.<br />2. On whether or not Irony is a mature work: the first part is not.  The first part begins and ends with Hegel, with occasional allusions to what points he will hit in the second part.  Want to skip the first part because it's long and doesn't seem to get to the point, or you don't know enough about Socrates?  Forget the second part then, which won't make any sense at all without the working definition it takes until the discussion of Aristophanes to get to.  And don't worry about not having a background on the Greeks.  All you have to do is have a little working knowledge of the Apology of Plato, and know that Xenophon is a bit of a dimwit.  Everything you wouldn't know and Kierkegaard doesn't tell you is said in the commentary, which is both repititious to those who know, and vexatious to those who don't, but is really helpful nonetheless.<br />3. The second part, especially in the discussion of Lucinde is a microcosm of the rest of Kierkegaard's philosophy.  It just takes a little bit of a skewed lens (an ironic lens, if you will).  Irony as infinite negativity? (which is probably an infuriating way of putting it since it really doesn't say anything about irony unless you understand the context provided by the discussion on Socrates in the first part... see why you can't just skip ahead?) alludes to concious despair, or at least if you're an ironist, and you see the emptiness of your position LEADS you to concious despair.  The Ironic itself becomes sublimated somewhere between the aesthetic and the humorous, something unsustainable in it of itself, because after all, it is infinite negativity (once again,i refer you to the first part.  It has something to do with Socrate's position that he was the wisest man in Athens because he knew nothing, and about the soul after death.  See why Socrates is so necessary an ingredient now?).<br />4. The discussion on Lucinde in the second part is his descisive turn away from the Aesthetic and from Regine, not the Seducer's Diary as presented in EITHER/OR.  In fact, EITHER/OR is his more direct explanation of his position that he first touched upon in Irony.  Do you see the irony in that?  He had to write a pseudonymonous work of an editor who finds a pile of papers in a desk in order to be more direct about a subject he indirectly touched upon in his dissertaition.  <br />5. This is seminal Kierkegaard.  This is the book that makes clear the infinite bottomless pit that Kierkegaard points you to in his later work is in fact, an infinite bottemless pit--WAAAUUGHHHH!<br />6. I hereby disclaim all my references to Kierkegaard.  Especially this one.	2001-07-24

I read this thing straight through in three days, while passing it back and forth with a friend of mine, who finished it within a day of when I did.  The narrative structure, which alternates between present, and memory, where at the end, the memory catches up to the first moment of the present, is woven with a delicacy that complements the plot well.  It lends a certain urgency to the book, which matches with the urgency of teenage life.<br />The characterization of Charles Highway, who is a boorish, pretentious aesthete, without any truly original ideas, and without any real self he can hold onto, is slightly exagerrated, although it hits home true to life, unlike Holden Cauldfield, who is just there, and angsty.  In the end, he gets his comeuppance--by getting exactly what he wanted.  Rachel Noyes is a perfectly crafted beautiful girl that the main character reads too much into.  In the end, the reader sees a pretty girl, who's deep, but who Charles is trying to degrade as only skin deep.<br />There are those who are surprised that Amis managed to do this in his debut novel.  I'm surprised that anyone can think this can be anything but the product of a debut novel.  There is a certain raw urgency that developed writers seem to lose with their youth, which only makes the book more comepelling.	2001-04-07

The meaning is very clearly laid out, both by the narration, and by the occasional exposition of the narrator.  Houellebecq's major thesis is that in the aftermath of the cold war, and the triumph of capitalism, the same cutthroat comepetition that has left behind so many economically has crept into social life to the extent that some get screwed, and others get screwed.  Upon the first reading, the message was clear enough, but on the second reading, there emerges a subtlety to the narration that conveys the message far better than the expository rants that the narrator occasionally goes on.<br />So much for the book itself.  I'm sure it merits a good five stars, but the translation is absolutely abhorent.  At first glance, it's just the occasional creeping British argot, but you realize that the sentences are choppy, and that the argot is there just for its own sake.  It is translated into nobody's vernacular.  Hammond's rendition into a limp British slang is quite comical, especially since Houellebecq has been militating against Americanization (or at least you can feel that undertone) which the translator really undermines.	2001-04-01

Maggie Estep's talent is in telling stories in a twisiting, gyrating manner, with all the grace of a great dancer.  Her prose is undistractingly clear, but has all the wild movement and intensity of Kerouac's spontaneous prose, with all the fluidity and flair of Joyce's stream of conciousness.  <br />The nice thing about the book is that many of the constructions and catchphrases are also used in her songs.  The sentences push ahead with a poetic rythm, enforced by her nasal, yet surprisingly sharp voice, almost singing in my head.  It's no surprise this book is the work of a poet...	2001-01-18

Every reviewer worth his column in the book supplement bashed and destroyed the book. I had to pick it up and read it.<br />The premise seems promising enough, Lolita from her own perspective.  Obvious issues in freedom, feminism, etc.  This is most obvious, not by what the book says, but by the fact that the book exists.  It is carried through in such an unpolished way that you're better off reading straight criticism, or better yet, another Nabokov novel.<br />One wonders, especially after reading Pale Fire, whether Nabokov meant it to be a book about Lolita told by an egomanical Humbert, or rather, what Nabokov meant by it.  Questions of betrayed promises of freedom (or whether promises of freedom are always betrayed?) about the silence of the opressed?<br />Still, people don't disappear silently.  Want the real Lolita?  Read the original again.  Save your money.	1999-12-25

I just loved it.  This one is a keeper.  It gets  funnier every time you read it.  I've read it at least four times, and  can't get tired of it.  Definately deserves to be above Brave New World in  the top 100 list. Keep in mind, in Chapter 39, the definition of Catch 22  is &quot;They have the right to do whatever we can't stop them from  doing.&quot;  That stands out better than Doc Daneeka's, but that seems to  stand out.	1998-10-12

Within four weeks of it coming out, I went to amazon and purchased it.  It  delivered quicky, and I read it faster than it was deliverd: 24 hours,  about 6 hours of continuos reading.  It held me on, plus I had the time on  my hands.  All the characters are great, Townsend seems more evil than his  former boss, Jon Masters now is a real character, not just the computer  junkie genius kid he was in previous novels. This doesn't top his earlier  novels, but it may open new avenues in Dreamland.  Maybe Pat will quietly  retire to home life, but didn't he leave that in Shadows of Steel?	1998-09-05
