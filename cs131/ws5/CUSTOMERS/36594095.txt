Allen, which features the brother-in-law/sister-in-law front seat of the truck romance between Pam and Johnny from \\"Nadine's Husband.\\"  Carol Taylor has done it once again.  Excellent, excellent, excellent choices.  I am still a purist, so I still rank Erotique Noire at the top of my list of all time greatest erotica anthologies (black or white); however, with the publication of Brown Sugar 4, I beg to make an amendment.  If I consider the series as a whole, then the Brown Sugar books rank # 1 and Erotique Noire falls to # 2--especially when the stories in this latest installment (#4) are taken into consideration.	2005-02-11

The other reviewers have discussed the romance angle, which I agree with, and the sex, which is excellent as usual, but this is not a \\"genre\\" book of the sort it is being compared with.  Did the other reviewers miss the fact that the main character starts off the book as a stalker?  Did the name Lethal Coon not strike them as a bit harsh?<br />This book is good but it is not a light read.  It compares more with Preston L. Allen's first novel Hoochie Mama, than with Bounce or the erotic work he did in the Brown Sugar trilogy.  In fact, one of the characters from Hoochie Mama, Shoneeka, who was the hoochie mama cop's lesbian lover, makes a surprising appearance in this new novel.  In Hoochie Mama, when we last saw her, Shoneeka gave birth to a child and then disappeared.  She reappears in this book with some interesting twists. <br />Clearly the idea behind this book is the fairytale \\"The Frog Prince.\\"  Sol is the Prince who appears as a frog, and Sheba is the princess who frees him with a magical kiss.  That premise leads to both the darkly serious and the fun romantic elements of the story.  True love wills out, but as with all Preston L. Allen novels, character development is balanced against a troubled childhood.  Sol, the \\"frog prince\\" in this one, has a dark side, darker even, in some ways, than the villainous boyfriend HB (Hansel Baines).  He is a former street thug with a violent past and several stints in prison; he is a stalker of women (as well as men); and he may even have murdered someone, though it is not clear--he certainly would have murdered his own father if he could have.  And that is just as Preston L. Allen would have it so that Sol can make his point about \\"true\\" reform when he compares himself to HB: \\"I know about being bad . . . you have my police report.\\"  Allen's point seems to be that Sol has to be real bad so that we can see that real frogs can become real princes if they undergo real change, not the cosmetic type that both HB and Sheba seem to be so concerned about before meeting Sol.  Sheba's kiss (along with the advice he got from his grandmother) changes Sol; but will Sol and his goodness be enough to change Sheba?  You see in this book, the Princess is a frog in need of change too.  <br />Sheba herself has a dark side, which the writer explores with poignancy.  Allen soon reveals that Sheba is not the sweet, innocent shop girl that we meet at the beginning of the novel.  She too has had a past; she is in desperate need of the kind of transformation that a life with Sol will bring.  There is a reason that she has lived so long with a heartless brute like HB.  There is a reason she covers her body with bling-bling.  There is a reason that after meeting a soulmate like Sol she is reluctant to become one with him.<br />The real beauty of this book is a quality that lies beyond the stylish writing, the captivating storyline, and the lush sex scenes; the beauty of this book is in its message that real change is possible, which is hammered home in the final scene when Sol tells HB: \\"For the things you did . . . in my old life . . . I would have killed you.\\"  We the reader think that he should have because HB is so reprehensible.  But Sol is a changed man, so he didn't.  Sol has been kissed by a princess.  Sol has been transformed.  You will be too.	2004-06-23

The word \\"Cool\\" comes to mind.  Generally I am bothered by self-conscious books.  You know--those books that know that they are books, books that let you know that you are reading them, books that announce themselves.  I sort of felt that way while reading this one, except this time the technique worked, the flashbacks, the originality and genuine lustiness of the dirty scenes (and the way they sneak up on you), the stories within a story, the wordplay, echoing, subtle hints (roses) and repetition (bounce, bounce, bounce).  None of it seemed forced or like showing off.  It just seemed so natural, so effortless . . . so cool.  But why am I talking about HOW the book was written when I really want to talk about WHAT was written?  Am I contradicting myself?  No, the thing is just so good--I want to talk about evey aspect of it.  There is meat enough in this one for all of us to eat, I promise you, but I'll leave the plot to reviewers who aren't as deep as I am.  I'm going for the Freudian stuff.  Cindique and Red both need to be on the couch.  I'm not lying.  He has a \\"cousin\\" fixation, a little family thing going on.  She has self-esteem and color complexes in abundance.  So is this a preachy, preachy head book?  No way. Preston L. Allen's strength, as we are beginning to see, is in creating characters who are at the same time deeply layered as well as extremely active.  In other words, Allen is one of the few writers who creates dense (literary) characters that move with the lightning speed of the shallower more stereotyped protagonists of popular literature. He gives us the best of both worlds: characters who prick our brains and set our hearts to racing at the same time. Erotica, love story, African American literature, tell-all, slice-of-life, sistah girl book?  One thing is for sure, this book is nobody's cliche.	2003-10-21

God Bless my English Professor Preston L. Allen (Author of Hoochie) for recommending it to me when I was going through my science fiction phase.  The whole idea is pretty cool, with the bi-sex creatures, the cold planet, and the two cultures on it that might be symbolic of the two super powers of our world who were at the time in the middle of a \\"cold\\" war.  I am not going to go over the aspects of the book that so many other reviewers have already covered--I agree with them all, it is a great book.  What I want to do is point out something I caught the last time a read the book: the hero is black, is he not?  Did I read the book right?  Doesn't he say, somewhere near the end, that on his home planet (earth) he would be considered \\"dark\\"?  Ursula K. LeGuin is so cool.	2003-01-15

Who's better, Bradbury or Asimov?  The two were both born in 1920 and they made their fame in the forties, fifties, and sixties, writing (and pioneering) a kind of fantastical pulp fiction that would eventually become known as science fiction.  In short, the two men were giants of the genre and so their work, their art, naturally invited comparison.  I have always loved them both, Asimov for his great ideas and Bradbury for his great storytelling voice.  Asimov, the university professor, was trained as a hard science man--physics, mathematics, chemistry.  If he had not made his name as a writer, he probably would have designed the first rocket ship that landed on the moon.  In fact, we owe him thanks for the word &quot;ROBOT&quot;, the rules for governing them (ha-ha-ha, see I Robot), and the fledgling field of robotics itself.  Is there a more representative work of science fiction than The Foundation Trilogy?  Though Asimov is known primarily in literary circles as a science fiction writer, the great man was a thinker of ideas so varied that his books earned him a place in the Guinness Book of World Records: he is the only author who has at least one book in every category of the Dewey Decimal System.  In other words, no matter where you are in the library, you can find a book written by Asimov.  Bradbury, on the other hand, is not a scientist.  In fact, if you check out some of the stories in the Martian Chronicles, his best collection, you will discover working rocket ships that were built with hammers and nails in somebody's barn.  You'll find life forms that are bubbles with voices.  You'll find a variety of strange and contradictory rules for space flight.  And you know what?  None of it matters because Bradbury's appeal, unlike Asimov's, has nothing to do with his grasp of scientific principles and the various real and imagined extrapolations thereof.  We read Bradbury because he is a writer first and a scientist second.  Bradbury could write a story about ice melting in a cup, and we'd be on page 200, reading with pleasure,  before we looked up and said, hey, why the heck am I reading a story about ice melting in a cup?  Bradbury explores the humanity of his characters when he writes, as the stories in the Martian Chronicles prove, and he has an absolutely addictive storytelling voice.  It's kinda like sitting under a tree with your grandfather and listening to him spin yearns.  Time passes before you know it, and you wish he could go on talking forever.  So here it is then, Read the Martian Chronicles not for the science, but for the fiction, and you will not be disappointed by the master.	2003-01-15

Asimov was a man of great ideas and scientific knowledge, but I do not believe that he ever took a creative writing class.  He was writing back in the days when a writer wrote, rather than talked about writing.  So, OK, some of the characters talk as though they are in a cowboy movie.  So, OK, some of the dialogic phrasings are awkward or stilted.  So, OK, there is only one teeny tiny female character (as a black man myself, I might aslo point out that we of the African Diaspora are noticeably absent from the futuristic roll call).  The whole idea of psychohistory is so engaging that you sit there for hours pondering it and thinking, and he was so young when he wrote this.  So young.  This is a great book, a true classic.	2003-01-15

When my old professor, Preston Allen, author of Hoochie Mama, suggests that I read a book, I never know what to expect.  Usually he is right on target, as he was when he invited me to a reading by C. C. Medina and encouraged me (made me) purchase their book.  It was an excellent read, a page turner that I did not put down until it was finished.  There are four women as the main characters, but I will focus on Isabelle and Julia, who, I believe, are the moral center of the novel.  Isabelle is funny and profound in her four years of self-imposed celibacy.  Julia, on the other hand, has had a man, the perfect man, for quite a long time.  Both of these women, despite their opposite plights, are looking for a little love.  The way these women find their loves crosses lines of ethnicity, culture, and sexual identity.  A great, great read.	2002-11-10

Philp is one of the great poets of our day, Caribbean or otherwise, just go read his recent XANGO MUSIC or FLORIDA BOUND.  I had heard that he had written a short story collection that won some sort of award.  As I said before, the collection is masterful: humorous, insightful, stylishly written, cynical, thought-provoking, and even dark.  I like two stories best of all in the book, SOFTERS and BATTY BOY, though they are all good pieces that yield profound understandings of the Caribbean expatriot mindset.  Batty Boy forces a father to consider the unthinkable--a gay son--and I believe he makes the right decision, though not the one I might have made.  In softers, Philp's most human/humane work, we get into the mind of his most pathetic and at the same time sympathetic hero, and we pray that he gets the girl--though she herself may not be worth it.  Each time I read this story, it never fails to tug at my heart strings.	2002-11-09

I read them because after I finished the book, I wasn't sure where it fit in with EJD's other works, all of which I loved.  True fans of EJD will love this book; his &quot;fanatics&quot; (from which the word &quot;fan&quot; is derived) will be disappointed.  I was initially disappointed because I went into it as a &quot;fanatic,&quot; a member of the EJD cult, a reader who KNOWS what he is going to get out of a book before he even reads it because he only reads it to for those things and those things are always there (and usually in some predictable order and style).  I wanted my plot twists, my sudden revelations, my blythe happy ending.  When those things are not there, or are there but rearranged, or disguised, or expanded or reduced, the &quot;fanatic,&quot; having not gotten his &quot;fix&quot;, says &quot;This is a bad book.  EJD has lost me on this one.&quot;  In fact, what really happened is the writer gave us a great book, though a bit slow at the beginning, but with rich characters and plot enough to go around for any &quot;fan&quot; who will tolerate versatility and growth on the part of his favorite writer.

On the more serious, literary side, we have EROTIQUE NOIR, BROWN SUGAR and AFTER HOURS leading the pack.  On the non literary side (where the writers don't aspire to literary aesthetics of style and craft), there are ADDICTED and this book leading the pack.  Many of these books on this non-literary side are self-published, small-press published and/or poorly edited. The plots are transparent or laughable, if a plot even exists; and the sex attempts to be shocking and revealing, but most usually ends up being quite mundane and redundant.  Not so with this book THREESOME.  In fact, the writing at the beginning of the book rivals that of the \\"more talented\\" literary writers.  What a great opening for a novel!  It is impossible to put down.  While the plot and the writing later on become a bit less polished and original, Thomas keeps the reader hooked with a fast paced series of hooks, and wicked, wicked sex scenes.  I do not want spoil the book for you, but the lesbian scene and the first sex scene with Phoenix alone are worth the price of the book.  After reading this book, I wish I could go back and give Zane's ADDICTED 4 stars instead of 5.  I love ADDICTED, but THREESOME is much better.  Much, much beter.	2002-09-24

A few reviewers worried that the book may be a little tough for children under fourteen to handle; ironically, this is a true testament to this book's enduring impact on American culture.  It is too late to worry about really young children \\"reading\\" this story, because if they grew up in America watching the Saturday morning cartoons, they have already watched the movie version of OF MICE AND MEN several hundred times.  That's right.  Warner Brothers cartoons frequently paired a big, strong, dumb character with a little pipsqueek who comically controls him, slaps him around, or takes care of him.  The little guy is \\"the Boss.\\"  They got that routine straight from Steinbeck's novel.  If you want examples, the most recent one is probably Pinkie and the Brain, but they have done it for years with cats, dogs, wolves, and zoot-suited gangsters.  The big ox-like one is almost always stumbling into and accidentally smacking the [heck] out of the little boss in his eagerness to pursue the prey, often Bugs Bunny.  \\"Which way did he go? Which way did he go?  The wittle wabbit, I want to hug him and squeeze him, and hug him.\\"  \\"Shaddup!\\"  Slap!	2002-05-15

Mr. Banks is perhaps the finest writer I have ever read, his prose refined to the point of being almost too self-conscious.  He is a master at making the reader FEEL for his characters.  So I followed the main character from the Northeast to Miami, as he fled his boring life and found himself in more trouble than he knew was possible.  That first story, surface story, works because of rich writing and some semblance of plot.  As a Haitian American, I had a serious problem with the second main story (especially because of Banks' fine style), Claude and Vanise's story.  I wept.  It was fiction, but I wept.  I remembered how I came here as a small boy.  I remembered what happened to my mother, but I won't go into that.  And I was angry because Mr. Banks is not Haitian.  I kept waiting for him to get it wrong--there were some stereotypical things, but they were minor.  This is the story I kept wishing someone would write.  Both Haitians and Cubans see Miami as a haven from poverty and political oppression in their countries, but America usually sees only the Cubans as deserving of refuge.  I am still a bit bothered that Banks is not Haitian, but for selfish reasons I wish every American would read this book.  I number it among my favorites of all time.	2002-05-12

The son of a prostitute and grandson of a grandfather who murdered his (Racehoss') grandmother, Albert followed his destiny and ended up in a tough Texas prison, which is darker and starker than anything I've seen in books.  In fact, I agree with another reviewer who suspects that Stephen King, and perhaps others, used Sample's book as a model for their prison stories and scenes.  Read this book if you're thinking about going to prison--it'll change your mind real quick.	2002-05-12

It was as though she was revealing things about our community that should remain private.  By the  end of the book, I was of a different mind.  This book is not just about the Haitian experience, this is a book about people, in particular a mother and a daughter, who have to come to terms with the way a cruel world has impacted their relationship.  That is everywoman's story, everyman's.	2002-05-12
US	36594095	RYMK4VLLY4ZF3	067978148X	645048612	The Rules of Attraction	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Ellis' Best Work	Stop it, you people who are analyzing this book for plot.  Quit trying to nail down the elusive symbolism, you whiners.  This book is not about any of that.  This book is a photo album of when we were yicky and MTV was still young.  I went to college the first time back in the 80s and I have read no book that captures the feeling of that time as this book does.  Yes, we were yuppies, but we were also the first of the slackers, too.    This is by far Ellis' best work.  It does not get the press of his other books, but long after they have been forgotten, this one will be hailed as a classic.	2002-05-12

You will not only track down the serial killer(s), you will peek into the dark closets of their minds.  Nothing is off limits, the detective, too, M Gantry, the hoochie mama cop, will reveal all about her sordid past.  You will love her, pity her, you will understand her.  By the time the story spins to its heady conclusion, you will be cheering both style and content.  It is unusual for a writer, an artist really, of this calibre to pull off a book like this, in which the story is as good as the writing.  I hope he can sustain the magic for a sequel.	2002-05-12
