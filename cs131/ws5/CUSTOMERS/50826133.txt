Furthermore, there is really no need to include both Colle systems in a book on The Colle. <br /> <br />The Koltanowski system and the Zukertort system are so different, and likely to be useful to different players, that including both in a single book is like including the Najdorf AND Dragon in the same book. <br /> <br />I recommend _A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire_ by Aaron Summerscale instead.  If you absolutely canoot get that book, then Lane's may be worth getting depending on  your needs.  If you can get Summerscale's book, then Lane's book isn't worth getting for the vast majority of people.	2004-07-29

I give the two star rating (rather than less) mostly because the plotline is decent, but there isn't much of it. A synopsis of this book would be:<br />*)Tie up loose ends<br />*)Find out a little more about what is happening to the dead.<br />*)Tie up some more loose ends<br />*)Find out who the &quot;One God&quot; is.<br />You could read all of _Fallen Sun_ and then the last chapter of _Lost Star_ and pretty much know what is going on.<br />I agree with some other readers that the recaps are annoying, but I guess I have gotten use to it, as this is the 11th book in the &quot;mainline&quot; sequence (3 Chronicles 3 Legends, Summer Flame, Soulforge, Brothers in Arms, Fallen sun, lost star).  I have also gotten use to the positively-horrid-tell-you-everything-because-you-can't-see-it-on-your-own writing that plagues Hickman's work. Furthermore, I was surprised at who the &quot;True God&quot; was...not &quot;Wow, you really got me there&quot; surprised, but &quot;Oh, I thought you had something better in store&quot; surprised.  I would have given the book 3 stars otherwise. Finally, I would like to offer my views on things to look for in the third book: Note how Wayreth Castle still hasn't turned up. Note how this mage &quot;Bogan&quot; is mentioned and not described much. Note how Raistlin's absence is still not accounted for. NOte how Raistlin and Fizban simply walked off at the end of _Summer Flame_.... Note how, at the end of summer flame, Raistlin is able to still command the staff of Magius. I think we should watch for Raistlin in the tower of Wayreth coming in to &quot;save the day&quot; again.  I was a bit surprised and unhappy when HE wasn't revealed as the &quot;One true God,&quot; but given who the &quot;One true God&quot; turns out to be, it would not be out of character for Him to come back on the scene...it appears they are going to need him.	2001-04-19

First be aware that is seems Hickman is brewing up some Mormom allegory here.  Hickman is a Mormon (Latter Day Saint), and it seems that he is trying to bend Krynn into having a semblance of his theology (Mina mentions premortal existence and talks of being sent by the one God in whose name she does all these great works). In contradiction to what another reviewer said, it _IS_ important that Tas is in this book, for more than one reason.  Tas is the second or third most important mortal in the history of Krynn, and the most important kender by far This book is like a set of worms all disconnected and burrowing toward a central point without knowing of the others' existence...that is to say there are three or four plot lines running through the book that coalesce more or less at the end. The writing of the book is quite poor, mostly because Tracy Hickman thinks he is writing to 10 year olds who have to be told, rather than shown, everything.  This is quite standard, and if you are happy with the writing of the other DL Weis and Hickman books, you will be happy with the writing of this one. The plot is quite good...and it is quite worth the read for those of us who are well entrenched in DL lore...note that you should not start on this book...definitely go back and start at the Chronicles.<br />For those wishing better writing in DL books, I highly recommend the Raistlin Chronicles... A short summary of the book: Tas goes forward in time from the Chaos wars to speak at Caramon's funeral...which may or may not have alterered Krynn's history by banishing all magic and calling dragons from another plane to rule Krynn.	2001-04-16
US	50826133	R2FWS83F7OBMLQ	1901259080	425034213	Semi-Slav	Books	5	34	34	N	N	A different type of opening book, and a welcome change	Matthew Sadler has put together a real masterpiece here.  The book is like no other opening book I have seen (except other books by the same author).<br />If you want to skip to the most important reason why this is as an excellent book, skip the next three paragraphs.<br />There are several types of opening books out there.  Some are &quot;repetoire&quot; books attempting to put forth a single, unified approach, or maybe two separate unified approaches, for the benefit of those without a lot of time on their hands.  Others are little more than compilations of lines with sparse commentary and tons of games.  These can be helpful as a reference, but are not as helpful in terms of actually learning an opening.<br />Still other opening books concentrate on explanation and stand motifs, with a few games for example purposes.  These are better for learning, but are still not in the same league as _The Semi-Slav_ by Sadler.<br />The thing that separates this book is as much the _type_ of commentary as the format, but more on that later.  The format is excellent: the book is broken into two main sections: the Bot. and Moscow systems.  Then several lines are each analyzed, using sample games with excellent commentary.<br />Now, I get to my major point: the type of comments, especially in the very first chapter of each main section is extraordinarily insightful.  The Semi-Slav can be pretty sharp, so many moves are forced, but Sadler does an A1 job of explaining what is going on.  Not simply tactically, but on a more heurestic setting.<br />His commentary is invaluable because it highlights the key issues of the formation, so you know the reasons why what you should do is good.  It goes one step further and often uses the _present_ situation on the board to give reasons why certain moves are good, rather than simply saying &quot;Do this because in the future it will help achieve a this common theme.&quot;<br />One example of this simple yet elegant commentary is about 13 moves down in the Botvinnik variation where the placement of the light bishop and the queen are discussed.  The key point is that White's KN has been traded, so it is natural to attack the g2 (which would normally be shielded by this knight) square and those central squares for which the KN and the misplaced QB are natural defenders.<br />I assert that it would not be overstating things to say the first chapter of each of the two sections of this book will be more helpful by themselves than the majority of opening manuals.	2000-10-17

I actually agree that someone of their &quot;big discoveries&quot; may have some merit:  The fact that &quot;Adolf Hitler- Austria&quot; has a numerical value of 666 may very well not be coincidence, for example.<br />My issue with the book (and I have only read 1/3 of it or so) is that many times they reduce words to single numbers by adding the digits together, so a word that originally signified &quot;285&quot; would equal &quot;15&quot; (the sum of its digits 2+8+5), which would equal &quot;6.&quot; <br /> Now, some quick thinking with this methodology lets one realize that this means that any given word has a 1/10 chance of being related to ANY other word: so of course you can find connection!  To make matters worse, you get to subtract 1 from anything that is antipodal to the Lord, but it seems they do this at their own discretion, sometimes subtracting, sometimes not.  With this much wiggle room, you can easily make connection between all types of things.<br />They also seem to throw away some information and occasionally make what seem to be absurd deductions:  For example there is a portion of Revelation that says &quot;And there were 200 million cavalry.....and 1/3 of mankind was slain.&quot;  They then say &quot;Wow! when you take 1/3 of 200 million you get 66,666,666 people (plus 2/3 of a person!), which is in the hypothecated range of the number of people killed in WW2!<br />NOTE: The Revelation says 1/3 of MANKIND, not 1/3 of the number of cavalry.  1/3 of mankind at that point was much greater than 66 Million.<br />Anyway, I really find the scholarship of this piece of work quite poor.	2000-10-10

It is a bit less  terse than &quot;little Rudin&quot; (Introduction to Analysis), but is a  bit spotty in comprehensiveness.<br />The problem is that the alternatives  have problems.  Simon Hall's book doesn't give as many proofs and doesn't  cover the subject matter as much (dealing more with functional analysis).   Royden is probably better, but I have not read it much, and I think it is  less advanced from what I hear.

For example, very little is given in the way of group (co)homology.  For  the specialist, you should instead invest in more specific books (e.g.  Robinson).	2000-09-09

Please don't be mislead by all the bad reviews.

It is  _that_ important.<br />The biggest idea in this book is the use of imbalances.   Unless the person you are playing is much worse than you, you should not  assume that you can gain an actual material superiority by simple  maneuvring.  The important idea is to use imbalances (rather than  _over_balances) to your advantage: steer the game so that your pieces are  worth more than his, even if &quot;the book&quot; says they are worth the  same.<br />Silman also gives great insight into helpful things to know.  Chess  books often suffer from a bad ratio of quantity to price, but this text  bursts with helpful information, and I recommend it to anyone who has  played enough to have bad habits.	2000-09-09

For a  better look, go to the artwork on &quot;Soulforge.&quot;<br />There is one  unfortunate aspect to this book.  Caramon's character comes to the  realization of what Raistlin is, and his reaction is a bit simplistic and  the characterization dealing with him is disappointing.  However, this is  nothing to be done about it.

I would like to give it  three different rating for different types of readers.<br />If you have never  read dragonlance before, but you enjoy the genre (Forgotten Realms,  Ravenloft, etc.), then you probably should consider getting this tome.  It  is not so much more expensive than getting all three in softback.  However,  be warned that the characters in Dragonlance are not as comlplex as you  might find in other sagas.  Furthermore, the writing in general is poor  (mostly due to the pure idiocy of the characters).<br />Why would I tell you  to get this if I just said the characters were too simple and the writing  poor?  Well, two reasons.  First, if you are a fantasy buff, you simply  cannot be complete without having read the dragonlance saga.  Secondly, and  probably more importantly, while the writing and characters are  disappointing, the actual story and comprehensive setup is very good, even  great.  The tale, as a whole, is quite involved, and this makes up for some  of the writing.<br />If you already have read Dragonlance, and you simply want  a hardbound copy, then I would definitely suggest buying this, as the price  is quite reasonable.<br />If you already have read Dragonlance, and you are  interested in the annotations, I am afraid you will be quite disappointed.   The annotations are mostly vapid.  More than half are Tracy Hickman's  self-indulgence self-gratification (i.e. Hickman giving himself a pat on  the back for making his world lifelike and his characters not completely  simplistic).  Margaret Weiss' comments are better, but Tracy's predominate.	2000-09-07

Doing so will rob  you twice, as you won't appreciate this book as much until you have read  the others (by &quot;others&quot; I mean the &quot;Chronicles&quot; and the  &quot;Legends&quot;), and you will also not have the pleasant feeling of  mystery regarding Raistlin as you would otherwise have while reading the  others.<br />That aside, if you have read the saga, or at the _VERY_ least the  &quot;Legends&quot; trilogy, then you should absolutely read _The  Souldorge_, as it gives a more comprehensive (and in some ways correcting)  version of Raistlin's younger days.<br />Furthermore, Weis writes MUCH better  than Tracy Hickman, and inasmuch as this book is fully her work (while the  saga is only half her's) the writing is much more compelling.  If you read  the saga but was unhappy that the writing and characters were too  simplistic and too moronic, take heart.  I wish Margaret had written the  entirety of the saga, but alas it was not to be.	2000-09-07

However, if you have read the previous books in the saga, not reading this  one would almost be like not reading the third book in the original  trilogy.<br />Note that this book is _not_ the &quot;fourth&quot; book in the  &quot;Chronicles&quot; sequence.  It happens chronologically after the  &quot;Legends&quot; saga, and should be read after one has already read the  entire 6 book saga (&quot;Chronicles&quot; + &quot;Legends&quot;).  Thus,  in some ways, it is like a bigger version of _Dragon's of Spring Dawning_,  as it ties up everything, or most everything.<br />Yes, many things happen in  this book that some will not like.  I would have liked Raistlin to have  come back in a more powerful capacity.  I would have liked more use of the  original characters.  The ending might make you unhappy, but don't worry:  Tracy and Marg has something else up their sleeve.  You see, this book is  _Technically_ the first book  of the &quot;Fifth Generation&quot; series.   The &quot;War of Souls&quot; saga is 1/3 of the way done and carries the  story on, so don't worry that it is all over in the end :&gt;.	2000-09-07

If you have ever read anything by Card and  liked it, you will probably enjoy Endor's Game.<br />If you have not ever read  a book by Orson Scott Card, or ambivalent about one that you read, you  should be aware that &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is definitely a book suited  for a young audience.  This does not mean that it cannot be enjoyed by  others, but children are very likely to enjoy it.  The entire book, or most  of it, is written in a third person perspective centered on Ender, the  title character.<br />Ender is a young child who is quite precocious.  He does  very well at games and much of the book is a detailing of his experience at  a training center.  Then he is requisitioned to work in a special training  program to help the humans against their alien aggressors.<br />The twist at  the end is not hard to see coming if you look for that sort of thing.

The  only question is whether it makes up for the generally poor writing and  simplistic characters.<br />If you enjoyed the first book in the saga, you  will probably enjoy this one.  But bear in mind that the style only gets a  bit better (and that is only because Tracy and Margaret have gotten over  their &quot;first date&quot; fumbles in the first book).  Also keep in mind  that if you commit to this book you will essentially be forced to get the  third one to complete the tale.<br />If you have a youngster and are looking  for a good gift for him, this is probably a good pick, as the simplistic  (and idiotic) characters won't bother him as much.	2000-09-07

The War of the Lance is brought to a satisfying  end.<br />I further recommend the &quot;Legends&quot; saga.  It is overall  better and is a natural next step in the saga.	2000-09-07

Either you have read the earlier books and liked them  enough to continue, or you haven't read them yet.<br />If you have read all  the earlier ones (including the first book of the series), then I highly  recommend this book and the final, concluding, work.  The story is quite  good and the rest of the dragonlance stories (Summer Flame) hinge on what  happens in &quot;Legends.&quot;<br />If you have not read the first  &quot;Legends&quot; book, but you have read the &quot;Chronicles,&quot;  then I recommend reading the first book in this series &quot;Time of the  Twins&quot; unless you absolutely had no interest in Raistlin (in which  case I wonder if you breath oxygen).<br />If you have not read _any_  dragonlance books, then the question of whether you should start is a bit  of a more complex one.  The truth is that the writing is not that great  (especially those parts dominated by Tracy Hickman).  The charactes are  simple and do some pretty stupid things.  However, the actual story is  excellent, and for many people that is enough.  I have read the entire saga  twice and can appreciate the interesting story while only cringing a bit at  the characters.	2000-09-07
US	50826133	RDGRTH908S351	0439064872	667539744	Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Another helping of literary candy	It is pretty simple: If you liked the first Harry Potter book, you will probably like this even more.<br />If you didn't particularly like the first  book because it was either too fluffy, too light, or had too flat of  characters, then this installment won't be any better for you.<br />However,  if you didn't like the first one because the &quot;twist&quot; at the end  was either too easy to see beforehand, then you might like this better, as  the ending _may_ be a little harder to see coming.	2000-09-07

Even if you are  not generally a fluff reader, be aware that this is particularly good  fluff.  The characters are quite flat, the hero unlikely and his choices  frustrating, but the book itself is quite enjoyable.  The imagery is  excellent and the plot, while simple, interesting.  There is just enough of  a twist at the end to catch the reader off guard.  Rowling does not  spend much time on the specifics of spell casting or explain much of the  structure in her magical world, but for some people this would be unwanted  background material.  This also gives a more lighthearted tone, so if you  like the comprehensiveness and gravity of the _Dragonlance_ saga, you might  be a bit dissappointed.	2000-09-07

There are some places where the newbie dancing partners stumbled on each  other's toes.<br />More importantly, the writing is not that great.  The  characters are too simple (and too IDIOTIC...I wonder how any band of  travelers who do some of the utterly stupid things some of the main  characters do could possibly survive).  Furthermore, the writing is a bit  simplistic.  HOWEVER, the actual story is _VERY_ good.  If you are looking  for a really good gift for a young child, one who might not be so annoyed  with poor characterixation and simplistic writing, then I would highly  recommend this book.  The overall story becomes quite long and involved.   Furthermore, any fantasy buff really should have read this saga.<br />If you  do choose to buy this, which I give my reserved recommendation towards, you  should probably simply buy the annotated chronicles, not because they are  annotated, but because they are reasonably price hardcover version.	2000-09-07

I have read many of his books (Pig, Singulariy, Tycho, and I think I  have read duplicate), and I think this is his best...but Tycho was close.  The book is a bit thin, and its audience is definitely chilrenesque, so the  quantity to price may be a bit small for your tastes, but other than it is  a very creative work with a quite humurous end. The basic gist is that  three young adults move into a house next to the main character and they  play a _very_ interesting game....	2000-09-07

It is still definitely Sleator through and through, but it is a bit more serious.  I  didn't like it as much as &quot;Tycho&quot; or &quot;Interstellar  Pig,&quot; but it is still a good read. Note that it is quite short, so the  quantity of book per dollar is a bit small, but it is excellent for  children who like quirky fiction.  It is also suitable for interesting  fluff for thos adults who want light reading.	2000-09-07

I  whole-heartedly recommned this book to anyone who liked Raistlin in the  Chronicles.	2000-09-07

Yarbrough cites many sources and gives the essence of most of  the opinions on the cases he covers.   That is to say that a given case may  have three or four opinions, as justices can agree on the same verdict for  different reasons, and Yarbrough does a fine job of explaining each on most  of the decisions covered. My huge qualm with the work is the simple fact  that Yarbrough commits one of the biggest sins possible in scholarly work:  he sharply biases his work without seeming to.  His language is subtly  biased, and an unwary reader could easily be manipulated.	2000-09-06

Hundreds  and hundreds of texts purport to show you techniques for getting smarter,  have better memory, etc.<br />The good news is that a couple books (Most  especially this one and &quot;The Einstein Factor&quot;) are actually worth  having and reading.  This book is well worth the price and should make a  great gift for anyone you know interested in learning.	2000-09-06

I have delved a great deal  into issues of increased intelligence, etc., and this book is one of the  best values around. It covers not only self-analysis but also  self-improvement.  It's notes on memory and speed-reading echoe the main  points in a program costing 20 times as much. I heartily recommend this  book to anyone interested in increasing your intellect.	2000-09-02
