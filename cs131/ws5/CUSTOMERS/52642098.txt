This is one of the most amazing subjects in -- and out of -- this world, but this book is bland and sometimes wrong.  What a waste.  It's another tale of the X-15 and moon program, thinly told through Armstrong's resume.  Yes there is some neat and new stuff here, but not much.  It is all overshadowed by the errors and omisions.  Yes, that is Buzz on the cover.  The quote as Armstrong walked on the moon is wrong.  Neil was not an 'ace' in Korea.  In describing an Earth orbit docking, Wagener talks of 'twinkling' navigation lights -- but I thought the twinkling we see is an atmospheric effect.  What did it really look like in orbit?  I don't trust this book to tell me.<br /><br />There are many great books on Armstrong's times and events, I'd buy many of them before this one.  And wait for someone like Jeffrey Kluger, Neil Thomson or Andrew Chaikin to get us close to Armstrong. UPDATE: The book you're looking for has been written, it's [[ASIN:B001O9CGHG First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong]]	2004-05-07

You'd be wrong. <BR><BR><br />This is an exceptionally well written book that gently yet almost instantly transports you to England, 1939.  You'll go through RAF flight training, and then be behind a V12 Merlin over Kent in the middle of the Battle of Britain.  There are hundreds of such true tales - and I've read most of them - but this is clearly one of the best.<BR><BR><br />'Boy' Wellum not only takes us inside the cockpit, but inside the emotions of a young man at war, and inside an amazing time and place in world history.  If you are a pilot looking for what it was like to fly the Tiger Moth, Harvard, then at 168 hours climb into a Spitfire, this is the book for you.  And if you are interested in a literate immersion into The Few, this is the book for you.	2004-01-10

The title sounds good, there is the promise of going along in the cockpit of a heavy jet around the world -- but this book is mostly a waste of time.  The grammar, the organization, the presentation, the jumping from one unrelated topic to another, the introduction of characters and situations that then are never heard of again are all annoying and distracting.  And it all ends with weird TWA 800 missile conspiracy stuff. Er what?<BR><BR>This is really just another personal website that would be OK reading for free, but is not deserving of a place on a bookshelf.  Keshner never really talks about the actual flying, and while there are some sorta neat stories in the book, and I'd love to hear them at an airport bar, I was left feeling cheated out of my money.

Not a wanna-be or some academic, but a real pilot who placed in the nationals. a pilot who was also once the youngest senior editor at Time magazine, making the writing as smooth and as vivid and as captivating as watching a summer airshow. I could not put the book down. After writing this review, I'll go back and read the whole book again.<BR><BR>You do not need to be a pilot to read this book, as it is not a technical aerodynamic textbook. You just need to be human. You will enjoy the salty spicy taste on the tip of the tongue from being inside a sport that demands extreme physical and mental preparations. Maybe about once a decade someone connects flying and living with loving and dying. Writers like Saint-Exupry, Gann, Bach. Now Ramo blasts into the box, and spins his wonderful dreams in the sky, the page, and deep into our souls. Yeah, I liked it.	2003-05-17

There are hundreds of big glossy books of planes and aviation history in bookstores, and with the 100 years of powered controlled flight anniversary, there will no doubt be a few more bowing the shelves. But if you want to buy just one, say for a present, then this is the one to buy. It is balanced, it is complete, it has pictures and text in harmony -- and it is not slapped together like some other slightly embarrassing flying tomes.<BR><BR>Over 400 pages perfect for a youngster, yet written well enough for any adult. Is it perfect? No. But 400 pages of perfection would be hard. I would have put in RJ's rather than the F-28 in the current small airliner section, but complaining about a couple of details should not hide the fact that this is one big cool book. Whatever more detailed specialized books about flying you get later, you will not need to get a great big glossy exciting celebration of flight book again.

It is the most riveting, yet real, book on relationships this 36-year-old divorced guy has ever read. <BR><BR>The relationships between me and my Dad, me and my Mum, and the new 'blended' families of ex- and step- fathers wives and girlfriends. There are some truly wonderful pages. It's a framework to measure yourself with, a metric to begin to ask questions about yourself with. I am never going to take 'The Grand Tour' of teenage lovers turning into newlyweds into babies and boys and retirement together and grand parenting. It is too late for me now. Instead it's Tony Parsons' world of wanting and understanding too late. Emotional guys trying to do right and somehow not getting there yet. The book aims deep inside and hits the target.

It isn't. It may sound like one and smell like one, and it may have been interior decorated to look like one; but the difference is -- it goes on wings.&quot;<br />Still the best way to get the fundamentals straight. In the 1930's test pilot Wolfgang noticed that the words and the realities of piloting did not seem to agree. After careful thought, he published a series of articles for Air Facts magazine that analyzed the true actions of stick and rudder. The book was released in 1944 and has been in print ever since. Some of the writing shows its age -- I don't think any flight instructor will talk about the airplane's flippers -- but the actual actions of the flight controls has not changed. If you are a pilot and you don't have this book, you need to add it to your professional bookshelf.	2002-04-22

Yes, sometimes these airplanes fail, but more often, it is the pilot flying the airplane who fails, and this failure is due to the lack of mental control.

Mental training, neurology and energetics are all covered. The mindset of excellence. Introduction by first lady of aerobatics Patty Wagstaff.	2002-04-20

There have been plenty of books using this formula. But this one is special. Very readable. As an airline pilot who has taken (but thankfully never had to use) crash site courses the technical aspects are pitch perfect, and as a reader of tons of aviation books, the writing is engaging and accessible. Just about anybody could read, understand, and become involved in this text.<br />The epic story of the world's most popular jet with an unknown fleeting flaw is the story. Adair avoids the clichés of the Airplane! genre, but the whole book smoothly reads like a novel. He seemed to have interviewed everybody involved in the 737 investigations. And as a professional journalist he knew how and what to ask. Balanced without preaching. It is clear the 737 was safe, but had a fatal flaw. Thanks to folks at the NTSB that never gave up, and people like Adair who track and report on the detective story, airline flying becomes even safer.<br />If you want to know what it is really like inside a crash investigation, without the hyperbole, but with all the smells and politics, this is a super book to start with.	2002-04-20

From DC-2 to 747, it was a career spaning the greatest changes in civil aviation. A story that is now told by someone who was active in advancing the skill of airline flying and can make it very readable. The airline pilot autobiography is not a new idea - there have been some good ones and boat-loads of just OK ones - but this is the best I've read.<br />A pilot's pilot (Captain Buck flew the line, did research and wrote some best-selling classic pilot education books) who can make the flight through the decades come alive. Imagine sitting down with an old man at a small airport who still pilots gliders and he turns out to be a storyteller of great wit and charm, a man who still remembers when crossing the Atlantic was a battle, who was there when airline flying advanced from shaky pistons to huge jets. Who would not want to relax in the sun, watch the airplanes, and listen to the wonders of TWA unfold. In the tradition of St. Exupery, Ernest Gann and Len Morgan. And yes, I liked it.	2002-04-17

It's one of my most dog-eared books, as I try to read it before every training session. Covers in detail all major procedures required to master handling a large airplane. Written by a master who learnt to fly with a barnstormer, earned two Distinguished Flying Crosses flying B-24's, and retired as an airline check airman with 35,000 hours and 500 students taught.

So the book gets five stars. But I could have just not written a review. Instead I want to share with you that this book is like getting to listen in on the story of a life, told first-hand by a real straight-forward all-American mountain-climbing airliner-flying legless man. Ed lost his legs in a harrowing five days spent on the side of Mount McKinley following a crash in a small plane he was piloting. Ed hit lows of VA hospitals and cheap beer. Ed now is a pilot for American Airlines, and still climbs big mountains. I learnt a lot about his life that I didn't know after flying with him for a month. It's not platitudes, or deep thoughts, but it is real. And it sounds just like Ed talking, not some fancy tarted-up bookish words. It was well worth my time to read it, and if you've never flown with Ed, it should be worth your time and money to see what you have missed.	2002-01-18

As one of the classic Ways, like flower arranging or kendo, it is an exploration into oneself. The author, now a Zen teacher and university professor, is not some a kid talking about how a day of Zen turned him into a Judo machine; rather this is a well thought-out, well-written journey of both Zen philosophy and martial arts practice. We follow Kenneth to Japan where he sits cleans the dojo, sits in zazen meditation, and becomes expert in Kyudo.<BR><BR>One of the first books to introduce a Way of Zen to the West was 'Zen in the Art of Archery.' Now `One Arrow, One Life' references Herrigal's classic, while providing a fresh expression of learning an ancient physcal skill, making them perfect accompaniments. The author has a deeper understanding of the history and methods of Zen, and clearly explains how they mate with a big bow, and how to carry the lessons on to your whole life. This book would be super for someone new to Zen, as well as someone who wants to revisit Herrigal. A lot of ideas that people talk about were put into place in my mind, then to my body and soul, thanks to this book.	2001-09-17

The topics range from classic Bach railing against the FAA by cheering for the Outlaws, to barnstorming, to Egyptians flying, to applying at United Airlines. There is an awesome article describing his favourite books, his relationship with pilots that write, complete with a reading list. There is even a little one-page article from 1959, 'There's something the matter with seagulls.'
