This book.	i anxiously awaited this book for more than a year,  when it was finally released, i could not wait to see it, then read it.<br />having been a great admirer of diana vreeland, and having read her autobiography, i could not seem to find much else about her life and her work.  but then eleanor dwight came along with the most information you could ever want to read about the legend, diana vreeland.<br />the book covers diana's entire life, and her work, right up until the end, nothing is missed.  the book is full of hundreds of never before seen pictures, of diana with her family, and at work.<br />if you are interested in reading about others colorful lives, then this book will not disappoint.  reading the book sure makes you wish you could have known diana vreeland, if only for a moment, thats all it would take to pull you in.  the book does a wonderful job of just that, but nothing beats meeting the real thing, unfortunately ms vreeland is no longer with us, but her legend lives on, and this book helps a new generation to become familiar with her.<br />this is one of the best biographies i have ever read.  i strongly recommend this to anyone interested in fashion.	2003-02-24

Not only is her physical transformation fascinating, but  her lifes journey is equally fascinating. <BR>Cindy has lived an incredible life, growing up on a farm, never really fitting in.  Instead of doing the 'right thing', Cindy did want she wanted and moved to London.  She made an exciting life for herself in London singing in a rock band.  <BR>The books takes you through all phases of Cindys life, childhood, boyfriends, family, but the book really takes off after she arrives in London.  The book has sex, drugs, rock n' roll, and alittle royal gossip, but I enjoyed reading about her surgeries and why she choose to do what she did.  <BR>I check her website ... regulary to read the 'latest news' of what she has been doing.  I also recommend her Plastic Surgery Guide and Video as well, both invaluable for those considering surgery.  <BR>Thanks Cindy for sharing your life with us, finally.	2003-01-16

I have followed Cindy for many years, never missing any American TV show she was to be on, and I have followed her remarkable transformation.  I have been interested in plastic surgery long before I knew anything about Cindy, I have read every article, watched every TV show regarding PS.  Maybe someday I will work with Cindy, ha. <BR>To finally read the life story of someone you have followed is a great journey.  I learned that Cindy did not have an easy childhood, but overcame her adversities and took control of her life, never taking no for an answer.  Cindy has lived the kind of life that I dream of, and reading her book gives me the inspiration to have the surgeries I want, and to do the things I want, and stop listening to what others expect of me. <BR>Cindy has lived, and will continue to live, an amazing life.	2003-01-14

Kennedy, Jr.	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Life Lived	Richard Blow has done an excellent job of revealing his friendship and working relationship with John Kennedy, Jr. In the book he reveals the 'behind the scenes' working of 'George' magazine. I believe that Mr. Blow has gotten alot of undue criticism for writing this book.  I don't feel this is disloyal or taking advantage of a private relationship. The book is a tribute to a great man, that Mr. Blow obviously respected and greatly admired. I think John would have approved.	2002-05-21

I got much more out of this biography than I expected.  I wanted to learn more about Billy Haines, and his struggle to be openly gay in Hollywood, and about his long marriage to Jimmie Shields. But, what I learned was how alot of people in Hollywood were gay, and openly so, but then became closeted later.  Stars I never knew were gay, Cary Grant, Claudette Colbert and many others. The book was fascinating.  Lots of gossip, Hollywood stories, movie star information, but more than all that its a book about the amazing life of Billy Haines, and more than 50 year love affair with his companion Jimmie Shields.  The book was well researched and never really left me wanting more.  I recommend this book as a source for Hollywood lovers, and for gay men and women.  A story all would enjoy, and a life worth reading about.	2002-04-12

She had a cool easiness to her modeling, she was almost surreal.  Her beauty was perfection.  I do not believe there has ever been a model that can compare to her.  The supermodels of today, Cindy, Naomi, Claudia are all beautiful, but not in the same way that Lisa was perfect.  Its so nice to see her images captured in a book. I hope that in the future more will be done to regenerate her place in history.	2001-10-24
