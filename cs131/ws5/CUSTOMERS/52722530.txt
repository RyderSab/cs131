Sugarman can't write fiction (that this largely nonfiction book was in the guise of.) He should stick to nonfiction. It read like a novel written by a 16 year old...and not a Thomas Chatterton or an S.E. Hinton, either.  And if he reveals in the book that Pamela Courson told him that Jim O.D.ed on her heroin, why didn't he put that fact in NO ONE HERE GETS OUT ALIVE? He co-wrote that book with Jerry Hopkins, and Hopkins was angry to find out that Sugerman had kept it from him.        If you want to read a high-octane novel (that this one tries to be), read instead ON THE ROAD by Jack Keroac (if you haven't already). Jim Morrison worshiped that novel, and even copied the laugh of the character Dean Moriarty. Morrison himself would prefer you to read ON THE ROAD, I'm sure of it!! Sugarman is a no talent person who is sponging off the talent and phenomenon of the Doors.	1998-06-07

But I was amazed to find it a wonderfully moving and graceful novel. Not much happens throughout, but what does happen is executed with such subtlety and artistry, that it makes for captivating reading. Harold Bloom--America's most famous and respected literary critic--put THE GARDEN OF EDEN on his list of Hemingway's masterpieces, and he only put four books on that list (the other three are A FAREWELL TO ARMS, THE SUN ALSO RISES, and COMPLETE SHORT STORIES).	1998-06-03

But I think it is an absolutely brilliant novel; probably Hemingway's third best (After THE SUN ALSO RISES and A FAREWELL TO ARMS). Thomas Hudson is an interesting protagonist, and his relationship with his sons is moving, and without the cynicism that colors most of the affectionate relationships in Hemingway's work. The writing is brilliant (among the best I've ever read), and the action scenes done with artistry. I believe ISLANDS is an under-appreciated novel in Hemingway's oeuvre.	1998-05-29

The writing is suprisingly clumsy, and the characters contrivances. (Incidentally, why do Hemingway's heroes alway want their women to cut their hair &quot;like boys,&quot; as Jordan wants his lover to in TOLLS??? In at least one Hemingway short story, the female lover cuts her hair like a boy to please her man; in THE GARDEN OF EDEN both women cut their hair like boys to please the man; in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, Catherine Barkely cuts her hair like a boy to please Frederick Henry. What's the deal??? One could make some rather interesting conclusions about Hemingway himself while pondering this recurring detail in his work!!!) Anway, about TOLLS, F. Scott Fitzgerald said it had &quot;all the profundity of REBECCA&quot; (a famously sleight novel). I think Fitzgerald sums TOLLS up well.	1998-05-29

This first section takes some concentration to get through, but it's necessary for the next section that explains the nature of consciousness itself. This part of the book is utterly fascinating and often mind-blowing. You'll be shocked to find out how your mind works, and how you previously and certainly weren't aware that it worked like THAT! The last section is disappointing, though, in that the author makes conclusions based on the flimsiest of evidence regarding the evolutionary history of human consciousness. It gets almost gobbledygooky new-agey. But the first parts of the book are founded on hard-won research, and those parts alone (if you haven't read about the original research elsewhere) are worth the price of the book many times over.	1998-05-25

(Brando can't write in SONGS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME, and neither could KATHERINE HEPBURN in her autobiography. As good as they are as actors, they don't suggest eloquence on the screen...despite the quality of the lines they say). But O'Toole is not one of the greatest writers alive. This volume shows that. His writing needs to be more linear. He IS one of the greatest actors alive, however. So I wish he would leave his desk and get in front of a movie camera or on stage instead. I don't believe there is such a thing as a genius actor. But if there is, O'Toole is it (and the only one). There has certainly never been an actor as charismatic (well, maybe Cary Grant. But could Grant have played serious drama as well as light comedy? He never played in a drama that I know of).	1998-04-23

I should have left well-enough alone. The book itself is a grind. And Amis injecting autobiographical passages in the midst of what is supposed to be a FICTION novel is egomaniacal and distracting (Amis would excuse it as &quot;post-modern&quot;). We go from fictional characters' lives to Amis complaining to the reader how he regrets always having been short. Save your little-man complex platitudes for your memoirs, Martin. To anyone tempted to read THE INFORMATION, read the &quot;New Yorker&quot; excerpt instead (or first, anyway). The excerpt was in an issue published in early 1995 (get it at your library).

He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the &quot;truth&quot; of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists.

The narrative is a little awkward so that he can put forth the real-life history of Aldrich Ames betraying America, but I was so interested in the Ames story, that I gladly forgave the awkwardness. Forsythe said this is his last book, and that is a shame if it's true. (He said that a few books ago, but then wrote more to keep up his lifestyle, so let's hope his expensive tastes bring him back to the word processor. If this is his last book, I must say, I think I found a thriller novelist who could fill Forsythe's shoes. I just read THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE by Craig Furnas, and he almost out-Forsythes Forsythe. THE SHAPE is a true page-turner available through Amazon.com).

The writing is the best you'll ever read, the story is touching and deep and rich, the charcters wonderfully drawn. And the last paragraph in the novel is both hilarious and endearing, and makes it a novel that is brilliant to the very last word. I can not recommend this novel highly enough. It is somewhat of an overlooked masterpiece (overshadowed by the lesser &quot;Bovary&quot;).  One critic said that the reason &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (the movie version) did so well was that &quot;it dealt wonderfully with unrequited love, something we can all relate to.&quot; Well, &quot;Education&quot; is about unrequited love, and it deals with it with 100 times the power that &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; did.

It will be interesting to see what kind of movie it will make (that will be released soon). I recently read a Crichton-like novel (in its lay-out more than its subject matter): THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE by Craig Furnas, and it is fantastic. I'd read that before this. But EATERS OF THE DEAD is interesting. I have to give Crichton credit for taking a chance on this book, since it deals with viking-days, which certainly is not standard Crichton-fare. His publisher was probably none-to-happy when he turned in the manuscript. Do you think Grisham's would be happy if his next book was about Eskimos hundreds of years ago? So I give Cricton an extra point for taking a chance.	1998-04-22

Hemingway said, &quot;Tolstoy wrote the best books, BUT TURGENEV WAS THE GREATEST WRITER.&quot; And then he went on to praise the short story &quot;A Rattle of Wheels&quot; above all other Turgenev stories. So if Hemingway thought Turgenev the greatest writer, and &quot;Rattle of Wheels&quot; the greatest story he wrote, then he certainly thought &quot;Rattle of Wheels&quot; the greatest short story ever written (aside from his own works, of course, egomaniac that he was).

One thing RISES has that Hemingway's later novels didn't is personality. Hemingway's later novels were very dry in tone (and I love them), and the characters spoke with verbal sterility (Richard Ford wrote that Hemingway's characters sound somewhat like robots. This description could in no way apply to RISES' characters). THE SUN ALSO RISES has humor and life, and the best dialogue I've ever read. I've read parts of RISES countless times. It's been knocked for being a collection of vignettes, and not strong on plot (and I don't consider &quot;plot&quot; a sin like some literary snobs do). But the vignettes (that do serve the story) are so beautifully crafted, they are a pure pleasure to read. There are two books I've read where, in parts, I wish I could have stepped inside the books and lived what was happening. WAR AND PEACE is one. THE SUN ALSO RISES is the other.	1998-04-15
US	52722530	RDQR14YNORMIS	0786700823	194255903	Gibbsville, PA	Books	4	7	24	N	N	OK	If you've read one John O'Hara short story, you've read them all. All characters are obsessed with their status in life, and if a man and a woman are alone together, you just have to wait until one will try to get the other in the sack. If you had a 95 year old grandmother in a scene with an 18 year old male high school student, you could almost expect that one would make a pass at the other. THE DOCTOR'S SON is the best O'Hara short story I've read. It is excellent. Read that one, enjoy it. But you need read no more, since everything in that story is in every other O'Hara story.	1998-04-14
US	52722530	R2JRGHZQG5FJBT	0899664784	551860371	Moby Dick	Books	2	8	17	N	N	Over-rated	MOBY DICK was trashed by critics in its own time, and was a commercial flop. I think those folks had the right take on the book. I found it tedious going. And it was odd how the fictional story was interrupted here and there to become a text book for a college oceanography class: everything you ever wanted to know about whales. I truly think MOBY DICK has turned into a &quot;classic&quot; because university students and professors who needed a literary novel to write about found MOBY DICK so rich with symbolism (even though the actual novel itself wasn't worth much). English term papers (and articles professors have to write for academic journals) require you to show--not whether THE GREAT GATSBY is a good read or not--but what Gatsby represents (the failure of the American Dream!!). The optometrist's billboard that appears throughout GATSBY represents...THE OMNISCIENCE OF GOD, AND HOW YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE HIS FATE. Those are the two big symbolic/metaphorical things in THE GREAT GATSBY. And I could write an English paper explaining those symbols. But MOBY DICK...my God!!!!!!!!! There are more symbols and metaphors on a single page of MOBY DICK than there are in the whole of GATSBY, or most other literary &quot;classics.&quot; I could write a thousand English papers and professorial academic articles about the symbolism in MOBY DICK. I mean, the white whale...his whiteness is symbolic of...where do I start??? That Queequeg is all tattoed...what do those tattoos represent??? (That's a term paper right there). And Queequeg and Ishmael (two men) sleeping together at the beginning of the novel &quot;like husband and wife...&quot; (Another paper explaining that). Peter Coffin is the name on the sign outside the inn at the start of the novel.  The last scene in the book has a coffin float to the surface after the Pequod (the name of an American Indian tribe!!!) sinks!!!! The inn is &quot;like Lazarus,&quot; the inn's windows like Lazarus's eyes. (Since when have you stayed in a hotel that reminded you of a g! uy raised from the dead?????? Ah...but it's symbolism!!!) Ahab's peg leg bitten off by Moby Dick?...well, of course, that peg leg is a phallic symbol! (Yet another academic paper written right there). And what of the biblical names...like &quot;Ishmael&quot; and &quot;Ahab&quot; (names not representative of American names of the time)...more term papers and articles for academic journals.  Grad students and undergrad students and professors over the years have needed literary works rich with symbolism like this to write about. And when there is a book like MOBY DICK...that makes your work very easy. And all those students and professors writing papers about MOBY DICK over the years have had a snowball effect so that people actually now give the novel merit in and of itself, aside from its helpful wealth of academic goodies. I will say that the last three pages of MOBY DICK are good. It is a good action scene, that final battle against the whale. (And there is enough symbolism in those last few pages, besides, for ten term papers. But it's good stuff in and of itself. But three good pages at the end of such a long, grinding book ain't worth the journey). When I read Mark Twain's quote that &quot;a classic is a book everybody wants to HAVE read, but nobody wants to read,&quot; I thought immediately of MOBY DICK.	1998-04-12
US	52722530	R7LD4ILM5R82O	0140186301	283114178	Lucky Jim	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A Masterpiece	While Martin Amis is indulging in egomania, he must know in his heart of hearts, his talent (even though it is formidable) will ever come close to his father's (Kingsley Amis) as is displayed in Kingsley's LUCKY JIM. LUCKY JIM is light and humorous, but has profundity in it, too, and is a brilliant novel. The language is poetic and highly literary, but at the service of the story. A lot of &quot;literary&quot; writing buries the story, (Well, like in Martin Amis's stuff, for instance), but LUCKY JIM has wonderfully poetic sentences, that, even if you did not notice their poetry, serve a reader who would only need the sentences for their furthering of the narrative. There is not a single word wrong in this novel. It's perfect down to the last syllable. And I know I'll read it again sometime, and parts of it numerous times. It's not called a &quot;classic&quot; for nothing.	1998-04-11

I read that one, and when starting FITZGERALD AND HEMINGWAY, thought I'd read the same book, but with a few added facts. Well, there are tons of new facts in F &amp; H that are EXTREMELY interesting to the Fitzgerald and Hemingway fan. I recommend this book highly. I've read much of it more than once.	1998-04-11

You can buy it, too, on Amazon.com. So get that one, too, if you get this one. Or get the Craig Furnas novel instead). But THRILL! was good fun, and Jackie delivers again.	1998-04-10

It got good reviews, but the public seemed to neglect it (I don't know why). This book is not only an important history lesson, it is also a wildly entertaining read. Don't YOU neglect this book.

(Craig Furnas's novel, truth be told, is better. It is a &quot;10&quot;. It deals with Nazis wanting to overthrow Peru, but there is a lot more to the book than that. It is a riveting page-turner that I could not put down. Before you read &quot;Chain of Evidence,&quot; read Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE. You can buy it through Amazon.com. YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!) &quot;Chain of Evidence&quot; is a good pool-side read.	1998-04-09

I could pick out the plot points like they were flags on a golf course. Literary fiction is supposed to be pure, with no tricks. Well, this had plotting as awkward as the worst John Grisham novel. And its pretentious use of language made me cringe at times. If Chabon is the best literary writer under 40 (as some say he is), then MTV really has destroyed some minds.	1998-04-09

Craig Furnas's &quot;THE SHAPE&quot; is the definition of a page-turner. I couldn't put it down. It is brilliantly plotted, wonderfully written, with surprises (all believable) in chapter after chapter. The amazing climax will knock your socks off! If you like well-crafted thriller novels by talented writers, I can't think of a better-crafted thriller by an author with overwhelming talent than THE SHAPE. Get it. Read it. Give it to your friends. They'll thank you for it. (Mine have!)	1998-04-09
US	52722530	R1POB20C2IB622	0679446486	684823314	Airframe	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Very good	I personally (unlike some other readers/reviewers on this page) prefer Crichton's books that deal with the real world rather than techno/sci-fi stuff. DISCLOSURE and TERMINAL MAN were great (I personally detested JURASSIC PARK). And AIRFRAME is somewhere between DISCLOSURE and TERMINAL MAN (TERMINAL MAN comes out on top for me). AIRFRAME is both interesting and suspenseful. In a few spots the narrative is awkward, but overall it is a first-rate Crichton novel. I would like to say that, before you read AIRFRAME, you should read a suspense novel I read recently that is much better: THE SHAPE by Craig Furnas. It is a page-turning thriller about Nazis trying to take over Peru (but is about much more), and I could not put it down. THE SHAPE gripped me like a sumo wrestler, and would not let go!! It is the definition of a great suspense read. You can buy it through Amazon.com. I recommend you do. You won't regret it!! But AIRFRAME is still good.	1998-04-09
