US	52505807	R2MH9SCN8BZFQ6	0898869412	70791014	The Beckoning Silence	Books	5	22	22	N	N	A Very Good Read	I've enjoyed every one of Simpson's books that I've read. It's hard to say why -- maybe it's because his books seem more personal than others or maybe it's because his books tend to ramble in a personal way that cover a lot of ground -- from personal to philosophical and then to the side of the mountain. At any rate, this book starts with a climb in the Andes and a near call with a collapsing serac and Simpson's increasing sense of his own mortality. For some people, this would be called a mid-life crisis and Simpson explores the impact of this realization on his own endeavors. Unlike other people, though, Simpson decides to climb the classic route up the North Face of the Eiger. As he prepares for the climb, he reflects on some of the historic efforts in the 1930s -- and then as he details his climb, he relates the stops and efforts to the history. In fact, he revels in the history as he ticks off some of the stops on the route. I get the sense that we haven't heard the last of Simpson yet. <br /> <br />This should be the second of Simpson's books to read after Touching The Void.	2005-03-16

The writing (or at least the translation) is wooden -- compare these books to those of Joe Simpson or Greg Childs. Still, there was much that was interesting in this book and many good photographs. Some of the details on the journey to Everest through Tibet were intriguing. All in all, this book deserves three stars and would be worthwhile recommending to someone who really enjoys mountaineering.	2004-10-26

This is an interesting book but hard to characterize in just a few words. The book certainly offers a comprehensive perspective of Hill's climbing experience from her first climbs as a teenager to recent years. The personal perspectives of many of the key rock climbers of the 70s, 80s and 90s that she offers in this book are often insightful, humorous and touching.<br />However, I think the reason why I give this 4 stars (versus 5 stars) is that I felt that it was missing a bit of the spirit that characterizes the best books of the climbing genre. Even the opening chapter where she describes her fall is missing just a little bit that make it less gripping. There is definitely a lot to like in this book but I can't help but think that it could have been just a touch better.	2004-04-01

He is also an extremely creative and interesting writer. One of the best things about this book is that it is inundated with humorous touches and is often hysterically funny. I highlyl recommend this book.<br />The stories he tells in this book, most of them true or at least with a kernel of truth in those that are larger than life, are always interesting. While the stories here only occasionally touch on climbing activities, they demonstrate a consistent philosophy of an adventurer at heart -- someone who lives his experiences to the fullest. Through his writing, he shows that he truly cares about the environment where his adventures take place; even though his experiences exploring prehistoric cultures in Malaysia seem to show a bit of disrespect to the cultures he is interfering with, I always sensed that he was respectful of the people around him.	2003-11-09

Maybe it's because it was written by a 3rd party some 40 years after the incident and the memories of the participants are dulled. Maybe because the writing was fairly dry. I still read it all the way through as the story is compelling all by itself but it just lacked a sense of drama. I noticed recently that there is a second book out on this same incident and I have to wonder if it's a more compelling read?	2003-08-15

Although the three or four travelogues dragged a bit, the majority of stories are amusing and, in some cases, really funny. For example, how can the theory of relativity be observed/proved by a man and woman? (Sorry for the tease -- you'll have to read the book to get the answer to this question.) Putting wooly ovine conspiracy theories at front and center of the evidence, the book certainly offers some evidence to the notion that boulderers are more at the flaky edge of the climbing world. Very enjoyable read.	2003-06-27

The second half settles down to more of slow, plodding pace. There are no great revelations; it is almost as if the famed British 'reserve' seems to come into play. The writing itself doesn't have the same spirit or liveliness that other writers bring to the genre of mountaineering books; that is, less of the climbers' actual personalities are conveyed than in other books. Unlike some of the best books, there are few spots in this book where the tension and pressures of climbing become self-evident in the writing and the expressed drama between the climbers. That said, there were parts of the book that were very rewarding and enjoyable to read such as the elaborate details given on the hike into the mountains gave me a better perspective on the geography rather than just observation of details. In short, this not a bad book by any stretch of the definition -- it's just not a great one.	2003-03-18

In his forward, Twight challenges the reader directly when he says that he wants to make them think, think really HARD, about what he's writing. Twight expects the reader to put it down periodically to do that thinking. He succeeded. This book is an intensely personal perspective on climbing, the ethos of climbing, and the friendships of climbing. The stories are, sometimes, not easy to read -- I sometimes found myself re-reading parts of them just to make sure that I didn't miss anything. Later in the book, Twight indicates that the &quot;Dr. Doom&quot; persona that he put on was sometimes (maybe) overdone for the articles he wrote. Nonetheless, the feelings of anger and rage and the feeling that he just wants to climb his own way and to his own standards, without interference, appear completely genuine starting right from his quotes from his favorite punk rock songs. Adding to the level of interest are Twight's comments after every article where, with some experience and maybe mellowing of time, he adds some additional reflections on what the story meant to him then and now. (Note: This book won the 2001 Banff Mountain Book Award for Mountain Literature.)	2003-02-25

It helps making the intimidating subject of wine appreciation much less scary. Gaiter and Brecher bring a few decades of wine tasting experience and the perspective of years of happy partnership to the book.<br />This book is not a reference book like many others in this genre. Rather, it is more of a user's guide to different wines that brings the joy of tasting and exploring wines to the reader. The book offers lots of good, common-sense advice on &quot;simple&quot; tasting procedures, on how to buy wine, on how to taste and enjoy wine, and other topics. It also offers a healthy perspective on wine rituals, skewering some of the more pretentious in the process.<br />One of the things that we enjoyed about this book is that it offers a broad perspective on what to expect with different wine varietals. It covers everything from Barbera (from the Piedmont region of Italy) to Zinfandel, the &quot;native&quot; grape of California. These varietal sections have been improved in the second edition (we've read both versions) and now includes one on sauvignon blanc which has always been one of our favorite white wines.<br />Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys wine or would like to enjoy wine.	2002-12-09

Harrer goes far beyond simply recounting the story of their 3-day ascent and describes the earlier unsuccessful and often fatal efforts that helped pave the way for their ultimate ascent and several of the subsequent successful and tragic ascents as well. Although written in a somewhat dispassionate manner that may be due to the translation from original German, this book is a very comprehensive description of the story behind the climbs of the Eiger.

The ten stories that are included in the book are amusing and easy to read in a way that is very attractive to children. The stories of Chelm have not failed to get a laugh (sometimes a little giggle and sometimes something more) each time that we have read them. However, the book goes one step beyond the stories themselves. Every story is followed by 3-4 questions that you can ask your children after reading the story. The questions can be helpful in prodding your child to think about some of the deeper meanings behind the story as well as to measure their understanding of what makes the people of Chelm foolish yet, ultimately, wise in their simple ways.

But it doesn't match up to earlier efforts. The key to books like these is not just that they need to be well-written so that the reader can fall along - Mr. Poyer does a fine job of writing. Unfortunately, however, this book falls short on the premise of believability. Although the first third of the book seems completely plausible, it just does not seem likely that the key plot twist (when the boat reaches the China Sea) could really happen.  I'd get this if you're a fan of Poyer or if you like naval yarns.	2002-11-12

So, I found this book to be an interesting perspective that describes several years of a special operations group that supported Norway during the war. The book presents, rather drily at times, the stories of the men and ships who built the Shetland Bus operation -- from the time that they requisitioned and provisioned the ships and fishermen/sailors to the time when the wooden fishing ships were replaced with faster, more reliable submarine chasers.<br />The glue that holds this book together is the adventures of the Norwegian sailors, as retold by Howarth after the debriefs of the crews. (Howarth was prevented from sailing by the British Navy so his only first-person perspectives are from the operations and shipyard management side of the picture.) In short, what makes this book real is the stories about the storms that they sailed through, the difficulties in getting their small vessels across the North Sea, and the narrow scrapes they had with the Germans when they entered the protected waters of the Norwegian fjords<br />In summary, this is a marvelous account of a small but important operation. It could be improved by slightly more adventurous writing style but is definitely worth a read if you're interested in seafaring adventures or personal stories from the World War II era.	2002-10-23

Ridgeway describes the epic story of the first successful American climb of K2 in 1978. K2, the second highest mountain in the world, has always presented unique challenges due in part to its remote location and in part to its degree of difficulty.<br />There are two fascinating aspects to this climb that are explored in great detail. The first key sub-plot tells the story of the organizational and personal issues that emerged as the expedition dragged on week after week. The schism that developed between the four aggressive climbers (Ridgeway, Reichardt, Wickwire, and Roskelley) and the other climbers demonstrates the pressures that can grow within any small group of people, friends or not, when they are subjected to incredible physical demands, differences of opinions, and the need to wait out the inevitable storms. With some of the challenges they faced, it is remarkable that the entire team continued to carry loads up the mountain day after day and that they were ultimately successful in putting four climbers at the top.<br />The second sub-story describes the route selection process by the lead climbers at the top of the mountain. They were exploring a new route in difficult conditions. Ultimately, this culminates in the decision, whether forced by equipment failure or by choice, by three of the four climbers to make for the top of K2 without the use of supplemental oxygen - a feat that had never been completed before. At the same time, the almost hallucinatory description of Wickwire's emergency bivouac at 28,000 feet is a compelling story of his determination to survive.<br />This book is a great read for those interested in the history of mountain climbing.	2002-10-18

Unlike expedition accounts, these cover broad swathes of time -- about ten years each. This approach gives the author a chance to describe the advances in his technical climbing capability through the years. <br />More significantly, however, the collection gradually downplays the technical side; the length of time that he surveys gives Bonington the space to describe his evolving philosophy towards climbing. The technical aspects of climbing seem to diminish through the book and the storyline is replaced by the inner exploration of what it means for him to climb. As he grows older, the changes in personality that it takes to become a successful leader of climbers are also increasingly demonstrated.<br />Bonington has certainly lived a charmed life; except for his injuries suffered on the Ogre, he has been blessed with luck that few other climbers have sustained over a 30-40 year span. He has also been blessed with an ability to write that few other climbers (perhaps Greg Childs, Joe Tasker, Peter Boardman, and Joe Simpson?) can match.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-08-06

Andric writes a fictional, yet truthful, history of the bridge at Visegrad which stood for centuries. The key to the book, from a reader interested in this from a more historical perspective rather than a literary viewpoint, is that the tensions between the different residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina are apparent. From the Turkish occupation to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the factions intertwine throughout the history of the town and the bridge. Although told, or translated, in a slow, laconic style, the writing was wonderful. The individual stories were well told and kept the history of the bridge moving forward.<br />I enjoyed this book quite a bit.

My first reaction on reading this book was amazement as to how dysfunctional this team was due to the fractured leadership style. The inability of the strongest climbers to agree on strategy and work loads contributed to the team's overall slowness on the climb. Yet they still managed to put people on top of the mountain. Other climbing expedition books often make allusions to similar types of  disagreements on strategy and plan but this one really lays it all out in front of you. <br />My second reaction was that there are surely two or more sides to any story -- this version of the climb was surely colored by Roskelley's own self-acknowledged aggressive personality and his bias/perceptions of what his team members were thinking at each step of the way. The second afterword from Roskelley describes a bit more of other team members' own reactions. <br />The story was compelling but I left one star off the review because the writing style was somewhat wooden. Plus, I wanted to hear more about the climb from someone other than Roskelley to get a different perspective.	2002-01-05

In each region, it includes interesting anecdotes on Lynch's own adventures in finding unique wines and the winemakers he comes in contact with. Lynch is most passionate about the wines of Burgundy -- and least interested in Bordeaux -- as much because of his enjoyment of the wines themselves as to the different natures of the wine trade in those regions.<br />Some of the other reviews note a &quot;pedantic and sanctimonious&quot; manner from Lynch's writing. There is something to this perception as Lynch does have a tendency to hammer his points home again and again. Nonetheless, Lynch is so passionate about what he likes and the characteristics of winemakers that he likes to work with, that you can almost overcome it. (Nonetheless, this is why I dropped one * from my rating.)<br />For what it is worth, I read this book about the same time as I read Patrick Mathews book on natural winemaking.  Interestingly, they form a matched pair as both books share a passion for wines made, as much as possible, through traditional methods without extra intervention.	2001-10-11

Everest. By weaving together the story of his own effort with a number of little-known stories from his father's Everest ascent, this book brings the spirituality of the Himalayas to the forefront. While the world celebrated Hillary and Tenzing for their achievement, Jamling was inexorably drawn to attempt Everest in his own time. According to the book, both men reached their goals through remarkably similar experiences which shows, as probably few other people can, that climbing Everest is still a personal journey that is remarkably unchanged over the last 40 years even though both the culture and equipment have changed considerably. Although there is not much that is new in this book about the well-documented troubles on Everest (see Krakauer's Into Thin Air) in 1996, this book does break new ground by telling the story from the perspective of the native Sherpas.	2001-05-09

Many books on winemaking attempt to reduce a complex topic into a 'cookbook' approach to making wine. Instead, Matthews delves into the philosophical issues of what makes a 'real' wine. The goal is to understand how personal taste can be translated into the grape-growing and winemaking process.<br />In the late 1990s, there has been a revival of natural methods that counter the industrial approach to winemaking. This book is centered on the tension between approaches to making wine that are used in the old world and new world. To illustrate this tension, this book focuses is mainly on California, where where is currently a swing back to more natural methods where there is currently a swing back to more natural methods although winemakers use both approaches. Some of the topics covered include: What is the role of terroir (site selection) in making wine? How do you choose which grapes to grow? How does one go about planting the vineyard? What makes some wine 'good' and some wine 'bad'?<br />Matthews' book is thought-provoking. It is well worth buying if you are interested in wines and winemaking and some of the tradeoffs that winemakers are making in their search for wine that embodies the soul of the earth from which the grapes grow.	2001-04-10

Each of these stories is a well-written perspective on the art of climbing; they cover a wide range of his experiences ranging from sea-level (island cliffs in the Gulf of Tonkin) to the top of the world in the Himalayas. Each of the stories reflects to Child's own experiences over the last 10-20 years and the philosophy of climbing that he has developed in this time.<br />Many of these stories are written with a dry sense of humor (eg, the 10 rules of bivouacs) that reflect Child's personal experiences. Of course, this humor leavens the drama and tragedy that are described in several of the pieces. With the variety of stories that are included in this book, it is distinctly different from 'Thin Air' which covers three different Himalayan expeditions in depth. I'd recommend both highly; the difference in voice shows the range of perspective that Child can generate with his passion for this sport.	2001-03-27

The pictures are nice and have the same spirit as the originals; my 6-year old boy likes the way that the pictures are drawn. However, the story is a bit choppier. The lessons are carefully and explicitly made: (1) be careful what you wish for as you might be surprised and (2) that life is mixed between good and bad just like succotash is mixed with beans and corn.<br />If you're looking for the classic Babar stories by Jean de Brunhoff, then this would be a second choice.	2001-01-09

The fact that there is a true story behind the book makes it even more interesting for the adults who have been doing the reading. This book has particularly captivated our older boy. As we read and re-read the book to him, it was fascinating to watch as his attention shifted from simply listening to the story to observing how Picasso changed his representation of Sylvette over time -- and his questions about the art captured that change in perception. Together with the Classical Kids CDs, this series by Anholt has been one of the more valuable ways that we have introduced classical Western culture to our children.	2001-01-08
