Each person has his own obsessions and knows only part of the truth. As you read, you become fascinated by the characters and the story, the political and religious intrigue, and the beliefs of the times. And of course you want to understand the truth of the incident. It is one of few historical novels where the details ring completely true. A really great book!	2003-11-14

This book is well written, extremely interesting, and drags you in and keeps you there until the finish. I was disappointed to see no more books available by this author.

It is not a compelling story, and it seems very derivative. I've noticed several places where a small amount of research would have helped get the details straight. For example, Tess's boyfriend rejects the Californian Bordeaux and asks for a New York one. I believe that, as with most French regional wines, the label Bordeaux can't be used unless the wine comes from Bordeaux. Therefore, there's no such thing as a Californian or New York Bordeaux. <br />The interactions among the various law enforcement personnel don't seem very convincing to me, either, but I can't believe at all in Maggie O'Dell as a convincing agent. A woman who leaves her gun in the desk drawer for the movers to find? She is so terrorized that if she was a responsible professional she would have taken herself off the case to begin with.	2003-01-03

However, I found the story from the past to be written in a distractingly self-conscious way, so much so that I almost quit reading the book. It did, in the end, make me interested enough to continue, but only just. The names of the Anasazi, in particular, seemed totally unlikely.<br />The story from the present seemed more interesting at first but decreased in importance as the book went on. I felt that the anthropologists and archaologists were unconvincing--it's hard to believe they would be so illiterate and uninformed. I can't imagine someone in that field (and I know several), for example, who would be ignorant about history and basic English vocabulary. In addition, there were some completely unnecessary passages, such as the entire spiel of a flight attendant upon landing of a plane, I assume to convey the temperature, when a sentence phrase would have done the same.<br />The characters were not very well drawn, so it was difficult to care about what happened to them. In general, they had one or two characteristics each.<br />Overall, I found this book to be mediocre.	2002-07-17

I am also not a fan of word games, so this might be the problem. I guessed the murderer halfway through the book and never swayed from my choice, which isn't necessarily bad, although I prefer it not to happen. But I found the dialogues increasingly annoying, especially the last one, which was used instead of a more clever approach to tie up the loose ends. If the dialogs actually contained clues (except for the one with the Roman numerals--which I thought was obvious), I certainly didn't catch most of them, and since I was able to figure out everything except the motivation (which I figured out partially) without them, I found them to be a distracting filler.	2002-01-29

I am a mystery reader and am usually disappointed when I can figure out all the secrets right away, but even though I could do that with this book, there was so much more going on than just finding out the secrets that I couldn't put the book down. <br />In response to another reader's letdown that a romance between the wife and Robert wasn't pursued, I would say that most people who are grief-stricken and confused wouldn't turn to another person within days of their spouse's death.

First, the writing style had none of the delicacy that is so much a characteristic of Austen's style, and since the book was supposed to be letters and journal entries written by Austen (rather than a third-person narration), I think it is important that the author be able to faithfully present that style. Second, and even more irritating, the behavior of the characters is not even remotely what one would expect from that class, society, and time. Never, for example, would the Lieutenant treat Austen as he does throughout the book, especially in falling upon her. Too often do I read &quot;18th century&quot; novels that have 20th century characters (or worse, characters that do not behave properly for any time and place) and such is the case in this book.	2001-06-14

The books amusing and make an enjoyable quick read. Although I understand where the comparisons to Jane Austen are coming from, I think they are off the mark, though. I think P.G. Wodehouse is a fairer comparison, without so much silliness (which I love). These little trifles don't have the depth or subtlety of Austen's works. However, for a light read where you like most of the characters and wish them well, you can't beat Thirkell. My favorite is Cheerfulness Breaks In.	2001-04-16

But what really frustrates me in a mystery is when the detective does not follow obvious trails or makes nothing of pretty strong hints. For example, Weaver had the manuscript of his father's book in his possession and knew it probably related to his death. Did he read it? No, it made him sleepy! Then someone stole it from him. Why not make it more difficult for him to get the manuscript in the first place than have him ignore it? There were many incidents like this throughout the book. If there is anything that makes me impatient, it is a stupid detective.	2000-10-04

It is a closely edited description of an old man's life in a remote rural area of Ireland in the first half of the century. He tells a few stories from his father's and grandfather's days but mostly describes what life was like during his life. The book was first published in the 50's, I think. Without referring directly at all to the major events of the day, we get a look at the changes that were underlying society in his time. From the story about his grandfather being &quot;pressed&quot; to serve in the British Navy during the Napoleonic wars on, I was hooked. The Kirkus reviews are misleading, though. They make it sound like the man was telling fairy tales instead of fairly straightforwardly recounting his life, which involved a fair amount of superstition.	2000-10-04

Although I find this book slightly more interesting than did the reviewer who likened it to Sominex, I have to confess that I am trying to finish it out of obstinacy and of my interest in Dicken's life. Ackroyd's writing  style does indeed get on my nerves, particularly his effusions about  Dickens' genius. Maybe he was a genius, but we don't have to be reminded 40  times a chapter! What bothered me the most were the chapters inserted here  and there that were Ackroyd's fictional accounts of Dickens meeting his  characters or other writers who did not live in his time. I found them  corny and unbearable. I have never seen anything like this in other  biographies, and I think that's a good thing. The only reason I am giving  this book 2 stars is that it reflects an incredible amount of scholarship.  But I have no idea why it is so well-regarded.	2000-06-16

I was willing to give it a try on its own merits once I figured out that the characters had nothing to do with the ones that Jane  Austen created, but I couldn't get past the pretentious writing style,  especially when the author used the wrong words (one of many examples: she  used the word &quot;tonsorial&quot; when she meant &quot;sartorial&quot;).  If she thought she was echoing the writing style of Austen, trying to sound  formal and Victorian by using the biggest words she could find, she should  try reading Austen again (I'll bet she won't find the word  &quot;betwixt&quot; used five times in one page)--and use a dictionary!	2000-02-08

By the end of the second book I couldn't put  them down. <br />But they are not easy to read. Game of Kings, although the  only stand-alone of the series, is particularly difficult because of the  quotes in antique foreign languages. I didn't try to decipher them, and by  the second book they all but disappear. <br />All I can say to those readers  who found the series difficult to read is that reading it is worth your  patience. If you like authentic historical fiction, exciting action, and  compelling characters, plough on ahead! Lymond as a character is not easy  to understand, but rest assured that most of your questions will be  answered by the end of the series.	1999-12-01

I started out this book being frustrated by the assumptions Schrage makes. For example, at the beginning of the book he talks about collaboration and seems to be making the assumption that people who work in teams DO NOT  collaborate.<br />Maybe my experience working in a software company is  different from what people experience in other industries, but it seemed to  me as if Schrage had a bizarre view of how people interact within a  corporation. <br />Schrage's central message seems to be that tools help  people collaborate--not exactly an insight.
