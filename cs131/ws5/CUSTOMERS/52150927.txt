Bowden then introduces us to Pablo Escobar, a drug dealer who gained   whatever he wanted through extreme violence and fear.  The first half of the book details how Pablo used these tactics to become one of the richest men in the world.  The second half details how this quickly unraveled into a manhunt which had no intentions of taking him prisoner.    One interesting point in this book is that no one could deal with Escobar through legal tactics.  While goverment officials were talking to his lawyers, he was orchestrating car bomb attacks on innocent people just to put more pressure on negotioations.  The only group which was able to take down Escobar's empire was another rogue group which operated outside the law called Los Pepes.  They used Escoabr's terrorist tactics back at Escobar and this caused him crumble rapidly.	2005-10-02

The information contained in the book is thoroughly researched and enlightening.  Diamond's thesis is that modern-day civilization was solely determined by geography.  In my favorite sections he gives examples how geography affected plant and animal domestication, and he illustrates how the east-west orientation of Eurasia led to their rapid propogation. <br /> <br />The problem with this book, however, is not what it contains, but rather what information it is missing.  Diamond never wavers from his thesis even when it has many apparent flaws.  He discards the notion of biological/cultural differences affecting the progress of civilizations as \\"racist\\" and goes no further.  Well, unfortunately the unpleasantness of a theory has nothing to do with whether or not it is true.  Diamond owes his readers more than a brief dismissal of ideas which run contrary to his thesis.	2005-09-14

The episodic plot and many dialects were too much for me to handle.  Now, nearly 10 years later, I find this book an absolute masterpiece.<br /><br />Twain paints 19th century american ideals, themes, and perspectives through the experiences of perhaps the most memorable character in American literature.

This problem hinders the book throughout as he struggles to relate these two phenomena with selective case studies, but I believe these two large topics would have worked better as separate works.     Diamond also tried to create metaphors without the evidence to support them.  For example, he tries repeatedly to convince the reader that modern day Montana is similar to Norse Greenland and the United States is similar to the Mayan civilization, but his arguments fall short.      The best parts of this book are the modern day sections on Rwandan genocide, Hati, and industry and environmental policy.    These appeared well researched and unbiased with a personal agenda.  I felt the problematic sections were those on the ancient past and those attempting to predict the future.  They seemed to be based more on selective facts and personal conjecture.	2005-08-14

Most of the book focuses on Lincoln, but the Garfield and McKinley sections are more interesting since they are less well known. <br /> <br />For the audio version, there are several celebrities which read the quotes of various characters, but do not get this book because you want to hear Conan O' Brien and John Stewart perform.  They probably have less than 5 lines each. <br /> <br />Also, Sarah Vowell is the narrator, but there is a slight problem: she can't read.  Well, I'm sure she can read, but just not well out loud, which is kind of important if you're narrating an audio book.  Luckily it only takes a while to get used to her stilted delivery, either that or she improves as the book goes on. <br /> <br />At times she gets personal, and I would have liked her to get more so.  For example to reveal how she came to love US history and all things macabre.  In all, this is a charming book which will eduacate and entertain, but I wouldn't recommend it as an only source for historical accuracy.	2005-07-11

At first I thought, Davis was writing a fluff piece on his idol, but he quickly dispells this image by diving straight into Morisson's drug use, violent behavior, and selfish antics.  However, Davis is always reminding the reader of Morrison's love of books, poetry, and philosophy, and how he incorporated these into his song writing.      Davis focusses mainly on the years of the Doors, and describes in detail most of their major concerts from the first LA club shows to the large-scale arenas.  Although, \\"death\\" and \\"legend\\" are in the subtitle, these 2 issues are only a small portion of the book.	2005-06-23

Unfortunately, this book has too many flaws and not enough substance.  The first main problem is that Surowiecki does exactly what he tells the reader not to do: he jumps to conclusions that suport his thesis rather than analyzng the evidence.  For example Surowiecki looks at stocks after the Challenger explosion and concludes that the market's group wisdom determined which company was at fault, instead of any of a number of more reaonable conclusions. <br /> <br />This leads to the next flaw of the books, which is that the evidence presented is unecessarily thin.  He presents experiments with vague descriptions and never shows any math or statisitics used to derive his results.  He dances around the wonderful field of game theory, but never references it and hence misses the theory's insight on his topic. <br /> <br />Not surprisingly, Surowiecki contradicts himself alot.  The reason for this is simple: groups have as much intrinsic wisdom as they have intrinsic idiocy.  Surowiecki only tries to pretend the former is true, while being forced to admit the latter throughout the book.	2005-06-08

The main escape is truly one of the more tense scenes I've ever read, and it is truly incredibile, but there are more dimenstions to this book. <br /> <br />Brickhill gives us a first-hand account of life in a German POW camp.  He goes into great detail jury-rigged engineering involved.  From building the tools, to digging dunnels, to forging documents, to designing air pumps, all in a covert way in a prison camp environment. <br /> <br />An interesting them was that they were escaping to a far more dangerous place then the prison camps.  WWII Germany was not a safe place to be picked up by the Gestapo if you were an Allied soldier.  Brickhill's complete research into the fate's off all the people involved on the German and Allied sides caps of the book perfectly. <br /> <br />I also highly recommend seeing the NOVA special on PBS about The Great Escape after reading this book.  They show excavations of the tunnels as well as interviews with the soldiers.	2005-05-31

However this novel still has some of the problems found in King's other works: major suspension of disbelief and overly dramatic descriptions.  That being said, this is the best King novel I have read.  For being written in different segments it is very well structured, and the parallelism of characters and themes is extremely effective.	2005-05-23

These fears were quickly put to rest, and I was extremely impressed at Durant's rigorous and logic-based apporach to analyzing past civilations.  He breaks civilations into three sections:  hunting, agricultural, and industrial.  He explains how our needs and hence our morals changed with each.    The greatest part of the book is to see our major problems of today: freedom vs. order, capitalism vs. socialism, religion vs. state repeated throughout history.  It was an extremely humbling and enlightening experience.  I heard the audio version and I highly recommend it since it contains relevant interviews with Wil and Ariel Durant after each chapter.    I would love to see an update of potential consequences as we change from an industrial to information based civilization, and as we develop such ground-altering technologies such as genetic design, artificial intelligence, and inexpensive WMDs.	2005-04-30

Winchester has the talent of taking what seems like secondary details at first glance and weaving them in as essential pieces.  Dutch cartography, underwater telegraph cables, and militant Islam are just a sampling of issues which Winchester thoroughly envelops into the larager story of the volcano.  An added benefit is Winchester's background of geology, so he has intimate knowledge of plate tectonics, continental drift, and subductions zones, and he never patronizes the reader.	2005-04-09

The first is a rambling monologue from a decaying man (or is it woman or animal) named Molloy, in search of his mother.  The second starts out as a detective named Moran in search of Molloy.  In both stories nothing much happens involving any specific time or place, and the identities of all characters are in question.  The only thing that really exists is the language, which turns out to not have much true meaning at all.<br /><br />Read this if you are looking for an unique style of writing to experience.  Perhaps you will learn more about the nature of language and identity, or perhaps you will find it tedious and pointless, but all readers will agree it is experimental and unique.	2005-03-22

He starts by showing us the untidy history of the English language and the first attempts to catalogue its words.  Then the challenge of the OED is underway -- to fully document the words of the language in its entirety. From the master lexicographer, James Murray, to the diverse and msyterious characters scribbling down millions of quotes, Winchester shows how this monumental task came to succeed over a period of decades.  My only complaint was that the book was not longer, and did not go more into the modern reworkings of the OED, although it is touched upon in the epilogue.	2005-03-15

This is really two books in one: A nonfiction monologue and a trademark Crichton thriller.  The nonfiction part is the better of the two, and it's what makes this novel stand out from his other works.    The main character is a lawyer/environmentalist who gets tangled up in an international terrorist adventure.  He has the least amount of personality I can remember from a main character.  The other lead character is an ex-military, walking scientific journal, named  John Kenner, who heads a \\"Risk Assesment\\" task force.  The adventures these two get into, along with their friends, are not much more than contrived plot devices.  The plot is absurd and in general makes little sense.  Thankfully, in the 3rd act some more interesting characters are introduced and the plot takes some unconventional turns which salvages the story.      By far the most unconvential part of the novel though is it's attention to scientific research, including citations of research papers on global warming.  These references are mainly recalled by Dr. Kenner, who is extremely critical of the paranoia over global warming.  Everyone knows about global warming and 99% of us assume that humans are steadily warming the planet, yet how many of us have actually read the research behind it?    This book deserves 5 stars because it will inspire you to research, and think about the sources of scientific claims.  Crichton doesnt expect you to rely on his sources.  His characters challenge you to re-evaluate your beliefs with research of your own.  Since reading this novel I have done my own research on the intenet, and I highly recommend people read the rebuttals to his arguments on realclimate.org.    Crichton also gives many examples of the unintended consequences when politics mixes with science, including the study of eugenics and the banning of DDT.  Why have I never heard before this book how banning DDT lead directly to tens of millions of malaria deaths in Africa?  Shouldn't this be common knowledge?  That this book guided me to research these facts alone is enough for a 5 star rating.    I don't know what to think of the fact that a suspense writer is the lone voice in entertainment publicly promoting scientific research with independent verification, instead of apocalyptic politically correct dogma.	2005-03-09

It contains a Scrabble playing dog, an infanticidal psychopath, and even a deadly mutant baboon.  The book changes repeatedly from cute and playful to violent and gruesome, and at one point there's even a graphic sex scene straight out of a cheesy romance novel. <br /> <br />Unfortunately all of these quirky elements are held together by Koontz's flat, styleless tone.  Although many of the characters are borderline crazy and a few completely insane, they are all utterly predictable.  After the first few chapters, it is very apparent what the obligatory climactic showdown must be, and the novel plods steadily towards it. <br /> <br />If this book had an interesting style or a decent theme to tie everything together, it would have been a great book.  Instead it's just your standard thriller with some of the weirdest random elements you will ever come across.	2005-02-23

I knew nothing about Hoover before reading this book, but Hack does a comprehensive job in this bio.  Hoover is portrayed as a higly intelligent, organized man, who had too much power for his (or the country's) good. <br /> <br />Hoover's need for fame was a double edged sword:  It helped promote the FBI and it's intentions, but it also put public image over real substance.  The most interesting parts of the book were Hoover tracking down old-time mobsters, and his obsession with Martin Luther King Jr. and his ties to the communist party. <br /> <br />The biggest problems with the book were lack of technical details (Hack throughout mentions illegal wire taps and \\"black bag jobs\\", but never goes into details of how they were implemented), and apparent embellishment of the truth.  For example, Hack goes into detail in converstaions between 2 people which there are no sources for.  This is confusing and detracts from the overall authenticity of the book. <br /> <br />Overall, this was a great book to learn about this unusual leader.  I think it paints a farily balanced picture of him, not as an evil man, but of a smart control freak and media hound that was given too much power for too long.	2004-12-23

I listened to the audio version and the narrator was one of the best I have heard.  He takes on the character of Poirot with total enthusiasm and convinving emotion.  This is a classic that is anything but typical.	2004-12-13

Hamiliton lived an incredible life from his illegitimate birth to his infamous death.  This book outlines his brilliance in his federalist writings and treasuray management, but it also details his scandalous affair and other terrible decisions which nearly ruined his politcal carrer.  While at times Chernow may be a bit biased towards Hamilton, this is still a comprehensive and exciting book about his life.	2004-12-13

This is alleviated by the most unlikely character, whom the others are finally able to relate to.  Set in the depression era south, a few of these characters have some radical political beliefs, but I think that is understandable given their economic situation.  I listened to the unabridged audio version and it was extremely well done.	2004-11-18

This is the auto-biography of Gene Simmons, who begins as a poor Israeli immigrant and eventually becomes one of the most famous rock stars in history.  The book covers his younger years including some vivid stories of homelife.  The bulk of the book is about the band and what went on behind the scenes.  He is extremely critical of Ace and Peter's bad work ethic and chemical problems, and pretty much always praises his own behavior.  It's unclear how accurate this perspective actually is, but Simmons comes across as genuine, smart, and egotistical.    I listened to the unabridged audio version of the book, which was great because Simmons reads it himself.  But what keeps this version from getting 5 stars is that there are no audio clips of any KISS music.  That would have been a great feature, but still it is a great book (at least from a non-kiss-fan perspective).  If you liked this book I would also recommend Joe Eszterhas' autio-biogrpahy \\"Hollywood Animal\\".	2004-11-12

This is not the case as Derbyshire has put together an excellent book covering such topics as Hermitian matrices, the logarithmic integral, and the p-adic numbers among others.  It is odd though, since at times Derbyshire will stop to remind the reader of something as simple as \\"-3 times -3 is 9, not -9.\\"  Luckily he will only pause for a sentence and then continue straight on to the more interesting math.      This book builds up to explaining what Riemann showed in his landmark paper where he proposed the hypothesis.  This involves deriving the prime counting function in terms of the zeta function zeros.  At that point the reader will understand the relevance of the zeros, but not necessarily the importance of the hypothesis which states where to find those zeros.  While the hypothesis does put a stronger bound on the prime couting function as Derbyshire explains, the main reason to solve it is because it's there.  This may be disappointing for some, but the jounrey is well worth it.    I recommend this book for readers who want to learn about the zeta function and have a basic knowledge of number theory and calculus.  The combination of math and history was better than I expected, and the book is enlightening in both areas.	2004-11-08

It was abridged to 7 hours, which is simply too brief to contain this brilliant man's life.  The audio version was constantly racing from one series of events to the next, without pausing to gain insight into Franklin's abilities and motives.  After listening to this book I heard how Franklin became a great writer, publisher, politician, and even discovered electricity (!!), yet I have no clearer idea how he was able to accomplish these things nor what his own thoughts and motiviations were. <br /> <br />One of the more interesting parts was to hear how Franklin's unique and brilliant character was interpreted in the following centuries.  I was surprised to hear the intense criticism of his pragmatism by the Romantics.   <br /> <br />The audio book is great for a summary of Franklin and his accomplishments without much emotional insight.  The unabridged version may be better.	2004-10-30

The most interesting parts: the great war, the Culture society, the AI Minds, were all held in the background while the protagonist and his random adventures were put up front.  Which was fine and entertaining for an SF action novel, but nothing original and somewhat frustrating knowing that those interesting elements were ignored.  There are many cool parts though, such as the Oribitals and the giant Culture ships, but focusing on a cult on an island and a laser fight in a temple was too mundane for my tastes.  Perhaps other books in the series will more epic and less random action, but this one was a disappointment.	2004-10-30

Books	5	4	10	N	N	Libertarianism	Stossel isnt a Republican nor a Democrat he's a Libertarian.  I didnt know that much about Libertarianism before listening to this audio book, but never have I heard such logic and common sense applied to political issues.  The basic position is that government is best when kept to minimum and not interfering in private lives.      For example, free markets are more efficient and accountable then govt. institutions.  Govt departments regularly lose billions of dollars every year and no one is fired- instead they ask for more tax payer money and they usually get it.  If that happened to a coproration people would be fired or it would go out of business- that's why it rarely occurs.     Stossel started out as a consumer advocate, but after many years came to realize that the government regulations created as a result of his reporting were causing more harm than good.  The reason for this is simple: the organizations that can influence and conform to regulations must have money and power.  This hinders small businesses, general innovation, and taxpayers.  The people that benefit are large corporations, lawyers, and labor unions- all at the expense of consumers.    Stossel goes over dozens of these and other topics with amazing clarity and plenty of examples.  This book is enlightening, will make you laugh at many of the absurdities in governent, but will also stir you to anger.  I highly recommend the audio version as it includes audio clips from some of Stossel's interviews.	2004-10-23

This book starts with the pre-war lives of the marines in the famous photograph but then converges to the battle on Iwo Jima and to the 1/400th a second represented in the photo.  It then diverges again to show how their lives were affected by the war and the image of the flag raising. <br /> <br />By being a son of one of the marines that refused to talk about the event, the author's passion and dedication to revealing the moment and the men involved is startling.  The book reveals life in American during WWII and the horrible yet heroic battle of Iwo Jima.  It is impossible to forget the images portrayed- both good and bad.	2004-10-23

The audio book focuses most on his early life, military career, the atomic bomb, his race with Dewey, and the Korean war.  Unfortunately much of his private life, Israel, and the birth of the UN/NATO is short changed.    What never ceases to amaze me about American History is how it repeats itself.  The Korean War was the \\"wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time\\".  Truman had to make tough decisions between taking North Korea and extending the Chinese conflict.  Now NK is one of the most dangerous countries in the world, but would it have been worth the cost to finish the job as MacArthur wanted?	2004-10-11

They are interesting but nothing groundbreaking.  In my opinion this book is a SF classic because of its protaganist and its last chapter.      The female protagonist is a Robot psychyatrist.  She not only understands the reasoning behind their intelligence, but she also sees how their intelligence can be greater and more compassionate than that of humans.      The last chapter is simply brilliant.  It gets away from the condition of robotics and the 3 rules and instead focuses on Artificial Intelligence in general.  Asimov proposes what might happen in human society when AI becomes an invaluable tool.  He explores like no other how our complex relationship with machines may evolve and shape our future.	2004-10-11

He is frank about his mistakes and gives plenty of self-critical stories about infidelity and alcohol abuse without offering excuses.  Although the Hollywood mega-deals and his stories of screen writing collaborations are entertaining, the most powerful and emotional parts of the book are about his personal family life and an amazing revelation about his father's past.  Again he does not make excuses for anything, and perhaps he is confessing his sins so that others can learn from his mistakes.   <br /> <br />That being said he accomplished a great deal in his career- a first generation American who became the top man in one of the most competitve fields.  And I'm sure some day the world will eventually forgive him for Showgirls.	2004-10-02

The overwhelming assumption that Saddamn had WMDs  and would use them. 2. Speed and flexibility would be necessary to counter this threat by taking initiative from the enemy. 3. The potential problem of \\"catastrophic success\\" when a power vaccuum was created in one of the worlds most corrupt regions. <br /> <br />Franks' interactions with Bush, Rumsfeld, and other leaders foreign and domestic are memorable, and it was intersting how little the news media was told about the wars, especially when the press started to panic just a few weeks into both Afganistan and Iraq.  Whether or not you agree with these wars, you will learn more about them by reading the accounts of their military commander.	2004-10-01

What I found most amazing was how the political battles of 200 years so closely resemble the battles of today.  His debates with Jefferson and Republicans are timeless American political arguments including slanderous press, and claims of warmongering and being unpatriotic.  But he also showed how these sides can reconcile as he and Jefferson exchanged insightful letters throughout the later parts of their lives.      Not only does this book cover the events in Adam's life, but it also provides insight into his motivations and emotional life.  This is conveyed through many of his personal letters, and the book also focuses on his relationship with his amazing wife Abigail.	2004-10-01

He sees it as a hideous mess of robotic creatures programmed to destroy themselves, specifically through destruction by American capitalism and racism.  At times this does seem a bit cliche, but his style is anything but.  It's funny, original, and at times very personal. <br /> <br />The best parts of the book are when he literally draws himself into the story.  He tries to be a good God to his characters, but seems to fail as our Creator must have.  It's not as good as Slaughter House Five, but his shocking style is in strong form. <br /> <br />For those who want to pick up the audio version for the Vonnegut interview- don't.  In the beginning of the interview Vonnegut and his interviewer both reveal that they havent read the book in a while, then proceed to talk about completely unrelated topics which go nowhere.  Tucci does a fine job of reading though.	2004-09-30

This can make sections hard to follow, but it allows the setting to come into form in a more loose and realistic way.

This book shows how based on Einstein's postulate on the universality of the speed of light, the mathematics forces us in certain directions and builds to create General Relativity.  The key mathematical building block in this book is Tensor analysys. I had no idea of going into the book what that even was, but Schutz will guide your through it assuming you have a solid knowledge of vectors and calculus. Even with that knowledge, this book requires a decent amount of effort so be prepared to read and re-read chapters.  I recommend this to anyone that knows the conceptual basics of relativity, but wants to spend the effort to learn the math.	2004-09-25

(This chapter alone showed me how great the movie could have been.)  Although the vivid details of soldiers and their battles in modern warfare are incredible, I think the highlight of this book are the History and Moral Philosphy lectures. While I dont agree with everyhing in them, it's amazing how using history and logic, Heinlein could not only describe our modern day societal problems, but also point to potential solutions with such directness.  His characters laugh at our problems wondering why we're so dumb not to fix them, and sometimes the reader must wonder the same thing.	2004-09-25

First, is the discussion of Babbage's life and his computing engines.  Second, is the author's modern-day story of attempting to complete Babbage's Difference Engine, a feat which Babbage himself was unable to do.  I picked up this book for the first part.  I wanted to learn about Babbage and how his engines worked.  While the author gives a wonderful account of Babbage's life and methodology, he does not clearly describe HOW these engines function.  I realize that the engines are extremely complex, but a chapter on the functioning of the Difference Engine trial piece and some diagrams on its operations would have been much appreciated. Unfortunately, as were Babbage's contemporaries, we are left mainly in dark as to how simply turning a crank can produce the necessary additions.  The author also never fully explains the \\"method of finite differences\\" upon which the function of the difference engine is based.<br />The most amazing part of the book is the overview of Babbage's design for the Analytical Engine- the first programmable computer.  It is amazingly similar in concept to today's modern computers, but it uses motion through metal gears and cams, instead of electricity through logic gates and wires. I expected to be bored by the modern-day story, but I actually was interested in the process of reconstructing this 19th century machine.  It was enlightening to see how the same problems Babbage faced 150 years before troubled engineers today.<br />Overall, I recommend this book for those curious about Babbage and his engines. However, the writing seems jerky and unorganized in parts, and there is little technical description of the engines' functionality.	2002-09-16
