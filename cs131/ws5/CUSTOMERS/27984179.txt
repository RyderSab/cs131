Is one of you a spender, the other a saver? Would your marriage be stronger if you could somehow work as a team to manage your finances and get out of debt?<br /><br />Notice that I didn't ask if your marriage would be stronger if you had more money. Mary Hunt aptly notes that money problems are about more than a lack of money. Money problems are the result of conflicting attitudes and habits, and indicate just how well you and your spouse communicate and combine the two.<br /><br />Debt-Proof Your Marriage is written in three parts. Part 1 explains the relationship side of the equation, enabling you to prepare the groundwork for financial harmony. Part 2 gets into the numbers, starting off with six debt-proof principles that are powerful and easy to understand. Part 3 provides resources to help you apply parts 1 and 2.<br /><br />All of this is written from a Biblical perspective, from someone who has walked the walk. Both frank and friendly, this is a sound message that will improve both your pocketbook and your marriage.<br /><br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2005-09-10

Would you open the envelope?\\"<br /><br />We are all mortal, but not many of us give our mortality much thought. After all, there are millions of things that we would rather discuss than our inevitable death. Still, Mathieu asks, how powerful would we be if we were to live our lives without the fear of death?<br /><br />Mathieu shares his unique perspective as someone who was given an \\"expiry date\\" as a teenager, told that he was not expected to live past 30. Through this experience he developed a profound appreciation for living in the present. He shares this revelation with boldness, infectious enthusiasm and refreshing humor.<br /><br />How powerful would your life be if you stopped dwelling on the past and worrying about the future, and fully lived in the present? Or, as Mathieu asks, \\"...what's the worst that can happen to you if you've already come to terms with death?\\" Come to terms with your death, and you will truly begin to experience life!<br /><br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2005-08-13

Is my pain simply God inflicting punishment for some unconfessed sin? Is it the result of my lack of faith? Does God expect me to be thankful for my suffering? Is it all part of God's plan? What do we say as Christians when people ask us how a loving, all-powerful God could allow such nasty things to happen to people?<br /><br />I certainly didn't know, and picked up this book with hopes of finding some answers. Dividing the book into three sections, Yancey explores why there is pain, how people respond to pain, and how we can cope with pain.<br /><br />Part 1 aptly points out the necessity of pain - to build our trust in God, to keep us safe and to act as a stepping stone to pleasure. It shows how pain can either drive me away from God or draw me closer to Him.<br /><br />In Part 2 we are introduced to some people who have suffered far beyond what the average person could expect to suffer in their lifetime. We see how they view their suffering, and how it has affected their Christian walk.<br /><br />Part 3 equips us to see the \\"big picture\\" of pain, and to understand, as the title suggests, where God is when we hurt. Understanding the pain and how it relates to our relationship with God may not lessen the pain, but it does help cast a hope and vision that will allow us to endure. And when it hurts, that can make all the difference.<br /><br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2005-08-13

We (thankfully) see that he was not always successful, but rather than dwell on his failures, asked for God's forgiveness and simply went again. He shares his insight and life's journey through four conversations with Abbe Joseph de Beaufort, fifteen letters and six maxims.<br /><br />Through his writings, Brother Lawrence shares a humility and a desire for communion with God that is not only infectious, but also simple enough for anyone to apply.

Our own self-image determines just how far we allow our built-in 'success mechanism' to take us. In other words, the results we achieve in life are consistent with our self-image.<br /><br />Here Maltz teaches us how to improve our self-image to that of our 'real self' (not a fictitious 'super-self' that is unattainable) so we can achieve the results we desire with relative ease. I was slightly surprised - and pleased - to see Maltz say that we are created in the image of God with the purpose of glorifying Him, and that He would not create something unable to meet that purpose.<br /><br />Maltz teaches how to overcome our beliefs of inferiority and to get in touch with our own unique self. He shows us how to form a clear mental image of our desired results and let our 'success mechanism' take over, living only in the present moment.<br /><br />How liberating! By changing our beliefs and our focus, we are able to discover our true selves, and put ourselves in motion toward a worthwhile goal. You will learn to be more relaxed, focus your attention on things that are truly important, take responsibility and - as the author says - experience more life.<br /><br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2005-08-07

This is a devotional for those who want to stretch and grow spiritually, who would rather go through the pain of a 'spiritual workout' than stay spiritually soft. Be prepared to roll up your sleeves.<br /><br />Each day begins with a passage from scripture, then leaps into a lesson that I find to be just the right size - a very compact punch of wisdom that takes very little time to read, yet resonates for the full day and beyond.<br /><br />Wherever you are in your spiritual journey, this will provoke and equip you to take the next step forward.<br /><br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2005-08-07

We need to be reminded that lasting, true success and significance come from bettering the lives of others rather than searching for the quick buck. The Baron Son is an allegory, written in both the first and third person, that does just that.<br /><br />The Baron Son easily compares in style to Paolo Coelho's The Alchemist, George Clason's The Richest Man in Babylon, or Og Mandino's The Greatest Salesman in the World. Like The Richest Man in Babylon, the language is dated, I assume to give the story a regal and timeless feel. While it does give the material a more significant air, it also makes it harder to digest. For example, \\"Do note, an alteration in one's spoon victuals helpeth not a man who doth not redirect his thoughts.\\" Huh?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there is definitely some good content here. You just may have to work a little harder than usual to uncover it. This isn't the vade mecum, or guidebook for constant reference, that the title implies. To earn the title of vade mecum, it would need some clear and concise summaries at the end of all eleven \\"supreme principles\\". After each chapter, I knew that a valuable lesson had been given, but it was very difficult to express it clearly in my own words.<br /><br />I applaud what the authors are trying to communicate here. The principles are valid and necessary. Still, in their efforts to \\"supply an innovative approach\\", I feel they have taken the edge off their message. To get the most from this book, dig deep into each chapter, rewrite the principles in your own words, and make those notes your vade mecum.<br /><br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2005-07-31

Think back to 1988, a time when AIDS was even more misunderstood.  Imagine finding out that your mother was infected with the HIV virus through a blood transfusion, and was slowly dying of AIDS.  Imagine choosing to keep her battle a secret in order to avoid her being ostracized.  Imagine watching your mother suffer for years in silence.<br /><br />This is Nancy Draper's story, a story that needs to be heard.  A Burden of Silence not only brings us face to face with the realities of a family member battling AIDS, but also with the misperceptions and social stigma that have followed this disease.  Ultimately, though, it is the story of a daughter's love for her mother, and how finally breaking the silence can transform one woman's battle into a blessing for countless others and their families.<br /><br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2005-06-04

With countless references to The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, Gladiator, The Wizard of Oz, Braveheart, even Amadeus and The Lion King, it is fair to say that Eldredge likes to use contemporary analogies to back up scripture.<br /><br />If you aren't completely familiar with all those books and movies, or if you are the kind of person who takes offense when Dorothy and Toto are used to illustrate scripture, you may have a hard time warming up to Waking the Dead. Even if you are open to these areas, this isn't exactly an easy message for all to grasp.<br /><br />One of the main points that Eldredge covers is that our hearts are good by nature, and that we have bought into the lies of the Enemy if we believe otherwise. He argues that the flesh is the culprit rather than the heart, and that we need to distinguish between the two. By acknowledging that our hearts are good, we are liberated from the discouragement of the enemy that tries to convince us that we are weak and unworthy.<br /><br />By acknowledging the goodness of our heart and opening ourselves up to Jesus' offering of life through Discipleship, Counseling, Healing and Warfare, we are able to wake up from our slumber and shine with the light of Christ.

We learn about selflessness, humility, integrity, faith, courage, gratitude, generosity, love, perseverance, wisdom and servanthood.<br /><br />Do not read this book without a highlighter.

How much of what you do is governed by habit? Habits are acquired behavior patterns that have been followed to the point where they become almost involuntary. Often it only takes 21 days of repetition to acquire a new habit, or lose an old one.<br /><br />What if you were able to identify a series of habits that would be beneficial to your physical health, mental health and your relationships?  What if you were able to track these habits and their benefits, and set triggers to remind you to implement them? What if, after 21 days, you had acquired these habits and did them \\"automatically\\"?<br /><br />Dan Robey has assembled 81 habits and their benefits, and indexed them so you can easily look up and cross-reference the habits that will benefit you the most. He has also given you a \\"flight plan form\\" to chart and monitor your progress. He does a good job of setting up a framework for you to develop positive habits in your life.<br /><br />The layout of this book is excellent, well indexed and easy to read. However, the editors and proofreaders were asleep at the switch. If, like me, you cringe when someone uses the word \\"then\\" when they should use the word \\"than\\", prepare to cringe about 50 times.

This is a very simple read, and you may be tempted to race through it and miss some key points. Maxwell rightly suggests that you walk through each quality methodically, giving it the attention that it warrants based on your current level of competence.<br /><br />While the material warrants five stars, some spelling mistakes and the author's use of his own quotes dropped it down a notch for me.

Would you look for expensive clothes, jewelry, late model foreign luxury cars, a big house in a posh neighborhood, all the \\"toys\\"?  Guess again.<br /><br />In this high-consumption society, many have bought into the lie that we must look the part before we can afford it.  Just because someone looks the part, doesn't mean that they have accumulated any significant wealth.  Rather, it could very likely mean that they are spending far beyond their means.<br /><br />One of the key messages in this book is that wealth and income are not the same.  It's not how much you make - or spend - that is important, but rather how much you keep.  Authors Stanley and Danko's research reveal how a large portion of society is setting itself up for financial ruin, all in the name of social status.  They paint a profile of what a real millionaire looks like -- and it will probably surprise you.<br /><br />Successful wealth builders value financial independence over social status.  They live well below their means.  The life of a millionaire is not the life today's media would have you believe.  It is a life of sacrifice and discipline.  It is a life of hard work.  Many millionaires own their own businesses, drive modest vehicles and live in modest homes.<br /><br />This book is a much-needed wake up call for all of us who have been seduced by the media's idea of the \\"millionaire lifestyle\\".  It's time to break the conditioning and realize that financial independence is available to all -- it just comes in an unexpected package.  Would you rather look like a millionaire, or be one?  The Millionaire Next Door reveals what it takes to be one.  The choice is up to you.<br /><br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2004-09-22

It's not that there is a lack of content here...looking back through the book, there is a lot of good advice that would be valuable in developing your sphere of influence.  It just seems to be an awkward assembly of borrowed wisdom that didn't stick once I closed the cover.<br /><br />Maybe it's because the majority of the content is repeated from Maxwell's other books.  It's not unusual to find two or three quotes or excerpts from other books on each page, which limits the amount of \\"original\\" material and seriously hampers the flow.  It almost appears that Maxwell and Dornan wrote separately, then did their best to cut-and-paste the two scripts later.<br /><br />The book considers four levels of influence: model, motivate, mentor and multiply.  It does its best to weave those levels into ten chapters whose titles combine to spell \\"influencer\\" -- Integrity with people, Nurtures other people, Faith in people, Listens to people, Understands people, Enlarges people, Navigates for other people, Connects with people, Empowers people and Reproduces other influencers.<br /><br />Perhaps this book would be more effective if you hadn't read any Maxwell books before.  It would definitely be best to search through the book for individual nuggets of wisdom rather than try to pull one clear, solid message from these pages.  Sadly, the nuggets that you pull are more likely to come from the quotes and excerpts than the original content.

Here he takes us on a tour of Jesus' ministry where He meets and tends to a number of hurting people.<br /><br /> He ties these moments in to our modern day struggles and shows us that those examples aren't in the Bible just to show us what Jesus did. They are there to show what Jesus does in the lives of those who look to Him. With his usual excellent stories and often unexpected humor, Lucado reminds us that the tender, loving Christ of the Bible is alive and well, and working in our lives still today.<br /><br /> Each chapter has its own study guide at the back of the book, with personal questions under the heading &quot;Looking Under the Stones&quot;, and a scripture study called &quot;Building on the Rock&quot;.

Fortunately, author Zev Saftlas also knows that motivation on its own does not last, so he created the Motivational Blueprint. It is a seven step process to identify your goal and maintain the motivation you need to achieve it.<br /><br /> In Step 1, you identify your goal. Step 2 allows you to flesh out why you want to achieve it. You then commit to your goal and take responsibility in Step 3, become a student of success in Step 4 and visualize your success in Step 5. You start improving your self-image and beliefs in Step 6, and renew your commitment daily through Step 7.<br /><br /> Each step contains a great collection of stories and quotes that bring the concepts to life. The concepts themselves are not necessarily new or earth-shattering. What makes this book unique, effective and worthwhile is the Motivational Blueprint. If you are tired of having your motivation fizzle with time, plug yourself in to the Motivational Blueprint to &quot;get motivated and stay motivated&quot;.<br /><br /> Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2004-07-21

Each week is broken down into five days, making it an excellent workplace study.<br />Lessons from Days 1 through 4 start with a thought for the day and a biblical passage, then close with a question for you to reflect on.  Day 5 summarizes the week in brief sections that help you to absorb the week's material, sort it out, pray through it, apply it to your own life, and pass it on to another leader.<br />Obviously, this book is not aimed at the secular crowd, and is much more beneficial to those who have read the 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership.  If you enjoyed the 21 laws and are comfortable with scripture, this study will dramatically enhance your ability to prayerfully apply the laws to your life and the lives of those around you.  A great resource for Christian leaders.<br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2004-07-12

Y'know, Southern Fried Rock, Hits of the 80s, 24 Great Truckin' Songs...all those classics? (Just kidding.)<br />Imagine a collection of thirty leading Christian authors, sharing their insights on holiness, temptation and sexual purity.  With 30 daily studies from the likes of J.I. Packer, Neil Anderson, Chuck Colson, Max Lucado, Bill Hybels, Charles Spurgeon, Bruce Wilkinson, Charles Swindoll and Randy Alcorn, there is no fluff here.  Each day is an insightful, no-punches-pulled look into areas of a man's life that are very real, yet often difficult to address.<br />It doesn't say so on the cover, but this book is aimed at men.  Female readers may want to have a peek in order to understand the temptations that the men in their lives face, but this is primarily a book for guys.<br />Men, are you ready to set yourself apart for God's special purposes?  Are you ready to submit to His will, discipline yourself, break negative patterns, make better use of your time, become a better steward of His resources, resist temptation, gain self-control?  Start with this 30-day journey and you will be well on your way to personal victory.<br />This book could also serve as an excellent launching pad.  It is an opportunity to expose yourself to a number of Christian authors in a short amount of time, discover some of your favorite communicators, and start assembling your own personal library.<br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2004-07-11

He helps you to set your priorities, check your integrity, learn how to initiate positive change, and become a problem solver.  He stresses the importance of attitude, people, vision and self-discipline.  In the end, he shows you not only how to develop your own leadership ability, but how to start developing others as well.<br />Though sometimes choppy in its presentation, with maybe a few too many quotes and cliches, the content here is top notch.  If you are a Maxwell reader, you will see repeats of this material in his other books.

Our television shows have laugh tracks to tell us when something is supposed to be funny. Our coffee cups now warn us that the contents may be hot. Labels on our hair dryers remind us not to use them underwater. We are so used to having someone else do our thinking. What would happen if we woke up and started...thinking for a change?<br />Right away Maxwell establishes that successful people think differently than unsuccessful people. In Part I, he develops a foundation by explaining the merits of good, changed and intentional thinking. Part II reveals the 11 ways that successful people think -- big-picture instead of small, focused instead of scattered, creative instead of restrictive, realistic instead of fantasy, strategic instead of random, possibility instead of limited, reflective instead of impulsive, innovative instead of popular, shared instead of solo, unselfish instead of selfish, and bottom-line instead of wishful.<br />Each chapter explains one of these facets of thinking and allows you to evaluate yourself in each area. Maxwell then gives you action steps to develop that type of thinking in your life. This is an excellent resource to help you jump-start and expand your thinking beyond where it is today.

Is one of you a spender, the other a saver?  Would your marriage be stronger if you could somehow work as a team to manage your finances and get out of debt?<br />Notice that I didn't ask if your marriage would be stronger if you had more money.  Mary Hunt aptly notes that money problems are about more than a lack of money.  Money problems are the result of conflicting attitudes and habits, and indicate just how well you and your spouse communicate and combine the two.<br />Debt-Proof Your Marriage is written in three parts.  Part 1 explains the relationship side of the equation, enabling you to prepare the groundwork for financial harmony.  Part 2 gets into the numbers, starting off with six debt-proof principles that are powerful and easy to understand.  Part 3 provides resources to help you apply parts 1 and 2.<br />All of this is written from a Biblical perspective, from someone who has walked the walk.

Right from the start, Kiyosaki acknowledges that the network marketing business is not for everyone.  He also admits that the industry has had (and will continue to have) a fringe population of greedy and/or crooked hucksters that drive the rest of us crazy and close many minds to its true benefits.<br />For someone exploring a network marketing opportunity for the first time, this book gives a solid, realistic foundation from which you can chart your course.  For all those who have dived into multiple network marketing opportunities looking to make millions in a matter of weeks, and those who have dabbled for a couple of months, grown discouraged and quit, this book is a much-needed wake up call.<br />The title tells it all -- network marketing is not a &quot;get rich quick&quot; vehicle.  Rather, it is a business school where the ultimate goal is personal growth.  In this second edition, Kiyosaki presents eleven &quot;hidden values&quot; of a network marketing business.  This is the ideal tool to help you look beyond the hype, see the network marketing opportunity for what it really is, and set realistic expectations for your personal success.<br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2004-04-07

Several years ago I visited a trendy restaurant and ordered their chicken mango salad.  Some delicious bits of chicken and mango arrived, nestled in a bizarre mishmash of strange colored and shaped lettuce.  I politely picked through the lettuce and ate what I could endure, but the overall experience was one of confusion and disappointment.  All those feelings came back when I read this book.<br />Robin Sharma provides life lessons via the fictional story of Jack Valentine, an advertising executive who is reunited with his long-lost father as they share a hospital room.  On his deathbed, Cal Valentine sends Jack on a mystical journey to meet three mentors -- you guessed it -- a priest, a surfer and a CEO.<br />Writers such as Og Mandino and Paolo Coelho have mastered this style, delivering clear, profound messages through believable dialogue.  Sharma doesn't come close here...the dialogue is stiff, unrealistic and unnatural.  It is littered with dozens of profound quotes that deliver a great message, but send the hokey factor sky high.  Success principles appear to have been cut from other sources and pasted in these pages with not much thought given to organization or flow.<br />The gist of Sharma's message is to submit to the will of &quot;the universe&quot; for your life and follow your true vocation.  Some won't mind this message, but I was surprised to see that &quot;God&quot; is almost avoided like a four letter word in these pages, even by the priest.<br />Just like that chicken mango salad, there are some good nuggets to be found here, but you can save yourself the agony of picking through the jungle of lettuce by reading the summary on the last three pages.<br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2004-03-27

Have we become so accustomed to hearing it that we have forgotten the wonderful promise it contains?<br />Traveling Light is a verse-by-verse exploration of Psalm 23, brought to life by comparing us to travelers weighed down with excess spiritual baggage.  Each chapter identifies a different burden that we may be carrying in our life: flawed views of God, self-reliance, discontent, weariness, worry, hopelessness, guilt, arrogance, facing death, grief, fear, loneliness, shame, disappointment, envy, doubt and the longing for heaven.<br />This walk through the 23rd Psalm reminds and encourages us to take God at His word and release those burdens to Him.  As usual, Lucado supports his material with plenty of scripture, sharp analogies and just the right amount of humor.  For added impact, be sure to work through the study guide at the end of the book.

He's a very charming young man who makes friends easily.  Unfortunately, he also has trouble keeping them.  His thoughts and actions tend to center around his own needs and desires, and friends don't put up with such a one-sided relationship for very long.<br />My wife and I explain to him that his life will be much richer and rewarding when he shifts the focus away from himself and onto others.  Max Lucado takes this idea one step further and asks, how much richer and rewarding will our lives be when we shift the focus from our personal agenda to God's agenda?<br />As usual, Lucado has assembled an excellent balance of meaty scriptural passages, stories both Biblical and contemporary, and some of the best analogies imaginable to illustrate this point.  His style is so friendly and conversational, with bits of brilliant humor thrown in, that the message is easy to learn and a pleasure to apply.<br />By shifting the focus away from personal desires, our son stands to earn and keep many more rewarding relationships.  Through shifting our focus from a self-centered life to living a God-centered life, we give honor to Him and open ourselves up to the ultimate reward, hearing Him say, \\"Well done, good and faithful servant.\\"<br />Read this book, reflect on its message and the many scriptural passages within it, work through the study guide at the end of the book, and you will be well equipped to start living a more God-centered life...	2004-03-21

Are you carrying the weight of past or present hurts, anxiety, anger, lust, guilt, greed?  We allow small fragments of mental trash to clutter our lives until we are carrying around sacks of it.  We can't quite explain how it all got there, and aren't quite sure how to get rid of it.<br />Based on one of the stories from Next Door Savior, here Lucado expands the story by dividing it into several scenes and weaving powerful lessons into each section.  It is a beautiful story of how God's grace allows us to \\"take out the trash\\" by giving the burden to Jesus.<br />What makes this story truly effective is that it does much more than advise the reader to \\"give it to God\\" and leave it at that.  It clearly illustrates the extent of Jesus' sacrifice for us.  We aren't called to simply acknowledge our trash, then continue to drag it along with us.  We are called to give our burden to Jesus, and to accept God's offer of a new beginning.  If you are ready to take out the trash in your life, start by reading this little treasure.<br />Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2004-03-19

When you tried to implement those changes, did you notice that they were temporary at best, and that you eventually fell back into the same self-defeating patterns that held you prisoner in the first place?<br />Helmstetter rightly points out that the majority of information that our subconscious mind receives, from both external and internal sources, is negative.  At any given time within our subconscious, as many as three negative thoughts are duking it out with one positive.  Not knowing right from wrong, our subconscious chooses to believe the most dominant thought pattern.  Unless we feed more positive messages to our subconscious, we become a prisoner to negative thought patterns.<br />What to Say reveals a simple way to overcome the onslaught of negative thought by literally feeding positive thoughts into our subconscious through Self-Talk.  More than just affirmation statements, Helmstetter shows how to get specific and attack problems at their source.<br />This book will serve you well on its own, and will be even more effective as a catalyst to help you apply success principles from other books and speakers.

Sometimes my wife and I take our kids out for a Sunday drive -- no particular destination in mind, just going where the mood takes us.  Some drives have been quite memorable, while others are easily forgotten.  Looking back on all of our Sunday drives, we have a generally positive feeling, but an overall lack of substance.  We could likely generate more life-altering memories in one well-planned two week vacation than a lifetime of Sunday drives.<br />The Dream Releasers is a Sunday drive.  There are strong points tucked in behind some flowery metaphors, but more often than not I found myself wondering where I was, and where the author was trying to take me.  There is substance, but it's not clearly presented.<br />The idea behind this book is great -- by helping others realize their true potential, you unleash your own potential.  It is aimed primarily at pastors and lay ministers who wish to expand their sphere of influence by developing others.  But rather than a passionate plea from a concerned friend, Dream Releasers came across to me as a distant, tired sermon.  It stumbles out of the gate and never quite gains its full stride.

This book boils down more than 30 years of Maxwell's life of learned and applied leadership to 21 laws.  If you could condense 30 years of a man's life into one book of basic principles that you could learn and apply to your own life, what would it be worth to you?<br />Although they all combine to form the foundation for leadership, each of the 21 laws stands alone.  As you read through each law, take a personal inventory to determine which areas are working for you and which need to be improved.<br />This book is not particularly good at showing how to apply each law to your own situation, but it does give excellent real-life examples of what happens when these laws are (and aren't) applied.  Maxwell likes blowing his own horn to illustrate the laws in some cases, but he also uses many other &quot;big name&quot; examples from the world of business, politics, the military, sports and the church.<br />Each chapter will enable you to understand a key facet of your leadership ability, assess it for yourself, and begin the next step of filling in the gaps that have held you back from being the leader you could be.<br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-12-29

We all have been born with a Big Dream, a gift from the Dream Giver.  Often we lose sight of that Big Dream, or crumble under obstacles that seem insurmountable.<br />Through this parable, Wilkinson walks us through the stages of living that Big Dream: embracing the Dream, leaving our Comfort Zone to pursue it, meeting discouraging Bullies along the way, entering a Wasteland of delays and disappointment that test our faith, finding Sanctuary where we solidify the purpose of our Big Dream, warring with Giants for the Dream Giver's honor, and finally thriving in the Land of Promise.<br />Part two is the Journey to Your Big Dream, and is much more than an explanation of part one.  Wilkinson acts as our &quot;Dream Coach&quot;, supplying a solid foundation for applying the lessons learned through the parable.  He relates personal experiences and answers questions from real readers.  With the turn of every page I was able to identify and address my own personal obstacles that have held me back from my Big Dream.<br />The Dream Giver will help you identify where you have been, where you are today, and where you are headed.  It will equip you for part three, which is beyond the covers of this book.

Keller rightly says, &quot;...there's more to success than just having a great attitude.&quot;  He also shows you how to apply that great attitude as a catalyst to your success.<br />You will learn how to change your thinking, make a commitment, overcome adversity, form new habits, face your fears, risk failure and turn it into success.  The final chapter alone, about the power of networking, is worth the price of the book.  Five big stars!<br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-12-05

When I picked up this book, I was prepared for some generic time management principles surrounded by some motivational hype that would pump me up and then leave me flat a short while later. I'm not quite sure why...I suppose I just thought that procrastination was more of a built-in character flaw than a lifestyle choice.<br />Am I glad that I was wrong! In the introduction, Rita Emmett explains that procrastination is not part of your character. Rather, it is a habit that can be changed. Using plenty of real-life examples, Emmett helps us identify areas of procrastination in our lives, discover their source, and apply proven strategies to overcome them.<br />This book helps you get right down to business. The format is very friendly, with quick tips, top ten lists, quotes and illustrations scattered throughout. It even has a few &quot;extra credit&quot; questions and activities to help you start applying what you have learned right away.<br />I opened this book as a skeptic. After reading it cover to cover, I'm a believer! My basement is the cleanest it has been in over ten years, my kitchen sink has a new fixture, and today I'm going to fix that annoying drip in the upstairs bathroom. What have you been putting off?

Life is difficult. Peck shows us that our avoidance of problems and their accompanying suffering are the root of mental illness. Difficulties are a fact of life, and they never go away. By refusing to acknowledge and overcome them, we create a barrier to our spiritual growth.<br />When I first read this book several years ago, I was not ready to hear its message. I had created my own reality, believing that I was working at my full capacity and was on the road to achieving my full potential.<br />While this book was not the source of revelation, it has been a catalyst to help me realize the self-deception that kept me from being a truly loving person. There is a long road ahead, but I am now on the path of lifelong learning and growth. The Road Less Traveled has helped me identify and remove many of the barriers that up until now had held me back from being the person God created me to be.<br />...And that has made all the difference.<br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-11-24

Would you like to become a better communicator of love to your spouse? Would you like to reap the rewards of having a spouse whose &quot;love tank&quot; is full, and keeps yours full as well?<br />Love is a choice, not an emotion. Gary Chapman explains that after the &quot;falling in love&quot; stage of a relationship, which can last up to two years, we settle back in to reality. The rose colored glasses are removed and we begin to see our spouse for the person they really are, warts and all.<br />When the sparks begin to fizzle, Hollywood tells us that it is time to move on to another relationship. Chapman, on the other hand, reveals that we now have the opportunity to solidify and deepen the relationship through learning how to effectively communicate our love for our spouse.<br />He introduces us to the five love languages: quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service and physical touch. Each of us express our love using these different languages and their dialects. If our language is different from that of our spouse, our expressions of love may not be understood and appreciated.<br />This book helps us identify and use the love languages that are meaningful to ourselves and our spouse. Chapman uses real-life examples to illustrate each language, with a dash of biblical passages to support his material.<br />The love languages are simple, and they work -- not only between husband and wife, but with children as well. My wife and I are polar opposites in love languages. By learning to express our love in ways that are more meaningful to each other, our honeymoon is thirteen years strong.<br />Get this book, read it, share it, apply it, and your &quot;love tanks&quot; will never be empty again.<br />Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-10-31

He expands on each, introducing us to our current stage and offering helpful guidance to propel us toward the &quot;much fruit&quot; category.<br />The first &quot;secret&quot; talks of God's fatherly discipline that pushes us toward a life that bears fruit. Secret number two is that God the vinedresser will prune us of our selfish desires so we can bear even more fruit. Secret number three involves God's invitation to abide more deeply with Him.<br />In the words of the author, &quot;...the secrets of the vine reveal how God changes you so that you will become even more useful (fruitful) for His glory.&quot;<br />This little book will help you come to terms with the current struggles you have in your life, and focus your attention on becoming the person God meant you to be.

Have you ever known someone who expects the best of every situation and always seems to get it?  That, according to author Claude Bristol, is the Magic of Believing.<br />The Magic of Believing works because Bristol was himself a skeptic at first.  He presents this controversial topic with complete objectivity, addressing and overcoming objections throughout, and creates an excellent case for the power of belief.<br />Bristol reminds us that &quot;...whatever we fix our thoughts upon or steadily focus our imaginations upon, that is what we attract.&quot;  He doesn't assume that thought alone will bring success, but also encourages the reader to develop a plan of action, and gives simple steps to help make it a reality.<br />I can personally vouch for the validity of this material.  The unconscious application of these principles has taken me to international acclaim as an author, when three years ago my only resources were a written affirmation statement and a strong belief.<br />Here's the funny part...it only works if you believe that it will work!  If you don't, it won't.  Do yourself a favor -- hang on to that naive belief long enough to see it work for you.

He starts with two relevant quotations to start you thinking. He then gives you a short real-life example of that particular quality in action.<br />He breaks each principle down into specific applications, gives you a brief period where you can assess your own effectiveness, offers you concrete ways to improve yourself, and wraps each chapter up with a profound thought that will stay with you long after you have closed the cover.<br />What you get out of this book depends on how you read it. This is a very simple read, and you may be tempted to race through it and miss some key points. Maxwell rightly suggests that you walk through each quality methodically, giving it the attention that it warrants based on your current level of competence.<br />While the material warrants five stars, some spelling mistakes and the author's use of his own quotes dropped it down a notch for me. Otherwise, an excellent handbook for improving your personal leadership qualities.<br />Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-10-22

Many of them are so routine and seemingly insignificant that we don't think twice about them. Ultimately, where we are and where we end up in our life is the result of each and every one of those choices. If you aren't happy with where you are right now, start looking at the choices you make. Want to start making better choices for your life? Start asking better questions.<br />For years in my life, without realizing it, I had been asking questions that wrongly deflected responsibility from me to my family, friends and associates. Not only was that punishing them, it kept me from growing and becoming the husband, father and friend I wanted to be. QBQ helped me to \\"reframe\\" different situations and start asking questions that would yield positive solutions rather than dwell on problems.<br />With a healthy dose of humor, Miller shows us in thirty nine bite-size chapters how to accept responsibility for our own choices, actions and attitude. QBQ will show you how to approach your daily life situations with better questions. Better questions will yield better answers. Better answers will yield better long-term results.<br />Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-10-22

The Purpose Driven Life takes us on a 40 day spiritual journey -- a basic exploration of God's purpose for our lives. Each day offers a lesson loaded with scripture and wrapped up with a brief summary point, a verse to remember and a question to consider. Great premise, but before picking up this book, ask yourself one question -- what am I looking for?<br />If you consider C.S. Lewis and Oswald Chambers to be a &quot;light read&quot;, this book was not written for you. The Purpose Driven Life was written for the rest of us who are looking to glean Biblical wisdom and apply it to our lives for God's glory, without spending hours dissecting it. The author hasn't served up pablum here, but he has cut the meat into bite size chunks. Are you looking for a simple presentation or an intellectual challenge?<br />The author has used fifteen different biblical translations to &quot;help you see God's truth in new, fresh ways.&quot; This will be refreshing to some, and a source of major frustration to others. Are you looking for eclectic, contemporary translations or do you value uniformity?<br />The Purpose Driven Life is a hamburger with all the toppings. Some will like it just the way it is, some will choose to pick off the toppings they don't like and eat what's left, and others will snub the burger because it isn't a steak.<br />No, it's not a steak, but I'd rather have a burger than go hungry.<br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-10-20

In an age where gender roles are increasingly smudged and distorted, would you rather be a spineless, toothless Nice Guy or a Manly Man with a solid identity and knowledge of God's purpose in your life?<br />John Eldredge challenges us as Christian men to rediscover the passions of our youth.  Christianity is not a prison of rules, regulations and restrictions; it is a battle to be won, an adventure to be experienced.<br />Eldredge puts us in front of a mirror that reflects the person we were meant to be.  He enhances a sound scriptural base with an eclectic collection of movie clips, song lyrics, poetry and literature.  Where else would C.S. Lewis and Oswald Chambers meet George Thorogood and the Dixie Chicks?<br />Those who scream heresy when Eldredge supports his arguments with contemporary, non-scriptural analogies just don't get it.  He is not steering the reader away from scripture; he is making it more accessible and applicable to the reader.<br />While this book will be most beneficial to men, I think women will get a lot out of this book as well, getting a better idea of how their man is really wired.<br />No more Mister Nice Guy.

Are you tired of spinning your spiritual wheels?  Are you ready to submit to God's will for your life?  Then here is the place to start.<br />The Prayer of Jabez is not about asking God for more material wealth.  It is not about placing specific personal demands.  It is about asking for God's maximum blessing in your life--whatever, wherever, whenever, and however He wants it to be.  It is about using those blessings to become a person of influence for His glory.<br />In a compact, friendly package, Bruce Wilkinson shows us how a simple prayer can - and will - help us become the person God wanted us to become.  Here's the catch -- what God wants for our life and what we expect don't always match.  Approach this book with a willing, submissive heart and you will experience miracles.<br />This little prayer has transformed my life.  In three years God took me from a no-name manufacturing manager to an internationally acclaimed author and speaker.  Has it been uncomfortable?  Yep.  Has it been a roller coaster ride?  You bet.

If you aren't open to evangelical Christianity, this book is not for you.  If you are open, this book will help set you free.<br />Based primarily on Biblical affirmation statements, prayer and a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, it will help you to choose the right attitude, energize yourself, increase your expectations (and reach them), avoid worry and defeat, and focus on the truly important things in life.<br />Humble and not at all preachy, Norman Vincent Peale openly shares his own struggles with negative thinking, and tells how others have helped him overcome it.  He rightly lets us know that positive thinking does not guarantee our success, but it does bring it much closer to the realm of possibility.<br />The language is somewhat dated, but the principles are timeless.  As Peale says, \\"The way of life to which this book is a witness is very wonderful.  It is not easy.  Indeed, it often is hard, but it is full of joy and hope and victory.\\"  If you are ready to experience joy, hope and victory, this is the place to start.<br />Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-10-11

Second, you must keep an eye open for opportunity, and be prepared to apply this material to transform thought into rewards.<br />20 years of research are crammed into these pages.  You will learn six steps to stimulate your subconscious mind to turn desire into gold, a five step self-confidence formula, the 31 major causes of failure, how to train yourself to be persistent, how to multiply your brain power through a Master Mind group, the power of sex transmutation, the secret of effective prayer, and how to identify and conquer fear.<br />Do not aim to understand and apply all of these concepts in one trip through the book.  Some of the ideas presented here take a while to absorb.  Treat it like a buffet, sampling some of the familiar and comfortable in the first wave, while trying some of the new ideas as well.  Look to understand and apply more with each read.

Through this lecture, Conwell debunks the idea that it is noble to be poor, an idea that far too many Christians share.  He illustrates that it is our duty as Christians to use our gifts to honestly earn riches, because you can do more good with riches than without.<br />Conwell successfully illustrates the difference between the popular expression &quot;money is the root of all evil&quot; and the complete Biblical passage which states &quot;the love of money is the root of all evil&quot;.  The love of money is idolatry, but money itself is neither good nor evil.  It is simply a tool which may be used for either good or evil.<br />In these pages we learn the virtues of earning money through honest, hard work.  We learn to look for opportunities to serve others in our own back yard by simply finding a need and filling it.  If you wish to be great, begin with who you are right now, where you are right now.

Through a dream and the timely appearance of a mysterious stranger, the greatest salesman in the world sets out once again to better the world around him.  More than just an illustration of ten success principles, this book is a fascinating story with nuggets of wisdom hidden throughout.  Each of the ten Vows of Success contain powerful observations that will hit you right between the eyes.<br />This book stands well on its own, but will be even more meaningful to those who have read and enjoyed the original.<br />Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-09-20

How appropriate, since what you get from this book completely depends on the attitude you choose when reading it.<br />The four principles of Choose Your Attitude, Play, Make Their Day, and Be Present are solid and have been proven at the real life Pike Place Fish in Seattle (the video is magnificent).  No one can poke holes in the validity of these ideas.  If you are looking to simply glean some excellent ways to help you love the work you do, then this book is for you.<br />However, it may be difficult to swallow the story that is used to illustrate these principles.  If you approach this book with a skeptical eye, you may be disappointed.  The fictional team in this story seems to come together and open their hearts to each other much too quickly and easily.  For me, the corny factor dropped Fish! from five stars down to four.<br />My advice?  Get this book anyway.  Choose your attitude.  Look beyond the corny facets to find and apply the valuable nuggets.  They are there.<br />Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-09-20

Dave Dravecky has done a wonderful job of marrying baseball lore with biblical wisdom.  He leads us through nine-plus innings of stories from the ballpark, expanding on each as an analogy for the Christian walk.<br />With quotes from the Bible and assorted baseball legends, bite-sized stories and lessons, colorful photos and the odd dash of humor, this book should be on the coffee table of every Christian baseball fan.<br />Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-09-20

Truly an original, he brings the wisdom of Proverbs to life through personal experiences, sometimes quite moving and often hilarious.  He is the friendly uncle or older brother whose stories you love to hear, and whose advice you respect.  Insightful, never preachy, and a whole lot of fun.<br />Anyone who shies away from this book due to Dale Henry's openly Christian beliefs is doing themselves a huge disservice.  These principles are good, right and true whether you are Christian or not, and are well worth the read.<br />Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize:  Nine Keys for a Life of Victory	2003-09-10
