US	50020099	RAAMKCSP0R7NZ	1413735398	784537621	Men of Extreme Action	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Story OK, but needs professional editing.	The story seemed to be decent, but was difficult to read due to all the typos and other errors that don't get caught by a spell check. It was frequently difficult to determine which character was speaking dialogue and there was at least one instance where the author called one of his heroes by the wrong name. If he can't keep the characters straight how can a reader? There were several minor characters whose names changed spelling from one page to the next.  <br /> <br />Jim, if you ever write another book, hire a pro to edit it!	2005-09-11

The humor in this story stands up after 30 years. Although the story is somewhat dated now, this book deserves a read.	2005-08-05

Remo was on his own. Remo's assessments of the staff at the forum are terrific and only get better when he learns the secret behind their plan to conquer the world.  <br /> <br />This is a down and dirty, physical Destroyer who uses his extraordinary skill at fighting and a unique chess move to save the day.	2005-07-18

I paraphrase omitting some five hundred words.&quot; and &quot;The vision of Van Helsing as a vampire is one before which my imagination balks; this is doubtless only a shortcoming on my part; he may have been well fitted for the role, since as we have seen he had already the power, by means of speech, to cast his victims into a stupor.&quot;) are sometimes dead-on funny and othertimes tiresome.<br />For the price, a worthwhile read.

Although it didn't read quite as smoothly as most of Jim Mullaney's novels, it was a decent adventure story.<br />A lot of the dialogue between Remo and Chiun and Remo and Smith seemed forced / unnatural, but that is really the only problem I saw with the book.<br />If you want a really good Destroyer, pick up Assassin's Handbook 2 at warrenmurphy dot com - he may still have a few autographed copies available.	2004-04-12

I didn't realize there were still so many sheep bleating overseas.<br />If you want a good story and don't mind the author's poor writing skills, this is a decent attempt.

Perhaps because I'm so familiar with Fleming's Bond, I really enjoyed some of these stories and didn't need all the filler.<br />Anyone who has enjoyed a Bond novel should like at least a couple of the stories in this collection.  I especially like the moral dilemma Bond finds himself in while being a predator near the end of The Hildebrand Rarity.	2003-12-05

This book was quite an exception.<br />Being a member of a local SAR (Sons of the American Revolution) chapter, I thought I should learn more about the Revolution and Washington than I did in school.<br />I was truly amazed at how much INTERESTING information this short book had that I'd never known before.  This book is very readable and provides a wealth of information about this amazing man and the early years of our nation.  After reading this book, you'll appreciate how hard it was to maintain a democracy even after we won the war.<br />I probably would have enjoyed American History at school if this book was taught rather than a snippet here or a date there.  This book gives great background and tells enough of what was happening in American and Europe to understand the significance of Washington's decisions and actions.<br />The only negative thing about this book is the author's clear bias when describing some of Washington's contemporaries.  It is one thing to explain what some of them did (which could have destroyed America as we know it), but the name calling detracted from the feel of the narrative.<br />Excellent work, Mr. Flexner!	2003-08-03

Of the five Fleming Bond novels I've read so far, this one seemed to be (from a technical point-of-view) the best written. Wint and Kidd were much more of a threat in the novel than you would suspect after watching the movie. <br />Picture the way Fleming describes the action when reading about Bond and Tiffany Case trying to survive a locomotive chasing them at about 60 miles an hour while they are out of petrol.  <br />I'm looking forward to reading From Russia With Love and the Penguin release of the other classic Bonds.  Nobody does Bond better than Fleming!	2003-02-03

Although the authors seemed to know what they were talking about (even if they come across somewhat \\"preachy\\" by telling us what was good, what was bad, and why John Barry should have won an award for each film), I was very disappointed by...<br /> THE GLARING ERROR!<br />The book states that Ernst Stavro Blofeld was last seen in Diamonds Are Forever.  When I read this, I quickly turned to the section on For Your Eyes Only.  John Hollis is credited with appearing as the \\"bald villain confined to a wheelchair.\\"  I can't believe that the authors completely missed the importance of James Bond visiting his wife's grave and then killing the man responsible for her murder!<br />I still gave the book two stars.  The sections on each film seem to be complete with most of the women, vehicles and gadgets that were used in each.  Also, the photos are excellent.<br />If you're a James Bond fan, you'll enjoy the book.  Fortunately, it doesn't include the lame Die Another Day.  The last film presented is The World is Not Enough.	2003-01-01

I think this was the shortest battle Purcell ever had.<br />James Mullaney had been laying the groundwork for this story quite some time and did an excellent job of bringing it together. It's interesting to look back over the first 129 novels and see how far both the storylines and characters have developed.  <br />Finally, anyone who has ever read the series needs to pick up this book.  It definitely marks the beginning of a new era.  I can only hope that the next author to pick up this series cares about the characters enough to bring them to life as vividly as Jim has done.	2002-10-10

It's a shame Jim is leaving the series, he's done a terrific job in most of his books.<br />As Jim says in the intro, this book is not following the source material 100%.

The second time I saw \\"Samurai sword\\" I knew I should have just watched the movie again.<br />The authors not only botched some of the most poignant moments of the story, but I wasn't impressed with the description of the final battle between MacLeod and the Kurgan.<br />I think the Director's Cut version of the original Highlander movie is one of the best written movies I've seen. Maybe that's why this novel fell so far short of my expectations.<br />If you can get a copy of the script to Highlander, you'll get a much better feel for the themes to the movie - avoid this book!<br />Oh well, at least I learned how to spell pendejo.	2001-06-29

The world is once again in danger, but when dealing with criminals who are not above-board you should look under the surface to see what's really going on.  Remo, the United States' super secret agent, and his mentor Chiun must deal with another unsavory hoard of evildoers before time runs out.  <br />In #121, the story pulls you in and the action builds to levels almost as high as the pile of bodies.  This episode is better written than some of the previous titles - even without a supernatural villain.  It will take awhile to uncover the true villain of the day - there are several to choose from. <br />I love this series because of the main characters.  If you're not familiar with the series this is a great point to jump in.  This story mixes adventure with a little bit of fantasy and mysticism.  It also makes enough references to previous stories in the series to give a good overview for newcomers.  Try it, you may find a new book every three months just isn't enough!	2000-10-22
