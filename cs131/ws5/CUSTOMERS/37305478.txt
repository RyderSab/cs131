US	37305478	RAOY3CSEQEJO1	055358135X	298857171	War of the Rats	Books	5	8	11	N	N	Excellent	One of the better historical fiction novels I have ever read.  Mr. Robbins places the reader in the middle of the action in the Battle of Stalingrad.  In this novel, a master Russian sniper, Zaitsez, nicknamed the \\"Hare\\" due to his slight frame and quickness, becomes a hero among the Russians because of his dexterity with long range rifles.  The German government has become aware of the \\"Hare\\" and decides that killing him will help destroy morale among the Russian troops and give their army a bit more momentum. They decide to bring in a \\"schoolmaster\\" who trains young German soldiers to be snipers.  He's also got better shooting range than does the \\"Hare\\" and enlists Nikki, a bright young German soldier to accompnay him the field.  <br /> <br />What's interesting is that an arrogant General by the name of Nikita Kruschev makes an appearance to award the \\"Hare\\" with a medal of courage for his efforts in the war.  <br /> <br />Reading the final 150 pages was like watching an intense chess match.  Robbins has scored big with this one and I am looking forward to reading more books by him.	2005-06-24

He's arguably the greatest mystery writer around today but this book just did not quite grab my attention like the others.  One of the biggest knocks on Child is that he spends too much time on minute details.  In this book, he spent an enormous amount of time on the smallest of details.  The constant review of the videotape filming the Secret Service cleaners got to be nerve wracking.  In fact, I was tempted to just skip ahead of all of that because it was a pain.   <br /> <br />In my view, this book is probably one of Child's weaker efforts.	2005-06-24

The characters are very well-developed and the story, told from the doctor's perspective, is incredible.  This is not your typical \\"whodunit\\" mystery.  If you're new to Coben's novels, No Second Chance is a good book in which to start.	2005-03-31

The book fast forwards the world 10 years of the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and how Iraq is making an all out effort to destroy the United States once and for all.      However, this story is highly improbable because he paints Hussein and his top officials as religious fanatics.  Hussein was not, nor will he ever be, a religious fanatic.      Also, his protagonist, Jonathan Bennett, had such a limited role in this book, you couldn't help but wonder why so much time was devoted to him.      This book obviously had a very pro-Israel slant and the author was way too preachy throughout most of it.	2005-03-31

Prescott brings back two of his more interesting characters, Tess McCallum, FBI agent and Abby Sinclair, \\"The Shadow Hunter.\\"  As expected, the two women do not get along very well when hunting down a serial killer but they must learn to work together in accomplishing this feat.   <br /> <br />The book had a good combination of action, humor and sadness.  The exchanges between Tess McCallum and her boss, \\"The Nose\\" are classics.

I hurried over to the news stand and did not have enough time to browse and picked up \\"No Other Option.\\"     This book took me by complete surprised from the outset.  It is packed with so much action and suspense, I had a hard time getting off the plane as I was about to finish.  Jonny Maxwell is a hero gone bad and Dale Miller, his former partner, has been called upon by federal law enforcement to help find him.     With the help of an attractive cop in Minneapolis, Dale decides to ditch the federal boys and go looking for Maxwell himself.     Wynne is probably the best kept secret among fictional suspense writers out there.  If you like lots of action and do not get turned off by explicit language and excessive violence, I'd strongly recommend this book.	2004-10-15

The murderers responsible are an Islamic group with roots dating back over a thousand years.   <br /> <br />Very intense dialogue accompanies this novel with a sub-plot of an Arab-American working for the CIA as an analyst to track down the leader of this terrorist group.

The book gets a little confusing because there are so many German towns, phrases, organizations, etc that it becomes hard to keep track of them througout the reading.  Also, the romantic scene between the hero who hunts down Repp, Leets, and a nurse becomes more distracting and really has no relevance to the story.  The action scenes were quite entertaining, however, and the book was hard to put down in the last 100 pages.     It was a decent book but I think I'll stick with the \\"Swagger\\" series from now on.	2004-10-13

This is my first Hunter novel and I was absolutely dumbfounded after reading it.  Swagger is a very complex character who has a lot of ghosts from Viet Nam that still haunt him, especially the memory of his best friend getting killed by enemy fire.  Swagger is one of the best snipers in the business and he is cajoled by a rogue group of secret government operatives into involving himself in an assassination plot.  After the rogue operatives fail to kill him, he becomes a fugitive from justice and has to team up with a disgraced FBI agent to clear his name.  Very tense thriller involving government coverups, trickery and constant grandstanding by the Asst Director of the FBI.     I could not put this one down.  Hunter scores big with this one.	2004-09-30

I really did enjoy reading works like The First Law and The Hearing.  However,I just couldn't get excited about this work.  The plot was a bit unrealistic while a great chunk of the novel was void of intense dialogue and a few action scenes for good measure.  Lescroats disappointed me in this one.

He clearly demonstrates that these leaders, who he refers to as civilians, have the right stuff to make tough strategic decisions while their generals should be obligated to carry out their orders. While it is important for heads of state to take their generals advise under consideration, these generals are in no real position to make political decisions, according to Cohen.

Several women have been murdered throughout the country and they all have one thing in common.  Each of them knew Reacher from the military.  However, the murderer is very efficient in that no clues remain as to what caused the death of each woman. Reacher has been coerced by the FBI to assist them with the investigation and he reluctantly decides to help the agency.  Unfortunately, most of the agents on this assignment really do not respect nor like him with the exception of a very attractive yet inexperienced 29 year old named Lisa Harper.  She also proves to be a valuable ally to Reacher in his search for this cold-blooded killer.   <br /> <br />Very graphic with intense language but very exciting book.	2004-08-30

She has been told that she is a CIA agent who has been recruited to hunt down a cold-blooded international assassin who is nicknamed, \\"The Carnivore.\\" However, as the novel progresses, she begins to discover that she's not who she thinks she is.  She has become a pawn in one of the biggest government cover-ups and has teamed with a CIA renegade to find out the truth.  <br /> <br />The story seemed very well constructed but my big problem was with the action scenes.  Highly unrealistic action scenes were very distracting and it took much away from an otherwise good story.	2004-08-30

Jack Reacher,an ex MP from the Army, is a drifter who is hitching a ride in a small rural town in Texas and picked up by a mysterious woman who tells him she's in trouble.  The problem is that much of her story does not add up and Reacher, being an ex-cop, becomes suspicious of her.   <br /> <br />A very intense novel with many twists and turns throughout much of it.

After he escapes from prison, he enlists a few members, including a dirty cop, seeking vengeance against those responsible for his sister and wife's deaths.

Some of the horrors inflicted on the Polish, particularly Polish Jews, are unthinkable.  I really liked how Rossini describes the various factions within the SS and the major players involved throughout the entire process to create &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space) for the German peoples. I also find it quite ironic that the Polish are described by many of the SS barbarians as &quot;violent.&quot;  My only complaint was that the author could have described the military tactics from the Polish perspective a bit more.  In other words, why was the German army able to steamroll the Polish military so easily.  A few accounts from Polish officers would have helped, though we did get quite a few accounts from Polish civilians.	2004-07-07

This Kidd individual seems pretty shallow as his character has no depth or reality to it. LuEllen was a more interesting person than Kidd and maybe it would have been better if the story centered on her.  Don't waste your time with this one.

These men belonged to a highly secretive organization known as Sigma.  In the interim, Ben Hartman is a thirty-ish banker on a ski trip in Switzerland and as he is about to depart, an old college \\"friend\\" notices him in a hotel lobby and makes an attempt on his life but fails.  As you continue to read the book, you will discover that there is a direct link between the attempted murder of Hartman and Sigma.     Anna and Ben accidentally meet each other about a third way  through the novel and discover that they both have a lot in common which is the desire to learn more about Sigma and some of its past and present members.       This was a great novel with lots of good history on the many doctors who performed human experiments during (...) Germany.

Easy is recruited to find the murderer of a young white coed, who happens to be the daughter of a prominent LA Asst D.A.  She was also found dead in a mostly black area of Los Angeles and LAPD detectives coerces Rawlins into assisting them with their investigation. Only problem is that Easy is now married with a daughter and has to put his family situation in jeopardy if he decides to offer help. He goes through his usual questioning of witnesses and as usual, he discovers a few surprises in the process. <br />A good thriller but like most Mosley novels, he has too many characters to keep track of.  Also, Easy is a borderline alcoholic in this one as he is always coming out of the liquor store or some kind of bar filled with scotch. It's a wonder how he's able to question his witnesses without slurring his speech or staggering all over the place since he's drunk throughout most of the book.

However, I was very disappointed in the ending. There were at least three mysteries that were not yet solved at the conclusion of this book and left me feeling empty afterward.  I almost felt as though I wasted 2 weeks of my valuable time reading this book. When I got to the final 4 or 5 pages, I was hoping desperately that some of mysteries would get solved or mentioned but they were not. Further, the narrator began to become a little bit too sanctimonius toward the end also. He was married to a beautiful and intelligent yet self-centered arrogant unfaithful wife but still loved her in spite of herself.  His self-loathing and seemingly idol worship of his extremely flawed wife got to be a bit nerve-racking. <br />This book was good but could have been much more had the author tried not to get cute toward the end.	2004-03-09

Those of us who complain about trivial meaningless matters like our favorite tv shows getting cancelled or not finding the right kind of department store, etc. must understand that unless we walk in the shoes of someone like Fisher, our little gripes and complaints really mean nothing.  This individual, according to statistics, should be sitting in some kind of state prison right now or in some kind of homeless shelter but instead, had the fortitude and determination to play the awful cards that were dealt him and become a productive citizen.<br />So far, this book is the best biography I've ever read and that would include the bios of individuals with surnames of Powell, Kennedy and Lincoln.	2004-01-15

Clark, an ex-Navy Seal, who possesses a great deal of intelligence and ice water in his veins when confronted with evil.  He shows absolutely no remorse and offers no apologies for exterminating the criminals who wreak havoc on society.  This is a very dark novel with extremely graphic descriptions of gratuitous violence coupled with excessive profanity.  However, the book is also a great yarn with intricate sub-plots and places the reader in the midst of the action that took place during the Viet Nam War era.  What's interesting is that Jack Ryan, son of a homicide detective, makes a cameo appearance as a college senior and discusses career options with his dad.<br />A shame that this book was never made into a movie.  It would have been awesome.	2004-01-15

Her description of Det. Kovak, for example, was so descriptive that I could actually smell old stale cigarettes on him whenever his name was mentioned.     My only complaint is that she gave us a bit too much of the cliffhanger in the middle of the book instead of saving the best for last.  All in all, it was a very good read and can't wait to read her next novel.	2004-01-13

He presents his protagonist, Dirk Pitt, as a James Bond type hero except that he operates at sea.  A very well written plot with a great ending, unique characters, intense action, make this novel one of Cussler's finest works that I've read so far.  However, for some reason, people do not discuss this book as one of Cussler's finest works in the same vein as Sahara.  <br />My only disappointment was that Julien Perlmutter, his obese marine historian, does not make any appearances.  He's one of Cussler's most interesting characters.  <br />I would definitely recommend Shockwave.	2004-01-13

This is the first time I've read a book from this author and am not familiar with the characters.  Ms. Johansen, however, does not give any good character introductions and the transition from event to the next is very sloppy.  The book was so pathetic, I literally gave it away to a used bookstore before completion.  <br /> <br />	2004-01-13

While Jack, Jr is only 23 years old, Clancy turns his character into spoiled brat of sorts. He makes too many references to his \\"daddy\\" instead of carving out his own niche and focusing on his strengths.  The Caruso brothers are very interesting new characters but the criteria used to select them to hunt down terrorists is highly unbelievable.  He also fails to mention how these guys are related to Ryan. <br />Very action-packed with good dialogue among the Muslims and South American drug dealers.  If you are new to Clancy's writings, you might enjoy this one.  However, if you've read epics like Executive Orders or Without Remorse, you will come away feeling a little empty.	2003-12-11
US	37305478	RSB2SWOCMN2FE	0425121631	425740762	Rules of Prey	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Hard to Put Down	Very suspenseful tale about a \\"Ted Bundy\\" type individual who has singlehandedly placed fear in every brunette in the Twin Cities area.  He's a very twisted bloodthirsty yet highly intelligent professional man who makes these rules for killing individuals.  Davenport plays the cynical yet smart and passionate detective who uses unorthodox but effective methods of tracking the killer.  <br />Very heart pounding in your face thriller and quite a debut for Sandford.  Davenport's character is very easy to dislike in this one because he demonstrates the thin line that separates him and the killer.  <br />Sandford has given us a hero who is very flawed but he's being realistic in his approach.  Face it, not every individual who hunts down bad guys is a highly moral self-righteous church goer who wants us all to get along.  DAvenport is highly selfish and very much a womanizer.  He is also smart, ruthless and tough.  These attributes are necessary when going after a cold-blooded killer.	2003-12-09
US	37305478	R2GFDOIT583X36	0425185710	92000199	Valhalla Rising (Dirk Pitt)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Decent	<BR>Cussler, once again, provides readers wtih a good suspenseful tale which features the exploits of Dirk Pitt and his trusting sidekick, Al Giordino. On the plus side, he provides us with a thorough description of various ships and submarines and puts the reader right in the midst of the action. He also gives us some educational insight on pre-Columbus expeditions and a good history lesson. I also get a kick out of the obese St. Julien Perlmutter. He's quite a character. The downside is that he puts Pitt in too many situations that would kill the average Joe 10 times over but somehow, he manages to come away unscathed every single time. If Cussler does this every once in a while, it would be more believable. However, with Pitt, he does it way too often. There were many instances where I simply heard myself saying, 'Aw, gimme a break' while reading a few paragraphs. Overall, a good story with interesting characters. Definitely would recommend.	2003-12-02
