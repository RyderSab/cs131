Minute details bog down the first 112 pages of this most recent addition to the series.  It took me two weeks to read as far in the book.  Once Harry arrives at Hogwarts for his 5th year, the story takes off at a feverish pace.  Dolores Umbridge is perhaps the most hated character ever to be introduced in the series (perhaps even more than Volde... oops, He Who Must Not Be Named).  J.K. Rowling's literary style has matured along with Harry and I anxiously await number 6 in the series.	2003-08-01
US	50868616	R3VHPDGFV1FN91	0843947527	402076302	The Deceased	Books	2	3	4	N	Y	Flowery writing.	The potentially excellent plot of this story is hindered from ever being realized by the author's ornate writing style.  The book did not raise any fears within, simply because of the hideous overtones of &quot;artistic&quot; writing.  The characters are not well developed, and the story reads very slowly.  There are times in the plot when you are not sure which character is where.  Tom Piccirilli's books will not be gracing my bookshelves any time soon.	2002-07-14

It keeps you believing that the worst is over, until each shocking turn in the plot.  It will give you nightmares.

A terrific novel with a disappointing ending.  420 pages to lay the groundwork to an anti-climatic ending.

Kingsolver uses a brilliant writing style to tell the story of an American family on mission to the Belgian Congo.  Each chapter is told from the perspective of a different character (a woman and her four daughters.  Even though this novel peaks two-thirds of the way through, it is marvelous to the last page.  Kingsolver takes her characters far beyond the mission trip, elongating the story to several decades!  Political overtones run high in this story, but do not necessarily overshadow it!  Brilliant story, brilliant writing = BRILLIANT NOVEL!	2001-10-02

I have used this book to the point of having to order a second copy!  There are four books in the series, even though Amazon.com only lists volumes I and IV.  All four are incredible.

The kids love the part that everyone knows, but the authors have taken it a few steps further by adding additional verses.

It is a book with both pros and cons. The story is long winded, and really has no direction. The plot is too tedious for young children. However, the book does explain some aspects of African tribal culture which are well illustrated and meticulously explained. The best aspect of the book is the &quot;How To&quot; section at the end. My students enjoy making their own rainstick, and this is a perfect way to summarize the activity.	2001-08-30

Christian opponents, worried parents and paranoid cult haters have all found reason to hate this series. I have a brief statement to make. I am a Christian and a parent of two young children. I believe that this book only impacts young people negatively, if the parents do not communicate with their children about what is fiction and what is not. I read the newspaper daily, and I don't believe in murder. If these books draw even one child into the glorious world of reading, then Ms. Rowling has done great things for society!!	2001-08-25

I was skeptical at first, but I grew to care not for Kinsey Millhone, but for many of the other characters in the book. Even the eventual murderer had some wonderful traits. The plot is well conceived, interesting and well-played out. It held my attention, but it did not make me want to run out and buy another Grafton novel. I read Koontz's &quot;From the Corner of His Eye&quot; previous to &quot;P&quot;, and the Koontz book is much more compelling. In conclusion, read this book, but borrow it from the library instead of buying it!	2001-08-25

The giver requested that I listen and read immediately.  Howl!  From start to finish, I laughed!  The chant (grunt) is authentic, and true to Gregorian modes.  The musicians are first rate, though I am not sure how they recorded this without laughing!  <br />Basically, what Boynton and her cohorts have done, is spoof the ever-so-popular &quot;Chant&quot; recordings.  It details the day in the lives of some barn animals.  The humor is subtle, and it would almost be worth it to learn Latin all over again.  After studying the Chant form for a semester in college, I am sure that I find the humor funnier than the average non-music major.  Still, it is a great parody that everyone should hear at least once.	2001-08-23

I have read some of the reviews stating that the beginning of this book is slow and uninteresting.  To these people, I ask &quot;What book are you reading?&quot;  Koontz uses this time to set the stage for one of the most sinister, sick minds in all literature.  It is also in this &quot;slow&quot; section that Koontz's writing style is so brilliantly displayed.  <br />Having just read &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, one of the most rewarding changes in this book, is Koontz's lack of profanity.  In a sick society, it is wonderful to know that suspense, horror, and mind-boggling psychosis can be created without the use of the &quot;bomb&quot; and other choice phrases.<br />All in all, this book is a brilliant read.  Koontz has branched out from his earlier efforts.  I have loved all of the Koontz books that I have read, and this one only confirms my appreciation for Dean Koontz.	2001-08-07

I have read the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, the &quot;Omega Trilogy&quot; and now, this trilogy.  There is NO comparison.  I read the entire trilogy in five days, and was riveted from start to finish.  It is not the easiest read, as it is very thoroughly researched, in-depth, and maturely written.

Charming, witty, frightening, tender, page-turning suspense from the master.  There are points in the novel where you cannot discern which mental state is real or a dream.

This is a comprehensive volume designed to help the band director develop a concise curriculum for the high school (or college) band program.  Included are chapters on rehearsal techniques, conducting basics, philosophies of music education, and justification for our music programs!!!  The standout feature of this book, however, is its coverage of wind literature.  For each piece, there is historical background, instrumental difficulties, suggested listening lists, and various activities related to the piece.  This should be required reading for all college music education majors.	2001-05-08

Jan Karon proposed (no pun intended) this book to be something different than the previous &quot;Mitford&quot; books.  And different, it is.  Jan Karon's style is prevalent, as is the charm of the characters in Mitford, but is an intendedly uni-dimensional story covering events surrounding the wedding.

This book opens very slowly, but when the action begins, it doesn't stop.  You then realize that the opening of the book is needed to balance the pace of the latter part.

Having read all of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, I can say that this set of books is much stronger than the LaHaye/Jenkins series.  The characters are more complex, and numerous.  The writing style, while taking a bit of time to get used to, is more solid than the LB series.  Tor von Eisenhalt makes a much more convincing anti-Christ.  Left Behind is not a bad place to start, but the Omega Triogy is definitely a more concise step up in literary terms.	2001-04-14

This book uses the most vivid imagery of everyday life.  It endolds you, and sucks you in (no pun intended) to the plot.  The end of the book does not result in a cataclysmic battle between good and evil, but leaves things hanging in the air.  The use of child vampires still haunts me to this day.

As I read through the reviews of Grisham's new book, it becomes apparent to me that many people do not enjoy change.  I, for one, appreciate Mr. Grisham's versatility.  In music, if a composer does not diversify, they become known as a formula composer.  I think the same could apply to literary giants, as well.  &quot;A Painted House&quot; IS a new direction for John Grisham, and it is a fabulous book.  If you expect adventure and suspense, you won't be disappointed.  However, you will need to read into the characters to find the suspense!  This novel has the makings of an American classic, much in the lines of William Faulkner!  Read it with an open mind, and enjoy!	2001-03-21

I happen to be a very well-read individual, and I feel that &quot;The Mark&quot; keeps me intimately close with the characters with whom we have now spent eight books.

A masterfully crafted array of characters are blended to create the small-town America that our society longs for.  In an age when guns and  violence in the schools is commonplace, Mitford is a reassuring place that  we can all visit to regain some of the innocence that we once had.  <br />Jan  Karon wonderfully captures an audience in her small town, without the aid  of violence, sex, or any other heinous crimes.  This is not to say that  there isn't suspense or drama lurking at every page turn, however.<br />All  fiction writers would do well to adopt Jan Karon's view of life in America.   Enjoy!	2000-09-02
