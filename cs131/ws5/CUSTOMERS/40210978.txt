This book is for the rest of us. Okay, so we can't walk across America. We can still feel it, see it, smell it, understand it. That's what this journal, written as simply and powerfully as any literary stylist might. The writer is flawed but so completely honest about himself that we can't help but like him. And we know we can trust him too, and that is what makes this narrative so enthralling. I walked the Pacific Crest Trail with John when I read this, and all I missed out on were the stress fractures.

It is spare and exact as any literary reader could want, and at the same time as exciting as any adventure novel---and every word is fact.<br /><br />Corbett was a man of decency, honor and humanity. To read his writing is to see into his soul, and to see what man can be, yet seldom is. In this age of braggadocio and bluster it is good to remind oneself that men can be more. Few of us have such dangerous work as did Corbett, but we may all choose to live as decently and honorably and, most of all, humbly.<br /><br />Corbett was also an ecologist, biologist and lover of nature, as odd as that may seem for a big game hunter. He both loved and respected the tigers he killed, and did much to stop their destruction. Too often, environmentalists know nothing of what they seek to preserve. Corbett knew the forests of India, the fauna and flora both.	2005-01-13

Do you feel safer? In the real world, gun laws affect only those who obey laws. But what about lawbreakers?<br />The answer, of course, is that they ignore laws. So how do we defend ourselves from them once the politicians take our guns? This novel explores this  problem in a forceful, believable way.<br />Better written than other attempts at the genre, this novel takes the problem down to one man doing what he must to defend his wife from another man who wants to hurt her. And the small scale of the book gives it its power.<br />Read it, and be prepared for the fire it will kindle in your belly.	2004-03-31

I just love a good  mystery, and this certainly was one! WOLF was such a  great character in your novel. I was waiting till the  last paragraph to see how it was going to end, and it  was sublime Betty!!!!!  You wrote many interesting scenes in your book that  really &quot;hit me&quot;! In chapter #21, for example; when the  conversation ensues about Gram you say, &quot;It's as if  Gram was just in another room&quot;! God I just love that  feel Betty, love it. It moved me.  Then in chapter #29, when you say- &quot;The body is like a  winter coat, you wear it when the weather is cold. But  in the summer you simply don't need it any more. Your  Gram doesn't need her body now&quot;!!!!  wow!!! The images that that placed into my mind  brought a comfortable and reassuring feeling to me and it still stays with me as I type these words. Thanks a  million Betty.  Also, in chapter #36- When you describe Hattie  cleaning her silverware with a flannel rag, WHEW, that  really bombarded me with an emotion that I haven't  thought about in years. When my mom was in a state  mental hospital my grandmother took care of me and I  remembered her making the noodles and cleaning her  utensils with her husbands old discarded flannel shirt  from his construction job. I smiled both inwardly and  outwardly at this beautiful memory you made me  remember.	2003-07-30

The Big Band era took the music scene by storm in 1935 with Goodman's first tour of L.A.. Yet less than a dozen years later the musical phenomenon that has driven all music since  came apart at the seams, and within months, all the major bands had broken up.  A new book by jazz insider, Bob Wilder tells why. Big Band Era lays bare the troubles, triumph and tragedy which led to the blow up of what many consider the greatest American music of all time. The Big Band Era: A New Look blows the lid off the closely guarded secrets of the big band leaders, vocalists, instrumentalists and personalities who made jazz what it was. Miller,Dorsey, Forrest, Sinatra, Shaw, they're all here, and as you've never seen them. Get the insider story on the whole big band scene, from a reporter who saw it happen-both on stage and backstage. From Benny Goodman's most humiliating experience to Weems' fourteen-year \\"overnight\\" success and the true story behind the Dorsey tragedy.  Accidental death, suicide, the draft, gyppo promoters and jilted lovers-all took their toll on the big bands. The Big Band Era: A New Look  is all you've ever wanted to know about the big bands.	2003-02-13
