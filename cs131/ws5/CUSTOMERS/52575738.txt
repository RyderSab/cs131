Expect to be challenged, these are as exciting as history lectures can be. Delivered at the time of the Revolution in Iran they provide a critique, explanation, and support for Khomeini's revolution. Discussion and questions are reported after each lecture and four well selected short translations from Khomeini and Shariati are appended. <br /> <br />Lectures are concise summaries and opinion regarding each topic: \\"Iran and Shi'ism\\", \\"Imam Khomeini: the Embodiment of a Tradition\\", \\"Islam as Ideology\\" (on Shariati);and \\"The Year of Revolution\\".  <br /> <br />Perhaps because the viewpoint is so different from the media and most staid academic treatments, and enthused by the spirit of the moment, the reader is engaged and interested. (Despite minor changes with republication, this book remains a work from 1979.) <br /> <br />Algar makes Iranian Islam and Khomeini central to the dramatic and important revolution that haunts us still. U.S. and Israeli interests were upset, and Muslim countries at the time neither understood nor supported the revolution. Western, and especially American media traumatized by the Embassy takeover and the `loss' of the Shah as anti Communist and supplier of oil, never came close to accuracy or understanding. Labels and stereotypes from them still dominate most works on the subject.  <br /> <br />Since the revolution most academic explanations have been at a loss about how to treat the \\"religious\\" factor and the improbable success of the revolution. Neither political pundits nor academics can help but be embarrassed by the bias and shallowness of most of their work. Yet if Directors today are still having immense problems trying to do a full length movie on Ataturk - highly emotional after 60 years - they could not even dream of a time when one could be done on Khomeini.(The short biography by the History channel is tolerable for the time being as an introduction but still shallow.) <br /> <br />This book is a great place to start wrestling with the significance of the immediate revolution, the role of Shi'ism and Khomeini, the sociology of human spirit that created the people's revolution that is not to be explained by conspiracy or military takeover but rather success of a largely unarmed revolution against the 2nd greatest and most modern army in the Middle East of its time. Like it or not, this is a book that is a \\"must read\\" on many levels. <br />	2005-03-28

Another chapter traces May Day celebrations (and what reminds one of \\"socialistic realist\\" art posters and stamps) to show evolution from elements of a worker's revolution to a nationalist bourgeois realism. The evolving perceptions of property and state (another essay) puts perspective on rhetoric of people's rights that never threatened private property but came to more strongly support a national economy so long as Iranian culture and religion were secure and foreign interests well controlled - pragmatism did not replace principle. <br /> <br />The most important essay argues convincingly that the \\"Fundamentalist\\" label explains little about the character or the success of the revolution. (This should be a strong reminder to the labelers of our own time who feel they explain and understand by name calling.)  <br /> <br />Essays, perhaps necessarily, sometimes overlap and are uneven. At times they could have been briefer and tighter. A reader would do well to have some basic picture of Iranian history at least back into the 19th century. Yet the book has considerable value and the first and last essays on the \\"Populism\\" of the revolution and the \\"Paranoid Style\\" of Iranian politics are of special value. <br />	2005-03-28

It is a quick read, a worthwhile long essay really, more than a book of analysis and comparison. <br /> <br />Provocative, suggestive, even fun, it does provide pointers and examples of a diffuse anti-Westernism from varied sources: Hindu, Chinese, Japanese, Muslim among them. There is less study of intellectual criticism and more reminders of actions expressing contest. A Japanese subway gas attack and Kamikazes, as well as Irish terrorists (not called \\"Christian terrorists\\" of course) remind one that fanatics (if that is a valid term at all) and terrorism are not uniquely Muslim. Brief notes about Tagore, Gandhi, Iqbal, and others peak at cultural and intellectual critics of the West. <br /> <br />People generally, perhaps Americans more so, get historical amnesia (especially when it comes to other languages, cultures, and geography) and may enjoy reminders through many examples mentioned of striking anti modern, anti-technological, and even feminist critiques included as \\"Occidentalist\\". <br /> <br />For those already paranoid the list of alternatives is at once somehow amusing while being a bit scary. The many pointers should be pursued with discussion of various anti-colonial criticisms, as well as current critiques of the \\"Washington consensus\\" on Globalism and even Capitalist `triumphalism\\" assessed. It is not the `end of history' and we do not have all the answers. The authors can see that \\"Occidentalism\\" is more than the bemused deception of turning the blame around when non-Western countries have problems. But that would be another, and longer, more analytical book. Amused and reminded, by this book maybe we can hope others will be so inspired.  <br />	2005-03-24

(It is ironic and also unfortunate, that another book more shallow and less valuable became a big seller because it's title appeared to be confirmed by 9-11 shortly after it was completed, \\"What Went Wrong?\\" - such are the fates and irrationality of opinion formation.) <br /> <br />Readers should start with the new Preface written a year after 9-11 and be prepared to work a little harder to think rather than merely find simplistic confirmation of bias they may have. This is not to say one always agrees - only that Halliday has worthwhile things to say to those with an open mind. <br /> <br />The first section has chapters on the Middle East in International Relations reminding us that similar drives apply as elsewhere in the world and that it is not totally and mystically unique. An interesting essay on the Iranian Revolution is followed by another on the Gulf War.  <br /> <br />Part two provides mature reflections on select issues: \\"Islam and the West\\" and the validity of their mutual threats; human rights issues; and many sources of anti-Muslimism (one might wryly comment that his oversight misses Amazon reviewers and the darker side of the US Media). The conclusion critiques both Said and the Orientalists although it is not terribly satisfying and not really tightly constructed conclusion for the book so much as another essay. <br /> <br />Some general readers may find the analytical style a bit tough going built as it is on more than the flaccid assertions of some other more popular books. Yet the case that Islam is too varied, focus too much centered on domestic concerns, and conflicts of interest and character of various Muslim regimes and Fundamentalist groups too considerable for a meaningful interpretation based on Islam's \\"confrontation\\" or \\"civilizational clash\\" to really explain anything worth explaining ismade - however indirectly. Conspiratorial theorists, paranoids, and Crusaders will be disappointed - but probably would not think their way through the book anyway (fundamentally convinced of their own just truth already). <br /> <br />Huntington's thesis is not directly addressed here but is, and should be, discredited by the discussion of particulars. (For a more direct analysis of that one should see such things  as relevant chapter's of \\"Why America's Top Pundit's Are Wrong\\".) This book draws from specific analysis, Huntington's from broad generalization and assertions. Halliday is a scholar of Muslim themes, Huntington read Lewis's essay on \\"Rage\\" and not a whole lot more. Pundits, politicians, polemicists, press people have climbed on Huntington's bandwagon and policy has been effected - it is a pity that few have honestly considered alternatives. But then \\"60 million Americans can't be wrong\\" - no that was `Frenchmen'. <br />	2005-03-24

Space, time, change, local adaptation all have legitimate and important roles that make many generalities, however useful to simplify or sometimes demonize, seem terribly nave. <br /> <br />There are interesting bits and observations for the student of Islamic history and cultures with observations about such things as how Hui Chinese gravestones in coastal China used both Arabic and Chinese perhaps to be Muslim without denying their Chinese place while in Java Arabic quite sufficed perhaps because Islam felt less threatened by a dominant civilization. The examples can be interesting; the speculations are designed to make one think and open directions for further study. <br /> <br />Examples are from the entire period of Islamic history and may be of interest to many students of Muslim Civilization. <br />	2005-03-10

Mature reflections by an Anthropologist, former Ambassador and Muslim intellectual provide perspective and ideas all but absent in Western media. <br /> <br />Neither `Occidentalist' blaming the west nor `Orientalist' blaming Islam, Ahmed considers the witches brew of tribal, dynastic, European, and Islamic factors in times of great pressure, rapid change, and social imbalance. He is hard on Muslim leaders and countries - this is no apology. He also attempts to understand and analyze these difficult times. The application of the idea of a \\"post-Honor\\" world (including Muslim views of Clinton) may speak more to readers than the chapter on Ibn Khaldun and asabiyya perhaps. <br /> <br />At times personal, even idiosyncratic, the essay is always provocative. For those with some background and serious about understanding who want more than the typically polemic or hidden agenda multitude of books promoted in the U.S. - read this. Muslims frustrated by hving disaster after disaster in the media and public attention on what they see as exceptional, even un Islamic, presented as `typical' - read this. <br /> <br />Three other books are strongly suggested: for recent events and a Muslim `take' on the news \\"The War on Islam\\" by Enver Masud would complement this essay. Also Michael Sells and Emran Qureshi have edited a valuable collection \\"The New Crusades: constructing the Muslim Enemy\\". Another insightful book has three studies of how the purposeful fiction of the \\"Axis of Evil\\" has been promoted and manipulated (Inventing the Axis of Evil: The Truth About North Korea, Iran, and Syria  <br />by Bruce Cumings, et al.) <br />	2005-03-10

Written shortly before 9-11, this book is still probably the best single volume for introducing Islam and the Muslim world today! <br /> <br />Consider the daunting task. Who can find or would presume to write one book explaining Christianity and politics and society of the entire Christian world in one short volume? Ahmed does this rather well for the Muslim world. <br /> <br />Of course everyone would have alternative emphasis or focus and the broad coverage and discussion necessarily leaves out things that may have been of interest or `hot' news items. Understanding, not sound bits: maturity, not hypercritical unbalance focusing on  Armenian persecution or a cottage industry of hate that sees little but dhimitude (whose followers ought better study \\"democide\\" that is much worse, much more common, and much more relevant)is achieved. It is likely that a reviewer suggesting taqiyya (in ay case largely a Shia not Sunni practice) suffers from such a perspective. <br /> <br />Ahmed is not apologetic but rather critical of many faults in the Muslim world. If anything, he `lets off' the interventions and policies of the US and of Israel with too little criticism while emphasizing both Muslim and social-anthropological roots of problems. <br /> <br />Although the selection of Ottoman, Mughal, and Saffavid Empires as background seems peculiar to an Arab and post 9-11 Osama obsessed American it is entirely valid, helps understanding the political and social issues and provides necessary perspective. There is no space for significant thought centers and the large Muslim population of Indonesia however. The book is current if the goal is understanding. (Although the perspective is not that of international relations that is wanted by some readers who don't first have understanding of the countries involved.)  <br /> <br />Arab countries are discussed largely in the topical essays about democracy, family, and identity. Central Asia is surveyed. Muslims as minorities in variousareas are described. The observations and opinions are always worth consideration and reflection. Coincidentally, and usefully, one will always form a somewhat personal view while reading. <br /> <br />Some Islam phobes will miss focus on key pet polemics, but they will find honest if brief discussions of favorite critiques about such things as women's rights and even their \\"pet\\" crimes like mutilation. Sorting out what is Islamic and what is not - whether literalist or from understanding of principles and spirit of Islam is useful. <br /> <br />My own major criticism would be that the treatment of Western media is too forgiving and he has not opportunity to deal with the perverted impact of polemic, ignorance, and the extreme forms of `orientalism' and neoCons so pervasive in government, among pundits, and reviewers who are multiple `experts' hateful and/or believing all attacks on Islam help their `causes' a book of this kind is much needed. (Readers would do well to read \\"Why America's Top Pundits are Wrong\\" for analysis and critiques of Huntington (by extention Lewis's \\"Rage\\".) <br /> <br />This should be the first book for the \\"general reader\\" and for others exposed to only the popular media. Many concerned Christians would also do well to read this book as would American 'patriots'who may not appreciate how fortunate they are. <br />	2005-03-10

After a good short history of the coming of Islam to Malay peoples in what is now Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and the Philippines there are a few brief bright spots, otherwise the book is disappointing.  <br /> <br />The title is misleading when the author's special interest is Christian relations in, especially, the Philippines. \\"Resurgence\\" here is pre \\"terrorism\\" but is covered superficially after the first useful step of identifying its several strains. The discussion of \\"Fundamentalism\\" and roles of modern and traditional intellectuals is curtailed. <br /> <br />Much is superficial: no analysis of the ways in which made converts were made should now omit processes of discourse and adaptation, the central role of places like Acheh and Malacca, the myth and facts behind the Wali Songo of Indonesia. Nor can discussion of resurgence and modern thought miss so much of the very active Islamic debate in Indonesia where the author denies the importance of Islamic parties (Indonesia has the two largest in the entire Islamic world and elected as President the head of one just after this book was published). <br /> <br />Complaining about policies restricting Christian conversion efforts in Malaysia the author condemns policy with no understanding of how British \\"hands off\\" policy regarding Islam led to a very great impact from importing Chinese and Indians in considerable numbers effectively handicapping Malays in their own country. Whether or not continuation is legitimate the Malaysian policies have been \\"affirmative action\\" to offset this dire aspect of British colonial rule. <br /> <br />Even talking about his forte, religion, McAmis leaves much to be desired. His attempts at good will (welcome and all too rare of late) still leave him terribly judgmental about Islam and he imports older sources calling it \\"Mohammedanism\\" (both insulting and misleading) without comment. The importance of practice over belief - orthopraxy over orthodoxy - is neglected. Differences inideas of original sin, redemption, and the institutional differences as well as the importance of these is missed. This is part of a pattern of being somewhat out of date despite an appended biography that attempts to list more recent sources. There is no \\"Southeast Asia centric\\" causation here (a focus since the 60's); one might mistake Dutch conquest as completed nearly two hundred years before this was so; local trade and its continuing important roles are ignored. Much of the more recent work on Indonesia by the likes of Bowen, Hefner, Woodward, Siegel, and others is ignored. The picture of Malaysian Islam is simplistic. Despite some historical notes of Islam's former strength, the discussion of the Philippines is almost as much about Christians and ecumenical attempts without appreciating the Muslim case for autonomy after a long and bitter history of Christian forces. <br /> <br />	2005-02-23

Read the excellent introduction and at least the chapters on the pundits you read, listen to, or who influence policies that are of concern. The writers are anthropologists of the contemporary world who are terrific for the most part (the essay on lineage and family critiquing Huntington's metaphors was less valuable than the first analysis perhaps).These pundits have such broad impact that you may want to read the entire book. <br /> <br />Often I feel that most pundits are wrong, simplistic, or polemicists most of the time. Rarely does notoriety of their books seem justified. But they are promoted, publicized, applauded - usually by those who share similar bias, stand to make money on their work or just want an easy read or entertainment - and some sense that they \\"know\\" - without having to think critically. .In an age of well funded think tanks and endowed Chairs, of textbooks and case studies designed more for job training than of education and independent thinking about history or the presumptions hard wired into their training --debate is narrow in scope if there is debate at all. Money and publicity replace questioning authority. People are conditioned to parrot, to believe absurdities uncritically - and sometimes manipulated by their fears. Feeling they \\"know\\" better, are superior, and deserve to be so replaces competent critical analysis and questioning presumptions. Assertion replaces careful making the case. Quips and metaphors replace evidence. Where there is evidence it is often used in a sloppy manner comparing falsely unlike cases (Murray's black students generally with whites and Asians from educated families expecting and `pushing' education.) <br /> <br />Even if you entirely disagree with this \\"take\\" on public \\"discourse\\" you are likely to read (or at least be much effected by second hand versions of) Samuel Huntington; Robert Kaplan; Thomas Friedman (and Bernard Lewis's recent polemics parading as history) regarding foreign matters and/or DineshD'Souza; Charles Murray, and Sociobiology's commentators on race, poverty, sexism. Most politicians when trying to sound authoritative and much work from think tanks are but \\"lite\\" versions of the same travesty. Generally are all so remote and isolated from what the great majority of people experience that they are totally out of touch.  <br /> <br />Everyone who reads or listens to anything more serious than \\"talk radio\\" needs to read this book. Everyone! It will enlighten most and organize the thinking of others. If you choose to follow the footnotes (often worthwhile here) there are important lessons about manipulated programs outsiders saw (and continue to see) as ancient rivalries in the Balkans and Rwanda; about policies of governments and the IMF that cause disasters attributed entirely  to primitive (and racially inferior) people and their innate inferiority and violent nature. Not traditionalism but new fears and new economic crises explain much. The \\"olive tree\\" people and Seattle protestors are concerned about economic and social justice and taking care of their families not just thoughtless reactionaries. It is always the dirty poor rather than the clean elites (who finance, control, and buy the work of pundits after all) who inevitably are the cause of their own misery. Self fulfilling prophecy and self fulfilling policy are both evident from a critical reading rarely even	2005-02-14

Would that pundits and media `experts' provide at least some part of this maturity. Bulliet eschews polemic and bitterness to provide sound perspective some of the most essential themes of public discourse and policy regarding the world of Islam. <br /> <br />The whole book is a compelling alternative to common (and shallow, ideological, Islamphobe) views promoted by Neocons and others. Whatever your present perspective, understanding will be sharpened by careful reading of this excellent book.  <br /> <br />The only thing I do not like is the title, which makes a point but has mislead some reviewers already so that they dismiss or misunderstand the sound arguments presented. <br /> <br />The first chapter condemns Huntington's thesis about the \\"Clash of Civilizations\\" indicating how it is both misleading and damaging. (Bulliet might have added it has been used for aggressive, hateful, and misguided policies that obscure economic, oil, and geostrategic motives). Christianity and Islam as social, political, and institutional matters are \\"siblings\\" not clashing civilizations and excellent comparative analysis about responses to often similar needs are enlightening. <br /> <br />The second chapter \\"What Went On\\" provides much insight and more than the entire book with a similar title that has been widely promoted for those who want to think that they have answers \\"What Went Wrong\\". It is insightful and fascinating on topics ranging from expansion and conversion to the social and institutional place of clerics, law, religious hierarchy. <br /> <br />\\"Looking for Love in all the Wrong Places\\", chapter 3, avoids polemic while showing how area studies in the US provided a sort of revised \\"Orientalism\\" driven by triumphalist assumptions about democracy, development, and capitalism all the more biting (and ideological) because of the competition of the Cold War. Even now this has not been corrected to deal with things more objectively and with some degree of empathy. <br /> <br />The fourth and final chapter on the \\"Edge\\" analyses and speculates about the direction of development in Islam based on creative and changing situations that may become sources for broader future development - as they often have in the past. <br /> <br />Bulliet eschews blame and bitter argument and does not dwell on the sometimes negative aspects of Colonialism, intervention, anti democratic interventions by democracies of the west. Nor does he dwell on terrorism, putting it in perspective as presently exceptional and not widely supported. He is perhaps, if anything, too kind to some of those critiqued. (There is the implication that an approach based on `clash' and antagonistic policy ideologues who intensely dislike Islam - including Pipes and Lewis as well as NeoCons perhaps - may create more terrorism. This is a whole other discussion however.) <br /> <br />This is a short book (161 pages, Appendix, and notes) that will challenge readers of any stripe to improve their understanding, their reasoning, and perspective. It could well replace four longer books one might otherwise choose to read on these subjects. Attention is richly rewarded providing the mature and considered views of a thoughtful scholar that so clearly sets it apart from the many shallow books that have rushed to print since 9-11. Read it carefully whether your interest is history, exclusively current events, or speculation about the future. <br />	2005-01-19

In this case Hayes no doubt also profited selling to others who wanted similar conclusions argued for them. Reading the book carefully will convince only those with no independent perspective and wanting to believe. <br /> <br />The problem is that so much is contentious and unconvincing to an objective reader that the `evidence' is usually dubious and labeling those who would disagree becomes necessary. Not only has the bipartisan compromised and hardly radical 9-11 Commission discredited the thesis but a logical and well informed student of those involved (so rarely seen among ideologues and instant-expert pundits) would do so emphatically despite Hayes' attempt to trivialize the notion that Saddam and Osama would not agree because one is secular and the other Islamist.  <br /> <br />Common sense is, well, uncommon. Saddam, as someone said, even if he had WMD would be like a virile man wanting thousands of children by as many women - he had not the delivery system. None of his neighbors were much afraid (perhaps Israel a little despite its substantial supply of Nukes and the means for delivery) but the U.S with  perhaps 300 times or more the military budget,  about 12 times the population, and qualitatively even more superior military capacity and WMD was led to shaking in its boots by those with ulterior motives.  <br /> <br />Nor would Saddam trust Osama who as an ideologue could not be trusted to strike a deal (Hayes's argument) and might provide weapons to Saddam's Islamist domestic enemies. The Al Qaeda operatives in Iraq before the U.S. invasion were few and in areas not under Saddam's control. There is stronger evidence for U.S. complicity with two trips by a certain American, pictures of him shaking hands with Saddam, and records of as many as 20 or more U.S. companies supplying chemical and biological weapon materials. (Maybe this is why folks like Rummy and Cheney were so sure Saddam had WMD?) <br />	2005-01-17

The first four short chapters on Eurocentrism and disinformation about \\"Aryan Invasion\\", \\"Vedas\\", and \\"Caste\\" are the best (if brief and `light') before the book largely expresses viewpoints of Sri Auribindo updated by the author for more recent history. <br /> <br />The questioning of the common images of Gandhi, Nehru, Mother Teresa, and British colonial rule do make one think constructively and point up doubts abut commonly taught views.  Rabid anti-Islamic generalizations however are accompanied by attacks on Christian missions, cowardly American Military fighting from distance without honor (while applauding new Indian martial spirit).  <br /> <br />The French, Indianized, author supports Hindu Nationalism, reintegrating Kashmir and Sri Lanka, standing up to the Chinese on Tibet based on a romantic renaissance of classical Indian civilization and industry. Comparing the mission of India to that of Israel and lauding both the author is aggressive in his views. Among sources (scant indeed) he includes Nostradamus! <br /> <br />It is indeed annoying, weakly documented, opinionated, mostly wrong headed - but provocative! <br />	2004-12-02

Very recent under water cities that likely are about 7000 years old will add to the story when explored. Exposes racial, cultural, disciplinary biases that have held back 'progress' in better understanding early civilization and its continuity in India. <br /> <br />This is far more than idle or imaginative speculation and well worth reading although traditional historians would appreciate more sources of evidence and may be uncomfortable with that which uses early Vedic texts. <br />	2004-11-29

Several reviewers did not read the book or read from such virulently antagonistic positions that they learned nothing from a rich resource. <br /> <br />The 444 days counted down by the nightly news leave images from one side and support a narrow and emotional tale about terrorists, fanatics, and threat. Far from reality or balance. The retelling of the takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran, the student's goals and activities, Khomeni's response, Press coverage and attitudes exemplifies something Americans have yet to come to terms with. The regular exposure of efforts at sabotage and CIA intervention were censored out of accounts we saw.(There is little or no account of the much older role of the US in Iran's finances and politics even before the First World War or even of the overthrow of Nationalist Mossadeq by CIA sabotage -- all of which provide a depth of experience and understanding of US motives and actions deeper than even today's typical understanding of Iran by Americans.) At a time when our extremists see nothing by an enemy in Iran we are likely to make similar miscalculations.  <br /> <br />The biggest Power seems to have mostly sheltered, xenophobic, ill informed citizens because of both the media and our natural predisposition and distance. (As of 2004 we have new censorship that does not allow some books from specific 'enemy' countries to be published in the US - further corrupting our thinking and understanding.) \\"Takeover\\" is an easy and provocative read valuable for the personal story it tells and the much broader reflections about US policy, the CIA, the Media, and the near total \\"disconnect\\" from world realities from which we still suffer. It tells its story well and makes no pretense of being a broad and balanced history while injecting much that has been left out by American accounts. <br />	2004-11-02

Prehistory is now clear. Originally presented in 1968, the discussion is still of value and interest. (Most new work has not changed interpretation and the new Peru Coastal civilization although not known at the time would only reconfirm warfare was not the cause of civilization building.) Many books on archeology are research reports, surveys of sites, or technical; this book is a clear discussion that reads better and provides a consistent view of origins. There are a few photos of sites and artifacts to compliment the discussion. An enjoyable read of 151 pages, plus notes,photographs and maps.	2004-10-19

S Military is Using Bullets and Ballots to Remake Iraq	Books	1	16	65	N	N	Rose colored propaganda	One can honor and admire some of the individual efforts of soldiers to be constructive without distorting so thoroughly the context, purpose, role of occupiers. <br /> <br />The author would have us believe that Iraq's dilapidated state had little to do with war or nothing much to do with a decade of severe sanctions and therefore must be entirely Saddam's fault. Iraq seems never had educational, health, or other systems worth note. The destruction of clean water facilities and health systems is not explained; it must have been a few stray bombs.. <br /> <br />He also is so anxious to counter critics that he would have us believe that most soldiers are well educated idealists and patriotic youngsters - having very little to do with job and other opportunities lacking within civilian life. The many races and nationalities represented shows patriotism more than the narrow range of opportunities and economy in decline at home. <br /> <br />Further we have won the war, terrorists are a minute minority, and most Iraqis still welcome us. Insurgency for him is really a misnomer. This is consistent with simplistic and idealized view of many positive efforts by soldiers such that Iraqis should apparently have little reason to object to occupation. <br /> <br />Arrogant balderdash that is almost entirely myth creation and seeing through rose colored glasses. (If the Pentagon commissioned a book, this would be it.) <br />	2004-09-12

Which is worse; ignorance, poor methodology, or blind hatred? Trifkovic has excess of each. But let's provide examples of both his \\"method\\" (poor historian at best) and specific points that he makes. So much is merely asserted without real evidence that it would take a long book to document and correct all his errors. <br /> <br />Totally anachronistic, he often uses idealized standards of present times - not even practiced today - as a yard stick for Muslim failures. This is combined with totally misleading or falsified information. One example of both is the criticism of the Prophet Muhammad as taking 20% of revenues and booty. This ignores overwhelming evidence and reports of the very modest life style and lack of materialism and greed of the Prophet and also equates what the `state' took as taken by Muhammad when the public funds were used for public benefit. As far as anachronism is concerned - it would have been typical to have used funds for palaces and excesses rather like Saddam or dynasties through the ages. <br /> <br />The slander about Aisha, the child bride, reappears when it has long been known that this type of marriage was common and not consummated until a girl reached physical maturity. Why would this be raised except for slander and attempts to slur what is not understood and hated? <br /> <br />To comment about righteous violence condoned by the Qu'ran shows again both selective use of material neglecting even the immediate surrounding texts that provide conditions (defensive primarily) and limitations (protection for non combatants, protection of environment, protection for dhimmis who have surrendered or been defeated. It also totally neglects a realistic standard of comparison like Deuteronomy or Exodus that condone great violence without comparable limitations. <br /> <br />Sometimes facts are also blatantly wrong. Charity was provided for dhimmis as well as Muslims, and sometimes for other travelers and orphans in particular - not exclusively for Muslims although they were favored objects of charity - as in Christian and Jewish societies that felt \\"charity begins at home\\". <br /> <br />Self righteous critiques of Qur'anic comments on slavery provide a good example of Trifkovic's failures as an historian. He is anachronistic and he  misuses written sources. The 32 mentions of slavery in that book all accept but overwhelmingly encourage humanizing slavery. Freeing slaves gains merit. Owners can be punished for mistreatment. Children of slaves and owners were to be freed (contra Jefferson). This was far ahead of Christian texts and policy until well into the 19th century after thinkers like Hume, forces like the industrial revolution, and Christian idealists became a force for abolition. This is not, of course the full story about practice over the ages, but it is far \\"truer\\" to the realities that the author claims to be Muslim doctrine. <br /> <br />The book is full of exaggerations, lies, false emotional comparisons. He claims massacres in India worse that the Holocaust. Islam in India (despite extremist Hindu nationalist stories recently) is not all about \\"massacres\\". War, death, destruction were much a part of conquest but war often included Hindu allies; Hindus were usually treated as de facto dhimmis after conquest. And there was not state program of genocide. (And what good would conquest and rule be is all economic production was destroyed by genocide?) <br /> <br />Tolerance in Islam has not been practiced up to the standards of its ideals but both the ideals and the practice were generally better than the Christian treatment of either Jews or Muslims (or Catholics of protestants and vice versa) until at least the 17th century. There are still minority communities continuing in the Muslim world - unlike Spain. These have even survived western colonial; rule when the Christians could be felt to be, and sometimes were, traitorous fifth columns. The dhimmis, especially for their times I history, had legal and even economic status far better than the obverse situation and there were very few pogroms. Why does one suppose so many Jews left Spain for the Ottoman Empire and North Africa. Toleration was not ideal, but it was no myth as claimed. <br /> <br />The book is full of assertions few of which withstand honest criticism. It is hateful and indicative of the times (and intellectual standards) that conservative book clubs would support trash with such intellectually vacant notions of \\"multiculturalism\\" and \\"political correctness\\" as the basis for claiming that this book should be seen as daring expose of truth. Ignorance and hate thrive. Anyone with a decent education, whatever their faith, should be embarrassed by such trash. <br />	2004-08-20

Most contemporary and major historical and social questions about Islam are addressed in a manner and from a perspective that is unique with comparisons to American values and practices and just enough history to provide context. <br /> <br />There are some major reasons that disagreement and/or discomfort may be expected that do not reduce the stimulation from reading the book:  <br />(1) There will be some small disagreements on details for historians but there are also many thoughtful perspectives that may be of considerable value even for scholars of the subject.  <br />(2) The comparisons to American principles will seem forced at times both because they relate to an idealized Islam of moderates and because most of us have been strongly conditioned by Islam phobia our entire lives continue to be fed nonsense by those who should know better and often want to divert us from the real policy issues (\\"they attack because they hate our freedoms and way of life\\" as if elections, booze, and bikinis are reason for attack).  <br />(3) He does not address the moralistic antagonism against what Muslims (like Right Christians and others) consider to be lewd and corrupt behavior. <br />(4) There is little about the cultural values regarding family, honor, community that are not parallel to the individualistic, sometimes selfish and egoistic, standards of our own society. (To that degree he somewhat idealizes Americans as well as Muslims). <br />(5) The discussion will seem unfamiliar to those informed only by the media with its obsession with the violent (\\"if it bleeds, it leads\\"), simplification, and historic ignorance and disdain or hatred of Islam.<br /> <br />One who knows and understands Islam will recognize many strengths in this book, not least of which is placing things in what could be called a sociological and historical context. <br /> <br />The book is a striking contrast but certainly no more propagandistic than academic works have almost always had an \\"agenda\\" and can be very misleading. Often the most promoted and best known is very much product of ulterior motives about which many readers with limited alternative sources are naive. There is an intellectual \\"Gresham's Law for pundits it seems. <br /> <br />The ideas, perspectives, comparisons, and examples should all engage a thoughtful reader to better understand Islam and America too. Reading this book with an open mind is enjoyable and time well spent. <br />	2004-08-13

This book is an ESSENTIAL read for everything from Afghanistan to the 9-11 Commission and from Bush to Zinni.  <br /> <br />There will be things that are offensive - often ones that are probably accurate - for everyone except a few soldiers and CIA agents with integrity. Bush failed badly in reaction to 9-11 and both wars and has made enemies like no one before. Both occupations are lose-lose situations where we do not even fully control capital cities and have no surrender and no disarmament of most enemies. Our position in Afghanistan for example is like having some security in Dallas and claiming victory over Texas (about the same size). Worse, now there are two \\"failed states\\" that are magnets, playgrounds, training areas for insurgents - most trainees have been soldiers with an elite special forces (terrorists). Worse, hubris and ignorance of local history and US history are obvious. After years of experience and information available for Afghanistan that was mostly ignored and failing too see that democracy had roots in early England and has been difficult to achieve over 200 years in the US we lost the war and deluded ourselves than we'd immediately force change on ancient ways. (Some might add, not the author, that democracy is in decline here because of oligarchy and reducing civil rights as well as media failures and decline of meaningful debate of alternatives). <br /> <br />Morale courage is lacking and careerism skews reality, criticism, presentation of information right off the tracks. It is war not police action, blood will flow and we react poorly to defend ourselves.  <br /> <br />Bin Laden is not insane or a terrorist but rather a major figure (partly thanks to our responses) who has specific policy objectives that the US still refuses to even consider or debate. He has no desire to convert or dominate the United States; it is a defensive Jihad that wants policies changed (most should be for our own good anyway): (1) US support of apostate, tyrannical, corrupt rulers I  the Muslim world (and hypocrisy about supporting `democracy') (2) support for others attacking Islam in Russia, China, India (3) Occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan (although this presently helps Bin Laden greatly) (4) US and other Western Troops on the Arabian peninsula (the move from Saudi to Qatar fools no one) (5) Stealing Muslim oil by forcing below market prices on producers and (6) Continued strong support for Israel, land grabs, Occupation. (And just what benefits are there of this relationship for the mant detriments - no politician dares ask!  <br /> <br />It has nothing at all do  about attacking the American `way of life' of  `our freedoms' and claiming so is another self delusion leading to failed policy. One might add that the \\"Clash of Civilization\\" discussion is similarly a diversion from facing the real policy issues and their economic basis. The Lewis argument about failure to deal with modernity and rage is equally misleading. Both these popular myths divert attention from specific policy demands and interests and delude us with a `pop' psychology and presumed irrationality of the enemy. <br /> <br />There is a virtue to offending almost everyone equally perhaps is implied hard nosed objectivity and tough mindedness necessary for trying times. But the failure to consider the criticism raised by Bin Laden and the support this generates form even moderate Muslims and third world peoples who have had similar experiences is a mistake. Whatever the source for this formulation, the issues are very real and some shared by other non Muslim nations too. (Remember that until 2001 most terrorist acts against US interests were from Latin America, and many from other parts of the world with the Muslim  world far from in the lead.) <br /> <br />What the author takes as assumed in American interests translates into Oil Politics and Militarism and an Ethic that places American materialism and greed above all else while trying to sustain an unsustainable way of life based on wasting assets and resources. It belies the Christian humanism or social ethic that some Americans claim. <br />	2004-08-04

Simplistic phrases like ?failed state? don?t cut it and their use by diplomats, policy makers, or pundits merely proves their ignorance and/or superficiality. It is usually also evidence that they don?t really care a bit so long as raw materials from these areas make it to world markets. <br /> <br />Many people and a very significant part of the world economy is in this ?unofficial? and shadowlike area. Many depend upon it without even knowing that it exists. (Violent ?terrorism? is our present obsession but not the only storyline to understand much of the world.) <br /> <br />The author is an Anthropologist who has spent considerable time in various no-man?s lands especially in Southern Africa and explains some of the illicit ?order? that keeps things going  in war, borderlands, and general chaos. There are brief comparative references to Latin America as well. The analysis and description is the best I have ever seen in print (much deeper than Kaplan?s Coming Anarchy which might be the nearest comparison although very different in style and with little real analysis). <br /> <br />Perhaps a fifth of the book is telling anecdotes that humanize the book and are relevant but which could be skipped if a reader had little time (these are clearly identified in small print and spacing.) Other readers will find these the most approachable part of the book. <br /> <br />Crime, violence, child soldiers, smuggling, viciousness are here. But so are some means of continuing trade and human relations, some sparks of peace and order and even some hopeful examples of places gradually finding their path back to more civil society. From children living in ?clean? storm drains as family, to unrecognized states formed in areas of noted violence, to gradual reconciliation after war and violence ? there are lessons to be learned and some small ray of hope. <br />	2004-07-23

Why do national figures have to use four letter words on the floor of Congress? Both show a failure of logic based on facts as well as their arrogant hypocrisy. <br />Those in power have been winning the \\"rhetoric wars\\" hands down for too long. (My example rather than Amy's: Despite the Pentagon Crisis report on global \\"climate change\\" the administration and others call it \\"Global Warming\\" and others accept this creating difficulty explain why the Northeast will get colder). \\"Collateral Damage\\" and such are a similar misrepresentations of reality that together with censored reporting, sanitizing war, and killing a few journalists leave the liars in command and enable them to use psych ops even here. Americans are spoon fed pablum while many others are more likely to get better. One international organization of journalists just barely ranked the USA in the top 20 for a \\"free press\\" even as we are reassured time and again about how special we our with our free media. The most effective censorship is self censorship and self deception of those who would count on our free press or -worse yet- Fox and CNN.<br />One need not agree with everything Amy writes to admire her conviction, honesty, and persistence. Even when she is something of a heroine of the story the presentation is about the story not primarily herself. She is very annoying to those in power and those managing the news. Hurray for that! There are so very few who have the integrity to do this and 'corrections' come so late -- just today the LA Times had an article about how the military created a phony photo-op when they tore down Saddam's statue even though many of us knew about this within days, Were more of the press like this we would not see this country destroyed so rapidly by the real enemies - most of whom hold elective office or are Bush appointees! Amy is just as tough on Clinton and Democrats - a non partisan pain in the behind. <br />As Mark Twain said I support my country always, and my government when it deserves it. Amy also is devoted to the principle that one human being has value much as another - something that used to be taught by various Faiths. Without journalists like this we'd never have an inkling of when support of the government should be withheld or its policies adamantly challenged.	2004-07-04

How history has been abused time and again to encourage hate as a tool for politicians and `true believers' is a repeated, sad, but interesting tale. The mirror images of polluting and demonic \\"other\\" are drawn with quotations and local `color' as are battle scenes and key characters on both sides. Changing understandings and emotional impact of terms like 'Crusade' and 'Jihad' are noted. At least until very recent history the author provides a well balanced story with focus on `hot spots' like Andalusia; the Levant; the Balkans, while including some of North Africa and other conflicts. This book is 100 times better than the likes of &quot;Jihad&quot; by Fergosi and may be well complemented by books like Fletcher's recent book, &quot;Cross and Crescent&quot;. <br />One of the most common and often serious fallacies writing about Islam is to generalize from the less than 20% who are Arabs or the perhaps 40% who are in the greater Middle East. (The author has also written on the Ottomans.) This book holds up well because it provides a \\"why?\\" for the relationships that enlightens whether reading about centuries ago in Spain or recently in Serbia. One might disagree with some of the conclusions about current events, but the book remains valuable for readers.	2004-06-26

As a kid I used to read through the World Book Encyclopedia; this book provides the same kind a service and sometimes excitement for selected important ideas that have \\"changed the world\\". <br />Brief, concise, pointed sketches of important ideas are on target for their selection and coverage. Perhaps far from perfect, but there is nothing else nearly as good. Selected notes direct one to books to purse any idea further. Many ideas will be familiar and the short essays and photos may stimulate memories or reflection. A few will be new - or commonly misunderstood. Either way the open minded reader will learn something and be stimulated.

Who \\"gets away with murder\\"? <br />This is a wonderful \\"read\\". Sketches of Mike Spann (CIA hero and casualty), Lindh (the American Taliban), and O'Neill (the terror expert who might have made the difference) grab the reader as much as a well documented  discussion of the Bush administration's questionable role bargaining with the Taliban; responding ineffectually immediately after 9-11; screwing up their case against Lindh.<br />Given the total naiveté of young recruits sequestered in the Indian Ocean on ship and brainwashed about Saddam's role sponsoring 9-11 (a total myth), one might buy the notion that Lindh was a naïve, confused, idealist looking for clarity and Faith. Spann, a hero, may have been equally naïve and equally expendable to his government. War in Afghanistan was planned before 9-11 and the decision to attack Iraq was made in the first weeks of the Bush administration. The rest, as becomes increasingly clear, was \\"smoke and mirrors\\" (to put it kindly).<br />You can decide just who (several parties maybe) \\"got away with murder.\\"<br />Any book on current events will prove to have some errors. Here, aside from a proof reader who uses the Buddhist `sutra' for the Muslim `surah' there are a couple worth mentioning. The evidence that George Bush before the Gulf War hoodwinked the Saudis and the public about the satellite photos showing immanent Iraqi invasion - to get their support and American bases in Saudi Arabia (a key critical bin Laden `cause') - is now very convincing and includes satellite photos showing no such thing and the government's failure to produce or even show their evidence `off the record.' Salafiya is not identical to Wahabism as is implied. Nevertheless the story is compelling, great reading, and makes one think.	2004-06-20

Most obvious is the discussion of Fundamentalists not qualified as Alim (Ulema) to provide authoritative opinion. Further, there is nothing that speaks to how widely accepted such positions are which leaves the reader with his or her own biases to jump to conclusions. Lastly there is a bias from the `construction' of the work itself because the theory is tested against practice for cases like Saddam but not for any Christians who have been compared for \\"just war\\" theory. Perhaps this is because George Bush never directly justified his actions - or the lies and disinformation to get support for the first Gulf War - by any such theory. To that degree the it is misleading, the \\"comparative ethics\\" does not hold the feet of the West to the fire at all for contemporary events despite \\"The Gulf War and Beyond\\" in the subtitle.<br />That said, Kelsay has provided a thoughtful and useful work that should be read more widely. It will feed negative bias for the reasons mentioned above but remains not only competent but interesting as well. The comparison of Iran and Iraq positions during their war with each other is a reminder that values matter even when considering bombing cities and treating prisoners. Early attempts to determine the nature and status of irregulars refers to the American Civil War and Southern irregulars. The treatment of the Kuwait invasion is less helpful and is one sided (and would have offered interesting comparative perspective with the Panama invasion shortly before).	2004-06-18

He does a better job of reviewing authors who mislead and may not &quot;think for themselves&quot; clearly than thouroughly living up to the subtitle about &quot;why Americans (generally?)don't think for themselves&quot;. <br />Because the situation is deteriorating rapidly with multimedia replacing thoughtful reading; job training replacing liberal education; professional business/law win-at-all-costs replacing most ethics and humanism; and language itself losing cogency the topics he essays are critical indeed. White also, as ome example, has the guts to tell us the impolite reality that we enjoy the fruits of materialism at the expense of many disadvantaged in the world - directly at their expense more than we think. (The American child's problem is often obesity and boredom and attention deficit syndrome when nearly half the world lives on less than $2 a day and children are malnourished. Fact not liberal softheadedness.)<br />A worthy effort worth revision; the Truths herein deserve it.	2004-06-02

The loss of language, reason, and meaningful education that results is a disaster. Yet I would not trust the author on her on subject - history - where she both overcompensates and shows Americanist and Euro centric bias bordering on ignorance about many basics of non-Western civilizations. She is both a deft critic and, ironically, an example of why some of the assertions cultural bias have taken a linguistic turn. All in all the destruction of logic and imagination as well as the boredom it can create regarding reading justify thoughtful consideration of her argument despite her limited perspective on other civilizations and incipient chauvinism.	2004-06-02

There is more wisdom and truth here than in the dry high school textbooks that were the last history that many have read (neither rates 100% but Vidal is MUCH better).<br />The first and last essays alone are well worth the price of the book. Unlike certain policy makers today (almost all 'Chickenhawks') Vidal served in the military; unlike most (including a certain 'gentleman C student and-proud-of-it) Vidal knows his history. You may not agree but you should always find him thought provoking. <br />When the US is something like 25th in reading (despite the benefits of great English literature and many choices) this should be first on the list before the military history and heroes of myth. Unlike many books today it is the truth here that will both disturb and enchant.<br />It is a thoughtless, uninformed, superficial reading that would dismiss the some arguments as anti-Semitic or ideological and it is the early democratic spirit of the country not Marxism that informs his judgments. Thinking about the comments of Franklin, Jefferson, Adams quoted herein should make that clear.

People want a single book, or at least a single author to rely on. Lewis should NOT be the one. <br />Lewis also over generalizes when it is convenient to his agenda and largely ignores over half the Muslim world that is Asian. As an \\"Orientalist\\" his tendency to conclude - rather ahistorically - that various things Islamic are implicit essential `drives' of Islam is picked up by others wanting simple and quick answers and \\"wisdom\\".<br />Especially with modern subjects of the last century or two and topics concerning Israel or US Policy his bias is all too apt to become propaganda and lies of omission. Most of the \\"good\\" things that he has to write about Islam that might at first appear to contradict this conclusion are about the remote past and classical age of Islam. Even here is easily coaxed into misleading comments like those concerning the Assassins of the Middle Ages as roots of suicide bombers and terrorism.<br />A few examples follow: An essay on the foundations of Israel makes no mention of the King David Hotel, Irgun, Dier Yassin or Israeli terrorism of any kind. An essay on the first Gulf War repeats what are known to be lies about Saddam's readiness to invade Saudi (the US never showed the claimed satellite photos of hundreds of thousands of troops and independent satellite photos showed no such thing) that was the basis for US bases in Saudi. The Iranian revolution would appear to have been planned and managed solely by Khomeni entirely as a Fundamentalist revolution - which we know not to have been the case and which suggests numerous false conclusions. Discussing Islam and the West he somehow overlooks the essential example of Muhammad Ali (one should read Juan Cole's critique of \\"What Went Wrong?\\" on line also). The US is not \\"Imperialist\\" because Lewis defines the term narrowly while ignoring that the US has bases in 70% of the countries in the world as well as considerablecontrol through the IMF and World Bank. <br />The infamous essay on Muslim \\"Rage\\" is simplistic sociology and horrid generalization that makes something specific to a time and place appear to be the essence of Islam exaggerating a tendency beyond recognition and excusing any responsibility of US policy (Huntington and others have made absurd further generalizations from this and it has driven some of US policy - a good example of the non expert relying almost exclusively on a highly slanted Lewis essay). He certainly knows better but leaves a reader thinking that traditionalist and fundamentalist are the same. The screed about attacks on 9-11 were because \\"they\\" hate our freedoms and way of life ignores the symbolic selection of the showcase financial and military control targets central to US policies rather than an attempt to take the most lives. Nor do any people organize attacks for such reasons alone. The US has still not seriously examined its policies as motivation for the attacks. Analogous to this is the \\"clash\\" argument that totally ignores the economic and military imperatives of US policies as well as any reexamination of the support for Israel. Lewis is not alone responsible for this but has been commonly used by those happy with this approach.<br />Lewis even goes so far - failing the `laugh' test - as to suggest that the US is a largely impartial broker regarding the Palestinian issue. In doing so he inflates Israeli pride and ignores numerous inconvenient facts. That Israel on a per capita basis gets nearly ten times the US aid of the next country (Egypt) is perhaps not so important as additional favoritism, sharing military information, newer technology, intelligence and support for Israel against the UN and world community with its considerable nuclear arsenal of weapons of mass destruction on land, air, and sea. Nor are Likudniks advising the President an issue for Lewis although Perle even recommended policies of aggression, settlement, and thumbing its nose at the world community. <br />Essays on the very early period tend to be better, the two on the Fatimids are quite good. Reasonable people may disagree but his promoters exaggerate more than a little to call Lewis a national `treasure' when he may be more a national `danger'. I'm awed at his knowledge and shocked by his abuse of it.	2004-05-24

The Iranian Revolution was totally unexpected before it happened. It is difficult to fathom this essential truth after the fact. The Shah had the military and secret service as well as wealth to put down any revolution it was assumed. In any case material progress and modernization were moving ahead to provide benefits and quell discontent. The Revolution didn't care! It came anyway. But it could not be predicted by any of the social sciences: economics, political science, sociology, etc. Nor by religion. <br />Kurzman, himself a Sociologist, uses each chapter to apply these disciplinary viewpoints and show their limitations in explaining events. Circumstances, and personal decisions, became crucial when enough people changed their own expectations to believe that revolution might really be possible - to think the unthinkable.. Khomeini was critical for this but as a catalyst for various grievances both liberal and revolutionary to seem to have a chance of success.<br />Close examination in each chapter show anomalies, confusion, lack of central control. Culture contributed but was remade in the process. Shi'a religious organization gave it some coordination and direction lacking for many other elements but can not be said to be solely responsible for the revolution.<br />Two important corollaries follow from this, although Kurzman makes little of either.<br />First the Fundamentalist Iranian Revolution is not the Bogeyman that many see. It inspired enthusiasm among some Muslims in various parts of the world but was not a model to be copied. It was not \\"typical\\" of Islam (among other things Iran was Shi'a with a somewhat unique religious elite unlike Ulema or Sufis elsewhere). There were many motives and supporters that were practical and not `religious'. US antipathy is more a knee jerk reaction than based on understanding of Iran or of Islam. <br />Also it is clear that the various social sciences and traditional approaches to explaining revolution need History -each situation is unique and \\"unthinkable\\" before it happens; there exist not sufficient \\"laws\\" to predict revolution. None of the disciplinary approaches hold together without history too.<br />Kurzman's book is interesting therefore in numerous ways: the description of the Revolution; the acts and thoughts of individual participants; the anomalies and limitations of causation theory of various social sciences. The policy implications are consequential and should not be ignored.	2004-05-19

This is the best of the forty or so books I have read recently on the results of recent US foreign policy, on forms of political Islam, on the roots and character of terror, as well as on common misperceptions. Chapter two on \\"Culture Talk\\" is itself worth the price of the book. The origins of our enemies in US policy, CIA training, even University of Nebraska contracted textbooks is damaging to the myths supporting US policies now.<br />Discussion is painfully frank, honest, and thought provoking. Some will be unwilling to face this.<br />The origins of the worst may be in the Reagan era and now with this preemptive war but Carter and Clinton's errors are noted in what is a constructive rather than partisan analysis.<br />The types and motives of political Islam is a useful antidote to the simplistic poisonous tripe so common from the Media and the Administration and even scholars who should know better like Lewis and Huntington.<br />The summary of major costs of the focal Afghan War include, and continue to include, eroding democracy at home; US blowback from the creation of international trained and experienced terrorist Alumni; dramatic increases in Drug trade and users from financing methods of the wars; increased incoherence and decreased communication between the CIA and FBI. One can add that Press self censorship and complicity recently rated the US as not in the top 20 world wide for having a \\"free Press.\\" The author does not mention that after first disarming then attacking Iraq the US `bully' inadvertently makes a case for nukes for all for some deterrent (remember that word?).<br />The analysis of an commonality of irrational interest with Israel as another settler state and the discussion of the nature of suicide bombing will upset assumptions widely held but deserve thoughtful consideration.<br />Read this book! More importantly, THINK about what is said. Definitely worth buying. I'm giving a copy to the local library too!	2004-05-17

The book and thesis are essentially sophomoric simplification that seems to have impressed (from plaudits printed inside) numerous other unqualified readers who know the subject no better. It meets emotional needs for some but adds no depth of understanding..<br />The thesis is a defense of aggression based on little more that Pop Psychology about totalitarianism and \\"suicidal\\" violence - referring to Camus but lacking his broader understanding. Broad categories and labels are grotesquely inaccurate lumping Islamic Fundamentalists together and describing them as Fascist and Totalitarian. There is considerable diversity in the real world with some ready to participate in elections, and most who are not terrorists. Many are concerned almost exclusively with their own homelands. In the case of Iraq a secular, anti Fundamentalist, enemy of Al Qaeda was the US target. Consider too that there are proportionally probably more Christian Fundamentalists in the US than Muslim ones outside Saudi and Afghanistan. The history (including questionable conclusions describing the fall of France to the Nazis as solely from \\"liberal/socialist\\" lack of backbone) and psychology (sex, suicide, and totalitarianism are a syndrome) are not valid. They do, however, serve as propaganda demonizing Muslims in support of US and Israeli state counter terror. Again they provide a reason to avoid looking at the real issues and grievances resulting from those policies or the essential source of terror training and broad contacts from the CIA and ISI trained alumni of the Afghan-US war against the Soviets in Central Asia. (These are the folks whose leaders trained in the US and who were called, like the Contras, \\"the moral equivalent of our founding Fathers\\" by Reagan!) At least Berman's book it is not quite the insult to one's intelligence as explaining 9-11 by \\"they are jealousof our freedoms\\" but it is just as muddled thinking and equally motivated by propaganda rather than serious analysis - just this time for a book rather than a sound bite.	2004-05-17

There are many adults who would profit from the book, its outlines, and its suggestions for further reading. It is a conspicuous gap in the education of most people.<br />The level of discussion and debate regarding world history and Islam would be greatly improved if this were in the hands of every person who proposes to write or speak about Islam - Preacher, Politician, Pundit, Rabbi, or Journalist.<br />The main limitation for this purpose is that it does not deal directly with current events beyond background on topics like women in Islam and that its discussion of law is limited mostly to basics of the Shari'a. But it does very well what it sets out to do considering issues of understanding world history in terms of a very relevant example of Islamic history. Although published in 1994 it is not outdated (except for additions to the bibliography which remains useful) and perhaps more sound for not being obsessed with events and conflict since 2001.	2004-02-19

March 12, 2003 <BR>Expertise does not always produce wisdom, whether or not there is a definite agenda. Pollack has expertise and an agenda -- without the wisdom and honesty required to make the case compelling. <BR>For example, can we trust casualty discussions when he uses knowingly low and outdated figures for Iraqi civilian deaths &quot;by sanctions&quot; (the US admitted to about 500,000 children under age 5 already by 1996) and neglects detailing the US active role in withholding many medical necessities after bombing 7 of 8 major damns and water purification plants? He plays down casualties of the first war - both theirs and 'ours' with nearly a third of our veterans on disability as well as nearly 11,000 of our troops dead from toxics and depleted uranium. Nor is he entirely forthcoming about the different war on their homeland and in cities that might well claim many more American lives. His focus does not, of course, require discussion of terrorism in the US in response to invasion. There is no wisdom without honest perspective! <br />The case for democracy in Iraq is patently absurd! The US has never done it, no one knows how to impose democracy, Iraq is not a 'unitary' state like McArthur's Japan with the Emperor in place, military results in Afghanistan are certainly no political victory in this regard. Nor is it at all clear that the US would want democracy when controllable friendly autocrats and dictators have always been prefered.<br />Except perhaps on invaders the chemical and biological weapons are of little use without terrorist cells that would have been used before now if Saddam were not primarily interested in his own survival - our defenses were lower before 9/11 and there was plenty of motive after the first war. Ignore that the Anthrax came from the US - both when usedhere and a strain held by Saddam. Nuclear weapons are no threat to the US with missiles that barely travel over 100 miles (except for those who include Israel as the 51st state?). In a short review one can not thoroughly counter each argument of a long book. The greatest strength of the book is that it does - however onesidedly - draw out details of the case. This is the strength and also the weakness of Pollack's book. <br />It is not only about oil, but strategy and hegemony. Opponents who point out Cheney will get richer rebuilding Iraq fields as he and his company did in Kuwait, don't look ahead far enough. Oil is a serious issue both because of huge needs growing and the unrealiability of Saudi supply in the future.<br />The US needs to find solutions to the three biggest problems of policy: nuclear proliferation; terrorism; secure oil and water supplies -- none can be done unilaterally or even by brazen military means alone. Pollack's case, and the administration's, largely ignore the real issues and rush to military solutions that make problems ultimately worse from immense disorder and blowback. They nuture conditions and hatred for more terrorists too. This unilateralism is revolutionary change in foreign policy when multilateralism is more needed than ever however frustrating this may be to the world hyperpower. Pollack does not see that far and 'buys' a military solution to what is not primarily a military problem. I don't think he is able to 'sell' it.	2004-02-11

It thoughtfully and convincingly argues that Europe was no more advanced or likely to develop hegemony or capitalism in 1491 than many other areas. New World precious metals, extreme profitability of capital accumulation aided by depopulation from new diseases and Europe's weapons technology (terror and depopulation) was an accident of history resulting from relative ease of nautical proximity and conquest. The implications for rewriting and understanding world history, before 1492, and after are staggering and properly humbling for Eurocentric triumphalists claiming unique superiority from and for all times. Some 40% of the short book is critiques from other scholars two largely in support and two who differ. One may choose to read these or not.

It is a necessary antidote to all the simplifications and hidden agendas in the press, policy, and publications by &quot;popular&quot; writers on Islam who so often seem driven by hate, profits, or noteriety. Read here to reconsider the &quot;Huntington Thesis&quot; and it Lewis 'roots'. Reflect on the implications for Bush's &quot;Crusade&quot;. The essay on Christian Serb terrorism and the manipulation of hatred is valuable for its general lessons as well. How think tanks and best sellers sway policy among those with limited depth of knowlege is worth considering -- especially when there seems to be an intellectual &quot;Gresham's Law&quot; of punditry. The continued importance of history and memory is highlighted. A variety of authors with considerable knowlege and depth offer valuable insights into where we are and how we got there - about myths and reality that are central to the what has been dubbed &quot;the war on terror&quot; and is often seen by Muslims with some justification as a &quot;war on Islam&quot; -- a Crusade.	2004-02-01

Assumptions have been the basis for war and bigotry. Rarely are the common assumptions correct; rarer still is there enough understanding of context to provide meaningful discussion. This is particularly obvious when I read a book the first week of July and see that it has not been reviewed on Amazon until September 3rd. Pundits who continue in error when this is available to read don't deserve to &quot;pund&quot;. The same applies to journalists, talk show hosts, of government decision makers. The blind lead the blind. The perceptive reader might even wonder if these Muslims might see the &quot;war on terror&quot; as a Crusade against Islam? What has been assumed to be motivating Muslims is nearly always wrong; generalities about jealousy, hate, world conquest are almost laughable when attitudes are researched and understood. Muslims have enough problems and issues 'at home' but have some community awareness and may be ready to defend their Faith when attacked.<br />This book desrves five stars not for its readability, although it is sufficiently clear, but for its 'scientific' content that is needed to fill a huge void.<br />Careful interviews of some 4000 Muslims in four countries highlights differences and similarities that will surprise even some Muslims and provide a basis of hard 'fact' for those who claim to tell us about the Muslim world. It is a good start. The four countries are Indonesia, Pakistan, Kazakstan, and Egypt. This is a reminder that most Muslims are Asians not Arabs. It also has the special case of Kazakstan where Islam was brutally surpressed for several generations under Communist rule. The attitudes and values studied include those about religion and practice; about family and civil society; about politics; and more. Designed by a Muslim scholar trained in the social sciences the inquiry is well designed while the research remains on target to undertand Muslim concerns.<br />A summary of contents would npt do it justice.

It is not fair for a reviewer to criticize a book for what is missing, unless it is central and critical to the argument as here.<br />Firestone does well but is not \\"there\\". He describes views from nearly pacifist, to acceptance of self-defense, to justification of warfare (initially with Muslim, Jewish, and Pagan coalition of Medina against Mecca). He relates this to the growing growth of community sense of the Umma displacing ancient tribal allegiances. He argues that the energy of blood feuds, traditional raiding that was part of Arab culture of the age, and material need coalesced with a new religious identity to concentrate and redirect warfare. He implies, without much discussion or evidence, that this created a new religious aggressive warfare and ideology - although early in the book he does acknowledge those aspects that put personal striving to fight evil in ones own character as the `greater' Jihad and warfare as the `lesser' Jihad.<br />The failure is that he does not address the critical issues, critical in terms of his own argument about community and warfare, adequately. He does not discuss the deterioration of relations with Jewish tribes that were allies one after another or how the imagined orthodox aggressive ideology became consolidated as he implies. The potential evidence for this analysis for this is not much different than that he uses for the rest of the book. He does recognize that Muhammad was not himself particularly aggressive by nature but also neglects to attempt explanation of his admirable self restraint and restraint of his followers upon capturing Mecca.<br />The book is incomplete. But it is still worth reading and much better than the polemical multitude of works that claim Islam to be implicitly aggressive and evil. (One note in an early chapter points out that of 274 wars from 1484 to1945 two thirds were in Christian Europe alone with few in the remainder of the world  outside Europe - 187 to 91.)	2004-01-23

This is not the pabulum and propaganda of most of the press and right wing think tanks or corporate media but rather a tough minded well documented and truly scary reality that most would prefer to ignore -- at their own risk. The American Empire of Bases, hidden expenses and private corporate military contracts, together with a plethora of lies make for mass hallucination that has but an inkling of truth. One chapter could stand on its own as a great description of recent economic and military history &quot;What Happened to Globalization?&quot;. The chapter also effectively highlights how mythological is the &quot;free market capitalism&quot; that is ideology and far from reality. It is clear that the problem is not new - but also that is far worse than ever with the megalomaniac boy emperor and his irresponsible quest that is destroying everything from the Constitution to the economy. The practical first step - not mentioned directly by Johnson - is to get Bush out of office and work for major restoration of the promise of America for the people and the world rather than a few oil and war profiteers. Wake up! Pray there is still time to restore our country! Johnson does not say it in so many words but it becomes clear that no one has done more to make enemies and reduce our security than this President and his administration. After reading this one is not likely to be a total 'sucker' like Goering's public that could be manipulated by freaking people out about their enemies abroad and calling anyone who disagrees unpatriotic or traitorous.	2004-01-16

This is a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone approaching an understanding of Islam as religion, as &quot;enemy&quot;, or as a topic in the news. Most journalists and politicians would vastly better understand themselves and Islam as well as have more MATURE thinking about the issues by reading this essay. Those who claim to be &quot;well educated&quot; are so often ignorantly reacting to caricatures (this includes nearly all leaders and 'experts'). This volume is unique, useful, and a compelling readable discussion of how to think about religion, Islam, and the issues in the news. It is easy to read and has much to say rather than being a catalog, description, history, or polemic. READ IT AND THINK!	2003-12-07

With the many speeches, the Press, the pundits, and the American agression against Muslim \\"terrorists\\", we have yet to see \\"reality\\" or \\"truth\\" about Muslims and their views. Assumptions have been the basis for war and bigotry. Rarely are the common assumptions correct; rarer still is there enough understanding of context to provide meaningful discussion.  This is particularly obvious when I read a book the first week of July and see that it has not been reviewed on Amazon until September 3rd. Pundits who continue in error when this is available to read don't deserve to \\"pund\\". The same applies to journalists, talk show hosts, of government decision makers. The blind lead the blind. The perceptive reader might even wonder if these Muslims might see the \\"war on terror\\" as a Crusade against Islam? What has been assumed to be motivating Muslims is nearly always wrong; generalities about jealousy, hate, world conquest are almost laughable when attitudes are researched and understood. Muslims have enough problems and issues 'at home' but have some community awareness and may be ready to defend their Faith when attacked.<br />This book desrves five stars not for its readability, although it is sufficiently clear, but for its 'scientific' content that is needed to fill a huge void.<br />Careful interviews of some 4000 Muslims in four countries highlights differences and similarities that will surprise even some Muslims and provide a basis of hard 'fact' for those who claim to tell us about the Muslim world. It is a good start. The four countries are Indonesia, Pakistan, Kazakstan, and Egypt. This is a reminder that most Muslims are Asians not Arabs. It also has the special case of Kazakstan where Islam was brutally surpressed for several generations under Communist rule. The attitudes and values studied include those about religion and practice; about family and civil society; about politics; and more. Designed by a Muslim scholar trained in the social sciences the inquiryis well designed while the research remains on target to undertand Muslim concerns.<br />A summary of contents would npt do it justice. It should be read!	2003-09-02

This is a short, powerful, interesting and IMPORTANT book. The text is only 69 pages and says more, more clearly than the likes of Lewis's latest books. The notes and annotated bibliography are also well worthwhile. Former Ambassador to Pakistan and now a Professor, Simmons has a modern, US viewpoint but understands that social, economic, and political analysis explains more than blaming everything on &quot;Islam&quot;. There is some useful information and a thoughtful argument about recent history and what is now going on. One need not agree entirely to learn, to think, to better understand. Everyone interested in world affairs today would do well to invest in this book. However short it has great value; a book should not be judged by its cover -- or its length. Some may also find the comparisons, like that of Russia in the 1870s to Islam in the 1970's provide perspective.<br />Those who know the Muslim world well might have liked a little more on non-Fundamentalist discourse or reminders about the glory days; others might be surprised how much is explained without much discussion of the (important) Arab-Israeli conflict.<br />Thoughtful and refreshing reading.	2003-07-12

The book version includes some interesting information and one useful wake up call needed by some...the world is not going to become a modern carbon copy of the West and \\"westernization\\" is not a prerequisite to \\"modernization\\". <br />Some readers will also be disturbed by the observations about declining relative numbers and importance of the \\"West\\". This and the comments about civilizations learning to get along earn a couple stars. <br />The main thesis about the clash of civilizations (something of a tautology) and bigotted view of Islam are not even well supported by the book's own evidence and logic. The final scenario of war with China is more frightening and no better documented. <br />That many would read and accept the essentially anti-Islamic views here without a more critical analysis does not reflect well on the quality of public discourse, or general education, either. A footnote in the book notes that the most criticized part of the article was the part about \\"Islam's bloody borders\\" but the book does not show serious reevaluation. The sources are very limited stacked against Islam - the very fact that they imply something innate, violent, and general for Islam is right up there with explaining Hitler's 1000 year Reich, Stalin the Seminarian, and Irish terrorism as implicit in the nature of Christianity. <br />It gets worse. Many of the 'bloody' Muslim countries are victims not originators of the violence (manipulation of Serbian Orthodox myths to generate hate and 'justify' ethnic cleansing is a dramatic example,Indian pogroms against Muslims and occupation of Paletine are others). The argument for 'militarism' then uses statistics about ratios of men 'under arms' in Muslim countries as 'evidence' without weighting for autocratic and unelected rulers armed to retain power and without reference to 'intent' or actual use of the military. The US ratio is lower (and unmentioned Israel has higher ratios too) but the superior technology trumps mere numbers of troops as an indicator of potential. And the record for attacks and bombings (at least 40 countries since World War II and bases in more than 100 contries) suggest the US to be far more 'violent' in terms that make more sense than Huntington's and mawk his argument. <br />Of course with the \\"red Evil Empire\\" gone a \\"green\\" one serves many useful purposes for the Pentagon and budget battles. As Huntington points out nations find identity in opposition to the 'other'. Not that missles have any real value against a few terrorists of course. Nor should the emerging US role as the greatest dealer in the Arms trade be mentioned by Huntington (certainly there is no reference to the Carlye Group and the senior Bush's role). Lack of better perspective amounts to lack of honesty even if it pleases Huntington's wealthy backers. The \\"Clash\\" was written before 9-11 but has, despite its sloppy reasoning and Right Wing funding, been well recieved as further justification for forgone conclusions. <br />'Denial' is not just 'a river in Egypt' it continues to be the state of public discourse in the US that has not begun to fathom the real reasons behind 9-11 or how removing some of the causes might help produce greater security and more justice. The US prefers to spend $80 billion to destroy a country with a total military budget of about $1.4 billion. Arms and Oil industries prosper, people die for their benefit. US security is diminished and its values are undermined. Huntington is not, at least in this book, a \\"neocon\\" but he has contributed to their cause.	2003-06-30

To do this about a politically sensitive subject where attitudes contribute to deaths is worse. However after 9-11 the book will sell, especially to those looking for quick answers.<br />Taking advantage of the general ignorance, fear, and bias, of the public using one's reputation to provide a misleading appearance of objectivity and balance is fundamentally dishonest. It is truer to Lewis's own biases than his facts.<br />Too harsh on Lewis? Two things suggest that I'm not too harsh at all. First, this work is an opportunistic post 9-11 update on his 1990 article in the New Yorker about \\"Muslim Rage\\". Second, his bizarre claims about Jerusalem are inexcusable given his knowledge of the Middle East. <br />\\"Anger\\" is possibly reasoned, circumstantial, particular to a number of individuals. But Lewis chose to write about \\"Muslim Rage\\" irrational, endemic, violent, unjustified, innate in a whole people. Nonsense! Yet lapped up then, quoted as authoritative by the likes of Samuel Huntington as an example of the \\"Clash of Civilizations\\", and continuing to serve as generalized, simplistic, unfair, and misleading - it has been satisfying for those wanting a 'quick fix' answer. This is Gresham's Law applied to the public discourse rather than the economy. It allows denial of real causes and reasons, political, economic, social, and military.<br />The particular bizarre pro Israeli (and not even all Israelis would agree) discussion of Jerusalem is damning. Describing Al Aqsa Mosque with its monotheistic quotations from the Qur'an on its exterior as anti-Christian propaganda, Lewis promotes Jerusalem as a Jewish and Christian city not holy to Muslims. He ignores (what he certainly knows) that Muslims first prayed towards Jerusalem as the primordial center of Abrahamic faiths. He also ignores that the most celebrated nights of the year commemorates the Miraj when Muhammad traveled from Mecca to the site of Al Aqsa to ascend to the heavens and the presence of Allah (literally or as metaphor). <br />The impression one gets is that Muslims are mostly all like a small minority of radical extremists who rage against the West and that this is innate in Islam. (The morality of terrorism of the powerless versus mass killing by the more efficient airborne military is another subject entirely.) The fact that terrorists are few, that their causes are usually particular and political, that they are not widely supported is appreciated in the epithet \\"unholy\\" terror, but the analysis goes little beyond simplistic notions about an anti modern backward people humiliated by Western superiority and jealous of its position. This allows a state of denial rejecting that much is anger, not rage, and based on legitimate grievances using the methods of the weak against overwhelmingly superior military power. Particulars of quoting bin Laden or describing the Wahabis do little to diminish the mass condemnation of Islam in this book.<br />Most Muslims don't feel morally inferior because the West is materially better off and militarily strong. They are not jealous of the materialistic extremes of the West. For most a return to fundamentals is renewal of Faith and self purification, a personal and patient quest. (This is the \\"greater Jihad\\" not warfare which is the \\"lesser Jihad.\\") Muslims call, ask, others to see the wisdom of their faith and don't in theory or practice command violent world conquest as suggested by Lewis. One reverts to Islam as the primordial Faith with the same God and many Prophets shared with Christians and Jews who may, with righteous and God fearing lives be saved. (Neither of these Faiths allows this for Muslims.) Both times the Muslims took Jerusalem they were far more tolerant and less violent than the Crusaders. The image of violent conquest and forced conversions is outrageous given what we know of history - but it always underlies the attempts to paint Islam as innately violent. ( \\"Modern\\" Christians the 20th century have been far more warlike and perpetrated mass genocide and slaughter on a scale unknown even to the (pre-Muslim) Mongols.) Muslims don't draw the conclusion that this is the very nature of Christianity however.<br />Until historically recent times Islam was more tolerant than the (now secular) West. Even now tolerance continues to be fragile and racism common in the West. Islam has continued to be doctrinally and to a considerable degree in practice, less racist, color conscious, and elitist than the West. It had none of the problems with science, having earth as less than the center of the universe, etc. that held back the West. The current problems and anger are not so much as innate to Arabs or Islam as a product of historical experience. They are not innate to Islam.<br />Lewis reinforces bigotry but adds no understanding for anyone with meaningful knowledge of Islam or the Middle East. In a vacuum he seems profound, some with an agenda will like the book. Real understanding, balance, something closer to truth all lose out. He certainly does nothing to understand 9-11 or avoid further terrorism.	2003-06-30

Expertise does not always produce wisdom, whether or not there is a definite agenda. Pollack has expertise and an agenda -- without the wisdom and honesty required to make the case compelling. <br />For example, can we trust casualty discussions when he uses knowingly low and outdated figures for Iraqi civilian deaths \\"by sanctions\\" (the US admitted to about 500,000 children under age 5 already by 1996) and neglects detailing the US active role in withholding many medical necessities after bombing 7 of 8 major damns and water purification plants? He plays down casualties of the first war - both theirs and 'ours' with nearly a third of our veterans on disability as well as nearly 11,000 of our troops dead from toxics and depleted uranium. Nor is he entirely forthcoming about the different war on their homeland and in cities that might well claim many more American lives. His focus does not, of course, require discussion of terrorism in the US in response to invasion. There is no wisdom without honest perspective! <br />The case for democracy in Iraq is patently absurd! The US has never done it, no one knows how to impose democracy, Iraq is not a 'unitary' state like McArthur's Japan with the Emperor in place, military results in Afghanistan are certainly no political victory in this regard. Nor is it at all clear that the US would want democracy when controllable friendly autocrats and dictators have always been prefered.<br />Except perhaps on invaders the chemical and biological weapons are of little use without terrorist cells that would have been used before now if Saddam were not primarily interested in his own survival - our defenses were lower before 9/11 and there was plenty of motive after the first war. Ignore that the Anthrax came from the US - both when used here and a strain held by Saddam. Nuclear weapons are no threat to the US with missiles that barely travel over 100 miles (except for those who include Israel as the 51st state?). In a short review one can not thoroughly counter each argument of a long book. The greatest strength of the book is that it does - however onesidedly - draw out details of the case. This is the strength and also the weakness of Pollack's book. <br />It is not only about oil, but strategy and hegemony. Opponents who point out Cheney will get richer rebuilding Iraq fields as he and his company did in Kuwait, don't look ahead far enough. Oil is a serious issue both because of huge needs growing and the unrealiability of Saudi supply in the future.<br />The US needs to find solutions to the three biggest problems of policy: nuclear proliferation; terrorism; secure oil and water supplies -- none can be done unilaterally or even by brazen military means alone. Pollack's case, and the administration's, largely ignore the real issues and rush to military solutions that make problems ultimately worse from immense disorder and blowback. They nuture conditions and hatred for more terrorists too. This unilateralism is revolutionary change in foreign policy when multilateralism is more needed than ever however frustrating this may be to the world hyperpower. Pollack does not see that far and 'buys' a military solution to what is not primarily a military problem. I don't think he is able to 'sell' it.	2003-03-12

But there are many problems. Focus intensely on \\"jihad\\" starts with exaggerated assumptions about violence and deempahasizes the legitimate relations with dhimmis; this is exaggerated partly because of the two extremist incursions by Berber dynasties. This failure also derives superficial understanding of Islam and from 'listenening' to polemics rooted in early European fear and hatred of Islam and the Crusades and revived by post Nazi visions of persecution of religious minorities and genocide. <br />If one wrote a recent military history of the US it would have to include the only use of Nuclear Weapons on civilians and bombing more than 20 countries since WWII.If it added 'evidence' of hymns like \\"Onward Christian Soldiers\\" as further evidence of a violent civilization it would be rather like this book - which is sometimes nearly that crude. The conclusions about violence whether originally from the author or the publicist (one suspects that more books were sold with such a 'spin') are not warranted by the evidence (even that in the book) and even less supported by a broad knowlege of Islamic history. Part of the problem is that things are explained by 'religion' when religion was often merely a rationalization for political, economic, social, and strategic objectives. Part of the problem is shallowness from limited understanding of Islam in other places and other times. (More people probably became Muslims because of trade and cultural influences than from conquest worldwide. Most Muslims do not live in the middle East but in Sotheast Asia and in South Asia; there are more in china than numerous countries in the Middle East and North Africa.)<br />The sources the author uses are not well selected, nor as current, as they should be. Even works recognized generally as of most major importance (in French and English) and available when the author wrote (I checked major missing works against publication dates) are not included. This may be why old religious, colonial, and orientalist biases are adopted uncritically. There is no deep understanding of Islam here, for much the same reasons (sources and focus). The author fails to distinguish the substantial differences between crusade and jihad, the former offering conversion or death in both theory and often practice while the later recognized and had some respect for Christianity and Judaism (their Prophets, institutions, values, even doctrines) and provided dhimmis status as a third alternative. In the most tolerant times there are cases of sharing Churches for worship (Muslims Friday, Christians Sunday) and of Zakat (charity tax of about 2 1/2% net worth) being used for the benefit of poor non Muslim dhimmmis). One gets little picture of the cultural and intellectual fruition of that difference in history. (Dhimmitude studies are infamous for that slant on history ignoring real niche opportunities,the significance of self-governement for dhimmis and the taxes and military service avoided by paying the capita tax for non-Muslims. Most of these are also likely to read history backwards after the identifying markers for Jews that accompanied pogroms in Russia and were accompanied by Brownshirt violence and a precursor to genocide in Germany.) <br />If the author had better selection of sources and better understanding of Islam and its history the book would have been much sounder despite its decision to focus on essentially military history. The conclusion that war included violence would not have then been extended (by the author and even more strongly by many readers) as implicit in Islam. But of course fewer copies might have been sold; agendas are more popular than objectivity. The title itself spins relevance for the 21st century although little of the bookconcerns recent times. Sadly there is no better alternative history of Jihad in Europe now available although there are many better works to understand islam in Europe.	2002-12-13

Dick should read this to George but it would do no good if even the author sees no hypocrisy. The issue is very real, passion often replaces logic and people are left believing there are no \\"truths\\". Or making a leap of faith and believing everything they are told by some single minded ideologue (increasingly on the 'right')which is a simple and lazy but common solution. Truth is that the 'free enterprise' of ideas has become victim of its own world of tariffs, favoritism of sweet deals, profiteering, and near mononpoly. What happens when the 'truth-sayers' are liars (Halburton and Hawkin),superficial arbitrary phoney's (Hannnity and Limbaugh),and \\"political correctness\\" does not allow debate of the issues (Palestine)? What happens when the real issues are totally excluded from debate with campaigns of innuendo and disinformation - even if Saddam has weapons of mass destruction do we attack Russia, china, India, Pakistan, and Israel too? No real discussion of the results of premptory actions and consequences of war is allowed it seems. How can we find \\"truth\\" when the public example we have is secrecy, disinformation, withholding what are supposed to be public records, self interest of oil and arms industry? What happens when even the Churches seem no longer to much question killing, war, targeted assinations, official use of torture, etc. as standard operating procedure. Lynne's fictionalized partial truths (more often avoidence of displeasing information) to create patriotic little Americans would have kids so brainwashed by the time that they got to college that her thought police (it is NOT just the demonized and labeled \\"liberals\\") would not be necessary.

Pompousity does not make up for ignorance and Bennett is at least honest when he admits to ignorance about Islam -- although on the basis of shallow information that appears to confirm his biases (mostly obtained verbally, from mainstream press, and JDL briefings daily delivered to Washington) he tells us as though he IS the last word. His self confessed ignorance does not deter him from condemning Islam. The polemic is dishonest time and again. For example he says we fight for the freedoms of Afghanis - something that never concerned American policy when we 'used' them to fight the Russians and Regan described a Taliban delegation as \\"the moral equivalent of our founding fathers\\". The same hypocrisy applies to Iraq where papa Bush supported Saddam to fight Iran. Bennett needs to remember that opinion is not fact, that theory is not history, and manipulating public opinion or dictating his personal truths in the culture wars is neither honest or ultimately moral and good. He often raises pet peeves and discussions that have little to do with the justification of this 'Bushwackers war'. Nor does he assess the press bias, hiding of facts, dictat to say little about civilian casualties etc. (Many more innocent children in their homes have been killed directly and indirectly in Afghanistan, than adults in New York and Washington.) There is no understanding of the symbolic targets, the reasons why an extremist freak could act so, nor any discussion of the immorality and evil perpetrated by a 'peaceful' country that has bombed over 40 countries since WWII. It is not patriotic to lie or to support evil policies that undermine much of what is best in our country. Insider status and right wing financial support from the Olin Foundation and such may get Bennett published but his work is great only in his own mind. If this is the best justification and polemic we can muster we are indeed in seriouslybad shape as a nation. Remember the total fraud about the babies removed from stolen lung machines (repeated many ties by Bush Sr)in Kuwait when you see the lies to justify the next war!	2002-08-27

Fun and worthwhile with some shocking truths and some very tentative possibilities. Quick, fun read that leaves you wanting more while also wishing some truths would \\"go away\\". Give it to anyone who should not enlist in the armed services and to all who believe 'everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds' like Pangloss.	2002-06-12

Short, hateful, totally biased lacking both understanding of history and of Islam. One could just as easily make the same kind of case about any religion or ideology by ignoring perspective and fairness. Books like this increase hate and fear but certainly not truth or understanding. read Esposito's recent \\"Unholy Wars\\" instead.	2002-05-19

Someone once said \\"thinking is the hardest work there is -- which is why so few people do it.\\" This book can be annoying and one can argue with the ideas, but it deserves applause because it makes you think! I value it far more than Huntington's work on the clash of civilizations -- if you read that you owe it to yourself to read this too! If you agree with everything in a book you problem wasted your time reading it and learned next to nothing. The cover with George Bush's \\"unauthorized\\" picture is alone worth the price. Far too much of what is said herein is likely to be true for the comfort of those who are happy with the pablum from the domestic Press. I wish Charlie Rose and others would just once in awhile invite such guests!	2002-04-28

The new economy is supposed to displace productive value worldwide for the benefit of the top 20% of Americans in their own self image. There is no understanding of History or other cultures here.  (Railroads like many 'free enterprises' were heavily subsidized; military  and other investments are government sponsored, etc.) The US economy,  supply side (and Reagan) did not single handidly 'win' over Communism.  There will be many forms of 'Capitalism'; there are serious dangers in the  'free and unregulated' within nations and in the internatioanl economy.  Better to read John Gray, False Dawn if you want more than this  rationalization for a short period of high tech focus. Read Evans &amp;  Wurster, Blown to Bits to understand the spawning and workings of  businesses for this era. History did not end with the fall of the Berlin  Wall, nor is the very American version of the 'global free economy' going  to be accepted on its terms. In ten years this book will be clearly seen as  naive and peculiarly American dribble.	2000-04-24

It will  be difficult to understand the early 21st century without reading this  book!	2000-03-20
