Where every new day was full of joy and wonder.  Morris' storytelling brings the dog, his family and the lush southern landscape into full and brilliant view.<br />When you read My Dog Skip you can just feel how much this young man loved and revered his dog.<br />Any of us who have had a much loved pet know that the bond between animal and human can reach so much further than just &quot;pet and owner&quot;.  Willie Morris makes the statement that Skip wasn't just his dog, but his brother...  that is a beautiful thing.  Morris grew up an only child but did not feel alone by any stretch of the imagination.  He was loved deeply by and deeply loved his dog Skip.<br />Another great point made in this book is how Willie Morris learned so much from his dog Skip.  He clearly states that the most lasting lessons he has learned about love and loyalty came from knowing his dog.<br />This book captures so well the love a boy or any human being can have for a pet...  I loved the story and highly recommend it!	2004-01-06

He is told he is a gypsy and given the name Misha, by his friend and protector Uri.<br />From this point on Misha progresses in his understanding of all that is going on around him...  he comes face to face with \\"Jackboots\\", Nazi soldiers...  \\"Flops\\", turncoat Jews tormenting their own people...  and those being persecuted--  Jewish people.<br />The saddness of this story comes through loud and clear when Misha becomes attached to the Jewish family, the Milgorms.  Misha befriends, Jainna a young girl and quickly becomes part of the family and embraces his background as a Jew.<br />I applaud Spinelli for writing this book.  I realize there are many books written for middle school students on the Holocaust, but we must never stop reading about it... if we do we may forget just how terrible it really was.  And if we, as tolerant caring people forget the horrors, we could easily slip back into the cruelty and utter stupidity of the Nazi tormentors.  We must never become like them.... ever!<br />This is a mistake from history no one should ever repeat!<br />So as you read this...  remember that all people have value and it's our job to make sure we never allow something like the holocaust to happen again.	2004-01-03

If you have yet to read this book or his autobiography Spaceman do so soon!<br />Bill Lee has a way of bringing his rich sense of humor out with every word and anecdote.<br />This particular book is very creative.  Bill Lee, like many other members of Red Sox nation has misgivings about many events in Red Sox history.  So he takes this lovable but snakebit franchise to task... and rewrites it all!<br />This revision of history is interesting and laughable.  He begins by reversing the curse of the Bambino in 1919... and it just gets wilder and wilder from there.<br />I guess my only problem with the book is dealing with all the changed history...  the premise is funny and engaging at first but begins to wear as the book goes along.<br />But by all means it is worth your time and effort.  If you love the Sox or just love baseball read this book and you will not be disappointed!	2004-01-02

He doesn't have any friends...  he is socially awkward...  he has a difficult time in school...  and he has a well known family history-- and not a good one.<br />Poor Max has it rough.<br />One day he meets a young boy named Kevin...  or as many people call him, The Freak.  Kevin is living with a disability caused by a condition he has had since birth.  Kevin is tiny and has to walk with metal crutches.  He is not what society would deem \\"Normal\\".  But one thing is for sure he is very intelligent!<br />When Max and Kevin meet they become fast friends and are instantly transformed into...  \\"Freak the Mighty\\".<br />Transported by Kevin's intellect, boldness and imagination the two boys face many wild adventures and trials.  The story is full of many great twists and turns...  it is far from a dull book.<br />The book becomes very rewarding and touching as you read it.

This was a very thought proking story.<br />I don't want to go to deeply into the story line because I really don't want to give too much away...  but I must say the ending is shocking and expertly foreshadowed by Wharton.<br />Wharton's telling of this story through a third person narrator is brilliant.  We get a little piece, a glimpse of what happens in the story in the first chapter. In this glimpse we see an aged Ethan in town with a huge scar on his face and head....  and Wharton talks of the terrible, &quot;Smash Up&quot; he was involved in.<br />When I read it, I couldn't help but race through the book to find out just what the &quot;Smash Up&quot; was.  I love when a book gives you such motivation to speed through it.  This bit of  foreshadowing was masterfully brilliant and expertly done.<br />During the story we see Etan Frome, a conflicted and yearning young man.  Stuck between his ailing wife, Zeena and her young relative, Mattie who has come to live on their farm.<br />What Ethan wants more than anything is Mattie... but he knows he can't have her.<br />The bulk of the story brings us into his thought life.  I really enjoyed this aspect of the book.  We see Ethan waffling, hedging, scheming and hurting.  He is stuck in the life he chose and can't seem to escape it's grasp.<br />Ethan Frome is a conflicted and complex character.  I just loved Edith Wharton's portrayal of this man... brilliant!!<br />Read this book it is without a doubt a classic and well worth your effort!	2003-12-22

And the special horror of Vietnam comes through loud and clear.  The sights, sounds, smells, feelings and actions of this particular conflict come roaring off the pages of this book.  I literally could not put it down,  I just had to find out what would happen next!!<br />Richie Perry is a young man from Harlem who finds himself knee deep in the Hell that war is. After volunteering for the service he is trained and shippped out to the 'Nam.  The story gives much insight into the heart and mind of Perry.  We see him struggling to get used to the pain and violence of war.  We see him trying to find his role in all of this.  We see him dealing with faith and grasping for help in significance in a God he doesn't even know.  We see him aching to find out how he should feel about all he is doing as a soldier... or in his own words, \\"A Killer\\".  War is definitely a terrible thing... and  this book makes that point loud and clear.  There is no doubt Walter Dean Myers knows what he is talking about.  He portrays the horrors of war but never gets preachy about it, or self righteous.  He just tells the truth and never backs down.<br />I think the best aspect of this story is it's view of how young men must grow up under fire in times of combat.  Perry is just a boy forced to become a man...  it is sad and touching to see this happen to him.  He deals with the concepts of his own mortality, faith and values.  Myers handles it all expertly!<br />The combat sequences are more frightening than any horror story could ever be.  Walter Dean Myers actually transports you to the steamy jungles of the 'Nam and makes us feel just what it's like to be a rookie soldier slogging through the bush.<br />This book also explores the idea of race relations in the milatary during Vietnam.  It was not discussed as much as I thought it would be.  But still, this is an interesting idea.  We see how a new leader in the platoon, subtlely or not so subtlely places those of African American, Italian and Jewish decent at the point and rear on combat missions.  Perry struggles with this idea and can't really figure it all out.<br />My only wish is that Myers had explored this a little further...  But on the whole this is a great book.  It is a tense and stark portrayal of what it must have been like in Vietnam.  Young adults would benefit greatly from reading it to get a perspective of what this type of war was like... hopefully we won't ever have to face one like it ever again!r in the platoon, subtlely or not so subtlely places those of African American, Italian and Jewish decent at the point and rear on combat missions.

This is a small town in the Blue Ridge mountains that happens to be the home of this gifted story teller.<br />From this visit I have acquired a new found love for all things Waltons.<br />Earl Hamner takes snippets from his life and turns them into earthy portrayals of growing up in a poor family and of &quot;coming of age&quot;.  It seems like we all have faced questions, problems, trials and triumphs like this.<br />This book was enjoyable to read and entertaining.  I really couldn't help visualizing the tv family we all know...  I guess that's what a well known classic show will do to you.<br />If you like the Waltons or stories from the depression era this book will appeal to you.	2003-12-18

I must say the years have given me a deeper appreciation of it.  I really tripped my way through it as a freshman.  But now over ten years later I am liking this one more and more!<br />The story centers around poor Heathcliff and his sister/ loved one, Catherine.  Heathcliff has lived a life of struggle and woe.  He has been disadvantaged and mistreated.  Even when he is saved by Catherine's father and brought to live with them he is still, disadvantaged.  He is tortured by Hindley, Catherine's brother and made to live a life of pain and anguish.<br />When Catherine leaves home and marries Edgar Linton.  Heathcliff become even more tortured as the person he loves is taken from him.<br />This story is one filled with regret, longing and revenge.  We see Emily Bronte's excellent rendering of the corruptness of human nature...  and in Heathcliff we can see a human going to the depths of depravity and hatred.  The scarey thing is that we can... if we look hard enough see a little of ourselves in him too.<br />The novel is dark and foreboding, just like the windswept moors it takes place on.  The mood is expertly rendered by this genius author.<br />When you read it allow yourself to be swept away by it's darkness and get caught up in the atmosphere.<br />That was the draw for me and I'm sure you'll will feel it too.<br />Excellent Book!	2003-12-14

From:  Adam to Abraham to Jacob to King David, God inspired the writing of these accounts to show us he uses people just as they are and he does the work not us.<br />This is just the case in James Baldwin's story, Go Tell it on the Mountain.<br />The main character is John, a young boy just turned 14 struggling to develop his identity and to get to know God.<br />During the course of the story we see his family history revealed and get to know the truth that his mother and step father are very imperfect people but redeemed nonetheless.<br />That is what John must come to terms with.  Baldwin's rendering of this internal spiritual stuggle is masterful.<br />The way that Baldwin reveals the truth of the family little by little is extremely well done.  This story is short and packed with punch.  It is a moving and thought provoking book.	2003-11-26

But also a very rewarding story.  When you finish this one you feel like you have been somewhere... truly immersed in a time period... truly immersed in a family.<br />No author, ever...  has had the knack of creating a world of ordinary people so expertly intertwined throughout his novels.  Faulkner either by design or accident (I doubt that??) has created a rich tapestry in his books, of characters subtlely connected by time and circumstance.<br />I have read The Sound and the Fury and most of Light in August; and it is not difficult to see the connections in just these two books plus the short story The Bear.  Everything I have chanced to read by this amazing author has had careful, deep, intricate connections to the other works.<br />I know this is a well known fact... but the way in which Faulkner executes it, leaves me amazed each and every time I encounter it.<br />The Bear is a coming of age story about Ike McCaslin.  It traces his development to a young man through several vingettes.  Each time we see him he is involved in a hunt. That is until the last 2 sections in which we see him at age 21 looking back on his family history and discussing his right to the land.  Once we see him as a young boy and then onward into his teenage years.<br />The story revolves around an aged bear who roams the forests and swamps where they hunt.  It is interesting to see Ike develop as a hunter and man, as the hunters get closer and closer to the old bear.<br />There are many rich characters in this story.... far to many for me to touch on in this short review.<br />A big theme that impressed me in this one was how our personal history is inexticably tied to the land we grow up on.  Ike McCaslin was, &quot;who&quot; he was because of where he was from, and he could never escape that fact.<br />  Faulkner was an author unafraid to delve into the scriptures in developing his ideas.  I believe his use of scriptural narratives only serves to strengthen his work.  What he says, rings with authority when he uses Abraham, Adam and Eve as illustrations.  He expertly uses the story of Abrahams travels to the promised land to show how his characters have squandered their &quot;rights&quot; to the land they grew up on...  their &quot;promised land&quot;.<br />There is no doubt William Faulkner knew how to put a story together.  Any of his works, beg to be read again and again.  I will surely be picking this one up again...  I recommend it to anyone who loves books!

This is yet another fine example of Children's Writing.  I enjoyed this book.  It is full of laughs and surprises.  There are more twists and turns in this one than a back country road!<br />My only problem with this series is at times it gets jumbled and over-wrought,  it's almost as if you can see Mr. Snicket trying desperately to put the \\"brakes on\\" before he gives away too much.  We all know they are trying to squeeze this story into 13 volumes....  (I believe) and I'm sure he doesn't want to give the store away too soon.<br />At times the discussion of certain actions and events go a little too far.  As if he is trying to squeeze more out of a storyline than what is really their.  At times it goes too far.  But not too terribly far!<br />Mr. Snicket has truly, put a fanciful and wonderfully \\"Dreadful\\" world together for these three endearing orphans.  As I have stated before you can't be sure whether to laugh or cry for these children.<br />I enjoy the wry, dry wit employed in this series.  I also believe the little revelations that Snicket gives us into his own fictional life are brilliant!  The whole world of Lemony Snicket is truly intricate and engrossing.<br />I just picked up his unauthorized autobiography and can't wait to crack it open.  The more you learn about his \\"persona's\\" connection to the series, the more you want to know.<br />In The Slippery Slope we meet up with Klaus, Violet and Sunny once again and get to share in their misery.

I would like to see this play live.... after reading it, I am intrigued to see  actors bring it to life.  It is a story written on many levels and I think the best way to understand the irony is to see it presented on stage.<br />I enjoyed the written piece though.  It is full of wry humor and irony.<br />The two main characters are waiting for Godot... an unknown &quot;authority&quot; coming sometime... all throughout the play.  They continue to wait and contemplate the meaning of life through banal conversation.<br />One has to wonder who Godot really is.... and why he is so important to wait for.<br />Perhaps Godot is the culmination of all life for these two men?  A &quot;God&quot;-like figure, looming over us all as we wait on and on until life's ultimate endpoint.<br />This is strong existential writing.  Beckett purports the theory that today is all there is, and the most significant thing is to live in it and exist.<br />I will probably need to read this one again, it is the type of writing that begs to be examined more than once.  If you like comedy in an absurd light... this play is for you.	2003-11-17

I had to read this book...  and I did not like it at all.<br />As another reviewer mentioned, I am now thirty and read it again.  I now love this story!  It is a story of loss,  love and redemption.<br />A miserly Silas Marner loses the one thing that makes him feel complete, at least he thought it did.  His stash of Gold gone Marner opens up to the people around him for the first time in years.  He also meets the little girl who changes his life forever.<br />Silas Marner is a story about finding love and learning how to love someone else.  It is also about the miniscule value of possesions as compared to the relationships we can build with those in our lives.<br />Read this book... If you read it before and hated it, or have never read it... It is well worth your time.  This classic story written by George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans) will change your view of the world.	2003-07-28

I have read many of Andrew Clements books and this is one of my favorites.<br />In the book we meet, Nicholas a strongly independent 5th grader who decides to push the limits of the English language.<br />He single handedly changes the name of a common everyday object, a ballpoint pen, to \\"Frindle\\".  In turn everyone around him begins to call it that... the word takes on a life of it's own and really catches on.<br />The action of the story comes from the conflict between Nicholas and his English teacher, Mrs. Granger.  It is a battle over the sanctity of words and reality.  This book is as I said, Wildly Creative!<br />Andrew Clements seems to know kids like no other children's author.  He especially knows quirky kids.<br />This book is a fun, quick read and will have you laughing right along with Nicholas.	2003-07-21

Oliver North had a short tour in Vietnam but it definitely left him with many long lasting memories.<br />In this book we read North's personal impressions of what it was like to fight in the Vietnam War and he gives us the reasons why he thinks we failed there.<br />In 1993 Oliver North decided to go back to the country where he fought and finish his mission.  Instead of going in a stance of war he went as an agent of peace to bring support, hope and reconciliation.<br />Oliver North shares with us his views as a born again Christian.  He is driven by the teachings of Jesus Christ who calls us to, &quot;Love our enemies.&quot;  Oliver North does just that.  He is driven to bring help to this hurting nation, shackled by a crumbling system of communism.<br />Oliver North visited Hospitals and Orphanages both hurting and dilapitated.  He helped lead the way in bringing aid to these people.  It is nice to see North, a professing Christian taking his life in Christ seriously and really going out and showing love to others.<br />This book is full of unique observations and inspiring actions.  It was an enjoyable and quick read.	2003-07-19

LT writes with reckless abandoned just the way he played the game.  It was interesting that LT was not changed by his experience in the NFL.  He grew up a very determined young man, stayed that way in college and carried it through to his work in the NFL.<br />An intriguing portion of the book goes into LT's drug problem.  This book was written early on in LT's career.  It's too bad but he didn't really seem to take his problem seriously.  In fact it appears he never really made progress after this initial treatment.  He never really said the drugs were controlling him.  I believe he had the problem resurface in years following this books publication.  Too bad...  so much talent!<br />Lawrence Taylor's bio is worth the time of any football fan who would like an inside look, into one of the best linebackers of all time.	2003-07-19

How about understanding what it's like to be deaf?  Or what about living most of life unable to speak?<br />Helen Keller experienced them all and lived with all of these conditions in a most miraculous way.  This is a woman who overcame many obstacles.<br />I remember watching a video of the Miracle Worker in 7th grade and have always been inspired by the story of Anne Sullivan breaking through the wall that surrounded her young student, Helen Keller.<br />This particular book gives you the story from the other side.  I can only imagine what it was like to be young Helen Keller trapped in a dark, soundless world unable to speak.  Her short autobiography is stunningly optimistic.  This is a woman who met challenges and took them head on.<br />Her story is one of triumph in the face of set backs.  She never let her condition be a stumbling block but always a stepping stone.<br />This story is a marvelous picture of the many accomplishments of Helen Keller.  It is called &quot;The Story of My Life&quot;.  It should be called, &quot;The Story of My Remarkable Life&quot;.	2003-07-11

If you have never read the series I highly recommend it for anyone.  It is wonderfully written and highly descriptive of the days when the country was wild and free.<br />Laura Ingalls tells the story of her life, wild and free on the beautiful wind swept prairie.  She gives us vivid pictures of just what it was like to be a homesteader living off the land.  When Charles Ingalls decides the big woods of Wisconsin are getting too crowded, he gets an itchy feeling to head out and homestead in the \\"Indian Territory\\" of the midwest.  Laura tells the story of this adventurous move with the wide eyed innocence of a little girl.  This is especially remarkable since Laura wrote these stories while she was beyond the age of 60!<br />This account of her life, lived under the billowing top of a covered wagon, reads just as freshly, as if it happened yesterday!  You can't help but get swept up in the lush reality of it all.  Laura Ingalls Wilder lived these experiences and brings them into sharp focus for us today.  Some of her most vivid and gripping recollections come in reference to the wolves and Native Americans surrounding her little cabin.  Laura is full of spunk and always ready to face whatever challenge comes along.  She is a wonderful role model for young children, even if she is a little impulsive at times.<br />If you've seen the television show and haven't read the books, please take the time to enjoy them!  The TV show was good but dramatized quite a bit.  These books read as a historical record told in stark honesty.  They dispense with the hollywood melodrama and the present a story in a straight forward way.<br />But as I said before they are  vivid and rich in their portrayal of life on the prairie.  This particular book is well worth your time!	2003-05-30

William Golding seems to have the answer.  In this novel, The Lord of the Flies, we enter the a world of darkness and violence.  All spawned out of the hearts of very young men.<br />The bible says, \\"There in no one who does good, no not one.\\"<br />And, \\"All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.\\"<br />The hard fact of the matter is that man's natural bent is turned in toward himself.<br />This self centeredness is a mild transgression...that creates all kinds of deeper more insidious types of evil in the hearts of men.  What is stealing, but the selfish desire to possess something we can't buy?  What is jealousy, but the selfish desire to be better than someone else?  What is murder, but the selfish want to supercede someone else and take their place in the world from them?  All of these evil desire spawn out of a natural inclination toward selfishness.<br />In the Lord of the Flies we see the way in which a \\"normal\\" human being spirals quickly down into a life of total depravity.  The \\"feel good\\" sociologists and psychologists will try to convince you that man is born basically good.  But if you look at the actions of man and novels such as Golding's you will clearly see that man has the capability and natural inclination to turn utterly savage in a heartbeat.<br />In this compelling story we meet a group of school boys stranded on a remote desert island.  The boys work cooperatively for a time.  Soon the trappings of society and order break down.  The boy's rudimentary attempt at establishing a government crumbles and is rabidly devoured by the voracious appetite of self centeredness.<br />There are two main power centers in this book:<br />* Ralph/Piggy- who try to run a civilized society ruled by common sense and order.<br />* Jack-  the leader of a group of hunters who are ruled by sensual desires and to satify their basest needs.<br />These two power centers clash brutally just like we do in our own minds, when we battle to keep down our strange desires.  Like the concience battling the selish nature.  Ralph/Piggy are a civilized concience trying to keep things orderly and good.  While Jack and his hunters are untamed desire, ruled by their stomach and lust for violence.<br />The hunters quickly decide to battle with the idea of organized society.  They soon splinter off into a tribe ruled by the concept of \\"might makes right.\\"  Ralph and Piggy try to hold onto the frayed edges of society and order only to be sucked into the endless void violence and uncontrolled selfishness.<br />This book is timeless.

This author really knows what makes middle school kids tick...  let alone his understanding of what makes adults kids!  Andrew Clements is a true student of human nature.<br />The theme I find most encouraging in this particular book is that no matter what a jerk we may be or no matter what mistakes we make or no matter what terrible choices we make, every day is a new and fresh one!<br />Mark is a young man who has extremely rich parents, who barely pay any attention to him and ship him all over the place from home to home and school to school.  This experience has left the 5th grader cynical and jaded.  Who could blame him?<br />When Mark gets to yet another new home and school in New Hampshire he decides he is going to tune out everyone and everything at his new school.  He decides he will not interact with them because he won't be there long enough to get to know anyone anyway.<br />Mark's science teacher, Mr. Maxwell is an innovative, environmentally concious educator.  He seems like a typical liberal gentleman who is open to all ideas and all people.  But he immediately labels Mark as a \\"Spoiled Rich Kid\\" and decides to shut him out too.<br />The great thing that happens in this book is that Mark and his teacher both change.  They aren't trapped by the choices they made and they both evolve into better people in the end!<br />Every day we start with a clean slate and it's all about what we decide to do with that day, that makes us who we are.<br />This is a very encouraging book... well written and as always perceptive!  Yet again, another winner from Andrew Clements!	2003-05-24

In this story by Andrew Clements we meet a young man who experiences this very phenomena.<br />One fateful morning Bobby wakes up and discovers he is unable to see himself.  He is completely invisible!  As soon as Bobby makes this discovery he reveals this strange truth to his unsuspecting parents.  Oddly his parents decide to do nothing about the whole situation.  Bobby's parents decide to hide the fact that he is invisible from the rest of the world.  This choice proves to have damaging consequences later on in the story.<br />The invisible Bobby, learns he can stealthily move about in the outside world as long as he is unclothed.  He uses his powers to visit the university library and other conservative adventures.  It is interesting that Bobby doesn't take full-blown advantage of his powers.  In fact he even agonizes over the fact that he is now invisible and doesn't even want to do what most regular young men would want to do...  like sneaking into the girls locker room.  Bobby handles his new powers with caution and in a very reserved way.<br />Bobby is actually very unhappy with his new found power.  Which is a very realistic way for Clements to handle this \\"problem\\".  Many children's authors would treat invisibility as a joke or some type of special privilige, but not Clements.  He, as usual, analyzes the feelings of youth with depth and precision.  This is a true strength of Clements.  No other writer of pre-teen/middle school literature, so thoroughly understands the young mind it's motives as deeply as Andrew Clements.<br />While invisible Bobby makes a friend with a young lady.  The interesting twist to this new friendship is that his new friend, Alicia, couldn't see him even if he was visible.  Alicia happens to be blind.  Bobby and Alicia have many frank discussions about the similarities they share.  They find common ground in being invisible and blind.  They seem to find solace in one another's alienation from society.  This is yet another of Clement's brilliant portrayals of the youthful spirit.<br />The story itself starts rushing toward a riveting climax when social services realize that Bobby has been out of school for several weeks.  When Bobby's parents can't produce proof that he is alive, potential accusations fly and the family finds itself in dire straights.  Bobby's parents scramble for a cure to prove they are innocent and bring their son back.<br />The budding relationship between Bobby and Alicia is another highlight of this novel.  They share a tender yet cynical relationship.  Their many witty and sarcastic conversations are really fun to read.  Andrew Clements sure knows kids!<br />I'm sure some of us have longed to be invisible at times and at other times have felt invisible to everyone we know and didn't want to feel that way at all.

Nancy...  an anonymous letter writer, is one of the most creatively, funny writers, that I have ever encountered.<br />This book is a collection of letters sent to actual business and corporations making possibly legitimate, but wildly crazy requests.<br />One letter,(my favorite) writes to a fish restaurant requesting to be seated outside by the dumpster instead of in the dining room... the reason: because of Mr. Nancy's body odor.  He doesn't want to disturb the other patrons with his smelly body.<br />Many of the letters receive actual replies from the companies, such as the one I just described.  The restaurant manager says that they can not allow him to sit by the dumpster but could give him a conference room to dine in alone!!??!  :-)<br />I guess the element that makes me laugh so much, at this book is that someone took the time to actually write back to his off the wall requests.  When I picture someone taking these letters seriously it just cracks me up.<br />Jerry Seinfeld writes the introduction to this book. He wonders if what Ted L. Nancy does is illegal?  But comments that it sure is some of the funniest stuff he has ever read.<br />I agree!  This book is worth your time.  It is not a book you would want to sit down and read straight through.  The letters can blend into one another if you read to many at once.  But by all means read it.<br />I shared it with my co-workers and we had a great belly laugh around the table.  Now I have a waiting list of friends a mile long who would like to read it!  This book is a crowd pleaser... If you like wild, wacky, off the wall humor than this book is for you.  But you must be an outside the box thinker.  If you are too logical or straight laced you may not get it.  But give it a try! :-)	2003-05-07

The pace is quick and not heavy on detail.  Instead Andrew Clements takes the time to let us into the mind of a young man struggling with his feelings.  I really applaud Andrew Clements for taking on a sensitive issue.<br />This story gives a picture of a brief encounter between two young men Phil and Daniel.  In this encounter Phil and Daniel squabble over the ownership of the jacket Daniel is wearing.<br />This event pushes Phil to really think about who he is and what his core beliefs are.  You see, Daniel is an African American boy and Phil happens to be white.  Phil begins to question if he is actually a predjudiced person.<br />Clements does a wonderful job of portraying Phil's questioning.  He also touches on the way we are shaped by the views of a parents, whether we realize it or not!  Clements also shows us that we can rise above the misconceptions and predjudices of our environment.  Which to me, is the greatest message in this story.<br />  I'm sure this story would challenge the thinking of late elementary students and middle school students.  The copy I read has great discussion questions for literature groups.<br />  I really enjoyed it...  and I'm sure you would too!	2003-05-04

I discovered these books in my work as a teacher of reading to 2nd grade students. And students just love them!<br /> Let me start by saying this is an excellent series of books. The way that Mary Pope Osborne incorporates: science, social studies(history/geography) and many other important academic elements into her stories is phenomenal!<br />The stories are exciting and well written.  They have a way of drawing kids in and keeping them wanting to turn pages.<br />In our guided reading groups we usually read a chapter or two per day and the students frequently beg me to read more!  That is how much kids love these books!  Isn't that refreshing?<br />This particular installment in the Magic Tree House series finds Jack and Annie traveling back to ancient Rome!  They happen to land in Pompeii in A.D. 79 on the day that Mount Vesuvius erupts!<br />This book incorporates two very popular elements for young children: volcanos and magic. It is undeniable that young students are intrigued by the power of volacanos.  They love to read about them and this particular book is a great way for them to start researching.<br /> Jack and Annie's adventures never fail to thrill readers and keep them interested.<br />I highly recommend these books for students in early elementary school.  They are excellent for students in 2nd grade.  Enjoy!	2003-04-30

Dr. McGee died in 1989 but his insight into the scriptures live on.<br />This particular commentary on the great book of 1 Peter is very well written.  Dr. McGee's teachings on suffering that go with chapter 3 of 1 Peter are very well said.  Dr. McGee helps enlighten us to the fact that all men will suffer, and knowing Christ does not necessarily end suffering.  But knowing Christ surely does help us to put our troubles and suffering in perspective.  When we know Christ we have hope and joy in the midst of whatever comes our way.<br />Dr. McGee knew this and his teachings from this wonderful commentary are deep and meaningful for all of us.

Laura is the 2nd daughter of Charles and Caroline Ingalls.  In this particular book we meet up with the Ingalls family living in the big woods of Wisconsin.  Charles is a farmer, a hunter, a trapper and adventurer.  Caroline takes care of the family and runs the household.  Laura and Mary are two young girls living in a log cabin in the big, dark woods.<br />The most charming aspect of this book is that we see pioneer life through the eyes of a young child.  It is interesting to note that Laura Ingalls Wilder did not start writing until she was in her 60's but she still tells this story in a very child like way.  This is not to say the books are not well written, they certainly are.  But the writing gets increasingly better as the series contiues.  I'm not sure if this was by design or not...  of course the stories are told by a much older narrator as the story continues.  This would definitely lend itself to better narration.<br />  These books are excellent reads for children in 3rd grade and up.  They are written in a nice, simple style, yet they are just challenging enough to keep kids thinking.<br />I have also found that younger children, especially in 2nd grade love to hear these stories as read alouds.  If you want your child to learn about life long ago these books are a great stepping stone.<br />This first volume in the series concludes with Pa Ingalls moving on with his family to the great west.  It seems the big woods were getting smaller as more people moved in, and Charles got the itch to move on.

I love his colorful style of teaching the scripture.  Dr. McGee's teachings are filled with home- grown illustrations and practical insights.<br />I especially like the commentary on Song of Solomon.  I have to admit I had read the book, Song of Solomon once on my own and didn't get a lot out of it.  Once I looked at it again with the help of Dr. McGee, I could clearly see the gospel laid out in this wonderful little book.<br />All at once the book of Song of Solomon is a love poem from a man to a woman and a love letter from Christ to us.  Who loves us more than Jesus?  Nobody!<br />When you see Christ in the book of Song of Solomon you see it's truest meaning.<br />Dr. McGee is a wonderful teacher... as he always says in the introducitons to his commentary's he, &quot;Puts the Cookies on the bottom shelf&quot;, so that we can always reach them.<br />The word of God is so simple that even a child can understand it... yet in other ways so deep you can study it forever and never come to a complete understanding.<br />Let Dr. McGee lead you on a fulfilling quest into the word of God!	2003-04-27

The Classic Battle	Jack London knew the power of nature over and against humankind.  And in this book we encounter his telling of yet another story of the fight for survival.<br />In this short story we are swept back to the Arctic in a brutally cold setting.  So cold that the moisture from a person's mouth instantly becomes ice when it hits the air.  So cold that to stop moving is to risk freezing to death.  So cold that to get wet means certain death....  All of these risks are very real and can only be combatted by one element--  Fire!<br />  Our main character struggles to travel to his camp, making his way up the bank of a frozen stream.<br />As he progresses in his travel the need arises for him to build a fire.  In fact the only way he will survive is to build a fire.  And that is the crux of this cracklingly dark short story.<br />Jack London sends us into this frigid environment and won't let us go until the story is resolved.  I was honestly shivering as I read this story, because of the stark reality that London creates in lean story telling.  London tells us just enough to set the scene and let's your own imagination take over.<br />This is a quickly paced story of survival.  London drives the pace like a runaway freight train.  Hang on tight and enjoy the ride!	2003-04-27

What kid wouldn't want access to secrets held by the greatest candy maker ever?<br />What kid wouldn't want to embark on a wild adventure and meet the amazing, Willy Wonka?<br />I can't think of one who wouldn't! :-)<br />I know I would love to do all of those things and I'm not even a kid anymore...  well, I guess I'm a kid at heart.<br />Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an amazing book.  I was  first exposed to this story by my 3rd grade teacher, as a whole class read aloud.  And from that day forward, I was a lover of the writings of Roald Dahl.<br />I have since read this story every year of my teaching career to my own classes.  And I can honestly say that I have not found a class yet that has not loved the story of Charlie's amazing adventure!  This is one of the greatest books ever written for children... and I really mean that!<br />Roald Dahl introduces us to the Bucket family, an unfortunate family who struggles to survive on the money Mr. Bucket makes as a toothpaste cap screwer.<br />One day Mr. Bucket is laid off from his job and the family begins to starve.  One member of the family, little Charlie, struggles to subsist on bread and cabbage soup.  Poor Charlie finds himself starving to death, when one day he finds a dollar in the snow and his whole life changes.  With this dollar Charlie buys a candy bar just to fill his stomach and gets so much more than he could ever imagine.<br />Charlie becomes the 5th child to find a golden ticket and with it, has the marvelous opportunity to visit Mr. Wonka's chocolate factory.<br />At the factory Charlie meets up with a most wild assortment of characters:<br />* Augustus Gloop:  A large boy who loves to eat more than anything in the world.  His uncontrollable appetite leads him to a sticky end.<br />*  Veruca Salt:  A spolied rotten young lady. Who is prone to terrible tantrums when she can't get what she wants.  Her greed leads her to a messy exit.<br />*  Violet Beauregard:  An incessant gum chewer who chomps and chomps her jaws day in and day out.  Her insatiable desire for gum leads to her chewy end.<br />*  Mike Teevee:  A crazy Television addict, whose love for TV sends him zipping through the stratosphere.<br />*  The Oompa Loompas:  A group of melodic factory workers who work for Mr. Wonka, and act as a chorus in a greek tragedy.  Their silly songs are one of the many highlights of this book.<br />*  Mr. Willy Wonka:  The enegmatic ruler of a chocolate universe.  He has more secrets and surprises than we could ever hope for.<br />I highly reccommend this book for kids from 0 to 99!

Are there those who supersede the expectations and requirements of living within a community?  Do some men and women rise above the herd and rule with impunity, out of their own inherent power?<br />Wolf Larsen fancies himself one of these men.  The captain of the seal hunting vessel &quot;The Ghost&quot; believes he is above all the norms of socitey. He is one who is not handicapped by social graces or education.  He is one who does not buy into the hope of religion or eternal life.  Is he an existentialist... a materialist...  a nihilist?  Maybe he is all of these...?<br />Wolf Larsen uses people and possessions in a way that suits him best.  He gains his advantage by doing whatever he feels will advance his postion in the moment. Wolf Larsen is a self educated and self possesed person, wrapped up in himself and the power he seems to wield.<br />Humphrey Van Weydon is swept up into the surging storm of all that Wolf Larsen is.  Van Weydon is a pampered socialite who has spent his life in the comfy confines of wealth and academia.  He is well read and has a good understanding of philosophy.  But doesn't really have a great handle of the practical aspects of life. Where the rubber meets the road, in philosophical ideals, he is lacking.<br /> One day, as he is riding as a passenger on a steamer across San Fransisco bay, his life is changed in a heartbeat.<br />The steamer collides with another ship and Humphrey is swept overboard.  His next moment of conciousness is on the deck of the seal hunting ship, &quot;The Ghost&quot;.  This ship is captained by the infamous superman Wolf Larsen.  From this point on two very different... but similar worlds collide.<br />Van Weydon and Larsen spend many days discussing life and how we are supposed to live it.  More and more through discussion and observation Van Weydon, the refined socialite, discovers he is just like Larsen, the grizzled violent sea captain.  It is interesting to watch Van Weydon's desensitization to violence and the law of &quot;might makes right&quot;.  When Van Weydon begins his voyage he fancies himself above all the fighting and violence of the sailors.  But as he progresses in this trip he realizes he is one of them.  Humphrey finds he cannot help but be swept up into the violence, and see that it is just as much a part of the world he came from as it is aboard the ship.<br />I enjoyed the book, but it does drag a little in places.  The ending leaves a little to be desired.

Sometimes I found myself on an adventure in search of fame, sometimes in search of fourtune.  I was always filled with some sort of delusions of granduer.  This seems to be a right of passage for young boys.  We are always filled with the hope of excitement and adventure around the corner.<br />Tom Sawyer is no exeption to this rule.  He is a young man ruled by the hope of finding treasure...  the hope of swashbuckling his way into a grand adventure.<br />Tom and his friend Huck spend hours looking for new thrills and trying to touch the unknown.<br />As I read this wonderful book I couldn't help but laugh out loud several times.  Mark Twain's humor and understanding of youthful exuberance is unmatched.  He must have been a life long member of boyhood.<br />My adventures as a boy were always grand... but never quite as great as Tom's.  The Adventures of Tom Sawyer definitely provides the kind of escapism we all need young or old.  This book is one of my all time favorites!	2003-04-26

It is a very thought provoking tale.  As I read many reviews of this story I have seen a lot of discussion of the main character Bartleby, with good reason.  But it is also interesting to look at our story's narrator...  Bartleby's employer.<br />From the outset he is a man intrigued by his employees.  The story begins with his description of 3 employees:  Turkey, Ginger Nut and Nippers.  He has these 3 gentlemen as workers and seems genuinely interested in their apparent strengths and weaknesses...  especially the weaknesses.<br />Then enters Bartleby--  the stoic worker who respectfully uses his ringing statement of defiance, &quot;I would prefer not to.&quot;<br />It is fascinating to see the narrator deal with Bartleby and his passive resistance.  I suppose he could have swiftly dismissed his insubordinate worker.  And have ended his relationship with him quickly.  But, this was not the course of action taken.  He seemed to see a specific responsibility to Bartleby.  He felt like he must provide some type of framework for Bartleby to exist in. Even when he discovers Bartleby living in the office, he continues to carefully support Bartleby.  Why was this his approach?  Our narrator seemed to sense an important role in helping his apparently marginalized worker.<br />I especially enjoyed the narrator's thoughts on his supposedly predestined situation.  Was it his divinely ordained responsibility to deal with Bartleby?  Was he serving some great role in this man's survival and possible redemption?  I believe that's why he stuck it out with Bartleby for so long.<br />This short story is intriguing in that it should push us all to be more socially responsible.  Even when the responsibility pushes us to be outside our comfort zone.  In most of the instances in which the narrator felt like dealing with Bartleby harshly... he was prodded by peer pressure or driven by a fear of looking bad.  Does it really matter how we look in the eyes of the world?  Or does it matter more what we do, out of love for fellow man?  It shouldn't matter if we look foolish or weak... especially if we are putting others first.<br />Bartleby teaches me, that I have a strong responsibility to my fellow human beings.  If I see someone outside the bounds of what we would call &quot;normal society&quot;, what can I do to help them?  How can I show them love and respect?  It's too bad when someone decides to drop out like Bartleby...  Life means too much for anyone to do that.<br />Bartleby stood on the hinge of human existence and chose to swing out into the abyss.

Nearly every one of his stories is written in a different style.  Avi does not get type-cast or pigeon-holed...  he finds a way to stay fresh and creative in every book he writes.  I can't help but be blown away by his originality.  Well, enough gushing about the author.<br />Avi takes a page from Jack London in this story.  It is a take on the classics like, Call of the Wild and White Fang.  McKinley is a loyal, smart, loving, caring dog. He is devoted to his family, and takes great pride in caring for his human pup.  He is loyal to his human family and watches over them carefully.<br />But, McKinley is also the leader of a community of dogs.  So he spends time rounding up the dogs in town and caring for them.  One of his dog compatriots says he cares too much for other dogs.  And that appears to be true.<br />When McKinley goes to help a dog named Duchess who has run away<br /> from her abusive master, he meets up with a wolf.  His life is forever changed from this point on.  McKinley must decide if he will be loyal to his human family or break away and head into the wild with the wolf pack...  Interesting stuff.  Avi does a wonderful job of getting into the head of the McKinley.  He gives us some insight into what he sees as the thought process of a dog.<br />The ending is dramatic and ties together nicely.  McKinley gives an amazing statement on what he sees as a dogs relationship to humans.  The care relationships dog's have to humanity is expertly rendered by Avi.<br />I couldn't put this book down and devoured it in a couple of days.  The pace is fast and carries the reader along.  I hope you read it...  you will not be disappointed! :-)	2003-04-21

But I never really got it until I read it again as an adult.  Now I see clearly what London set out to do.<br />I have always enjoyed Jack London's look into the savage mindset of animals.  His understanding of the line between captivity and freedom is unparalelled.<br />In this classic story we meet Jack, a pampered house pet, who is one day swiftly and savagely swept from his home to the Yukon.  Jack is treated brutally and eventually his spirit is broken.  He in turn becomes a brute of a work dog, pulling sleds across the frozen arctic.<br />Some of my favorite scenes are those in which Buck learns the law of the club and fang.  Buck finds himself plunged into a world of brutality in which the only law is the law of the club and fang.  He is taught this law by a man in a red sweater who challenges Buck to a contest of wills.  Which is deftly won by the one holding the club. I love the look into Buck's thought process.  I also enjy how London nails Buck's slip from strong independence to complete servanthood.<br />Buck settles into a life of hard servitude, until he finds the love of a man once again.  It is amazing how London pulls Buck away from man to the brink of being a wild animal, only to bring him back into a loving relationship once again with John Thornton.  It is interesting to see Buck's thought process as he learns to trust and love human's again.<br />In the end Buck is swept once again to the wild.  London expertly takes Buck from transformation to tranformation... from  crossroad to  crossroad.<br />By the end of the story we are Buck and know fully what it's like to be Called by the Wild.<br />I highly recommend this classic book!	2003-04-21

As a second grade teacher I was very familiar with Louis Sachar from his Wayside School Stories and Marvin Redpost series also.  In fact his Wayside School stories are amongst my classes favorite read alouds each year.  Sachar has a real knack for giving me brief chuckles and also huge belly laughs.<br />In this story we meet Stanley Yelnats a very unfortunate young man.  Who through a strange twist of fate ends up at a youth correctional facility digging 5 foot deep, 5 foot wide holes everyday for what would be 18 months.  At this camp Stanley meets up with a great cast of characters who take him in and help transform him into a new person.<br />This book is masterfully written!  I can't help but think of the movie Cool Hand Luke... as I read it.  It takes an amazing children's author to bring a prison story to light like this and make it accessible to children.<br />Sachar tells this story like he's \\"unpeeling the layers of an onion.\\" (See the book)  The connections are surprising and carefully revealed. He tells us just what we need to know-- just when we need to know it.  I love it more each time I read it... and I bet you will too!	2003-04-16

His father sees it in yet another way.  His teacher sees it in another way altogether...  I could go on and on.<br />Phillip the freedom fighter?  Or is he just a foolish student swept up in a whirlwind?

It has a transcript style that roars along at a breakneck pace.<br />The reason this book is so relevent is that we all deal with conflict in our lives.  Something very small and insignificant can become something so huge!  This book is all about how things get blown out of proportion.  And how we deal with them, or don't deal with them!  It is a real slice of life.<br />I recommend it highly.  If you have ever done something you regret but didn't have the guts to back down you'll understand Philips quandry!	2003-01-24

Mr. Snicket is as strong a children's writer as I have seen in a while! His writing style asks you to think, while your holding your sides laughing. These books are so cleverly written. The humor ranges from subtle to ironic to obvious. This book made me laugh out loud, more than a few times and that doesn't happen a whole lot...<br />Poor Klaus, Violet and Sunny. You can't help but laugh at their misfortune. The understated way that the author tells about that horrible day when they lost their family and the series of unfortunate events kicked off by that day is brilliant. His style is the best since Roald Dahl. I loved all of Dahl's books, and have enjoyed each of these books so far! If you like understated, dry, ironic humor then you will love these books.<br />Lemony Snicket has such a great sense of timing he knows how to be self- referential without being ridiculous. The inside jokes are great. They really make you feel like you are part of something.<br />Enjoy this book... it is so sad it's funny!<br />These books are a little dark, so they may not be appropriate for young children.

But I have to say this particular book left me the least satisfied of all of them.<br />As I read this I didn't realize that Hemingway actually lived an episode like this during his 1st or 2nd marriage.  I discovered this after reading the book in one of his biographical accounts.  It seems that he wrote this one to process out his inner feelings about the actual relationship he lived through.  I wonder how he felt in retrospect?  At times his main character David seems bitter about the whole thing.  At other times he is definitely caught up in it.  He is written much like a puppet, controlled by his wife and the circumstances he runs into.<br />Catherine is one of the more complex female characters that Hemingway ever portrayed.  She reminds me of a more fleshed out Brett, from The Sun Also Rises.  Catherine has a very nihilistic view of life.  She seems driven to do everything in her power to destroy herself and all who cross her path.  She wants pleasure.  She wants to feel good about herself, but just can't seem to find a way to acheive it.  Poor Catherine...  I couldn't help but feel for her the whole way through the book.  She seems lost and unwilling to find her way or be found.<br />I wonder if Hemingway was simply journaling on this experience, never wanting to share it at all?  I guess we'll never know...<br />After hearing the fact that this is a reflection of his real life experiences, I understand why it left me feeling odd.  Reading it is almost voyeuristic or like eavsdropping.  If you read it, keep in mind it was left unpublished by the master himself...  Enjoy the twists and turns of an insatiable spirit.	2003-01-21

I enjoyed the book very much but felt so horribly for the main character Harry Morgan.  In Harry Morgan we have a seemingly noble man. Who starts the book as a hard working Fishing Charter Captain.  Through a series of unfortunate events Harry loses his work as a fishing boat captain.  And goes headlong into the life of a smuggler.<br />Harry seemingly detests this life in the beginning of the narrative, but is somewhat forced into doing it.<br />  It is amazing to see Harry, a man bound by duty to a life he doesn't want to lead, go down the dark dark path of destruction.  The most amazing factor is how Harry appears to lose all his sense of ethics in a heartbeat.<br />  Hemingway discusses one of his favorite themes, duty of man.  Harry has the duty of providing for his wife and daughters and will do whatever it takes to provide for them.<br />  Hemingways narrative reads like a series of flashbacks.  Each time we see Harry he is in a new place in his decent to the abyss.  He gets lower and lower each time.  It all reads with a strong sense of predestination.  It almost seems Harry is destined to walk this path... even though he wouldn't have chosen it initially.  He didn't want to go in this direction.  But he finds himself there and will do what he needs to do.<br />Harry seems so full of integrity at the beginning then begins to do all he can to make this lifestyle work no matter the end result.  He seems driven to provide no matter what he has to do.  It is almost a Machiavellian story.  You have to feel for Harry and his wife.  But Harry makes his choices and lives with them.<br />  Read this book.  It seems to be one of the darker Hemingway novels but it deifinitely satisfies!  A great stroy and a sad story.	2003-01-20

I didn't have the opportunity to read it in High School like many people have, but have always thought about reading it.  Let me tell you... it is worth the wait!<br />I find it interesting that Orwell subtitled this book a Fairy Story.  This \\"Fairy Story\\" has more reality in it than some history books.  Orwell uses animal characters to give us a startling picture of how an idealistic system of thought(Socialism), became a frightening, all consuming machine (Communism).<br />What's so interisting is that the actions of these animals are so indicative of how man reacts to power and privilige.  I don't necessarily agree with socialism, but it is a system of thought that does have some merit.  When you take it on it's own it can lead to real equality and humanity.  But, the truth is, when power hungry leaders get their clutches on it, the result is less than humane.  That is what happened to communism, and it happened so quickly!<br />Is Orwell a political prophet?  His book was written just before WWII and well before the Cold War.  But he surely had a good take on where communism was going and how it would manifest itself.<br />Read the book... you won't be disappointed.  It is a very quick read.  If you have been wanting to read the classics, this is a great book to start with!  Take the time to add this to your reading experience.	2003-01-10

I read The Sun Also Rises before I read For Whom the Bell Tolls,  I thought the latter had struck me deeply and made more sense to me... but there's just something about the former. Hemingway had a real knack for telling about the struggles for finding the meaning of life.  He hit the nail on the head time and again.<br />The Sun Also Rises is all about pain and longing.  I'm a couple of months removed from reading it, but that is the truest take I get from it.  Each character has a distinct pain and longing they are dealing with...  Let me highlight some of these:<br />* Brett--  the beautiful and highly desired object in many man's eyes.  She seems to have it all.  She seems to be right where she wants to be.  But she is truly searching and lost.  It seems the one thing that would make her complete is the one thing she can never truly have...  Jake.  The late night conversations between Jake and Brett, really tug at the heart.  You just wish they could somehow get together.  But it could never be...<br />--The longing and pain of unattainable and unfulfilled desires.<br />*  Robert Cohn--  the man on the outside looking in.  Robert Cohn so deperately wants to be part of the group.  He so deperately wants to be accepted.  He so deperately wants Brett.  But he can never realize any of this because the social group he wishes so much to join has already passed judgement on him and will never let him in.  And poor Robert doesn't realize that it is only \\"WHO\\" he is that is keeping him out forever.  Not just the fact of his ethnic background but his very personality drives him out of the group.<br />--The longing and pain of being on the outside looking in.<br />*  Mike Campbell--  He seems to be at ease in the social group.  He seems to have established himself.  But when you look at his constant barbs at Robert Cohn you can see he is really insecure about his position in life.  Mike isn't a main character but you can see yet another longing when you look at him.  He is actually in...  \\"The In Crowd\\" but doesn't seem to be very sure he is really in at all.  To me that is the human condition in a nutshell.  Always pushing... always grasping...  always looking for more... when all we need is probably right in front of us.  What a shame!<br />--The longing and pain of insecurity within security.<br />*  Jake Barnes--  Last but certainly not least....  Jake.  Jake epitomizes pain and longing in this book.  Jake is the glue that holds this whole group together.  That is a lot of pressure on an individual.  The pressure he is under can be seen clearly by his relationship to Robert Cohn.  He is forced to go through such changes in that singular relationship.  At the beginning of the book he seems to at least have a tolerance for Robert Cohn and then through circumstance he has to sway completely.  He keeps the clashing personalities at bay all through the story.  He seems to keep Brett from crashing and burning over and over again.  I'm sure there might have been a murder between the social combatants somewhere in the story if not for Jake soothing and placating all he came in contact with.  He seems to be the only one in the book who has any social graces and tact. What a lot of pressure on one individual.<br />Jake also has this mysterious wound from the war that keeps him from having a sexual realtionship and connecting to anyone in that way.  How much does this hurt Jake?  How does it affect him?  We don't really get a deep picture of it all...  but it seems to impact him at least minimally and I'm sure it goes much deeper.<br />To me the one thing that would make sense in the whole story would be a realtionship between Jake and Brett.  They seem to fit together...  but they can't.  Jake can't physically, of course, but he is also damaged emotionally and can't find intimacy in a purely emotional connection either.  Isthat lonliness or what?<br />--The longing and pain of holding everyone else together and the longing and pain of wanting... yet not being able to.<br />I think the one thing that makes me rate this book a 5 out of 5 is the fact that I have, at one time or another, felt exactly like all of these characters.  Like I said, Hemingway hit the nail on the head consistently...  he knew what we need, what we miss and what we yearn for. Hemingway like no other novelist understood how we struggle and fight for so much but rarely get what we want.<br /> He painted such a brilliant picture...  take the time to gaze upon it.  This is a wonderful book.ss or what?  <BR>--The longing and pain of holding everyone else together and the longing and pain of wanting... yet not being able to.<br />I think the one thing that makes me rate this book a 5 out of 5 is the fact that I have, at one time or another, felt exactly like all of these characters.

US	33803368	R1NKPPY2GCTSSN	0684803356	896923	For Whom the Bell Tolls	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The Importance of Putting Others First	Hemingway expertly begins this book with John Donne's poem... \\"No Man is an Island...\\" The main theme of this story, to me, is centered around our connection to others. No matter if they are right down the street or across the Atlantic Ocean from us. As Donne said... (I paraphrase weakly) \\"Whenever someone in mankind is hurting, it hurts me because I am part of mankind and mankind is part of me.\\"<br /> This book has several interesting elements:<br />1. Robert Jordan's strong sense of duty.<br />Why does a Spanish professor from Montana decide to leave his obiviously comfortable life to fight with the anti facist guerillas in a far away country? What compels him to give up himself so completely to fight for a people that he seemingly has no connections to? Where does Robert's commitment to duty come from? These questions are addressed and answered expertly by Hemingway in the thought process of Robert, conversations he has and lived out in his very relationships.<br />The book is dominated by Robert's \\"thinking out\\" of his actions in the face of what he has to do. I really enjoyed this facet of the story. I think it adds to the length of the novel but it is definitely worth reading.<br />2. The demise of Pablo's sense of duty and passion.<br />When we meet Pablo in this story, he is a man on the downside of his effectiveness. He no longer has convicitons. He no longer has a will to accoplish his goals. Pablo's lack of determination plays directly against Robert's and Pablo's wife Pilar. It is interesting to look at Pablo, the old leader of the rebel band... and how he is losing his influence over these people. His pride even causes him at times to hurt the anti facist cause, which he once felt so strongly about. Robert and Pilar are both on fire for the cause and it consumes them. Pablo has lost all his fire for the cause and is now apparently useless. (Pablo does experience some redemption in the end...)<br />3. The blossoming relationship between Robert and Maria. Love in the face of impending doom.<br />I'm not usually a big romance guy... at least in the books I read. But the love story between Robert and Maria is beautiful.<br />It grows out of a most impossible situation, Robert the foreign freedom fighter finds Maria the ravaged former war prisoner. She does not necessarily look beautiful on the outside but Robert loves her anyway. He loves who she is, and what she becomes to him.<br />Interesting internal discussions happen for Robert about her. I love the one that talks about how he has to in essence live a whole life with Maria in 3 days. All because he is unsure of whether he will live to have a life with her after the war. These two people really loved each other and would do anything for each other.<br />4. The ultimate sacrifice... Self sacrifice.<br />I don't want to get into the details of the conclusion of the story. Hate to spoil a good read. But the theme of self sacrifice comes through loud and clear. To me, this is the theme of life. We make a real difference when we give up on our sense of self and make an impact on others. Whether they are people we are closely and intimatly related to, or people we have never seen before. Robert Jordan gets it... he puts others first and gives up all he has.<br />Read this book... it is a rewarding experience. It is a war novel, but you will notice I rarely mentioned the war. It is so much more than a war novel. I loved it ... I think you will too.the face of impending doom.<BR>I'm not usually a big romance guy... at least in the books I read.

But I did read it on my own back then... I loved it then and I love it today!  This is a book that stands up each time you read it no matter what stage of life you are in.  Other books struck me as moving in my high school years... and then when I re read them 10 years later they were less than satisfying.<br />But Hemingway's little gem always hits the mark.  I've read it at least 4 times and it hits me fresh each time.<br />You really get to know who Santiago is through his strong dialogue.  What Hemingway says is limited but it says so much! Santiago's feelings are apparent, his hopes and dreams jump out even when it is not written directly by Hemingway.<br />If you read it once... read it again.  If you haven't read it read it now...  This should be required reading!	2002-12-17
