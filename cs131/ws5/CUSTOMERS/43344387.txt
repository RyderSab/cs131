If I had three words to come up with to describe the plot in this book they would be: ping-pong match.<br /><br />Why is that you ask? Because the characters go back and forth, changing their minds literally probably a hundred times. Do they want to be together or not? Sasha and Liam spent the book either in passionate lust or dislike. I really didn't see \\"love\\" between them.<br /><br />I have a issue with how they continue to bring up the difference of their ages (9 years apart), as a reason they're not together. 9 years isn't a big deal, and much of the book you spend saying \\"Get over it!\\" But they never do.<br /><br />Steel's subjects and story line are worn out - I'm sick of gallery owners, and widowers. Come up with something new that hasn't been done that doesn't involve these two subjects! For now, I'm just going to go back and re-read some of her classics. Don't bother with this book - if you must, wait a month or so until you can get one on here or Ebay dirt cheap!	2005-03-10

To let you get a perspective on my review, I've been an R.E.M. fan for over 10 years and own every cd they've ever put out, and am generally obcessive when it comes to them. I've read all the previous books before that were mainly published when R.E.M. was in their heyday of Losing My Religion. I've even reviewed them, and found them to be full of misinformation, hearsay, etc. (Writing a bad review on one book even earned me a nasty email from the author!! lol)<br /><br />But I digress. This book was incredible. It was well thought out and planned. It was completely linear - it only deviated from the timeline in the introduction to the book. Black approached writing this book as one would an academic research paper. He researched, researched, researched, and in his works sited he gave all credits where it was rightly due. I found out much I didn't know about R.E.M. in the early days. The great thing about this book is it's really recent, it goes up to right before Around the Sun came out, and addresses R.E.M.'s political leanings this year against the Iraq War.<br /><br />I hate to use a overused cliche, but I couldn't put this book down all day. I had to read all through it. If you are a die hard R.E.M. fan, or know one, pick up this book as it's the definitive R.E.M. biography out there!!!<br /><br />PS - The one flaw in the book is one picture was credited as being from \\"Out of Time\\" when it was clearly from the \\"Monster\\" era. But that's it!! Good stuff!	2004-12-27

I couldn't believe how many loose threads this story left. There was so much Danielle Steel could have done to make this complete. We never know what happens to Beata, Daphne or anyone else important in the first part of the book. I felt gipped in reading it. Also I felt Amadea being a Carmelite Nun, and then falling in love with men very easily with not much of a problem was an issue. With her latest books not being any of my favorites.. I'm wondering if her best days are behind her.	2004-12-03

I could believe that. The ghost storyline in this book isn't as believeable as it could be and feels flimsy at times. However that's not to stay that this book isn't worthwhile. Nora Roberts is a great read and she knows how to keep a reader on her (or his) seat. I like the fact that Nora Roberts is now putting a seal (NR) on her NEW works. Earlier this year I accidentally bought one of her old works - which was put out to look like a new one. This makes it much easier for me to know that this was new.	2004-11-07

Wow - I've never read a mystery where I have so much in common with the main character. Stephanie Plum is one hell of a character, who is your ordinary everyday 30 something woman become bounty hunter. Evanovich makes the book fast paced and easy to get into. I was recommended into this series and now I'm thrilled that I took the recommendation. I spent two days reading the first three books of the series! This was my favorite of the first three as Stephanie's chemistry with Joe Morelli is fantastic! I've never heard of a bounty hunter \\"catching\\" her prey so many times only to let him go.

Right now all Jennifer Crusie books are being re-released in anticipation of the paperback release of &quot;Bet Me&quot;, and are 3.99 each!! That's new, not even used! So that's my first hint. Go to your local bookstore and save yourself the 3 odd dollars and the cost of shipping!!<br /><br /> Ok now onto the book. Awesome, but at some points, you can be afraid of what Quinn is going through. I was somewhat irked that the subject of domestic violence would be portrayed in a humorous fashion in the book. Same with stalking. I suppose it's central to the plot, but I didn't think it was funny.<br /><br /> Other then that, this book was excellent, true Jennifer Crusie excellence. The idea that one day you realize you've been living a &quot;beige&quot; life, and want something different is something many women can attest to. Quinn stands up for herself quite nicely in the quest for a new life. A recommended read!	2004-08-06

When characters were speaking it was always &quot;and Maddie said&quot;, and &quot;and so and so said&quot; I got so sick of the and said style of speaking by the end of this book.<br /><br /> Good book, but at times it could have been the latest Belva Plain novel with the theme and storyline of finding your high school sweetheart while your marriage is going downhill. The usual Crusie humor does lie beneath though.	2004-08-06

I love her! Her writing is top, and she keeps it realistic enough to be believeable, but humorous too. This was one of her earlier books from the Harlequin &quot;Temptation&quot; line, and we can see what appears to be Harlequin holding her back in someways. &quot;Getting Rid of Bradley&quot; isn't as funny as some of her earlier works. It feels like she's following the rules laid down by Harlequin. However, despite this, it allows her voice to come through. From Lucy with the green hair to the end.. top writing that only gets better!	2004-08-06

The character of Erin Grant is one of the strongest I've seen. She's gone through hell and back, and will do anything to get custody of her child. Hiaasen paints a hilarious picture of the other characters to make sure that the book doesn't get bogged down into a &quot;Poor Little Me&quot; vibe, which admittidly could have happened. I would definitely recommend this, even if you've been put off because of the Demi Moore movie.	2004-06-30

There's that old cliche about not being able to put a book down. This book was truly that. I read it from beginning to end in one long day, and I loved it. From just reading the description I expected a mystery, but this book was so much more. It was about finding out who you truly are, and what you have to go through to find that out.

Dana is a hilarious character, in the many ways she puts things ever so bluntly. I thought the first one would be my favorite, but this one, upon reading it became my favorite of the trilogy.

Megan (which is gaelic for Margaret, who is the lead in Born in Fire) is an artist, who is unaware of how talented she is, etc etc. I felt like I was reading a total rip off, but I suppose since this book was done in 1984, it gave time for Roberts to perfect her craft, to allow her to write a masterpiece such as Born in Fire.

I must say I enjoyed this book, which is odd, since I usually don't go for Nora Roberts earlier books. It's a short read, just over 200 pages, and was published in 1984, which might lead some to think that the writing would be dated as well. In this case it was not. There were no references that would make on think that this book was 20 years old. The story between Colin, the successful Irish painter, and Cassidy, the strugging writer, is a refreshing twist, where they actually did'nt jump into bed with each other. Roberts allowed the storyline and chemistry to develop at a natural pace, instead of Roberts sometimes trademark instant falling in love. I enjoyed this book, as it was light, and sweet.

I couldn't believe how Roberts dropped the ball on the last book. Mia in the previous books was shown to be strong, confident and fearless, but this book tore all that apart, and left me with a feeling of what happened? In many parts Roberts didn't write directly what Mia was thinking, or doing, which led to a disjointed feeling within the book. And the part about Sam coming back as the 4th element? That was so out of left field. I don't know what went wrong, as the other two were so strong. Ripley and Nell were both strong in this book as any other, and Ripley grew tremendously within the book from the previous ones. Buy this to finish up 3 sisters, but don't expect it to be your favorite book of all time.	2004-05-23

For a review to get 5 stars doesn't mean it's perfect, and of course this book is definitely not perfect. IN this book we're dealing with Ripley, the witch who doesn't want to admit that she is one. She battles her attraction to Mac, the hot &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; type paranormal scientist. Ripley is a fascinating character, who really comes alive in this book. In the first one she seemed more closed off and brooding. However the book is not without flaws, as Ripley becomes a stronger character in the next book, which is where Roberts made the mistake. If Ripley had grown as she did in the first part of the third book in the second instead, I think the book would have been that much more interesting. Oh well. A wonderful series none the less, on to the last book!	2004-05-22

This was one of those fantastic books of Nora Roberts, where I lose myself in the writing. Roberts writes this trilogy with a strength not seen since her Born In Trilogy. I felt this book was made up of several different story lines, but instead of Roberts stuffing them into a readers throat at once, she allows them to gracefully develop and emerge as nescesary for the story. Nell Channing is a woman who grows as the story continues, growing in her knowledge that she is a witch. I would say this is an essential summer read!	2004-05-20

I went into reading this book, believing it would be a trilogy, as many of the Nora Roberts books I've read before have been. And in all honesty it could have been a trilogy, with everything in it, but it would have watered down the writing. This was an unbelievable book. There were so many different twists and turns, it kept me on my toes at all times. This is definitely one of my favorite books of the year, and as someone who reads alot, that's definitely no small feat for Nora Roberts. Roberts writes so clearly, and with so much description, you can picture yourself in the Montana outback in the Rockies, hunting down a serial killer in your mist, falling in love, and running a ranch. Willa was the best part of the book, a strong female character who in many ways was a little girl who at the beginning of the book still sought out her father's affection after his death, and at the end of the book, she was a woman, having grown. I loved every minute of it (and was up until 5am reading it! Couldn't put it down!) If this book isn't in your summer reading plans, change them!!	2004-05-18

As a 23 year old, most people my age never watched the series in the 80's because they were too young. I watched it with my mother, and I got into reading the books when they came out in the late 90's. I've read all of them, and in my humble opinion, this is truly the best of the bunch. Bain keeps the characters true to their roots in the series. He gets the characteristics of the New Englanders Seth and Mort down to a science. I loved this one because it was more predictible then the other ones. There's been a few in this series where you've been able to guess who did it, right off. This was definitely not one of those. The character of Sam Lewis described as someone with bigger ears then Yoda, who drives a Pink Caddy, was definitely one of the many highlights of the book. Yes it's a quick read, but definitely a good way to get your summer reading started. Highly recommended!!	2004-05-18

I know after so many years it's hard to keep a strip fresh. But Jim Davis shouldn't let Garfield get so watered down. I've loved Garfield since I was a kid, and own all the books (Number 14 being my favorite), and all the other books Davis has released. I could pick up this book, and go through it without finding a joke that was new, or funny, which of course is a huge let down. Garfield is not Snoopy, where Charles Schultz made the Peanuts Gang interesting and funny as long as he wrote it. After reading this, you get the feeling that Jim Davis was out of new material 10 years ago, and he's just trying to milk the series for all it's worth. Cats don't usually live well into their 30's, so I believe it's time for Davis to start thinking of how to let Garfield ride into the sunset with a scred of dignity left. If you must purchase this book, stop in your local bookstore and leaf through it, to see if you still like it. I love Garfield as much as the next person, but not this way.	2004-05-17

This has got to be one of the best For Better or For Worse books out there. The first part of the book begins with Lynn Johnston setting up the book, telling the backgrounds of Michael and Deanna, and what they went through to get to this point, which I think is an excellent way to begin. If you haven't read some of the earlier strips, this gives you all the background you would need. It also contained some information that would be good even for a die hard FBFW fan.<br />The book is in depth and contains all the strips from before and after the wedding. This would be a great present to give to someone who is getting married for a humorous take on the psychosis of getting married. Highly recommended!	2004-05-17

This book picks up where &quot;With This Ring&quot; finishes. I was actually disappointed with this book after reading the first one. There was no introduction, and the book goes from Michael and Deanna adjusting as newlyweds, only to 1 strip after Baby Meridith is born.

Not the best R.E.M. book I've ever read, but certainly not the worst. This book finishes up at New Adventures in HiFi, before Bill Berry's departure from the band on October 31, 1997. As a huge R.E.M. fan, most of the information wasn't new to me, but I enjoyed it anyways. I had a big gripe with the book, and that was that pictures of the band were not chronologically placed (i.e. a picture from 1991, in &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot;. Also it used many sources that weren't 100% reliable like &quot;most fans&quot;, or &quot;According to an unnamed source in the R.E.M. camp..&quot;, which I felt cheapened it somewhat. It wasn't totally bad, but it wasn't totally good. If you're a casual fan of R.E.M., you'll probably be ok with it, but if you're a rabid R.E.M. fan and this isn't the first book you've read about them, you won't enjoy it as much.	2004-05-17

Now we have to wait until October for the next installment of the series, which seems a ridiculous amount of time.

There was absolutely nothing new to this book. I mean it just felt like everything was taken from other romance novels out there.

There was so little romance in this book, it was more, &quot;I'm going to marry you, and you have no say in the matter.&quot; The 3rd book in the Connelly series dropped the ball. The 1st two were excellent. This one felt like the outsider of the series, it didn't stay true to many of the storylines that had begun in the previous books.

The attitudes that have been established by the characters in the previous 3 books do not stay true in this book.

For a short book, Leanne Banks made sure you got your bang for the buck. This book was well written, and from what I've read the best in the series. It felt like a fairy tale in some aspects, and probably would translate well onto the big screen. The story was a little bit fantasy, but not so much that it felt impropable. There's also a bit of mystery that begins in this book and carries out through the others. Being a fan of the romance genre, I enjoyed this book throughly, and now that I've read the other books in the Connelly Dynasty, I wish they had been held to the same standard as this.	2004-05-11

I probably notice the history content more then I should due to my schooling, but other then that, the book was pretty good. I felt this book was meant to tie up all the loose ends that had come about in the other books from the series. At times this book can come across preachy, but that's just my opinion. I liked this book, but enjoyed the others more.	2004-05-11

This was my first book that I've read by Jennifer Crusie, but it certainly won't be my last. Crusie makes believable characters with more attitude, and more issues then the National Geographic. I could certainly relate to Min's overbearing mother, and her lousy luck with outfits.. well except shoes. We both have excellent taste in those! LOL.. This book was well written, and it was refreshing to have a main character who wasn't the stereotypical female romantic lead. Min is 33, curvy, and very individualistic. The book was not predictable in any way, and it didn't get bogged down in melodramatics. This is definitely going on my favorite books list!	2004-05-09

Anthony in Her Own Words	Books	5	12	12	N	N	An invaluble resource for information on Women's Suffrage	Excellent book, a rare history book where the author allowed the subject of the book to speak in her own words, and not try to speak for the person. Anthony's letters and other correspondence are found in this book, and it's in reading these where we the reader get a more accurate portrayal of Anthony, then what we would read elsewhere. I used this book as one of my resources for a US History class, and it was very well received.I would recommend this book highly to anyone with an interest in the woman's rights movement, or anyone who needs to do a research paper on this remarkable woman. This is one of the rare history books that will always be interesting, as it was presented fairly and without predjudice from the author, or subsequent history. Modern Day Women take the right to vote for granted, but after reading this book, it's very unlikely that they will continue to do so. I know I had a whole new appriciation for my fore-mothers who sacrificed so much. A must read!	2004-05-09

I think that about says it all. I bought this book by sight, not reading the back - believing it was a new Nora Roberts book. NOPE. It was two books she wrote for Harlequin back in the early 80's. To read these is like pulling teeth. The books are very dated in their writing. And as for romance? There is none. In the first book, the character of Jake is made out to be the male romantic lead, but comes across as a male chauvinist pig. He's always forcing himself on Samantha. And Samantha just takes it.

I love to decorate, but as you probably know most decorating books cover just one subject, one room, or one style of decorating. This book truly covers everything and anything. It covers the hows, the whys, the color theory, and presents many pictures of beautiful rooms. Whenever I'm stumped for what to do in a room, I pick up this book and leaf through it. I have not been let down even once. There's always an idea I can adapt to whatever I'm looking for at that particular moment. I would highly recommend this book. It's a bit big, and might seem overwhelming to some, but don't try to read it all in one day. Leaf through it gingerly, or fast forward to a particular room you are wanting to work in. You will be inspired to try somethings, but always adapt them to what you would enjoy in your own home. In the summer months, my husband and I will be re-doing our 100 year old kitchen, and this book has already given me plenty of ideas to work with. Pick this book up, before all others. You can always narrow your decorating focus as you go on, and buy books on that focus. This book gives you everything and more.	2004-05-03

Suzanna and Tim have more issues than the National Geographic. Which made it enjoyable to read. I would recommend it, but read Love To Love You Baby, which was the first in the series.	2004-05-02

The portrait that she paints of Rick is someone without sin, a Godly man, who always aspired to be an astronaut. I felt she could have been more open and honest, and a bit less preachy at times.<br />Otherwise this book was touching. The real tragedy is that before the Columbia Disaster we as Americans did not consider the Astronauts who routinely risked their lives in manned space flight heroes. Space Shuttle launches were considered routine. The Columbia Disaster was a horrible wake up call. Reading what Rick had to do to get into the Space Program, all the training, all the sacrafices he made, was facinating. Rick Husband was a hero before he ever got into the cockpit of the Space Shuttle Columbia, and this book shows why.	2004-04-24

The charactor of Emily Barrett is strong willed, and intelligent, which is something romance novels sometimes lack.

First of all, Simon probably didn't write the book, it was most likely ghost written.<br />Secondly, it was a short read, not worth the price.

I would think that would have done much better. The fact that he wrote about it candidly and without as much ego as the rest of the book earns it that extra star.<br />Do yourself a favor, and just watch American Idol.

As a member of a train group, this mystery hit close to home. I enjoyed it greatly as I have with all the other Murder She Wrote mysteries. The best thing about the book is the way the author wrote it in Jessica Fletcher's authentic voice. If you've ever watched Murder She Wrote, Jessica has a very distinct way of putting things, and the way she acts. This is all continued in the books.<br />This was probably one of the better MSW books, as I had a difficult time figuring out who done it. There was a MSW special on TV about 10 years ago with many of the same plot twists and turns about a train murder (only this one was set on an Amtrak train). Pick this up for a good mystery read which may on the surface look like an easy simple mystery, but is much deeper.	2004-04-05

Of course an incident always brings people together. That's just par for the course. This book read like one of Danielle Steels newer ones (The ones that have fallen in quality). You're better off reading another Plain book.	2004-04-02

I read the Deep End of the Ocean, and I must admit, it didn't touch me, as this book did. The Most Wanted is a title that fits the book for many reasons, but mostly for the reason this book is all about being wanted: as a daughter, a criminal, a lover, a mother, and a wife. To where you feel the most wanted, and who you feel the most wanted by is where you'll be the happiest. The main message is if you're not the most wanted, find somewhere you will be. I must say again HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2004-03-31

Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I was expecting something more spiritually rounded with stories from all different faiths.

I recently went back and re-read it. I found it to still be a beautiful love story, but somehow it doesn't hold the same power over me as it used to. Somehow if you keep in mind, she remarried a Russian figure skater, and had a daughter with him, it sounds more like a Harlequin Romance Novel, instead of a tragic autobiography.<br />However, if you can keep that out of your mind, you'll appriciate the love that was between Sergei and Katia, and feel her deep sorrow.	2004-03-31

I haven't read &quot;The Daddy Quest&quot; which is the book that preceeds this one, but I found this one to be pretty good. All Harlequin romances are formulaic, and predictible, but I was hooked onto reading this. According to the back of the book the premise is:<br />&quot;Colin Luchetti's brother Bobby is missing and the only clue is a cryptic not sending Colin to Wind Lake. What he finds when he gets there is unexpected - a day care center complete with kids, a runaway guinea pig, and Marlie Anderson, the owner.<br />With all his options gone, Colin decides to wait in Wind Lake for word on Bobby. Even though he itches to get out into the &quot;real world&quot;, the more time he spends with Marlie, the more he admires her. But for his family's sake Colin needs to focus on solving the mystery of his brothers disappearance. Can he do it without falling for the woman his brother loves?&quot;<br />Of course the answer to that question is No. The book is part Black Hawk Down, part Daddy Day Care, and part Runaway Bride. The characters are well developed, and the ending is good enough not to be guessed at too quickly. I would recommend this highly for fans of the romance genre.	2004-03-28

These stories were hilarious, and showed me that science could be interesting if presented correctly. This past semester I took my first science course in 6 years - Intro to Physics!

She wishes it to be a little girl, because she feels that a little boy would be cold to her. She did end up having a little boy. I would like to see how this has worked with her career, her time at Caesar's Palace, and her fathers death. Many of the stories in her book are very touching, but she tends to be on the melodramatic side more times then not. I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that it was disturbing to read about her ideas of seducing Rene Angelil when she was 14. Rene and Celine have a beautiful love story, but at 14 that would be wrong, and it feels invading to read it. She does come across as a diva in many points, but all of these shortcomings are minor compared to the wonderful story she writes.	2004-03-28

I haven't seen such a book with mixed reviews such as this one, so I decided to throw my two cents in for what it is worth. The book follows Danielle Steels usual upper class romance with &quot;famous&quot; characters and plentiful wealth. I enjoyed this book and found it quite humorous and touching. Steel's formulaic characters are starting to get a little old, and I believe she should try something new.	2004-03-28

It's full of tips and full descriptions of the park, and rides. It explains all the ins and outs of Disney, while making it an easy read by the full color pictures and interesting commentary. A must for anyone on their way to Disney this year. Even if you have last years edition, do pick up this one! I buy a new one every year for my annual trip to Disney, and I find they do change. A good thing about Birnbaums guide is the fact that they rely on what the Disney vistors say about the rides, not just some public relations person from Disney. Also this book is sold in the Disney stores, so you know it's reliable. I recommend this book highly!	2004-03-24

Somehow, Cox manages to pull all these elements together to make for one fascinating book. The local element of speaking (London 1952) might be difficult for some, but on the whole it's fairly easy to understand the characters. I enjoyed this book throughly and found the style of writing to be very similar to another one of my favorite books &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot;. Definitely pick up this book if you have a chance.	2004-03-23

I'm not adopted but when my parents divorced, the whole family wanted to adopt me, and it split my family to this very day, 10 plus years later. The emotions that Gordon felt were very real. You want the best for the child, but if nothing's working in bringing the child to your home, you give up. I love Mitchards writing, and I think this one to be one of her best. Yes there is alot of background information, but as with anything to get a clear picture of a story you need that clarity. She has to detail everything. I couldn't put this book down, and enjoyed it. The ending was quite interesting and unexpected which is a pleasure when you get to the point that you think you could guess the ending to every book when they get formulaic. Pick this one up, with &quot;The Most Wanted&quot; and I guarantee you'll have a weekend worth of excellent reading.	2004-03-23

My husband is a home carpenter, a fix it all man. We both enjoy Trading Spaces. I have purchased a few of the other Trading Spaces books, but found myself disappointed. My favorite designers are Frank and Laurie, and I just had no use for the other designers parts of the books, so I sold them off. This book I bought on a lark for my husband, because we both think Ty is hilarious. My husband was extremely impressed with the ideas that were presented by Ty, and the manner in which they were presented. Alot of the technicial advice that lies inside is accurate, and factual and even my other half got some great tips from it. There are some off the wall ideas for decorating as one reviewer said, but you don't have to impliment them, but one can appriciate them as original. This book is great for a starter book, but even a seasoned professional can get something out of every page - a must buy! And if you want to go more into the details of home improvement or decoration I recommend the dummies or complete idiots series. These books are great for the beginner and encompass many different aspects of the areas. From there you can progress to magazines, or books that specialize in your particular interest.	2004-03-21

As the Garfield comic strip has gotten older, we've seen Jim Davis struggle to keep it fresh. Don't get me wrong, I own every single garfield book out there, but Get Fuzzy has definitely come into it's own as a successor to the throne. The adventures of Rob, with Bucky and Satchel are even funnier then Garfield, because in contrast to Garfield, Bucky and Satchel actually can talk and interact to humans. They are very up to date with the times, and will talk about issues that happen in real life in the strip quite often. One of my favorite strips is the one where Rob won't give up his Red Sox hat to Bucky, so Bucky goes out into the world and finds a Yankees hat much to Rob's mismay. As a Red Sox fan, I love how Conley is a huge Red Sox fan and portrays that in his work. As I've grown up, Garfield has grown with me, but now I feel I've grown out of that and into Get Fuzzy. Highly recommended for a good laugh!	2004-03-21

However at the end, I felt that there was really no resolution to the various aspects of the book. It really gets good, and then all of a sudden BAM, its at the end. You're left with many questions.

The only problem I had was the fact I read the book that comes after this one &quot;This Can't Be Love&quot; before I read this one! Anyodd, it was a great read. I enjoyed the charactors, even though I pretty much knew what was going to happen because of reading &quot;This Can't Be Love First&quot;. My view of Jane as a character changed immensely with this book, and I found her to be much like her wacky cousin Molly, only a tad more reserved. In the other book, Michaels portrays Jane as a dull stick in the mud spinster. These two books have made me quite the fan of Michaels works, and I will continue to read her books. I recommend this as a light read, nothing too heavy in it, take it with you on a beach vacation!	2004-03-21

I don't usually run out and buy a hardcover book immediately, but Luanne Rice books make me go and do just that. This book was well written and very touching. The whole premise of the story is Jane comes home to help her sister take care of her mother, but we find out she has come home for a very different reason and that is to find her daughter. As with any Luanne Rice book, Rice never puts all her cards on the table at once. She very slowly reveals her intentions for the charactors development chapter by chapter. The magical web she weaves makes us long to read more to understand and to develop the character in our mind. I spent a night reading this, I just couldn't put it down. Luanne Rice is in fine form. Anyone who enjoys books with a coastal flair will always enjoy Rice's books.	2004-03-21

I enjoyed this one enough, but it was not a favorite of mine. I felt that she jumped around between the charactors quite frequently, never spending enough time with her strongest lead charactor Cass. Sometimes I also felt that the parts where she cut off to what little Josie was thinking were rather odd, and disjointed containing little pertantent information to the story line. Pick up her newest book Dance with Me instead of this one. I guarentee you won't be disappointed.	2004-03-21

Yes it can be racist, and extremist at times, but at it's core you're reading a piece of history. For a book to sell 300,000 copies during it's original publication in the mid 19th century is astounding. You're reading a book that had a part in the Civil War, the bloodiest war of our history. I did find while reading it that many parallels can be made between this book and \\"Black Beauty\\". Coincidence? Perhaps, but worth looking at in a review, or report. To read this and think that America permitted this slavery to go on for years, would be enough to disgust anyone. America's history is a bloody one, one that we need to remember, and reading this book will make you appriciate your freedom now, as an American. Please do keep in mind however, the slave trade is still going not to America, but places in Europe and Asia, even with the U.N outlawing it in 1953. I just cannot say how much this book made me think about the world past and present. Most highly recommended.	2004-03-21

According to the copyright, it was printed in 1979, so to someone who wasn't born then I find it a bit dated. The story line is very typical Danielle Steel with a rich girl meeting a wealthy guy. It's formulaic, but it has worked many times for her, so why change. The aspect of Tom after he gets injured is a bit overwhelming at times, and Kate never seems to get her romance with Nick off the ground. But I enjoyed her interaction with her son, and where Steel showed Kate's vulnerability after Tom's accident. As another reviewer said it's a read only if you're a die hard Steel fan. If not, I would recommend one of her more recent books such as the Dating Game.	2004-03-21

As a fan of Trading Spaces this was the first book I saw out with the Trading Spaces name on it, so I bought it up but quick. Wow.. I cannot say how much I was disappointed. This book was a very VERY entry level book on color. I had no interest in much of the book, as the color schemes were too off the wall for me. A better book on color would be Home Decorating for Dummies or the Color Directory. One could go to an elementary art class and learn the information within this book. Total disappointment. I could have read it in the store and gotten the exact same information I took away with me. Avoid!	2004-03-21

An author can write a short book and it will be well received (i.e. The Gift) but this book falls very short of that lofty expectation. I felt while reading this Steel took her formula of putting wealthy people into everyday situations and just wrote a book to get it out to her publishers for some deadline. I read this book in an hour, and at the end of it, I found myself extremely disappointed. It's one thing if the book is good, and short, but this was not that. I would advise you not to waste your money on this book, but if you do want to read it, borrow it from your local library or a friend.	2004-03-21

This is the first time I've read Kasey Michaels, and I loved it. The charactor of Molly is well developed, and we see why she acts the way she does. After I read this, I read her book &quot;This Must Be Love&quot; which brings in Molly's cousin Janie. You should ideally read that first before this one. These books take place at the same time with the books interweaving their respective storylines, which is neat. I would recommend this book to anyone - but read the other one first!	2004-03-21
