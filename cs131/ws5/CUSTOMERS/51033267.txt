This is one of those books that doesn't change the way you look at certain things, but just skews them a bit. I can't look at a pack of camel cigarettes the same way. I feel deep into this story without even really knowing it. Next thing I knew, I was in a story that seemed so close, so intimate. Let me tell you, it's a great feeling. Superb story, superb writing.	2001-08-15

This diary of a 14 year old girl who was not only raped but left with the HIV virus is gut-wrenching. This poor girl had her life taken away from her before it really ever started. The fact that it's a true story makes it all the harder to read. I felt so bad for Nancy and was close to tears more than a few times during the course of the book. She goes from depression to happiness, trying to fight off the Virus, and sometimes even mentally convincing herself she can do it, other times she just wants to die. It's a look into the mind of a young teenage girl that has to go through something noone at any age deserves to go through. Her budding romance with a different boy her age was probably the hardest to read, as both she and I knew her talk of growing old with him and having his children, whould never happen, since some older guy decided to rape her. I feel for Nancy, and anyone else going through the same situation, this book was a real eye-opener.<br />This book isn't just for teenage girls either, I'm a 24 year old guy and still found this book to be an excellent experience. Do yourself a favor and read this book, you'll be a better person because of it.	2001-03-15

I appreciate it, it's a sad story about a lonely girl you in all honestly gets into drugs almost by accident. And like we've heard all through life, it's almost impossible to get off drugs once they get their hooks into you. Alice has poured her life into her diary, and because of this we get to see the first hand effects of what exactly drug use can do. This isn't a sugar coated story, nor should it be. I've never met Alice, but after reading this, I feel like I have. This book is really for everyone, as I'm a 24 year old guy and loved it. I'm a better person for having read it.	2001-03-15

A motivational book that actually motivates!	This book it alot like Pat Croce himself, engaging, interesting, and high-energy. I usually shy away from books like this becuase they tend to be preachy. That is not the case here. Mr. Croce has made a life for himself by thinking positivly, and there's no doubting what he has been able to accomplish. Being a Philadelphia-area native, I remember his radio show and morning spot on the news. I remember getting ready to go to high-school in the morning, and while I can barely get myself out of bed, Croce is on live TV, full of vigor and life few of us can experience on our best days. This book will no doubt motivate and inspire, all without talking down to you. This is a book for the people, by one of the biggest person in the world. We're talking about a man who gave some poor kids a lift to a sixers game when they didnt have any other way to get there. Or the man who flew down from the rafters on a harness when the sixers were in the playoffs. Read this book, you will take alot more from it that you'd expect.	2001-02-08

But for such a young author, Rebbecca Ray shows a considerable amount of promise. It would've been nice if the book had been broken up into chapters, instead of just running on and on. Also, I found it a little ridiculous that this 14 year old girls parents didnt seem to mind the fact that she was dating a 31 year old man. <br />There were flashes of promise in this book, but those seemed to be left by the wayside as the plot seemed to stumble along at points, never really coming to any kind of closure at the end. <br />All in all, like I said, it isn't the worst book I've ever read, but there are so many good books out there, I wouldn't spend time reading this one.	2000-12-18

Many storylines that intertwine and eventually come together at the end, when everything plotwise goes to hell. This was a very enjoyable book to read, and quick read, you're not going to be challenged here, but for gen-x readers, these are the kinda books that we like.

I remember seeing a commercial for this book on MTV about 2 years ago, and just never looked into it. I was told about a similar book &quot;The Perks of being a Wallflower&quot;, which I bought on amazon and saw that this was a recommendation, so I picked it up. I enjoyed it, but unlike the wallflower book, I didnt love it. And since they kind of lumped together, I compared the 2. There is a very witty and interesting story here, and while kind of off the wall, seems pretty grounded in reality. This guy's life spirals out of control so fast that not only doesn't he see it, but neither does the reader. A fun read.	2000-09-28

I was never a complete nerd, I had my close set of friends, but was never a jock, or one the coolest kids in class. Much like our &quot;hero&quot; Charlie, I discovered things at a slow pace, enjoyed high school, but think back that it could've been better. This book took me back to high school (even though I just graduated in 95) and I loved the ride man. All the while I read this book I pictured myself trudging down my high school halls, being late for class, hang out during lunch... Just a fantastic book, triggers a good walk down memory lane. Read it and enjoy.	2000-09-21

There's a primer about 2 pages long at the beginning of the book and that's  it. This is just pictures upon pictures upon pictures of rave flyers from  all over america. I was happy to see Philadelphia so well respresented.  This book was an inspiration to me, by and large because this is the kind  of design I love, and want to do for myself. This would make an excellent  coffee-table book, and a great conversation piece.	2000-08-11

Every time I eye it on my shelf I have to stop what I'm doing and pull it out, sit on the floor, and pour over the pages... This is wonderful art for the generation  X/Y age group. Not to cram too many buzzwords into this review, but this  stuff really is on the edge... it's out there... I'll be a happy man is  this is the direction the art world takes in the next few years...<br />This  book takes an empty approach to design... lots of white and black space  with strange freeze frames of different video and web pieces. Unlike most  of the digital art books today, this does not have a companion CD-rom.  Thats what makes this book so interesting, is that you have digital moving  art, frozen, taken out of context, and put to paper. There's not many books  like this, too bad.	2000-07-31

This book is fantastic	When it comes to new media, no one does it better than Rushkoff. This book, &quot;Media Virus&quot;, and especially &quot;Coercion&quot;... all  books shed excellent light on the information age.. and not just the doom  and gloom or bubblegum optimism we usually get thrown at us. Rushkoff takes  everything apart, explains it all in realistic ways, then puts it all back  together for us. Like Coercion, this book should be on the required reading  lists of every worthwhile college in the country. I am better prepared to  handle the world and my job (computers) for having read this book.	2000-07-18

Unlike other Bachman stories, this one just takes to long to get moving. Once it does, it's a great story, much  like the movie falling down.

While books are usually better than the book, this one isn't even a contest, this books is light years ahead of the movie (not that the movie was breaking new boundaries, but as far as action goes, it  wasn't bad). <br />A man goes on a game show, and needs to run from a team of  hunters for 30 days. He ca go anywhere he wants, he just has to mail back  videos to the studio. So what's the catch? The public gets paid in rewards  to turn him in so they can watch him get killed on television. <br />With all  the reality based tv shows we have nowadays, is it impossible to imagine  this happening?	2000-07-13

The movie compliments this book well, which is rare. This doesn't take long to read at all, since King hooks you and  just won't let go.

I read the first third of this book, then pages here and there, and I was disgusted. I was digusted the same why as when I read American Psycho years later, but at  least in AP's defense, it was FICTION. This book had potential, it could've  been a real look at a system that doesn't care about the people that are in  it, how he rose above all of this and achieved anyway. But Mr. Mcall seems  happy just telling us how it's everybody's fault but our own, and &quot;did  I tell you the time I gang-raped this girl?&quot; &quot;Or how it was some  girl's fault that she got pregnant, and I'm not taking care of it&quot;.  This book marked my one and only failed class in college, I refused to  finish it. I let my mother read some of it, and after she read about 10  pages, she completely supported my decision. There are much better books  about the human condition, don't waste your time here.	2000-07-12

This isn't a book that wisks you away to exotic locales,  high adventure and what not. It's a story about a boy in a walking race  with 99 other young men. The book revolves around how these people deal  with each other knowing only one of them can win the race, and live. Would  you make friends with them to pass the time? Knowing that only one of you  is walking away from it? Listen to their sob stories about why they need to  win? With your life on the line, can you afford that distraction? That is  what this book is all about, and it's fantastic. Easily one of King's best	2000-07-08

This book got me back into reading again. After hearing a girlfriend of mine talking about it I went and picked it up. Boy am I glad I did! The majority of the books takes  place in one locale, with one character, with some cool tie overs to  Dolores Claiborne.

One of those cult things that just goes on for years and years. Instead, this book was dead out of the gate, because even the people that love videogames can't like this book because  alot of the information is wrong. Game titles, years, people, etc. Of  course not all the information is wrong, but I had wanted to use this book  (one of the few on videogames) in a research paper in college and it just  wasn't reliable.

This is not an engaging story about the rise and fall of videogames. This is more a historical account of the rise and fall of videogames. Which is a good thing.

A book that disgusted me to the point of not recomending it because of its violence. I'm a 23 year old kid who grew up around all this media violence and consider myself pretty desensitized  to all of it, especially in terms of books. I'm a believer that violence  can have a point(fight club) but it just doesn't have a point here. This is  sex and gore for the sake of controversy alone. Free publicity was the  motivation, it had to be, because nowhere in the 400 page novel does a plot  ever get started it just goes on and on about what his friends are wearing,  the girls he has sex with, and why and how he kills them. murder, violence,  sex, all can add up to an intriguing story, but Ellis is more concerned  with giving us graphic details of sex positions and killing sprees then he  is with giving us a reason to keep reading. There's better books out there,  (Basic Eight, Virgin Suicides) don't waste your time here.	2000-07-05

This story was one of the  most tragic I have ever read, but at the same time strangely beautiful. The  imagery was so vivid that this is one of those books where your imagination  runs away with you. Reading this book, you can see and feel these poor  girls suffer, and although the ending is given away a few times during the  book, it doesn't make it any less enjoyable.
