This book is really good because of all of the events that take place. Paul the narrator plays on a great soccer team, but it took a hard time to get on it. He has to meet new friends who he gets along with pretty well.Erik, his brother, has a football dream. He wants to get into a good colledge.Erik gets into trouble and everything falls about.The place they moved to has storms everyday at the same time; along with a lot of citrus groves. The thing i didn't like about this book was that it didn't give a lot of detail at tyhe ending.This is why i rated the book 3 stars. You should read this book if u like a book that is mysterious.	2003-04-02

With Paul's dad focused on nothing but the \\"Erik Fisher Football Dream\\" they are trying to hide the truth from Paul about his glasses and make his brother, Erik, the star.

Louis Sachar did an excellent job on this story. This story is about Stanley Yelnants who is sent to Camp Green Lake for stealing a pair of famous baseball shoes. While Stanley is at Camp Green Lake he is forced to dig holes like all the other boys there. After awhile Stanley begins to think maybe they aren't just being punished. Maybe they are doing the Warden's dirty work. So when Stanley's friend, Zero, runs away he decides, a few days laters, maybe Zero might still be alive and he should go after him. Well, I can't give too much away or it will ruin it but I'll tell you if you like suspenceful or mystery books this book is for you. I hope you like it as much as I did!	2003-04-01
