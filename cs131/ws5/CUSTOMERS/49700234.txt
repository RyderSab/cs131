I have to say, the authors make Zephram Cochrane sound like a selfless, noble, perfect hero instead of just a normal, ordinary guy. I am getting tired of hearing every hero is noble, selfless, brave man who always  risks his life  to give a good contribution to the civilization. <br /> I love the movie  because it truly defines Zefram Cochrane's charaxcter. He's not only a  non-perfect guy but he's greedy and selfish. <br />Yes, I admit this is a  beautifully written book and I enjoyed reading it but you can't argue with  the movies.	2000-04-26

When i learned Michael Friedman's writing this book, it's sooo cool. His storytelling never ceases to amaze me. I loved the interaction between Worf and Wolverine and not to mention that between Picard and Storm. I'm even gladder to own the comic  prequel before this book came.	2000-04-24

It is full of inaccuracies. <br />For example, if Romulans in Goldin's pathetic excuse for a story are honorable, then why did the Romulan try to shoot a  defenseless woman?    Second thing is this book is racist stuff. If Goldin  cited all Klinons are treacherous, then he must be implying all Germans are  nazis, Irish are alcoholics and terrorists, etc. I would not say those  words. I don't even imply them.	2000-04-18

Worse, some of the authors including Blish and  Goldin discredited the klingons as dishonorable and deceitful. <br />John M.  Ford is the genius. he not only did NOT used Klingons as stereotypes but  also his book can help anyone understand the Klingon concept of honor.     <br />I would recommend this book.	2000-04-18

Daffyd ab Hugh does more than a good job describing and delving Odo's and Quark's  relationship. That's why i also enjoyed &quot;Fallen Heroes&quot;.  Odo vs Quark is more amusing than Spock vs McCoy.<br />I loved the moments  when Quark quarreled with Odo and Odo blackmailed Quark. It was hilarous.  <br />This book about Klingon character is okay.	2000-04-18

When i first read this book, I was so hooked I kept reading and rereading this splendid book.

Dillard has done a splendid job intrepreting one of my favorite ST movies. I mean J.M. Dillard's knowledge and understanding of Klingon culture is not only more than adequate but  also is almost genuinely flawless.  There is no more unique Klingon than a  bald, one-eyed Shakespearean Klingon like General Chang. Only a  human-raised Klingon in Starfleet can equal to it in uniqueness.	2000-04-13

Writing a story about a Klingon pacifist teaching humans is not only a new idea but an intriguing idea as the concept of a human-raised  Klingon in Starfleet.<br />Although I must congratulate Mr. Ferguson on his  spectacular book, it pales in comparision with Mr. Ford's Final Reflection  and Mr. Friedman's Kahless. No offense, Mr. Ferguson.	2000-04-13

The concept of having Spock babysitting a Vulcan child in this story is a bit dull.<br />Only two reasons this book deserves three stars because  1) I loved the way how  the author treats pardek's character. Too bad it's not the focus of the  story.  2) I like the part about tribbles. It's humorous.	2000-04-13
