Hal Clement is the pseudonym of Harry Clement Stubbs.  He was originally a high school teacher, and his approach to science fiction established the sub-genre known as hard science fiction.  \\"Mission of Gravity\\" is undoubtedly is most well known work, and it was recognized by the fans and fellow authors numerous times.  In 1955 it was nominated for the International Fantasy award.  In 1956 it tied for 18th on the All-Time Poll for best science fiction book, and was ranked 15th on the same poll in 1966.  Locus readers rated it 16th in 1975 for novels, 36th in 1987 for sf novels, and 37th in 1998 for sf novels written before 1990.  In 1994 it won the Ignotus award for best foreign novel.  Lastly, it was nominated for the retro Hugo award for the year 1953 for best novel. <br /> <br />Hal Clement used the scientific theory and facts of 1953 to build an unusual world and shape an intriguing story.  He created Mesklin, a disc-shaped planet with a very wide radius at the equator and much smaller between the poles.  As a result the gravity changes radically depending where one is on the surface, from as little as three times that of Earth at the equator, to several hundreds of times that of Earth at the poles.  The planet is inhabited by Mesklinites, who are a millipede type people much smaller than humans.  The premise of the story is that an Earth probe which has crashed near one of the poles needs to be recovered, but it is impossible for humans to survive in such an environment and so they enlist the aid of the Mesklinites to recover the needed data. <br /> <br />In addition to the science of the story, Clement does a good job of creating an alien society, where trade and profit are the prime factors.  He also creates interesting characters and an engaging story.  The most interesting character is the alien commander, Barlennan, with whom Charles Lackland, one of the humans, communicates and works throughout the story.  The story has become dated, as one would expect given the advances in science over the last 50+ years.  However, in spite of this and because of the great job of characterization and story telling, this remains a book well worth reading.	2005-10-06
US	53054493	R29ILYIVDLNLFI	1565849582	470636295	In Time Of War: Hitler's Terrorist Attack On America	Books	4	10	13	N	N	Relevant History	Pierce O'Donnell has written a find history of an attempted terrorist attack on America by Nazi Germany.  He examines it from the legal side of how it was handled.  In doing so he looks at the legal precedents set earlier such as those from the Civil War, and other key periods in history. <br /> <br />The first section of the book called \\"Military Necessity\\" covers the entire sabotage mission, from the preparation, through the operation, and finally the betrayal by one of the saboteurs which resulted in all of them men being arrested.  O'Donnell does a good job of telling us about the saboteurs, why they were chosen, how they were trained, and what they did when they were in the United States. <br /> <br />The second section titled \\"The Rule of Law\\" covers the legal aspects of the case.  It tells us why a Military trial was used, and how President Roosevelt tried to force a quick guilty verdict and execution.  The best part of this section though is the details of the representation the saboteurs received from Colonel Kenneth C. Royall. <br /> <br />The final section is titled \\"A Cautionary Tale\\", and it covers the aftermath of the trial, as well as what happened to the key characters involved in it.  It then moves on to relate the actions by President Roosevelt then to those undertaken by President Bush after the September 11th attacks.  He covers the Supreme Court cases which have resulted from the administrations policies, and being a lawyer he is able to attack the actions of the administration from strong legal grounds.  It is this section of the book which changes this book from a history of an event at the start of World War II, to one which has strong input into current events. <br /> <br />It is refreshing to read a book which touches on September 11th and the war in Iraq which doesn't resort to name calling, but rather deals with the issues intelligently, looking at historical and legal precedents.  Oddly enough the strength of the book is also perhaps itsbiggest weakness.  The legal discussion is clearly Mr. O'Donnell's strength, but it can be difficult for those without a legal background to follow.  Nevertheless, this is a book which should be read	2005-10-01
US	53054493	R26KLNS2GQAFGC	1886778108	85478235	Major Ingredients	Books	4	10	10	N	Y	Long Forgotten Treasures	This is a very good collection of 30 short stories by Eric Frank Russell.  First published in 2000, this brought back into print a large number of stories which today's science fiction lovers could not easily find.  When combined with \\"Entities\\", published in 2001, there is at long last a solid foundation of Russell's works, both novels and shorter pieces, in print again for the first time in a long time.    There are too many stories here to cover them all, but the highlights include \\"Allamagoosa\\", the first short story ever to win a Hugo, \\"Dear Devil\\", \\"Jay Score\\", \\"Study In Still Life\\", \\"Top Secret\\", and many more.  Also included are an Introduction by Jack L. Chalker, and an Afterword by \\"Mike Resnick\\".  Russell's stories focus mainly on ideas, rather than characters, which is something some readers may not like.  Chalker and Resnick offer some wonderful insights into his work and why it is that Russell's work has often been overlooked when it comes to awards and recognition.  This collection was ranked 6th on the Locus Poll for Collections in 2001.	2005-09-08

It is the first English translation of this title, and it is the last of his works to be published in his lifetime.  This is the first book in the \\"Early Classics of Science Fiction\\" series from Wesleyan University Press, and the quality of the presentation is outstanding.  There is an introduction by Arthur B. Evans where he covers the history of \\"Invasion Of The Sea\\", and its place in Verne's writing and life.  He also discusses Verne's opinion of the differences between his writing and that of H. G. Wells.  Evans also has a very interesting discussion of the problems with many of the English translations of Verne's books.   The text itself includes the illustrations by Leon Benett, as well as notes which discuss the real world history which created the base of the story. <br /> <br />The story doesn't rise to the level of the presentation.  However, it does make an interesting study for several reasons.  Despite being written near the end of Verne's life, there are certainly several similarities to his earlier work.  The story takes place in Africa, the same continent as his first novel \\"Five Weeks In A Balloon\\".  The story also has a pro-science feel to it, which had disappeared in his later works.  There are significant differences as well.  In Verne's earlier works the characters are active in the pursuit of the goal, but in this story the Sahara Sea is created not by the actions of the characters, but instead by a natural event. <br /> <br />Overall, this book is recommended for those who want to study Verne, or those who are compiling a complete collection of his works.  If you are looking for a good example of his works, it would be better to stick with one of his classics.	2005-08-31

It was also recognized by the fans in 1956 when it tied for 3rd on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll, and in 1966 when it was rated 19th on the same poll.  It ranked 9th on the Locus All-Time Poll in 1975 for All Time Novels, 12th in 1987 for All Time SF Novels, and 13th in 1998 for SF Novels before 1990.  It was also nominated for the Retro Hugo in 2004 for works published in 1953.<br /><br />Sturgeon tells his story by using three shorter works.  They tell the story of the next step in the evolution of man, which is named \\"Homo Gestalt\\".  As separate people, Lone, Janie, Bonnie, Beanie, and Baby do not fit into society, but when they are together, they are a fully functional being.  There are some tells in my description of the three parts of the story, so skip the rest if you don't want to risk any spoilers.  The three parts of the story are:<br /><br />\\"The Fabulous Idiot\\" is a novelette which was first published in this book.  It is the story of the creation of `Homo Gestalt'.  It focuses largely on the story of Lone, who is the `idiot' from the title.  For most of his life, he is largely ignored, although he does have telepathy and mind control powers that he uses, unknowingly, to get people to casually give him food or money so that he can survive.  We also learn about of Janie (telekinesis), and the twins, Bonnie and Beanie (teleportation), and Baby (super-intelligent).  This story jumps around from group to group, giving the reader the back-story for the characters, and eventually brings them together, and at the end they learn their roles in `Homo Gestalt'.<br /><br />\\"Baby Is Three\\" is a novella which was originally published in \\"Galaxy\\" in October of 1952.  This story takes place a few years in the future, from the viewpoint of Gerry, who is seeking help from a psychiatrist to help him understand who he is.  While exploring his past, we learn that Lone brought Gerry into the group and that when Lone died, the group stayed together seeking help from an old acquaintance of Lone, whom we met briefly in the first section.  As Gerry gains understanding and recovers memories, we ultimately find that he is Lone's replacement in `Homo Gestalt', and while Lone's simplicity was a handicap for the group before, Gerry's lack of morals is the new challenge to their survival.<br /><br />\\"Morality\\" is a novelette which was originally published in this book.  This part of the story follows Hip Barrows, who is desperately trying to recover his lost memories.  Somewhat similar in style to the previous section, it takes place a few years farther in the future, and it is a character reconstructing the past.  Hip is aided in his attempts to reconstruct his past by Janie.  We learn that Gerry decided to destroy Hip's life and that even while trying to remember, they are being pursued by Gerry and the rest of `Homo Gestalt'.  Hip's only chance for survival is if he can make Gerry understand the need for an ethic for the new species.	2005-08-20

Simak Centennial Edition of \\"City\\" includes all the stories form the original book from 1952 (although in a different order) as well as an Introduction written in 1976, and a final story called \\"Epilog\\" written in 1973 as a tribute to John W. Campbell.  This book won the International Fantasy award in 1953 for fiction, was rated 2nd on the Astounding/Analog Poll for books in 1956, and then 9th in 1966.  It was also rated 30th on the 1987 Locus All-Time Poll for All Time SF Novels, and tied for 38th on the 1998 Locus All-Time Poll for SF Novels Before 1990. <br /> <br />Like several other Science Fiction novels, this one is actually a collection of short stories written earlier.  Unlike some other novels built from stories, it appears that these stories were always strongly linked together, and the linking premise of scholars looking back at ancient mythological tales, works extremely well.  The amazing thing about this book is the number of science fiction themes that it touches upon, and yet it still maintains a steady pace, and moves forward. <br /> <br />The stories are as follows: <br /> <br />\\"City\\" is a novella, first published in Astounding in May of 1944.  It is this story that gives the book its name, and it is an unusual name since there are no cities in the rest of the book, and in fact they are dead even in the first story.  The first story is about the death of cities, and introduces the reader to the Webster family with the character John J. Webster. <br /> <br />\\"Huddling Place\\" is a short story, first published in Astounding in July of 1944.  In this story we meet Jerome A. Webster M.D., a man who in his younger days traveled, but now in the later stages of his life he suffers from Agoraphobia.  Prior to that, he had become friends with Juwain, a Martian philosopher.  Juwain is working on a philosophy which will advance Earthmen and Martians alike by hundreds of thousands of years in just a couple generations.  When Juwain needs an operation that only Webster can perform, he is forced to make a choice between the safety of his own home, and saving a friend.  This story introduces the character of Jenkins, who is a robot that serves the Webster family, and appears in most of the stories.  This is the only story in which there are Martians, although the lost of Juwain's philosophy is very important to many of the stories. <br /> <br />\\"Census\\" is a novella, first published in Astounding in September of 1944.  This story is about a census taker, who is traveling around to get an understanding of the Earth's population, and also to learn about the Mutants.  He learns about a mutant (Joe) who is able to fix things easily, and tries to get him to finish Juwain's philosophy.  This story introduces the reader to several important characters and events.  First there is the dog Nathaniel, who is the first talking dog, as well as Bruce Webster, the man who performed the operation to allow Nathaniel to talk, and Thomas Webster who invented the space ship drive that is allowing man to travel outside the solar system.  The character Joe is important, as are the mutants.  Joe's stealing of Juwain's philosophy, and his work with ants that allows them to evolve is also important to the overall tale. <br /> <br />\\"Desertion\\" is a short story, first published in Astounding in November of 1944.  This is the story of Kent Fowler, who is trying to find out if man can survive in a different form on Jupiter.  The problem is that the people he sends to find out are not returning.  Finally he decides that he himself must go, and he takes with him his faithful dog, Towser.  This is perhaps the most unusual of the stories, as it doesn't include a Webster character, or Jenkins.  However, the transformation to a Jovian life form is very essential to the story. <br /> <br />\\"Paradise\\" is a short story, first published in Astounding in June of 1946.  Kent Fowler decides to give up paradise, and leave behind Towser, so that hecan let humanity know of what he experienced as a Jovian life form.  Tyler Webster tries to conceal Kent Fowler's story, so that man will not abandon Earth and instead fulfill his destiny.  This story is important, because it leads to the exodus of man from Earth, and the decision by Joe to turn over Juwain's philosophy to humanity, which ultimately serves his own ends. <br /> <br />\\"Hobbies\\" is a novella, first published in Astounding in November of 1946.  In this story Jon Webster sees the end of man's reign on Earth.  Most of humanity has left for Jupiter, and those that remain are engaged in various hobbies that do nothing more than pass the time, and the Juwain Philosophy makes it impossible for them to ignore their fate.  Jon Webster journeys to see Jenkins, and learns that man must leave Earth to the dogs and the robots so as to avoid dominating them. <br /> <br />\\"Aesop\\" is a novella, first published in Astounding in December of 1947.  Peter, one of the few remaining humans, creates a bow and arrows.  When he uses them to kill a bird, accidentally, Jenkins is forced to seek help from the Mutants.  This story is important to the story, because we learn that the Mutants have left Earth, and this is also the first we see of travel between dimensions. <br /> <br />\\"The Simple Way\\" is a novella, first published as \\"The Trouble With Ants\\" in Fantastic Adventures in January of 1951.  In this story, we learn the ants that Joe helped advance way back in \\"Census\\" are still around and taking over Earth.  Jenkins seeks help by awakening Jon Webster, but when the only solution he can offer is killing the ants, Jenkins realizes that he cannot allow the ways of man to return. <br /> <br />\\"Epilog\\" is a short story, first published in Astounding for the John W. Campbell Memorial Anthology in 1973.  This last story, written so long after the others, is a wrap up of Jenkins' life.  He outlasts the ants, and then only he and the mice remain.  The dogs return in a spaceship, and Jenkins realizes he has no reason to stay any longer on Earth.	2005-08-14

However, there are many problems with this book that make it necessary.  To begin with, the writing is very dry which makes it difficult to read, although it does improve later in the book.  I also didn't care much for the organization.  Lastly, the font used is small, and this makes it all the more difficult to read for any length of time.  If you are studying the Cathars, then this is undoubtedly a good book to have as a reference.  However, this is not a good book for reading about the subject, especially if you are looking for an introduction to the topic.	2005-08-10

Age has been much kinder to this novel than to most from that era, and this still is a good read today.  It is the winner of the first ever Hugo award in 1953, and was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1954.  It was recognized by the fans when it was rated the 7th best science fiction book in the 1956 Astounding/Analog poll, and moved up to 5th on that poll in 1966.  It has faired well on the Locus polls as well, being rated 14th for All Time Novel in 1975, tied for 18th for All Time SF Novel in 1987, and finally 22nd for SF Novel before 1990 in 1998.  It is considered by some, to be the beginning of modern science fiction. <br /> <br />It is the story of Ben Reich who is the extremely rich head of a large corporation, and his decision to kill a business rival with whom he has become obsessed.  The biggest problem he has is the \\"Espers\\", telepaths who can read his plan from his mind, and stop him or easily have him convicted after the crime.  This theme will sound familiar to fans of Philip K. Dick, but the two stories are quite different.  There are many more events in this book which cause it to twist and turn, but it would be impossible to talk about them without spoiling the story.  This is a great book, and well deserving of the awards and accolades it has received.	2005-08-08

Kornbluth was first published in 1952, and was nominated for the 1953 International Fantasy Award.  Unlike the other nominee, \\"Player Piano\\" by Kurt Vonnegut, or the winner \\"City\\" by Clifford D. Simak, \\"Takeoff\\" is a surprisingly ordinary book.  It is very dated by the passage of time, and frankly it is difficult to understand why it would have been considered among the best for that year.  That is not to say that it is a bad book, but it doesn't seem to be exceptional in any way.  The story is a combination science fiction story and murder mystery. <br /> <br />The story takes place in the near future from when it was written, as a group of scientists, under the guise of researching a potential trip to the moon, are in fact actually trying to build a real rocket ship.  Dr. Michael Novak resigns in rage from his job with the Atomic Energy Commission, and finds himself applying for a job with the American Society for Space Flight who claims they are building a mock up of a rocket ship.  He becomes suspicious, when their plans seem a bit too specific for a fake ship.  When the chief engineer is murdered, Dr. Novak is forced to take on more work, and try to figure out who killed him.	2005-08-08

Many of the stories were from much earlier though, and the collection covers stories from 1931 - 1951, including many that had not appeared in print before.  Ray Bradbury writes a wonderful introduction to the collection, and if you have read Bradbury without reading Collier, you will definitely see that Collier had a big influence on Bradbury. <br /> <br />There are simply too many stories here to talk about them all, but for the most part they are very enjoyable.  Many are fables; almost all have twists to them.  All in all, this is a very fun collection to read.	2005-08-07

It was published in 1952, and was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1953.  It was republished under the title \\"Utopia-14\\" in 1954.  The story seems to hold up fairly well after 50 years, although there are a few aspects that are a bit dated.  Overall I highly recommend it, as an excellent satire of our society.  In discussing the book further, there are some spoilers, so only read on if you don't mind.    It would be easy to categorize this book as simply one of many science fiction novels where machines threaten to destroy man's way of life, but there is much more here.  This is a satire of American society.  The story is set in the future, where only a few men have decent jobs, with most of the rest of the work being done by more efficient machines.  There are shades of \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" in this book, but there is more as well.    Most of the book concentrates on the harm that the machines are doing to man's spirit.  We have a highly polarized society, where those who have been judged to have high potential get the good jobs live in entirely different areas than the rest of the people, and they consider the ordinary people ungrateful for the good things that are being given to the common man.  The hero, Paul Proteus, is pulled away from the upper society by a friend, Ed Finnerty, who also was once part of the intellectual elite, and away from the wishes of his wife and his boss.      He eventually decides to quit his job, and buys an old farm where he can live simply by doing honest hard work, but before he can quit, he is setup to spy on his revolutionary friend by being fired.  Once he is brought into the revolutionaries' meeting, he becomes convinced that their cause is the right one, and decides to commit to their cause.  The revolution results in the destruction of almost all the machines, even those that are beneficial to man.  Ultimately, we see that society will start to rebuild anduse machines again, and so in many ways we are in a vicious circle.	2005-08-06

It is a wonderful blend of Anthropology, History, and Sociology.  Definitely worth reading if you have an interest in the Cheyenne, or Native Americans in general. <br /> <br />John H. Moore spent a great deal of time with the Cheyenne, and clearly has a great deal of respect for the people and the culture.  Some of the stories he relates are very amusing, in particular where he discusses the portrayal in the movies and the actual dialogue spoken in \\"A Man Called Horse\\", and his story of The Wreck of the Cattle Truck are a real treat.  Some of the stories are sad as well.  It is his great gift to use the stories of his time with the Cheyenne to illustrate his points, and really make the reader feel as if they know this people.	2005-07-13

Once again Jeff Smith has done an excellent job of blending humor, mystery and fantasy to create a great tale of adventure <br /> <br />This volume is one great chase sequence, following Fone and Smiley in their adventure where they try to return Bartleby (The Rat Cub) to his people.  Along the way they meet the two outcast Rat Creatures, Rock Jaw, an unusual group of orphans, the possum kids, and Kingdok and his Rat Creature followers.  Smith is ingenious in mixing in dialogue that advances the overall adventure, with the action of the chase.  We learn more about Thorn, the history of the area, and other aspects of the story, even though Thorn, Rose, Lucius, and Phoney don't appear at all.	2005-06-14

The story really moves quickly in this book.  Even the humorous sections are focused on the storyline, which wasn't always the case in the previous books.  This is another outstanding volume in the series. <br /> <br />We learn a lot about Thorn in this book; her relationship with Rose, and with the Dragons.  She questions her abilities, and her resolve, but ultimately she rises to the occasion.  Fone sticks by her loyally throughout, but the most interesting relationship has to be between Rose and Thorn.  Thorn is very critical of the way Grandma Rose has kept information from her, and she does not hold back her opinion.  Rose is dejected, and disappears fairly early on in the book.  Phoney Bone continues his plotting to scam the villagers and return to Boneville after taking their stuff.  Lucius is trying to locate Rose after she disappears, and Smiley Bone continues to provide some lightness to the story.  A continuing mystery is the cloaked men, who show up periodically, but arrive just in time at the end of this book.	2005-06-09
US	53054493	R1ME2WDTRUZBI8	0812967127	823106538	The Day of the Triffids (20th Century Rediscoveries)	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Biological Warfare	John Wyndham was clearly influenced by H. G. Wells.  There is a reference in this story to \\"The Country Of The Blind\\", and certainly the story itself borrows more than a little from \\"The War Of The Worlds\\", as Edmund Morris discusses in his introduction to this edition.  There are many differences between \\"The Day Of The Triffids\\" and The War Of The Worlds\\" as well.  Wyndham's triffids are not the invincible threat that Wells' Martians were, and they are often not the most immediate problem for the characters in the story.  The triffids appear off and on for most of the story, as William Masen has to deal with helping the blind, gathering food, disease, and dealing with the chaos of a civilization which has come crashing down.   <br /> <br />The story opens with William recovering in the hospital, but finding that on the day his bandages were to be removed, that there weren't any people working in the hospital, and that the city itself was very quiet.  William had to work with the triffids prior to the disaster, and ironically, they are responsible in a way for his keeping his sight.  After removing the bandages himself, he quickly discovers that almost the entire city has gone blind, and that indeed it appeared to be a world wide phenomenon.  He manages to find Josella Playton, who has also managed to avoid the loss of her sight, and together they set about finding a way to survive.  Wyndham does a great job of bringing the triffids into the story, and then letting them drift into the background, only to bring them forward again for most of the story. <br /> <br />Wyndham deals with many issues in this story; including ethics, and the threat of biological warfare.  This is a very solid story, and interesting to read.  One might think that the fall of civilization would result in a lot more problems then appear in this book in terms of human interactions, but that doesn't harm its overall message.  This book was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1952.	2005-06-06

In this volume there is much more about the overall mystery surrounding Thorn, Rose, and the Dragons.  We learn about Thorn's youth and heritage, as well as Rose's younger days in the war.  We learn about the Hooded One, and discover that he too has masters.  There are more dreams, both Thorn's and Fone's.  The story gets fairly intense, but Jeff Smith helps keep it light by using Fone's love, and Ted the bug artfully to break up the drama. <br /> <br />On the humorous side there are several smaller stories.  There is the initial work to fix up the farm, in which Smiley and Phoney are next to useless, next they head off to town with Lucius to work off their debt in his tavern. Along the way they are forced to run from the Rat people.  When they finally get near town, an argument between Lucius and Phoney results in a bet about who can run the bar better.  Since most of the townsfolk hate Phoney, it seems like a certain outcome, until Smiley mentions Fone's Dragon.  Fone isn't much use on the farm either, as he spends most of his time writing love poems for Thorn.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent series.  This volume is the longest of the first three, and is vital and does a lot to advance the overall story in an entertaining way.  As with the others, it leaves you wanting more.	2005-06-04

It is the second volume in the nine volume Bone series.  Written and drawn beautifully by Jeff Smith, it is an adventure filled with humor and mystery. <br /> <br />In this section of the story, Phoney Bone is trying to rig the betting on the great cow race by starting rumors about Rose (Thorn's Grandmother who always wins the race) being too old, and about a new incredibly fast mystery cow, which turns out to be Smiley Bone in a homemade cow suit.  The main adventure story continues as well, as we learn more about Thorn through her dreams about a time she can't remember, and hints of an unusual past from comments by Rose and Lucius (the bar owner in Barrelhaven who has a long unspoken love for Rose). <br /> <br />This volume is heavier on the humorous stories, and as a result there is very little learned about the overall storyline of the series.  For that reason, I rate it slightly lower than the first volume, but it is definitely worth reading.	2005-06-03

It is a wonderful blend of humor, fantasy, and mystery which creates an engaging adventure that leaves the reader wanting more. <br /> <br />The story opens with the three Bone cousins (Fone, Smiley, and Phoney), who have just managed to lose the angry townspeople who have chased them out of their home town because of the dealings of Phoney.  Unfortunately, they have chased them right of their map of the known world, and they don't know how to get back.  A swarm of locusts then causes them to become separated leaving Fone searching for the other two.  He finds himself stuck in a valley trying to last the winter, after which he hopes to find his cousins and then they can try to find their way back home. <br /> <br />There are many twists to the story as well.  There is a dragon that occasionally appears, but Fone can't seem to convince anyone else that dragons exist.  There are the Rat People, who are the main villains, who try to capture and eat Fone, but are often foiled by the dragon or their own stupidity.  There is Thorn, a beautiful young woman whom Fone meets near the end of winter, and her Grandmother who likes to race cows.  There is Kingdok, the leader of the Rat People, and the mysterious Hooded One, who is clearly looking for Phoney, but we don't know why. <br /> <br />This is a highly entertaining series, and well worth reading.  The series is available in nine volumes, or as a one volume edition (1300 pages).  The volumes don't stand on their own, which is about the only negative I can think of, so you may want to go with the one volume edition.	2005-06-02

There are no science fiction stories; instead there is a mix of horror and fantasy.  The stories were written between 1947 and 1953 and with the exception of one story were all published before in a variety of the magazines from that era.  In addition, there is an \\"Essay on Sturgeon\\" written as an introduction to the book, by Groff Conklin.    Most of the stories are very good, and two of them have been recognized recently by the SF community.  \\"The World Well Lost\\" was awarded the Spectrum Hall Of Fame award in 2004 (In a tie with \\"Slow River\\" by Nicola Griffith, and \\"Swordspoint\\" by Ellen Kushner).  \\"A Saucer of Loneliness\\" was nominated for the Retro Hugo for short stories (eligible in 1953) which were given out in 2004.  The remainder of the stories are also worthwhile reading.	2005-06-01

Similar in style to \\"Angels & Demons\\", I much preferred this book because the ending was much more cohesive.  Overall the storyline was much tighter and a little less predictable than \\"Angels & Demons\\".<br /><br />Robert Landon is once again the hero of the book.  In this case he finds himself being questioned about a murder which has taken place at the Louvre, and quickly learns he is also the prime suspect.  He soon finds himself on a quest to find the Holy Grail.  Unlike \\"Angels & Demons\\", where the course of the investigation was apparent pretty much from the start of the book, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" doesn't have such an obvious path, which makes it more interesting for the reader.  The character choices though, are fairly similar, which is one of the weaknesses of the book for those who have read Dan Brown's other books.<br /><br />The biggest weakness would be the faulty history which is used to construct the story.  It is true that one should not expect historical accuracy in a fiction book, however, at the same time other authors I have read have been more responsible by included a section at the end where they discuss what is true and what was altered in the interests of a better story.  Dan Brown not only doesn't do this, but instead strongly implies at the start of the book, that most of the basis for his story is true.  He states: \\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate\\", but unfortunately that statement is not correct.  Comments his characters make about the Dead Sea Scrolls, Da Vinci's art, and even some of the architecture are simply wrong or are misleading to say the least.  Many of the historical statements are also inaccurate, which is one of the primary causes of the controversy surrounding the book.<br /><br />Despite that rather big flaw, when taken as fiction this is a very enjoyable book, and if you enjoy thrillers and conspiracy books you will almost certainly like this too.ou enjoy thrillers and conspiracy books you will almost certainly like this too. <br />	2005-05-29

It is a combination of some previously published shorter works (in some cases altered a bit to fit with the other stories in the collection), and some newer pieces.  The book as a whole was first published in May of 1950, with the earliest story first published in June of 1948. <br /> <br />Few writers in any genre can make the reader really feel the way Bradbury can.  Here he blends longer works, with shorter vignettes, to lay a rich tapestry to the overall book.  The longer works tend to be about specific individuals or groups, while the shorter pieces deal with society and the environment, and they set the overall tone and feel of the book.  One of my personal favorites is \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" in which Bradbury effectively delivers his message with no characters. <br /> <br />Several of the stories included in this book, also are related to other short fiction that Bradbury has written but that doesn't appear in this book.  For example, \\"Usher II\\" (originally published as \\"Carnival Of Madness\\") clearly comes after \\"The Exiles\\" (originally published as \\"The Mad Wizards Of Mars\\"), and \\"Way In The Middle Of The Air\\" clearly comes before \\"The Other Foot\\".  Both \\"The Exiles\\" and \\"The Other Foot\\" appear in \\"The Illustrated Man\\".	2005-05-17

The stories in this collection are chronological with respect to Heinlein's Future History.  These are some of the classic stories from Heinlein's early writings.  This is definitely a must read for anyone who likes Science Fiction. <br /> <br />\\"Delilah and the Space-Rigger\\" was originally published in \\"Bluebook\\" in December of 1949.  It is the story of what happens when a woman, Gloria Brooks McNye,  is hired as a replacement radio technician for what had been an all-male crew building a space station. <br /> <br />\\"Space Jockey\\" was first published in \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\" on April 26, 1947.

The story is about the Logan family who is visiting the Moon.  The youngest son disappears when they are touring the surface of the Moon.  It is written from the point of view of the elder of the two sons. <br /> <br />\\"It's Great To Be Back!\\" was first published in \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\" on July 26, 1947.  It is the story of Allan and Josephine MacRae who are eager to return to Earth after spending a few years on the Moon.  Once they get to Earth, they find things are not as good as they remembered. <br /> <br />\\"-We Also Walk Dogs\\" was first published in \\"Astounding\\" in July of 1941 under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald.

Sprague de Camp's \\"Lest Darkness Fall\\" with David Drake's \\"To Bring The Light\\".  Also included is an introduction by Harry Turtledove.  \\"Lest Darkness Fall\\" is one of the earliest examples of Alternate History, and is by far the best of the two stories in this book.  In 1952 it was ranked 11th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll, and in 1956 it was ranked 20th on the same poll.  It is a shame that this story has been largely been forgotten since then, since it is clearly well researched and a real pleasure to read. <br /> <br />It is the story of Martin Padway, a student of history who is in Rome working on his thesis.  He is sent back in time, to the year 535 A.D., when a lightning bolt strikes him.  After realizing his position, he decides to try to prevent the Dark Ages, and finds himself increasingly pulled into the politics of the time.  It is a fairly short novel, and well worth reading. <br /> <br />\\"To Bring The Light\\" is clearly based on \\"Lest Darkness Fall\\".  In this story the main character is Flavia Herosilla, a well educated woman living in Rome in the year 751 A.D., during the celebration of the city's 1,000th birthday.  As with Martin Padway, she is sent back in time by a lightning strike.  She is sent to the time of the founding of Rome.  Unlike the first story, where Martin Padway tries to change history, Flavia tries to recreate the founding of Rome based on the legends that she knows. <br /> <br />\\"Lest Darkness Fall\\" is a classic that should be read by anyone interested in Alternate Histories.  \\"To Bring The Light\\", though not as good, is still an interesting story, and makes a good companion to \\"Lest Darkness Fall\\".	2005-04-29

This material was published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" from September of 1937 through February 1938 before being published in book form in 1950.  This series was nominated for the Hugo for best all-time series in 1966. <br /> <br />It is the story of Kimball Kinnison, from his graduation into the Galactic Patrol, through his first mission which was more likely to end in death then success, on to his promotion to a Gray Lensman, and his location and destruction of the Boskone command base in our galaxy. <br /> <br />The science in this story is this book's greatest weakness, but that is made up for by the fast pace, interesting characters, and engaging situations.  If you are looking for something light and very entertaining to read, this is a great place to start.  Sit back and enjoy.	2005-04-28

As with the previous book, this is the collection of material that was previously published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" from October of 1939 through January 1940.  The book was first published in 1951, and was ranked 13th on the 1952 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll.  The series as a whole was nominated for the Hugo for best all-time series in 1966. <br /> <br />In this book, Kimball Kinnison searches for traces of Boskone after the destruction of their base in our Galaxy.  The search takes him to the Second Galaxy where he stops the Boskonians from destroying the Medonians.  He also searches out remnants of Boskone within our own Galaxy, and he continues to learn how to better use the Lens.  The book leads up to a climactic battle against the Boskonians in the Second Galaxy. <br /> <br />As with the previous books in the series, the science is the weakest part of the story.  Despite this, it is still worth reading for the characters and fast paced storyline.  This is a great example of Space Opera from the golden age of science fiction.	2005-04-28
US	53054493	R1RADP3QG1J0Y7	193141274X	629778781	Uriel's Machine: Uncovering the Secrets of Stonehenge, Noah's Flood and the Dawn of Civilization	Books	1	61	81	N	N	Mythology Not History	The authors of this book seem to be trying to create a history to support the documents that they wish to believe are accurate.  It is largely based on the premise that the Freemasons and their rituals and documents date back to ancient history, rather than the 1717 date commonly used, or even the 1590 date given in \\"The Origins Of Freemasonry: The Scottish Century 1590-1710\\" published by Cambridge University Press.  Instead they claim their information dates back to the Knights Templar and then back to the Jerusalem Church in the time of Jesus and James.<br /><br />One of the problems with their argument is that they are using written evidence to build a picture of a time before there was writing.  If you take their date of 200 B.C.E. for the writing of the Book of Enoch; it is still over 7,000 years after the events they are trying to reconstruct.<br /><br />Given that we don't even know the author of the Book of Enoch which was written a little over 2,000 years ago, what makes them think that the writer has such detailed knowledge of events over 3 times further in the past?  And for that matter wouldn't earlier sources be even better?  They don't seem to think so, as they only use writing from over 2,000 years before their source (i.e. Babylonian, Akkadian, and Sumerian) as supporting their source, rather than the other way around.<br /><br />We have had writing, and historians documenting most of the intervening period between today and the writing of the Book of Enoch, but that was not the case for the period between the writer of the Book of Enoch and the events they are describing.  Writing is estimated to have been invented around 3,000 B.C.E., which leaves over 4,000 years between the events and when they could have first been documented.  To make matters worse, the idea of writing down an accurate history only dates back to Herodotus in 440 B.C.E.; which still leaves more than 7,000 years between the events in question and the unknown writer and their uncorroborated writing.<br /><br />As part of their evidence for the age of the Freemasons, the authors cite that \\"the rituals of Freemasonry contained a great deal of historical information, despite the fact that the United Grand Lodge of England continues to insist that their rites are simply invented nonsense.\\"  It is not clear exactly what weight this gives their argument, since it would be natural to use a historical basis from to create the rituals in order to make them appear more authentic.  Age is often used as a symbol of status as far as civilizations, countries, and organizations are concerned, and that is why using a historical or biblical base would be used.<br /><br />If you want to avoid the Freemason debate, then the best way to judge this book is on how they present the material from more traditional sources.  From very early on in the book, the historical and scientific merit is questionable.  The authors clearly decide to pick and choose bits and pieces of other people's work and patch them together to try to make them support their theories.  For example, they quote W.L. Strauss and A. J. E. Cave's `Pathology and Posture of Neanderthal Man' from 1957 where it states \\"If Neanderthal Man could be reincarnated and placed in a New York subway - provided that he were bathed, shaved, and dressed in modern clothing - it is doubtful whether he would attract any more attention than some of its other denizens.\\"  Later in the same chapter when they draw heavily from James Shreeve's \\"The Neanderthal Enigma\\", they somehow forget to note that Shreeve said that that idea of the very statement they quoted before was shattered by the `Eve' hypotheses which they are using.<br /><br />The authors are also not accurate with their dates.  From what I read, they date the age of the Sumerian and Egyptian civilizations to about 3,000 B.C.E., but both are considerably older than that.  Even when an older date would help their argument they don't necessarily get it correct.For example, the ice-age kiln discovered in Europe which they claim to be 26,000 years old is actually 29,000 - 30,000 years old.<br /><br />The authors also get some things wrong.  When discussing the Kennewick Man, discovered in Washington State in 1996, they consistently refer to him as a Caucasian but this is not correct.  The Kennewick Man is a Caucoid, which would likely make him similar to the Ainu.  They do discuss this, but they continue to call them Caucasians when they are not.  It is true that it was reported this way in the papers and on TV, but for what is supposed to be a scientific argument to misstate this is simply unforgivable.<br /><br />I gave up on this book after finding too many inaccuracies.  I have read a lot of ancient history and some anthropology so for those areas I know they made a number of wrong statements.  Since they were incorrect in the areas in which I had prior knowledge and could easily go back and check, I can only believe that they are equally inaccurate for areas which I don't have a background.  If you are looking for a book to support your belief in the Freemason's history, then you will probably enjoy this book, but if you are looking for a book that investigates man's prehistory then I would recommend Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, And Steel.\\"	2005-03-26

When Fantasy Press made the deal to publish the four books of the Lensman series, they added two books to the original plan for four from the stories that were published in `Astounding Science Fiction' between September of 1937 and February of 1948.  The first was \\"Triplanetary\\", which came first in the overall series, and was a rather uneven book, with new material set mostly in the past, and a previously published story which was rewritten to fit into the Lensman universe.  The second was this book, which bridges the period between \\"Triplanetary\\" and the original Lensman stories.  In 2001 this was nominated for the Retro Hugo for the year 1950.   <br /> <br />In the first half of \\"First Lensman\\", we get the origin of the Lensmen and the Galactic Patrol. Concern over rampant crime and corruption leads Virgil Samms to come up with the Galactic Patrol and to search for a symbol which cannot be duplicated or imitated.  When an unusual character sends him to Arisa, he is presented with the Lens, which would become the symbol, and a key part to the remaining Lensman stories.  Virgil Samms becomes the First Lensman, and he selects others who will be brought into the service and given Lenses. <br /> <br />The second part of the book is concerned with the battle for control of the government (i.e. the North American presidency) between the Galactic Patrol and the criminal elements who currently control the government.  The criminals are also building a fleet to combat and destroy the Galactic Patrol, but the Galactic Patrol also has some tricks to play.  I found this book overall to be better than \\"Triplanetary\\", although it does bog down a bit in the election manipulations in the second half of the book.  I look forward to moving on to the original stories as conceived by Dr. Edward E. Smith.	2005-03-23

As a result, when I received this book as a gift I was a bit leery as to whether I would like it or not.  Unfortunately my fears were justified, as it fits right in with books by Al Franklin and Michael Moore and in opposition to those by Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and others.  Sadly, it didn't have to be that way, for while Maureen Dowd is certainly liberal and written many less than complementary pieces about the Bush family and administrations, she also won a Pulitzer Prize for her columns which attacked Bill Clinton.  Thus, it should have been quite easy to come up with a collection of columns which didn't turn this into just another attack on one group of politicians. <br /> <br />There are some positives here to be sure.  Dowd is a great columnist, and if one looks at the columns individually, more often then not they are quite good if not excellent.  They provide a fairly comprehensive look at the issues that many people have with the Bush Administration and the war in Iraq.   <br /> <br />The problems for me fall into two categories; organization and selection.  The book is organized into 20 sections based on larger topics, and the columns are chronological within those sections.  Columns that do not touch on the Bush family or administration are not included for the most part.  The problem with this strategy is that columns that were often written weeks, months, or even years apart are now one after another.  Thus, while it is often necessary in a column to reintroduce a viewpoint or argument due to the time between columns; in a book it ends up feeling tired and repetitive.  It would have been far better to intersperse the topics, and to include other columns to help give the reader a better sense of time and context for each of the columns. <br /> <br />If you like reading the politically one-sided books, or if you want to be reminded of all the things some people hate about the Bush Administration, then you will probably enjoy this book.  For the rest of us, it should be taken in small doses if at all.	2005-03-20

D. is the first book of the Lensman series in terms of the chronology of the stories.  However, it was a combination of new material and rewriting of a story of the same name which was published in \\"Amazing Stories\\" from January-April of 1934.  This story was originally a stand alone piece of fiction and not part of the Lensman series.  The original Lensman material which was published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" between 1937 and 1948 and it is in books 3 - 6 of the series, although it was edited to make it consistent throughout all parts of the series.    The forward to the book is by John Clute in which he gives the reader a good overview of what is to come in this book, and somewhat for the series.  In it he strongly implies that this is probably the worst book in the series, and the most difficult to read.  I must agree with most of the issues he discusses regarding this book in the Foreword, although I have not yet read the others of the series to see how those compare.    The main part of the book is an odd combination of material which fits into three sections.  The first section is titled `Dawn' and is itself divided into three chapters.  The first deals with the history of the two opposing elder races (The Arisians and The Eddorians) and their first point of contact.  The second deals with the destruction of Atlantis.  The last chapter of the first section covers the fall of Rome.  The inclusion of Atlantis moves this book out the realm of science fiction and into that of fantasy.  This is especially true in the way it is presented as a society even more advanced then ours at the point which this book was written.  There simply isn't any evidence to support the existence of such a society existing on Earth at that point in time.  The other two chapters are decent enough, but the pace is much slower than that which comes later.    The second part is titled `The World War' and unlike the other sections there is almost no mention of The Arisians or The Eddorians.  The title of the section implies a single war, but in fact it covers three World Wars, the last of which takes place in an unspecified year.  As with the first section, there are three chapters, each one covering a different war.  The only mention of The Arisians and The Eddorians in this section is in a brief epilogue which helps bring the reader back into the Lensman universe.  The style of writing in this section is uneven, and it has a much different feel than either of the other sections.    The third section is titled `Triplanetary', and it had the fast pace which I expected for the series.  There are 13 chapters in this section and the action is nearly non-stop.  It starts with a pirate attack on a space liner, but we soon learn that the pirate leader is not what he appears, nor are some of those on the space liner.  The Triplanetary League fight back against the pirates only to be interrupted when a spaceship of unknown origin arrives on the scene and changes everything.  If one sets aside any attempt at realism, then this can be an enjoyable section to read, but when one stops and evaluates what is going on, it doesn't really hold up.  For example, the rate at which technology is turned around by the Triplanetary League as well as their foes is simply absurd.  The story is shows its age in other ways as well.  For example, the decision by one of the `heroes' to poison the air supply of an entire alien city in an attempt to escape from the planet doesn't fit with today's morals where this act would be considered terrorism.    Despite the fairly low rating I am giving the book, I do intend to continue with the series.  There is every indication that the rest of the series has the fast and fun style of the third section, and while it may not be serious science fiction, it can be an enjoyable way to spend some time.  This series clearly has influenced many others and is of interest in that respect as well, such as\\"Babylon 5\\".  The Lensman series was nominated in 1966 for the Hugo for best all-time series.	2005-03-17

It was first published in August - October of 1945 in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\", however that version is quite a bit different from the version which was published in book form in 1948.  A final revision was published in 1970, which was very close to the 1948 version.<br /><br />The core of the story is set in the year 2650, and is told from the point of view of Gilbert Gosseyn, who discovers very early on that all his memories are not real.  He is being used as a pawn in a struggle for power.<br /><br />The story of Gosseyn is interesting and the reader does want to find out what happens to him, but there are problems with the story as well.  Key to the plot is the philosophy of Null-A (non-Aristotelianism), which is never clearly defined and thus can easily leave the reader confused.  This is the first of three books in this series, so perhaps this problem will be resolved in the other books.<br /><br />For my tastes, \\"Slan\\" was a better example of van Vogt's work.  In addition, his Isher series is easier to follow as well.  The other two books in the Null-A series are: \\"The Players of Null-A\\" and \\"Null-A Three\\".	2005-03-15

As with \\"Foundation And Empire\\", it is made up of two sections which are taken from shorter fiction that was published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940s.  \\"Second Foundation\\" maintains the higher level of quality that was displayed in the second novel, but there are still some signs of age.<br /><br />The two sections of \\"Second Foundation\\" are:<br /><br />\\"Search By The Mule\\" - The Mule notices that some of the minds under his control are being interfered with.  He sends two people, one with a controlled mind, Han Pritcher, and one uncontrolled, Bail Channis to search for the Second Foundation so that he may destroy them.  This was first published as the novella \\"Now You See It...\\" in the January 1948 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".<br /><br />\\"Search By The Foundation\\" - After the Mule dies the First Foundation rises again.  A group of scientists search for the Second Foundation in secret.  They want the First Foundation to be free from others' control.  They believe the Mule may have located the Second Foundation before he gave up his search.  This was first published as the novella \\"...And Now You Don't\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in November and December of 1949.<br /><br />The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years.  In 1952, even before the last book was published, the trilogy was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll.  It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966.  In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels.  In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels.  In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990.  It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\", Smith's \\"Lensman\\", Heinlein's \\"Future History\\", and Burroughs' \\"Barsoom\\" series for the award.	2005-03-05

An edited version of it was published by Ace Books in the 1950s under the title \\"The Man Who Upset The Universe\\".  It consists of two sections which are taken from shorter fiction that was published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940s.  While better than the first novel in the series, there are still some weaknesses as a result of age.  Asimov himself wrote in 1982 that the knowledge of astronomy at that time was \\"primitive\\" and that he could now take advantage of electronic computers in his stories, which hadn't been invented until he was halfway through the series in the 40s.<br /><br />The two sections of \\"Foundation And Empire\\" are:<br /><br />\\"The General\\" - In this story, the Foundation is attacked by what is left of the Empire.  The Empire, though much weaker than it once was, is still stronger than the Foundation.  This was first published as the novelette \\"Dead Hand\\" in the April 1945 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".<br /><br />\\"The Mule\\" - Perhaps the best of the Foundation stories; in this one the Seldon plan is destroyed by its inability to predict a singular event.  The Foundation is threatened by a person known only as The Mule.  He is mysteriously able to defeat more powerful forces, with inferior forces.  This was first published as the novella \\"The Mule\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in November and December of 1945.<br /><br />The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years.  In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll.  It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966.

It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating outTolkien's \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\", Smith's \\"Lensman\\", Heinlein's \\"Future History\\", and Burroughs' \\"Barsoom\\" series for the award.	2005-03-02
US	53054493	R3ON44CTUBHFHR	0553293354	834333861	Foundation	Books	3	26	30	N	N	Still A Classic	This is the first of the three novels in the original \\"Foundation Trilogy\\".  The trilogy is similar to \\"I, Robot\\", in that the novels are created out of shorter fiction that was first published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940's.  It was first published in novel form by Gnome Press in 1951.  A trimmed down version was published under the title \\"The 1,000 Year Plan\\" by Ace books in the 1950s.<br /><br />While certainly a classic and important to setup the series, \\"Foundation\\" is easily the weakest of the three novels.  Consisting of five parts, four of which are taken from the shorter fiction from years before, it covers a large period of time in a relatively short amount of space.  In addition, the stories are fairly short, and it is rare for a character to appear in more than one.  As a result, there is little in the way of character development in this book.  The subsequent novels (\\"Foundation And Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\") are each comprised of just two works of shorter fiction, and thus do not suffer as much in this area.<br /><br />The sections of \\"Foundation\\" are:<br /><br />\\"The Psychohistorians\\" - This is the story of Gaal Dornick who has come to the capital of the Empire, Trantor to work with Hari Seldon.  This story introduces the key concepts of the series; introducing the reader to Psychohistory, the Empire, and the purpose of the Foundation.  It is unique among the sections of this book, in that it was written specifically for the novel and was not published previously.<br /><br />\\"The Encyclopedists\\" - In this story, the Foundation becomes separated from the Empire, and is threatened by its neighbors, the Anacreonians.  It is in this story that the citizens of the Foundation find out their real purpose, having believed before that they were sent there to create a Galactic Encyclopedia to preserve man's knowledge.  This was first published in part as the novelette \\"Foundation\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in May of 1942.<br /><br />\\"The Mayors\\" - This story is closely tied to \\"The Encyclopedists\\", and there are some of the same characters.  Once again the Foundation is threatened by the Anacreonians; however, this time the Foundation uses its technological expertise to avert the crisis.  This story also introduces the use of `Priests' to spread the influence of the Foundation.  This was first published as the novelette \\"Bride and Saddle\\" in the June 1942 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".<br /><br />\\"The Traders\\" - This story is about the use of trade to expand the influence of the Foundation.  More specifically, it is about an agent of the Foundation who has been imprisoned on Askone, a planet that prohibits the use of the Foundation's devices.  This was first published in the October 1944 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" as the short story \\"The Wedge\\".<br /><br />\\"The Merchant Princes\\" - This is a more complicated and involved story than the others included in this book.  A merchant trader, Hober Mallow, goes in search of several missing Foundation ships, discovering evidence of the old Empire.  More important though, is the struggle for power within the Foundation which results in the abandonment of religion in favor of economics as the source of expanding the influence of the Foundation.  This was first published as the novelette \\"The Big And The Little\\" in the August 1944 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".<br /><br />The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years.  In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll.  It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966.

It was first published in magazine form between March 20th, 1864 and December 5th of 1865, and in Book form on May 4th, 1866.  Together with \\"At The North Pole\\" it forms the second adventure story by Jules Verne. <br /> <br />This book does not stand on its own, you need to read \\"At The North Pole\\" first.  This book picks up right after the cliff-hanging ending of the first book.  Where the first book was fairly repetitive, this book has a much better variety of difficulties for the characters to overcome.  Obviously the cold is still a significant obstacle as is food, but to these are added predatory bears, and the mutinous crew is replaced by a rivalry between Captain Hattaras and the American Captain Altamont. <br /> <br />For me, this book had a much better pace than the first book.  The characters are not just sitting around waiting for things to happen as much as they were in the prior volume.  Despite some glaring factual errors which date the book, and a somewhat anti-climactic ending, I found this to be more entertaining than \\"At The North Pole\\", and I give it the higher rating of the two volumes.	2005-03-01

Campbell Jr..  The 23 stories included were all published originally in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" between May of 1940 and March of 1951.  This anthology was published in 1952.   <br /> <br />In comparing it with the other anthologies, such as those edited by Groff Conklin, it falls short in a couple of areas.  The first is that there are fewer stories included, which isn't a big problem since the quality is very high.  The second is that many of the stories included had already appeared in other collections prior to this one.  However, for those who don't already have those collections, this is a good place to start. <br /> <br />The list of authors reads like a who's who of science fiction from the period, and many of the stories are classics.  The list of stories is: \\"Blowups Happen\\" by Robert A. Heinlein, \\"Hindsight\\" by Jack Williamson, \\"Vault Of The Beast\\" by A. E. van Vogt, \\"The Exalted\\" by L.

Fyfe. <br /> <br />The anthology as a whole, was ranked 16th by readers on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll for books in 1952, and it moved up to 8th on the same poll taken in 1956.  In 1999, it was tied for 17th on the Locus All-Time Poll for anthologies.   <br /> <br />Of the stories within, Asimov's \\"Nightfall\\" was rated 1st on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll for short fiction in 1971, and 2nd on the Locus Poll in 1999 for novelettes.  Leinster's \\"First Contact\\" tied for 9th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll for short fiction in 1971, and won the Retro Hugo for best novelette in 1996 for the year 1945.

Written by George Orwell (the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair) in 1949, it has become the work referenced in other literature, film, and music for a future government which controls all of its citizens, and uses them to maintain its own position of power.  Of course, it was not the first novel to present this idea, but it is perhaps one that presents the future that is the most bleak and without hope.<br /><br />Other authors have created sterile futures built on technological advancements that have drained humanity from its citizens.  Instead, Orwell's future has technology held in check or even regressing, while political power and control are the forces that imprison humanity in his future.  It is easy to read fascism and communism into the government of `Big Brother', but one can see elements from \\"1984\\" in any type of government, they simply are more obvious in a totalitarian one.<br /><br />This novel has been recognized many times by readers.  In 1952 it ranked 17th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll, and in 1956 it tied for 9th on the same poll.  In 1975 it tied for 41st on the Locus Poll for All-Time novels, in 1975 it was 34th on the Locus Poll for All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it was 21st on the Locus Poll for SF Novels from before 1990.  The most fitting recognition though, must be the Prometheus Hall of Fame award which it won in 1984.	2005-02-19

It includes five novels and 3 short stories from the all too often forgotten Eric Frank Russell (January 6, 1905 - February 28, 1978).  This collection was published in 2001, and along with \\"Major Ingredients\\", published a year earlier, a lot of his short fiction and most of his best novels are once again available.  In addition to Russell's work, this also contains introductions for each of the novels by Jack L. Chalker, as well as an introduction for the whole book by the editor Rick Katze.  The following is a list of the novels:    \\"Wasp\\" is probably Russell's best known novel.  Published originally in 1957, it is the story of James Mowry who is asked to be an agent behind enemy lines in Earth's war with the Sirian Combine.  He is asked to be like the wasp in the car that distracts the driver and causes an accident.  When this novel was first published, it was edited to fit the predetermined length of Avalon Books.  The version in this collection is the unedited version of the novel.  This novel was nominated for the 1998 Prometheus Hall of Fame award.    \\"Sentinels from Space\\" was first published under the title \\"The Star Watchers\\" in \\"Startling Stories\\", November 1951.  In this novel, aliens who are watching Earth but who are posing as humans, become involved in preventing a war between different factions.    \\"Call Him Dead\\" was first published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" from August - October of 1955.  It was later published under the title \\"Three to Conquer\\".  In this story Wade Harper is, as far as he knows, the only telepath in existence.  When he learns that aliens are taking over the minds of humans he needs to find a way to stop the invasion.    \\"Next Of Kin\\" was written three times.  It was first submitted to \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" and rejected as a novel.  It was then trimmed down to a novelette and titled \\"Plus X\\", which was published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in June of 1956.  Next it was expanded but notto its original length and published as \\"The Space Willies\\", along with several short stories in 1958.  Finally it was published in its full length and original title in 1959.  In this novel, a scout pilot is the first to use a new engine design that will allow him to travel much faster and farther then ever before, in an attempt to scout the enemy's solar systems.  When he becomes captured, he learns that there are many similarities between Earth and their enemies, which he uses to his full advantage.    \\"Sinister Barrier\\" was the first novel published in \\"Unknown\\" in March of 1939.  However, Russell insisted on updating this novel before he would allow it to be published again in the United States.  It is the updated version that is included in this collection.  In this story, Bill Graham is investigating the suspicious deaths of many of Earth's best scientists.  This novel was listed as the 18th best book on the 1952 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll.    The three short stories are: \\"Legwork\\", which was first published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in April of 1956; \\"Mana\\", which was first published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in December of 1937; and \\"Mechanical Mice\\", which was first published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in January of 1941 as by Maurice G. Hugi.  This was the only story for which Russell used that name, other stories by Maurice G. Hugi are by the author of that name.	2005-02-16

It consists of 30 stories, mostly from the 1940's, and a large number of those were from 1946 and 1947.  This differs from his previous collection, which tried to cover short fiction from the entire history of the genre.  All but five of these stories first appeared in the pages of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".    It is amazing how well these stories hold up even today.  Yes there are some things which are dated, but on the whole the stories work nearly as well today as they did when they were first published.  Included are stories from some of the great masters of Science Fiction, such as Arthur C. Clarke, L. Sprague De Camp, Murray Leinster, Robert A. Heinlein and more.  There are also many stories by lesser known writers.    Surprisingly only two of these stories have been recognized in reader polls.  These are \\"With Folded Hands...\\" by Jack Williamson which was tied for 32nd on the Locus All-Time Poll for novelettes in 1999, and \\"Rescue Party\\" by Arthur C. Clarke, which was tied for 9th on the 1971 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll of short fiction.  The Anthology itself was rated 20th on the 1952 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll of books.	2005-02-06
US	53054493	R372VEM73HAXOI	088411905X	382082383	At the North Pole (English and French Edition)	Books	2	2	2	N	Y	Wonderful Characters, But Repetative	This is the first of two volumes of the \\"Voyages and Adventures of Captain Hatteras\\".  Sometimes it is called \\"The English at the North Pole\\".  It was first published in magazine form between March 20th, 1864 and December 5th of 1865, and in Book form on May 4th, 1866.  Together with \\"The Desert of Ice\\" it forms the second adventure story by Jules Verne. <br /> <br />This book does not stand on its own.  The start is very good, as a mysterious person arranges for a boat to be built and a crew to be assembled with himself as captain.  Orders are given to set sail before the Captain appears, and the crew are left wondering if the Captain will ever appear.  Eventually that issue is resolved, and at that point the story becomes fairly repetitive.  The crew is left to face the same challenges over and over.  Some issues, such as mirages, and the discussion of wintering appear several times.  The latter even occurs in June or earlier, which seems absurdly early in the year.   <br /> <br />There are some major issues which appear over and over as well, such as the need for fuel to battle the cold, potential mutiny, and the health of the crew.  Unfortunately, the root cause for all the issues is the same in every case, and that is attempting to survive in the arctic region.  As a result, the story seems to bog down for quite a while.  Near the end of this book it picks up again, as the crew is driven to attempt a desperate trip across the ice to find coal for fuel.  It ends in a cliff hanger, which makes reading the second volume a must. <br /> <br />There are some entertaining parts of this book, and some wonderful characters.  However, overall this does not measure up to some of Verne's other books.	2005-01-29

This is a classic science fiction book, consisting of nine works of shorter fiction by Isaac Asimov linked together by the premise of Dr. Susan Calvin looking back on the history of robotics and her career on the event of her retirement.  This book was published first in 1950, while the stories themselves were published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" between September 1940 and June of 1950 with the exception of the first story.    If I were to rate this solely on the content, it would probably be a four-star book, but I don't think one can ignore the importance roll it has played in Asimov's writing, and in the field of science fiction as a whole.  It was this book that first introduced the three laws of robotics that were developed by John W. Campbell, Jr. and Asimov.  This book would also lay the foundation for much of Asimov's work for the rest of his career.    This books importance to the genre has increased as time has passed.  In 1952, it was rated 23rd on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll, it then was rated 21st in 1956, and all the way up to 12th in 1966.  In addition, it was tied for 4th on the Locus All-Time Poll for Collection in 1999.    \\"Robbie\\" was published in September of 1940 in \\"Super-Science Stories\\" under the title \\"Strange Playfellow\\", though Asimov wanted to use \\"Robbie\\" as the title, and is the story of a young girl who grows attached to her nursemaid robot, Robbie, against the wishes of her mother.  The story is supposed to take place in 1996.  This became the only story in this book to be recognized by readers separate from the book as a whole when it tied for 37th on the list of short stories in the Locus All-Time Poll in 1999.    \\"Runaround\\" was published in March of 1942, and in terms of the story's chronology is the first of the Greg Powell and Mike Donovan stories.  They are setting up a mining operation, when their robot malfunctions where they are unable to safely reach it, and it is running around in circles.  This story takes place around 2015.    \\"Reason\\" was published in April of 1941 and is the second of the Greg Powell and Mike Donovan stories.  In this one they are bring a new type of robot to a power generating space station to set it up to run the operation so that fewer men will have to stay there.  When the robot develops a religion of its own they need to determine what the consequences will be.  This story takes place six months after \\"Runaround\\".    \\"Catch That Rabbit\\" was published in February of 1944, and is the last of the Greg Powell and Mike Donovan stories.  It is probably the weakest story in the entire book.  They are looking into a problem with the new multiple robot, where they sometimes fail to function when there are no humans present to watch them.  This entire story appears to be written for the punch line at the end, and takes place 6 months after \\"Reason\\".    \\"Liar!\\" was published in May of 1941.  In this story a telepathic robot is accidentally developed, and a team of experts, including Dr. Susan Calvin, try to determine what happened in the build process caused the error.  This story takes place in 2021.    \\"Little Lost Robot\\" was published in March of 1947.  In this story a specially built robot with a weakened first law has disappeared, and his hiding in a group of 62 other robots that are physically identical.  Dr. Susan Calvin searches for a solution that will not force them to destroy all 63 robots.  This story takes place in 2029.    \\"Escape\\" was published as \\"Paradoxical Escape\\" in August of 1945.  In this story, Dr. Calvin tries to prevent the plans for a Hyperatomic Drive from destroying the positronic brain of U.S. Robots as happened to their competitor, `Consolidated'.  This story takes place immediately after \\"Little Lost Robot\\".    \\"Evidence\\" was published in September of 1946.  In this story a candidate for office threatens to leak a rumor that his opponent is a robot unless U.S. Robots can prove otherwise.  This story takes place in 2032.    \\"The Evitable Conflict\\" was published in June of 1950.  In this story, super robotic brains are running the world.  However, there appear to be mistakes being made and Dr. Calvin is trying to determine how and why.  This story takes place in 2052.	2005-01-21
US	53054493	R1791UF2W02COK	0881846740	754885699	The Moon Is Hell!	Books	3	9	9	N	N	Survival On A Dead World	This book actually contains two stories.  The first is the short novel \\"The Moon Is Hell!\\", which was first published in 1951 (some references indicate 1950, but I have not found any evidence to support the earlier date).  The second is a novella titled \\"The Elder Gods\\", which was first published in \\"Unknown\\" in October of 1939 using the alias Don A. Stuart and co-authored by Arthur J. Burks.  This book was ranked 24th on the Analog/Astounding All-Time Poll.    The novel bears a certain resemblance with the novella \\"Who Goes There?\\".  Both stories are about a group of scientists that are isolated from civilization, who have to fight for their lives.  In \\"Who Goes There?\\" it was a fight against an alien discovered in the ice of Antarctica.  In \\"The Moon Is Hell!\\" it is a fight for the basics of life (air, water, food, shelter) by a group that is stranded on the Moon after the relief ship that was to bring them home crashes.  The story is written from the viewpoint of one of the members of the expedition in the form of his diary during this period.  It is an interesting story, and Campbell is very inventive in the solutions that they develop to solve their problems.    The second story is a fantasy story, which is a genre that I was not aware that John W. Campbell Jr. had ever used.  In the story, the elder gods bring to the Azun islands a hero to try to destroy the Invisible Ones, who have taken control of their land.  It took me a while to get into this story, but overall it was a fairly solid effort.  It isn't clear why this story was paired with \\"The Moon Is Hell!\\", other than they needed to make this book a reasonable length.	2005-01-16
US	53054493	RUUF88RRQBS4	0743435613	344110456	Beyond This Horizon	Books	1	4	8	N	Y	Chaotic Mess	This is one of Robert A. Heinlein's earliest novels.  It was originally published in Astounding Science Fiction in April and May of 1942, and then was published in book form in 1948.  In the 1952 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll it was rated 25th overall for science fiction books.    I found this book to be surprisingly poor.  After reading it I was not sure what the purpose of this story was.  The first part of the book is somewhat standard, it is the story of Hamilton Felix, who questions what the purpose of life is.  He is genetically superior to most people, and thus there is a lot of pressure on him to procreate.  The society he lives in is considered a \\"Utopia\\", but frankly it has a lot in common with the society presented in Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\".  However, the mood of this book is much lighter than that of Huxley's.  After an incident at a restaurant things change for Hamilton.  A revolutionary group tries to recruit him to use in their attempt to seize control of the government and he meets a woman who changes his viewpoint on remaining single.    Once that story reaches a conclusion, the book continues on, touching on a variety of Science Fiction themes, but failing to deliver anything more than a chaotic mish-mash of a plot.  There is a bit of a story about a man from the early 20th century being found in a stasis field.  There is the start of a search for the meaning of life and the universe.  There is the beginning of a story about a telepath.  Finally, there is the start of a story about the transference of a dying person's consciousness into a fetus.  Hamilton Felix is present throughout the book, and there are several other characters that are in most of the book as well, but there doesn't seem to be any conclusion to most of what happens in the book.  Any and all of these themes could be used to make up a great science fiction novel, but this isn't it.    It is with extreme reluctance that I give one of Heinlein's books such a low rating.  He istruly one of the greats of the genre.  I suspect this must be his worst, as it isn't even near the same quality as any of his other novels or short fiction that I have read.	2005-01-12
US	53054493	R2G4LDHPXDGORN	0743244508	663516219	The Battle of Salamis: The Naval Encounter That Saved Greece -- and Western Civilization	Books	4	43	47	N	N	Informative And Entertaining	Barry Strauss has done a wonderful job of relating the story of the ancient world's most significant naval battle at Salamis.  This book is both entertaining and informative, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this period of history.   <br /> <br />It covers briefly the significant land (Thermopylae) and naval (Artemisium), as well as the sacking of Athens which preceded the Battle of Salamis.  Strauss also covers the situation which faced the Persians and Greeks in those days prior to the battle which is in the section called \\"The Trap\\".  What he is referring to is the plotting by Themistocles to try to ensure that the battle would take place at Salamis, and this along with the chapters on the battle itself are the real meat of the book.  The book finishes with a couple of chapters and an epilogue which covers the retreat by the Persians, and also discusses the short and long term effects of the battle.  He also discusses what happened to the major participants if it is known. <br /> <br />There are many interesting stories that take place in and around the battle.  These include stories about Themistocles, Xerxes, and Aeschylus.  Among the most interesting stories are those about Artemisia, the female queen/admiral who was one of Xerxes most trusted commanders.  She had predicted defeat prior to the battle, and during the battle she turned what should have been viewed as a treacherous act into her advantage after the battle.  Another very interesting story is that of Sicinnus who was sent by Themistocles to talk to Xerxes on the eve of the battle warning the Great King that the Greeks were about to depart and strongly hinted that Themistocles would defect to the Persian side. <br /> <br />Strauss uses many standard historical sources, relying heavily on Herodotus and related material.  He uses many sources on ancient naval battles and ships to fill in his narrative.  He even draws from Aeschylus the Greek playwright who was in the battle, and who later wrote \\"The Persians\\" a play about the battle, which is the only non-mythical extant Greek play. <br /> <br />The book does have a few flaws.  I felt that parts of it were not consistent.  As an example, in the discussion of the events just prior to the battle Strauss states that \\"Sicinnus's mission really did happen\\" which means that the Persians learned that the Greek fleet was to leave on the following day.  Later, when discussing the movement of the Persian fleet to block the Greeks from leaving he states \\"It is likely that they had chosen a cloudy night to enter the straits.\\"  It is not logical that they could choose the night based on the weather if they had just learned that the Greeks were about to leave.  These are minor points though, and only detract slightly from what is a very enjoyable book.	2005-01-09

Appleton and Company, and then in the U.K. on October 4, 1917 by Methuen & Co., so it is a fairly early Wodehouse story.  Although this is better than most of his early stories, it is not as good as some of his writing that would come later.  Those who know Wodehouse will find themselves in familiar territory.      The main character of this story is Lord Dawlish, who has a title but not much money, a fact of which his fiance, Claire Fenwick, reminds him repeatedly.  He suddenly finds that he has been left a fortune by a man he hardly knew, and being the honorable man he is he feels he needs to restore at least some of this money to its rightful heirs.  This takes him to America, where Claire also finds herself when a friend of hers writes her asking to visit.    To attempt to cover a Wodehouse plot completely would take much too long and I could never do it justice.  As one would expect there are several interesting characters, and lots of plot twists.  In the end, as with all of his stories, love wins out, and the reader enjoys the ride all the way.    This edition is another in \\"The Collector's Wodehouse\\" series being published by The Overlook Press in the U.S. (in the U.K. it is \\"The Everyman's Wodehouse\\" series being published by Everyman's Library).	2005-01-06

From the Study Guide to the Foreword by Thomas Jefferson, to the Certificate of Completion there is something in this book for everyone and pretty much something against everyone too.  They are not afraid to poke fun at everyone and everything. <br /> <br />From the title, one can tell that most of the focus is on the United States.  There are chapters on the the history of democracy, the founding of the U.S., one on each of the branches of the government, one about the election process, one about the media, and one on democracy's future.  Not all of the book is about the U.S. though.  Samantha Bee has a few pieces that poke some good natured fun at our neighbors to the north, and the last chapter takes a quick look at \\"The Rest of the World\\" (subtitled \\"International House of Horrors\\").   <br /> <br />Anyone who has seen \\"The Daily Show\\" is probably aware that it is fairly liberal.  That being said, they are more than willing to take shots at the left as well as the right.  I think that same feel comes across in this book. <br /> <br />Ultimately, you may find some parts that aren't funny to you, or you feel go too far, but if you turn the page you will probably find yourself laughing out loud at something else.  Definitely recommended to anyone who doesn't mind laughing at themselves.	2005-01-06
US	53054493	R3IC05LY93F1WR	0879979348	620992564	1984 Annual World's Best Science Fiction	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Very Good Anthology	The title may be a bit inaccurate, but this is a good collection of short speculative fiction.  This is a collection of 10 stories, which were originally published in 1983, and it is the collection itself which was published in June of 1984.  Six of these stories have won awards or been recognized in the SF community.    'Blood Music' by Greg Bear was first published in Analog in June of 1983.  It is the story of a scientist who crates \\"smart\\" cells using biotechnology and then injects them into himself.  Greg Bear would eventually publish a novel with this name in 1985.  This story won both the Nebula and Hugo awards for best novelette, and it also finished 4th for the Locus Award and 3rd on the SF Chronicle poll for novelettes.  It was recognized again in the 1999 Locus All-Time poll for novelettes where it tied for 13th.    'Potential' by Isaac Asimov was first published in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine in February of 1983.  It is one of Asimov's Multivac stories, where they are looking for humans with the potential for telepathy.  I have read some criticism of this story where it was called \\"meaningless\\", but I would have to disagree.  It is only 8 pages long, and even though it is a story of such short length it does have a message.  It was ranked 16th on the 1984 Locus Awards for short stories.    `Knight of Shallows' by Rand B. Lee was first published in Amazing Science Fiction in July of 1983.  This is a Multiverse scenario where a man learns that another universe's version of him is traveling to different universes and murdering that universe's version of him.  This novelette did not receive any awards, but I thought it held up fairly well with the other stories in this collection.    `Spending a Day at the Lottery Fair' by Frederik Pohl was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in October of 1983.  This story deals with the subject of overpopulation.  Any further discussion of it would act as a spoiler, so it will sufficeit to say that it is worth reading.  This story finished 3rd for the 1984 Locus Award for short stories.    `In The Face of My Enemy' by Joseph H. Delaney was first published in Analog in April of 1983.  An investigator tries to determine whether a planet is suitable to be colonized or exploited, but the company that holds the rights is less than helpful in the process.  This novella was nominated for the Hugo, and finished 10th for the 1984 Locus Award for novellas.    `The Nanny' by Thomas Wylde was first published in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine in July of 1983.  In this end of Earth scenario a man is sent to try to plant the seed of humanity on a planet around Alpha Centauri.  This novella does not have the most original story plot, but it reads well.    `The Leaves of October' by Don Sakers was first published by Analog in August of 1983.  In this story a tree is brought back to Earth from another planet, and it tries to make humans aware that his kind is sentient.  This story was rate 3rd for Novellas/Novelettes by the Analog Analytical Laboratory (annual reader's poll).  A novel length version of this story was published in 1988.    `As Time Goes By' by Tanith Lee was first published in Chrysalis 10 in April of 1983.  This is a time paradox story involving faster than light space travel.  It isn't clear why this particular novelette was included in the collection.  It is not a bad story, but I found it to be the weakest in the collection.    `The Harvest of Wolves' by Mary Gentle was first published in December of 1983.  Of the stories in this collection this would be the closest to a \\"1984\\" story.  A woman tries to defend her welfare status and avoid being declared unfit to live.  This short story (8 pages) may not have won any awards, but definitely holds its own.    `Homefaring' by Robert Silverberg was first published in Phantasia in 1983.  This is one of the best stories in the collection.  A man's consciousness is sent forward in time, wherehe finds himself sharing the body of a future resident of Earth.  This story was nominated for a Nebula Award for novellas, and finished 3rd on the SF Chronicle for 1984 and 4th for the Locus Award.	2004-12-31
US	53054493	R2NC8DB5V64ILC	0743486226	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	2	4	5	N	Y	Entertaining, But Flawed	This is the first Dan Brown book that I have read, so I can not compare it with his other stories.  The plot is about the re-emergence of a secret society (The Illuminati) which is the ancient nemesis of The Vatican.  The story takes place after the death of a Pope (a fictitious one, not John Paul II), when Robert Langdon (a Harvard Professor of religious iconology) is contacted by the head of CERN (a European scientific research group) to provide information on The Illuminati which they believe is involved in the death of one of their leading scientists.  As the plot unfolds, it appears that The Illuminati has planted a powerful bomb (with antimatter stolen from CERN) in the Vatican.  They also appear to have kidnapped the four leading candidates to become the new Pope with the intention of executing them in a fashion to tell the world that they are still around and powerful, and in an effort to destroy the Catholic Church.<br /><br />There are many good things about this book.  It was easy to read, and the reader is pulled into the story, making its 550+ pages fly by.  The characters are interesting, and the conspiracy plot is fairly well done, taking the reader from place to place in Rome and Vatican City.  Despite its flaws, for the most part the book was very entertaining.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are many problems with the story.  Some of the \\"facts\\" presented in the telling of the history of the Illuminati are wrong, and this does not appear to have been done for plot reasons.  The situation with the bomb was not done very well, because the scenario which is presented should have resulted in the bomb being found relatively quickly.  Finally, the last part of the book is messy.  There are many things thrown in at the end in an attempt to surprise the reader, but it really doesn't read true to the rest of the story; at least not for me.<br /><br />This is not a bad book.  It has a great concept, and for the most part is fun to read.  However, the ending and some significant holes in the story are the reasons that I give it two stars.  There are better choices available that involve secret societies from hundreds of years ago, such as \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" by Umberto Eco.	2004-12-27

In its pages, one can see some of the elements that were eventually to come together to form such great stories as \\"Around The World In Eighty Days\\", and \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\".  In this story, Dr. Ferguson creates a hydrogen balloon for the purpose of exploring the unknown regions of Africa.  He decides to take along Dick Kennedy, a Scotsman with whom he became friends when they served in the same regiment and who tries to dissuade him from making the journey, and Joe, who is his faithful servant.  As one might expect, parts of this story are dated, and some of the language regarding the natives undoubtedly would offend many people if one were not to take into account when it was written.  Still, it is an enjoyable book to read, and rates somewhere between 3 and 4 stars in my opinion.    The [other] publishing firm's bare-bones version of the book.  There is no foreword or introduction discussing the life of Jules Verne, or the context of the times in which it was published.  It simply contains the story, and nothing else.  It has a good solid binding, and the print is easy to read.  For some reason, they elected to put an extra line between each of the paragraphs, but this makes it even easier to read.  All the extra white space also makes it a much quicker read then one would expect.	2004-12-24

However, the version of Frankenstein that most people have read is the 1831 edition, which has significant changes from the original 1818 text.  This book gives the readers a chance to experience the original text, which is less refined and a bit darker then the revised text.  It also provides a wonderful introduction and notes discussing Mary Shelley's life, the context in which this story was written, and the differences between the original text and the 1831 edition.  These notes and introduction are by Marilyn Butler, who was a Professor of English Literature at Cambridge.<br /><br />The story is well known, although certainly the book is nothing like most of the movies that use its name.  While clearly one can find many issues from Mary Shelley's life and times that are addressed in this book, what makes it stand the test of time is how it can be made to relate to modern day issues as well.  One theme, science creates a \\"monster\\" which it cannot control and which ultimately destroys the lives of those that created it, can be found today in areas such as genetics, nuclear physics, etc., and will undoubtedly be with us in the future as well.  Other themes from the story carry forward from 1818 to today as well, which undoubtedly why this story is a classic and will always endure.	2004-12-24

This was first published in Astounding Science Fiction from February through April of 1943.  It was first published in book form in 1947, and was revised in 1952.  It was also published under the name 'One Against Eternity' in 1955. <br /> <br />In the Isher series, there are two organizations who are vying for power on Earth.  There is The Imperial Isher Dynasty, which is the governmental force on Earth.  Although the only governmental force, it has been unable to squash the technologically superior Weapon Shops, who provide the citizens with powerful weapons which can only be used in self-defense.  The main character of this story is Robert Hedrock, who appears to be working for both sides, or at least playing them off against each other.  The recent development of an interstellar drive has both powers trying to get control of the new technology.  Robert Hedrock is trying to gain control of the interstellar drive himself to maintain the balance of power.  It would be difficult to discuss this book any further without spoiling the story. <br /> <br />In 1952, this novel was ranked 26th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll.  The prior Isher stories include: 'The Seesaw' (July 1941) and 'The Weapon Shop' (December 1942), both of which were shorter fiction.  In 1951 'The Weapon Shops of Isher' was published, but the events in that novel take place before those in 'The Weapon Makers'.	2004-12-05

Originally released in August of 1946 as collection of 35 works from what are now considered the legends of science fiction.  It was tied for 4th on the Arkham Survey in 1949 and the top rated book on the Astounding/Analog polls in 1952 and 1956.  In 1966, 20 years after it was published, it was still rated as the 20th best science fiction book on the Astounding/Analog pole, and in 1999 it was ranked as the 3rd best SF anthology of all time. <br /> <br />Fourteen of the original 35 stories have also been long remembered by science fiction fans, including such stories as `Requiem' (Robert Heinlein), `Forgetfulness' (Don A. Stuart, a.k.a. John W. Campbell, Jr.), Nerves (Lester Del Rey), Black Destroyer (A.E. van Vogt), Nightfall (Isaac Asimov), and many more.  One must be careful in purchasing this book to be sure to get the full collection.  The second edition omits five of the stories, and there are several derivative collections that were released using the same or similar names.  The original 35 story collection was republished in 1957 under the title `Famous Science Fiction Stories: Adventures in Time and Space.'	2004-12-02
US	53054493	R1II4OVDTWPGA5	0312852533	422936499	The Humanoids: A Novel	Books	4	13	14	N	Y	Two Classics	This book contains two classic SF works.  The first is the novelette titled 'With Folded Hands...' published first in 1947 in 'Astounding Science Fiction'.  The second story is the novel \\"The Humanoids\\", which was also published originally in 'Astounding Science Fiction' in 1948 (March - May) under the title '...And Searching Mind'.  The two stories share the same nemesis, which are the robots known as The Humanoids. <br /> <br />The Humanoids' purpose is \\"To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men from Harm\\", which is really just a rewording of the first two laws of robotics that Asimov and Campbell create for Asimov's robot stories that first started to appear in 1940.  However, this does not make these stories redundant, as Williamson's Humanoids take their purpose to the extreme, and go so far as to prevent men from doing anything that could potentially cause harm, which includes such activities as driving, or even reading in some cases.  <br /> <br />In 'With Folded Hands...,' the hero is Mr. Underhill, who opposes the humanoids at first because they threaten his livelihood (he is an android salesman), but later because he can see the effect they have on people's lives.  He works with the creator of the Humanoids, Mr. Sledge, who is desperately trying to put an end to his creation. <br /> <br />In 'The Humanoids,' the hero is Dr. Clay Forester, who is made aware of the Humanoid menace by a group of humans with various special abilities such as teleportation, clairvoyance, telekinesis, and telepathy.  They refer to these types of abilities as \\"psychophysics\\".  As the story proceeds, the reader becomes less and less sure who is right and who is wrong in the conflict.  The Humanoids, though still a presence, are not the main foe for Dr. Forester.  Instead he focuses on Frank Ironsmith, a former colleague who is helping the Humanoids, involved with Forester's wife Ruth,  and is given much more freedom than other humans by the Humanoids. Although the Humanoids use some horrible methods of forcing people to be happy (e.g. drugs, surgery), they are not nearly as controlling as they were in `With Folded Hands....'  One oddity between the two stories is that Williamson introduces a different creator of the Humanoids, whose name is Warren Mansfield. <br /> <br />These two stories are definitely worth reading for anyone interested in Science Fiction.  `The Humanoids' rated 27th in 1952 for science fiction books, and tied for 18th in 1956 on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Polls.  `With Folded Hands...' tied for 32nd in 1999 on the Locus All-Time Poll of novelettes. <br />	2004-11-30

Unfortunately, even though this is called the Third Revised Edition, it is not clear in what way this book has been updated.  It contains the preface to the first edition, but no new preface or introduction is added for the third edition.<br /><br />It does include a \\"Corrigenda and Addenda to the Second Edition\\" after the main body of texts, but the question is: Why weren't these addenda included in the text instead of put outside of the main text, and where are the addenda for the third edition?  To make matters worse, the second edition addenda information uses page numbers that do not align with the third edition publication.<br /><br />There is still a lot of valuable information in this book, but it is important for the buyer to be aware of what they are actually getting when they purchase it.	2004-11-26

The first part of the story deals with his survival of the plague, and his journey around the country looking for signs of survivors.   <br /> <br />He returns to his home (in the Bay area of California) where he finally meets a woman (Emma) whose courage convinces him to start a family, which becomes a 'tribe' as a few other survivors come to join them.  He tries to pass on as much knowledge as he can to the children of the tribe, but his efforts are largely in vain as civilization continues to regress.  Ultimately he realizes a way to pass on some very basic knowledge to help his descendants in the future. <br /> <br />The author does an excellent job of dealing with the plague, the after effects of such a plague on nature, as well as the slow decay of the cities and infrastructure of our civilization.  He also describes well drop into a primitive society that would result from the plague.  There is also an interesting moral dilemma when the tribe has to deal with a potential threatening outsider who tries to join them. <br /> <br />The flaws of this story are few.  There are a few sections which clearly take place at roughly the time when the story was published (1949).  As a result, some of the references to technology and personalities make those sections of the story feel a bit dated.  This only happens a few times though, and doesn't really hurt the story. <br /> <br />This book won the first science fiction award given when it won the International Fantasy Award in 1951.  In 1987, it rated 28th on the Locus All-Time Poll of All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it tied for 41st on the Locus poll of SF Novels written before 1990.	2004-11-25

Snoopy becomes increasingly more eccentric, but he has not yet become a WWI flying ace.  Linus occasionally has a blanket, but it is not a permanent part of his character, nor does he even speak yet.  Lucy does fall for Schroeder in this collection, and Charlie Brown has his first sad Valentine's Day (although for some reason the description for the third volume indicates that this event occurs within its pages). <br /> <br />For most of this collection, the cast includes only the same 8 characters as existed at the end of the previous collection (Charlie Brown, Patty, Snoopy, Shermy, Violet, Schroeder, Lucy, and Linus).  The only addition that lasts is Pig-Pen, who first appears in July of 1954.  The other short-time addition is the long forgotten Charlotte Braun, who appears briefly in November of 1954.  The most common characters during this period are Charlie Brown and Lucy.  Snoopy is the next most common, while Patty becomes less common and is more of a secondary character along with Schroeder and Violet.  Linus becomes more common as time passes, while Shermy appears only rarely in 1954. <br /> <br />This is an excellent collection, and it is clear that the editors have worked hard in trying to locate all the old strips.  This is definitely worthwhile for all fans of the strip.	2004-11-01

In this collection of the first 2+ years of the strip it evolves rapidly from a group of four barely recognizable characters (Charlie Brown, Patty, Shermy and Snoopy) to a group of eight characters which, for the most part, are easily identified with the characters in the later strips.<br /><br />In the very early strips, Patty and Shermy are the most frequent characters, although before long Charlie Brown becomes the most common character, as he changes in personality from a bit of a prankster to the doubt filled character that keeps trying and never succeeding.  Snoopy starts out as a dog that does not seem to have one particular owner, although he is clearly Charlie Brown's dog by the end of this collection.  Patty is the most common female character until the arrival of Lucy.  Shermy becomes less and less common as the collection goes on.  Snoopy is not nearly as prevalent as he becomes in later years, and of all the characters is the least like what he will eventually become in the later strips.  Violet joins the cast in February of 1951, followed by a very young Schroeder in May of that year.  Lucy is also much younger when she first appears in March of 1952, as is Linus when he appears in September of 1952.<br /><br />In this collection you see a lot of the development of the characters and firsts for the strip.  Charlie Brown gets his distinctive shirt.  Schroeder gets his piano and starts his infatuation with Beethoven, including the bust that sits on his toy piano.  Charlie Brown is called a \\"Blockhead\\" for the first time (by Violet).  Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown for the first time (although Violet is the first one to fail to hold the ball for him in an earlier strip).  Good grief is uttered for the first time (by Patty).  Lucy starts her tormenting of Charlie Brown (winning 4000 games of checkers in a row).<br /><br />In addition to the strips, there is an introduction by Garrison Keillor, which is interesting, but it is odd that he states that Charles Schulz didn't live to see the rise of the graphic novel which is clearly not true.  There is a nice article called \\"The Life and Times of Charles M. Schulz\\" by David Michaelis which is a quite good look at his life.  There is an interview of Charles M. Schulz from 1987 which provides tremendous insight into his work.  Lastly, there is an index which makes it easier to find specific characters or events in the strips.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent start to a collection of one of the greatest comic strips of all time.  I look forward to the rest of the series.re is an introduction by Garrison Keillor, which is interesting, but it is odd that he states that Charles Schulz didn't live to see the rise of the graphic novel which is clearly not true.

The original sources used for these translations were all written in Akkadian (which includes Semitic Babylonian and Assyrian dialects).

It may be a bit unfair to criticize this book for failing to include episodes from the period after it was originally published, but on the other hand fans of the show today would like to have a complete guide, and there is no obvious reason why a revised edition couldn't be produced.  This book covers the first six seasons of the show fairly well, although it would have been nice to have more behind the scenes information.  Sometimes they tell you why a movie was picked, but usually they don't provide any reason at all.  It also contains a brief section on Season 7, and another on the MST3K The Movie.    They also could have provided more fun information, such as lists of movies they wished they had done; which movies they did do that they thought were the worst; which movies they rejected; etc...  You will find occasional mentions of these things in the write-ups for a particular movie, but they could have provided sections for the information, and make it organized and more complete.  All in all, this is a good book, but it leaves the reader wanting more.	2004-09-24
US	53054493	RM6AM0QLBUS7E	185798806X	1396600	Last and First Men (SF Masterworks)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Stapledon's First Masterwork	Prior to the publication of \\"Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future\\" in 1930, Olaf Stapledon had already published a couple of short stories, poems, including a book of poetry, a non-fiction book \\"A Modern Theory of Ethics: A Study of the Relations of Ethics and Psychology\\", and numerous essays.  However, this was his first book of fiction, and remains, if not his most famous work, than one of his two most famous works.  While clearly Stapledon's fictional work falls into the category of science fiction, in many ways it is unique and while it is easy to find authors who were influenced by Stapledon, it is much more difficult to find an author who has significant influence on Stapledon's work.<br /><br />The journey into the far future moves faster and faster as it continues.  A fair amount of time is spent on the First Men and our future both near and far.  This speeds up as Stapledon takes us through the Second through Fifth Men and faster still until he reaches the Last Men.  He covers many concepts such as genetic engineering, terraforming, alien invasion, biological warfare, and so on.<br /><br />The narrative of \\"Last and First Men\\" is driven by ideas, and not by characters, and in many ways this is true of all of his fictional work, though certainly novels like \\"Odd John\\" and \\"Sirius\\" have characters and take on the appearance of a standard novel.  The novel has tremendous scope, the narrative being given from billions of years in the future by a member of the last race of men, i.e. the Last Men who are aware that they will destroyed and thus be the last of men.  They story covers the cyclical nature of the history of the First Men, i.e. us, and the cyclical nature of many of the races of Men who follow.  It also discusses the psychology and the philosophy of the races as well as some of the physical and physiological changes.<br /><br />The cyclical nature of many of the things he discusses tends to make parts of the novel a bit repetitive, and so I believe that it detracts a bit from the overall effect of the novel.  That being said, it is still an extraordinary novel and unlike anything else you will likely ever read, with the possible exception of Stapledon's \\"Star Maker\\" which has a similar scope as well as an unusual narrative, but also has a different feel.  Stapledon did not finish with the idea of the Last Men with the publication of this novel, as he returned to the idea in his radio play \\"Far Future Calling\\" in 1931 where he amazingly puts the novel in dramatic form, but which sadly was never performed.  He also returned to the idea for his second novel \\"Last Men in London\\" in 1932, which focuses on a look back at the 20th Century from the perspective of one of the Last Men.<br /><br />This book was rated 3rd on the Arkham Survey in 1949 as one of the `Basic SF Titles'.  It also was tied for 30th on the 1975 Locus All-Time poll for Novels; 43rd on the 1987 Locus All-Time pool of SF Novels, and tied for 43rd on the 1998 Locus All-Time Poll for Novels written prior to 1990.

Foster.  Each of them has their strong points, but overall I prefer the Foster translation.  The Foster translation is much more recent(2001), and benefits from additional pieces of the epic being found.  The Heidel translation is from 1946 and for that reason has more gaps than the Foster translation.  Heidel also translates the racier portions of the epic into Latin rather than English which is troublesome for non-scholars. <br /> <br />That being said, there are some very good things about this book which make it worthwhile.  Heidel does an excellent job of informing the reader of what the source is for each part of the translation, as well as for the related material that he presents.  His sections on 'Death and the Afterlife', and 'The Story Of The Flood' where he compares the Mesopotamian works with those of the Old Testament are much better than the discussion given with the Foster translation in my opinion.  In addition, Rivkah Scharf Kluger uses Heidel's translation for most of her work presented in \\"The Archetypal Significance of Gilgamesh\\", which give those interested in a large amount of discussion all based on the same translation. <br /> <br />One last comment on the book itself is that the typeface used is rather small, and not very easy on the eyes.	2004-08-22

It includes a lot of insightful information on what different parts of the Epic represent in terms of the Sumerian and Babylonian civilizations.  For the most part, she uses Alexander Heidel's translation of the epic for her observations.  The only weakness of this book as far as I am concerned, is that it was put together after the author's death, and much of it is clearly based on her lectures.  I think if she had a chance to organize her materials into book form, the result would have been even better.  As it is, this is still a very good resource for those interested in learning more about the Gilgamesh epic.	2004-08-07

The epic was translated by Benjamin R. Foster.  The book also includes \\"The Sumerian Gilgamesh Poems\\", translated by Douglas Frayne, and \\"The Hittite Gilgamesh\\", translated by Gary Beckman.  In addition, there is \\"The Gilgamesh Letter\\", several essays discussing the epic, and an Introduction section which helps those who are new to the Epic with their first reading.  The translation uses the \\"standard version\\" associated with Sin-leqe-unninni as its base, and supplements it with parts from other versions where there are gaps.  There are also comments in the text to help the reader follow the passages easier.    An area of weakness of this book was in the area of editorial comments.  For example, Mr. Foster states in the introduction:    \\"There is no evidence that The Epic of Gilgamesh began as an oral narrative performed by bards or reciters and coalesced into a written text only later.  In fact, the poem as we now have it shows many signs of having been a formal, written, literary work composed and perhaps performed for well-educated people, especially scholars and members of a royal court.\\"    This is in sharp contrast with other opinions which I have read regarding the origins of the Epic.  While it may be that there is no conclusive proof one way or another, there clearly is some evidence to support the theory that it did begin as an oral narrative, just as there is evidence that it may not have.  If Mr. Foster completely disregards the evidence on the other side of the argument, then one is left to wonder if there are other \\"facts\\" provided by the editor that are equally suspect.  When comparing this translation to those by Alexander Heidel and Stephanie Dalley, one can see significant differences at the start of the epic where the other editors use as evidence which suggests that this was an oral narrative originally.  Mr. Foster'stranslation though is worded in a way that does not suggest an oral origin.      On the whole, this was a very readable translation of the Epic.  The supplementary material included is also very good.  While I may disagree with some of the editor's opinions about the history of the work and the way he presents the evidence, this is still a good choice to read.	2004-07-20

Doran, and then in the U.K. on October 17, 1919 by Herbert Jenkins, and it is a splendid example of early Wodehouse.  This edition is part of The Collector's Wodehouse series being released by The Overlook Press (in the U.K. it is The Everyman's Wodehouse series from Everyman's Library).      As with many Wodehouse classics, this one includes a collection of colorful characters, a complex love story involving many characters, and of course the happy ending where everything works out.  It is the story of an American Composer, George Bevan, who falls in love with Maud (The Earl of Marshmoreton's daughter).  Maud is already in love with another American, Geoffrey Raymond, who she met in Wales the previous year.  Her brother and aunt, Lord Belpher and Lady Caroline Byng oppose her getting involved with the American and want her to marry someone from her social class.  There are more characters as well, including some servants, Lady Caroline's son Reggie, Lord Marshmoreton's secretary Alice Faraday, and an acquaintance of George's Billie Dore who is in the Chorus of George's latest musical comedy.    As with most Wodehouse stories, the plot is very complicated, and attempts to describe it in detail would fail to do it justice.  It does involve a case of mistaken identity, a pool among the servants on who will marry Maud, and several characters finding their loves.  Overall this is a very good example of a classic Wodehouse story, and it is well worth reading.	2004-07-17

As with \\"Eleven Minutes\\" I found this book to be a quick read, and hard to put down.  It is the story of a Spanish shepherd boy named Santiago, who goes in search of his \\"Personal Legend\\".  He is started on his quest by a Gypsy woman and a man who calls himself king.  He runs into many people and obstacles along the way, and always his desire to obtain his Personal Legend sees himself through.  One of the people he meets is the Alchemist, from which the book gets its title, and he is instrumental in helping Santiago reach his goal.  <br />This book is different then \\"Eleven Minutes\\" in many ways.  The style is lighter, and it is clearly not meant to be a true story.  The reader never doubts that Santiago will succeed in his quest, nor feels suspense at the dangers he encounters.  However, suspense is not the purpose of this book.  This book is about dreams, and listening to one's heart, and in that it does its job very well.	2004-06-17

It was published in book form in 1946 by Arkham House, but the story originally appeared in the pages of Astounding Magazine in 1940. It was a highly rated classic of Science Fiction for more than 25 years after it originally appeared, but today it is often forgotten along with many of the early classics. In 1949 it was tied for 4th on the Arkham Survey of 'Basic SF Titles'. It ranked 2nd on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll in 1952, 5th, in 1956, and 3rd in 1966.<br /><br /> It is the story of a mutant race of humanity (Slan) who are stronger, smarter, and are telepathic. In the story we are told that the name Slan is derived from Samuel Lann who is purported to be the creator of the race. At the start, the Slan are hunted by humanity to be destroyed, and through the course of events we learn the history of the race, as well as the truth behind the crimes of which they are accused.<br /><br /> The story is told through the eyes of two of the Slan. The first is Jommy Cross who is nine years old when the story commences, and who is becomes isolated from any other Slan when his mother is captured. The second Slan is Kathleen Layton, who is a prisoner of the government and being held for observation.<br /><br /> This is an excellent book, which holds up well 60+ years later. It is fast paced, and definitely worth reading.	2004-06-15

Fowler Wright's 1929 classic novel, \\"The World Below\\", is as enjoyable today, as it was when first published.  The novel is divided into two books, the first is \\"The Amphibians\\", which was first published by itself in 1925 (1924 according to some sources).  The second book continues the story started in \\"The Amphibians', and bears the same title as the novel, \\"The World Below\\".      The story is one of time travel, where the narrator travels half a million years into the future in an attempt to find two previous explorers who have failed to return.  What he finds is a world as completely different from ours, as ours is different from when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.  He encounters several new intelligent peoples whom he names: `The Amphibians', `The Killers', and The Dwellers\\".     As with the novels of Verne, as well as some of Wells, this story is more adventure than science fiction, but it is very enjoyable and well worth reading.  This book was tied for 7th on the Arkham Survey of 'Basic SF Titles' in 1949.  It was also ranked 28th on the 1952 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll for books.  Although this work is in the shadow of H.G. Wells \\"The Time Machine\\", it is still an intriguing and highly imaginative work worth rediscovering.	2004-05-30

This is a story which has been done before, where a young woman (Maria) leaves her home to seek fame and fortune and ends up on the streets.  What this book does very well, is show the difference between sex and love, and the writing makes one want to follow the story all the way to the end.<br />There are some flaws though, some of which may be due to the translation.  For one thing, the absence of drugs seems to be unrealistic, but perhaps that was the correct decision, because in this story sex is the drug that is being used.  Another oddity that distracted me was how the narrative shifted from Maria's point-of-view to another character's for brief periods.  Overall, these problems are small though, and this book is very interesting to read.	2004-05-30

Hugo Danner is the strongest man on earth.  His father, Professor Abednego Danner, attempts to duplicate the strength displayed by small insects.  He tests a solution he creates on tadpoles, and a kitten, before finally drugging his pregnant wife, Matilda, and injecting it into her abdomen.  The result is a bullet-proof, super strong, super fast baby boy.  <br />Aside from similarities in abilities between Hugo and Superman, the stories are very different.  \\"Gladiator\\" is the story of a man blessed with super abilities, and cursed because he has them.  As he goes through life, he always must try to hide just how strong and fast he is.  Time and time again, he feels he is forced to flee from his current situation when those around him learn of his abilities.  He spends time as a Sports hero in college, a strongman in a sideshow on Coney Island, a war hero, and many others.  Each time he thinks he has found a place, but each time he is disappointed.<br />This book was tied for 9th on the Arkham Survey of `Basic SF Titles' in 1949.  It is not without flaws, but I found it to be entertaining.  It is certainly not a great book, but just as certain it is worth reading.  If the legacy of \\"Gladiator\\" is the Superman comics, then that alone would make it noteworthy.  As an early SF novel, it is also of interest.	2004-05-12

The hero of the story is Jeff Johnson, who is an historical researcher.  He is employed by a writer of Civil War books, Braun.  They are in the process of finalizing Braun's latest book, \\"The Duty Bound\\", and starting to work on Braun's next book on Lincoln, when he meets Annie.  Annie is suffering from bad dreams, which appear to be coming from Robert E. Lee during the American Civil War.  Throughout the book Jeff helps her determine what the dreams mean, and becomes obsessed with her.  This short hypnosis cannot do justice to this book, since there are many layers to the story.  I found that this book was hard to put down, and that I was always eager to get back to it.    \\"Lincoln's Dreams\\" was published in 1987 and was Connie Willis's first novel written outside of the collaboration she did with Cynthia Felice (\\"Water Witch\\") in 1982.  She also had published a collection of short fiction called \\"Fire Watch\\" in 1985 prior to this novel.  \\"Lincoln's Dreams\\" won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for the best SF novel published in the U.S. in 1987.  It was rated as the 5th best Fantasy Novel in by the 1988 Locus Awards.  It was nominated for the 1988 Mythopoeic Award, and the William L. Crawford - IAFA Fantasy Award.	2004-05-09

It is the story of a scientific expedition that is sent to determine if the reported findings of prehistoric life still existing in a remote area of South America are true.  Professor Challenger is the one defending his findings, Professor Summerlee is the skeptic, and there are two unbiased observers:  the guide, Lord John Roxton, and a reporter Ned Malone, who also servers as the Narrator of the story.  This story has the feel of a Jules Verne's adventure.<br /><br />This book is certainly showing some of its age.  The opening of the book, in which we learn of Ned Malone's motivation, certainly comes across as dated and sexist.  In it the woman of his dreams tells him \\"There are heroisms all round us waiting to be done.  It's for men to do them, and for women to reserve their love as a reward for such men...  That's what I should like - to be envied for my man.\\"  Much later in the book, we have the scientific expedition deciding to try to wipe out a race of previously unknown ape-men, hardly something a scientist would contemplate in this day and age, and I doubt it would have been even when this book was first published.  Yet despite these and other flaws, I did enjoy reading this book. The characters were eccentric and entertaining, and I was compelled to keep reading to find out what would happen to them.<br /><br />This book was tied for 9th on August Derleth's Arkham Survey of `Basic SF Titles', but it really is more of an Adventure novel than a Science Fiction novel.	2004-05-06

Olaf Stapledon, is undoubtedly best known for his amazing novels \\"Star Maker\\" and \\"Last and First Men\\", but if that is all you have read from him then you have missed out on his writings which are in a more traditional style.  \\"Sirius: A Fantasy of Love and Discord\\", published in 1944, is an excellent book as well, though not on the same scale as those earlier works.  It is the story of a \\"super sheepdog\\" (Sirius), who was biologically engineered with hormones, and raised along with the daughter (Plaxy) of the scientist (Thomas Trelone).  It is a tragic story, in which Sirius struggles between the worlds of his human family and his canine instinct.  A unique bond is formed between Plaxy and Sirius that shapes both of their lives.    \\"Sirius\\" can stand alone, or be considered part of Stapledon's vast future universe as outlined in his other works.  The story is simply on a much smaller scale, and so would not in and of itself be a noteworthy event in books like \\"Last and First Men\\" or \\"Star Maker\\".  Thomas Trelone is Stapledon's Frankenstein, though certainly he does not suffer from the same character flaws as Shelly's famous predecessor.  At the same time, Trelone admits that he failed to consider all of the consequences of his experiment, which led to a very lonely and torn character in Sirius.  Sirius cannot fit in with humans for many reasons, though Sirius himself focuses on the lack of hands.  Sirius also doesn't fit with other canines, as he finds them too simple and only interesting when a female is in heat.    This book was tied for 9th on the Arkham Survey in 1949 as one of the `Basic SF Titles', which was a higher rank than \\"Star Maker\\" (tied for 13th) received.  Perhaps the main reason this book is no longer as highly regarded as Stapledon's other books is due to the fact that it is a more traditional style of writing.  Innovation counts for a lot with the fans of this genre, and over the course of time more traditional works can be forgotten.  However, this book should not be forgotten nor should Stapledon's \\"Odd John\\", because though they are told in a more traditional manner, they still are uniquely Stapledon, and as such they are both worth reading.	2004-05-04

The authors cover what the subject of Statistics is, the history of Statistics, some of the theories and terms, and also shows some applications of the subject.      The weakness of the book is that there are a lot of formulas given and not enough discussion of how those formulas are derived, so one would need to use other statistics texts to supplement the material.  Thus this book cannot stand alone.  On the other hand, if one is just trying to get an overview of the subject, then there is a lot to skip over.  The authors do make a humorous presentation of the material, so those that are looking for an overview may find this a more enjoyable introduction to the subject.    There is also a lot to do with Statistics that the book does not mention.  It does cover probabilities, but when it comes to distributions it focuses only on Standard Normal distributions.  I don't believe it ever mentions Uniform, Poisson, or other types of distributions which most Statistics courses cover.    The best part of the book is the examples, some of which are carried through for several chapters to help the reader better understand the subject. Although, even with the examples they are a bit inconsistent in their presentation.  For example, in one case they started to discuss the use of statistics to compare the salaries of male and female employees in the same job, but they never complete the discussion.  The examples of racial bias in jury selection, and the gas mileage comparison of two different types of gas are much more complete.    This is a decent book, but not up to the level of Gonick's excellent \\"Cartoon History of the Universe\\" series, and not strong enough to give it more than three stars.	2004-05-02

It is a slowly building science fiction/horror story.  In 1949 it was tied for 9th on the Arkham Survey of `Basic SF Titles'.  The pace of the story is a bit slow.  The story is told from the point of view of Berekley Jones, who is relating the circumstances that led up to the suicide of his friend (Jerry Lister) to Jerry's father.  He starts the story with the discovery, by Jerry and himself, of the dead body of one of their former professors.  They are surprised to learn that the person they knew as a life-long bachelor had married, and that his widow (Selena) now wants to meet them.  Jerry quickly falls for Selena, but Berk has the opposite reaction and actually fears her.  The story covers Jerry and Selena's brief courtship, as Berkley tells of his reasons why he considers Selena to be something other than what she appears to be.    For most of the book, the reader knows in general where the story is going, but is forced to wait until the final chapter to find out the specifics.  Yet, despite the slow pace and the somewhat predictible plot, I found the writing held my interest fairly well.  I can't say this is a great book, but I enjoyed it enough to recommend it.	2004-04-29

This book was originally titled \\"The Cartoon Guide to Computer Science\\", and was published in 1983.  So much has happened in the world of computers since 1983, that this book has become very dated.  This book still works as a history of Computers, but the parts of the book which focus more on the current state of computers is no longer relevant, nor was it when the book was published again in 1991 by HarperPerennial.<br /><br />The areas that are well done include the history of the subject and related subjects, the overview of how computers work, the sections on logic and binary numbers.  The parts that are poor are those on the PC, and BASIC programming, which suffer from being out of date and no longer relevant.  There are several subjects that are missing too, such as networking and the Internet.  If you are seeking a light-hearted trip down memory lane in the field of computers, then this might be a good choice, otherwise you may want to look elsewhere.  In 1983, this probably would have been a four star book, but today I can only give it two.	2004-04-26

Given the subject, it is easy to see that this is not a complete collection, and one could easily imagine that it will develop into a series of books.  The book has several sections and covers many areas such as: politics, the arts, popular culture, war and peace, science, sports, business, etc...  Mixed in with the stories of people trying to implement bad ideas are lists of bad ideas such as cars, books, movies, etc, and ill-advised quotes.  Some of the \\"bad ideas\\" are fairly well known, some are actually urban legends, and others are much more obscure.<br />This is not a great book, but it is fun, and it certainly does not demand to be read in one sitting.  Rather it seems well suited to picking it up occasionally and reading the selections that catch one's eye.  This book is an above average selection, and worthwhile for those looking for some light reading.	2004-04-25

The first edition of this book was a large volume which tried to live up to its ambitious title.  There were 40 short stories put into 6 sections titled as follows: \\"The Atom\\", \\"The Wonders of Earth\\", \\"The Superscience of Man\\", \\"Dangerous Inventions\\", \\"Adventures in Dimension\\", and \\"From Outer Space\\".  The collection includes a large number of stories originally published between 1930 and 1945, from authors like Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Clifford D. Simak, Theodore Sturgeon, A.E. van Vogt, and many more.  In addition, there were some older stories from Edgar Allen Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, H.G. Wells, among others.  <br />The revised edition, published in 1963 included just 22 of the original 40 stories, losing all of the older stories, and some of the newer ones as well.  It is true that some of the stories were somewhat dated, and certainly the revised edition is a very good selection of stories from the 30's and first half of the 40's.  However, I prefer the lengthier original edition, which was republished in 1980 under the name \\"The Golden Age of Science Fiction.\\"  There are too many stories to name them all, but among those that are included are \\"Deadline\\" by Cleve Cartmill, \\"Killdozer!\\" by Theodore Sturgeon, \\"Goldfish Bowl\\" by Anson MacDonald (a.k.a. Robert Heinlein), \\"First Contact\\" by Murray Leinster (a.k.a. William F. Jenkins), and \\"Jackdaw\\" by Ross Rocklynne, all of which appear in both editions of this book.<br />This book was tied for 13th on the Arkham Survey in 1949 as one of the `Basic SF Titles'.  It also was rated as the 6th best book on the 1952 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll.  As for awards for the stories in this collection: \\"Killdozer!\\" was tied for 35th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll for Short Fiction in 1971.  \\"First Contact\\" was tied for 9th on the same poll, and won the Retro Hugo for novelettes written in 1945 which was awarded in 1996.  \\"The Piper's Son\\" was also nominated for the Retro Hugo for novelettes written in 1945.	2004-04-25

The most impressive thing about this book is how comprehensive it is.  The author covers all of the aspects of the code-breaking effort.  Including some of the technical details involved in breaking the code, the personalities of those involved, the stories of their efforts to capture code books and equipment, and the effects that their efforts had on the war.  The book is arranged in chronological order, with appendixes provided to give more of the detail of the technical aspects.  The epilogue includes a wrap-up of what happened to the major participants after the war.  This is a very worthwhile read for anyone interested in World War II and Enigma.	2004-04-14

This is a period of history for which it is hard to find good sources of information, and this is certainly the best book that I have found on the period.  Michael Grant does a good job of pulling together information from the various sources.  Nor is this book limited to just a one or two city states.  The author does a commendable job of looking at many different city states, although as he talks about in his introduction, it would be impossible to cover the hundreds that existed.<br />One area that could have been better would have been the maps.  Yes there are some provided, but there could have been more, and they could have been placed better and notated to aid the reader in following the descriptions in the text.  On the whole though, this is a very good book, and the author does a good job of relating what was going on in each of these areas during that time period.  The book also includes chronological tables, and a bibliography, both of which are of use to the reader in understanding the timing of the events of the period, and finding additional references.	2004-04-10

This makes it one of the earlier works by Wodehouse.  This particular printing is another from The Collector's Wodehouse series being released by The Overlook Press (in the U.K. it is The Everyman's Wodehouse series from Everyman's Library).  These are very nicely produced books, although it isn't clear what criteria they are using to select the order in which his works will be published.  For example, this is the second in the Psmith series, and the first has yet to be published.    This particular story centers on Mike Jackson, a Cricket player who is looking forward to going on to the `Varsity at Cambridge.  This dream is spoiled when his father loses most of the family's money (no mention of how).  Instead Mike goes to work at a Bank where, by chance, Psmith, a friend from cricket, also happens to be starting work on the same day.  The bank manager, Mr. John Bickersdyke, is their nemesis in the book.  He just happened to ruin Mike's last cricket match by walking across the screen and distracting Mike.  This caused him to fall short of his century and lose the match. The situation in this book is very contrived and forced.  It is true that many of Wodehouse's situations are contrived, but for me this one seemed much more so.  Perhaps it was because there really isn't a plot to this book.  Instead there are some humorous situations and interesting characters, but there doesn't really seem to be a story until the final few chapters.  There are some very funny parts of this book, but it was far from Wodehouse's best work.	2004-04-09

J. Watt and Co., and in the U.K. it was published under this title on November 15, 1910 by Alston Rivers, Ltd., which makes it one of Wodehouse's earlier works.  The edition I am reviewoing is from The Collector's Wodehouse series being released by The Overlook Press (in the U.K. it is The Everyman's Wodehouse series from Everyman's Library).  The series is very nicely produced, the bindings are excellent, and the paper quality is high.    This particular story is about Jimmy Pitt, who makes a bet that \\"any man of ordinary intelligence could break into a house.\\"  There is some pre-history to the characters, which the reader is given in a hurry, and it feels a bit more forced than other Wodehouse books that I have read.  I do not want to go into much detail about the plot because there are many twists and turns which are undoubtedly familiar to readers of Wodehouse.  Still, there is something missing in the telling of this story.  It lacks the easy flow that many of his later stories have.  However, one can see the early elements of what would eventually make P. G. Wodehouse one of the great humorists of all time.	2004-04-03

In 1949, it appeared on August Derleth's Arkham Survey of `Basic SF Titles', tied for 13th.  Time has not been very kind to this book, and it remains largely unnoticed today.  <br />The story centers on an invention that allows people to view history by extracting the light which was absorbed by stones throughout history.  In using the time viewer, the characters in the book watch the extinction of the dinosaurs, and in particular they follow one dinosaur which they name Belshazzar, who is a massive flesh eater.<br />The reasons this book is not mentioned with the greats today are clear; the science part of the book doesn't really make much sense, nor would it have even when the book was written.  Likewise science has shown that the species of dinosaurs that interact in this story, almost certainly were not alive during the same periods of time.  On the positive side, this is perhaps the first science fiction story to use the concept of a time viewer.  Also, the story itself is fairly well written, and is enjoyable to read.	2004-04-02

Before that, it appeared as a serial in the Argus, which was a daily newspaper in Melbourne.  In 1949, it tied for 13th on the Arkham Survey of `Basic SF Titles', but unlike many of the other books on that list, it has disappeared from notice.  Only occasionally does it seem to get mentioned, and then it is referred to as the first major Australian SF novel and not as an all-time classic.<br />The copy that I managed to find was published by Sirius Quality Paperbacks in 1981, and is 416 pages in length.  The story is kind of a combination of the Atlantis myth with the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty.  I think one of the reasons it has not lasted as well as some other classic SF titles, is that it is fairly predictable.  I knew from reading the prologue where the book was going for the most part, and it takes its time getting there.  On the plus side, it is enjoyable reading, even if you know where it is going.<br />At the risk of being a small spoiler, there is one part of the plot that is important, and was not predictable from the prologue alone.  The racial issue given the context of this book being written between the two world wars is interesting, and somewhat foretelling.  I suspect that it is for this reason that the book was highly rated in 1949 when August Derleth conducted the Arkham Survey.  However, even that issue, once it is introduced it plays out as one would expect.<br />If the above review sounds negative, then I should clearly state that I think this is an enjoyable book to read.  Some may find it a bit slow paced, but I would say it is above average, but not enough above to give it four stars.	2004-03-25

It was Stapledon's fourth novel and was first published in 1937.  Narrated by the same voice as narrated \\"Last and First Men\\" the novel is a sequel of sorts, but at the same time it has a much larger scope and thus there is no noticeable overlap between the two novels.  As with \\"Last and First Men\\", \\"Star Maker\\" is not a conventional novel, so if that is what you are looking for, you should look elsewhere.  It is a philosophical journey rather than a conventional story with a traditional plot and characters.<br /><br />The narrator takes the reader on a journey through the universe and through time, starting on a hill near his home, and ultimately finding the creator of the universe, i.e. the Star Maker.  He witnesses the entire life of the universe, and joins with many other minds from other civilizations throughout the galaxy.  It is tempting to use phrases like \\"for its time\\" when describing this book, but it is a remarkable work for any time.  I am sure that some of descriptions of civilizations and their scientific achievements would change if it were written today.  However, the statement that the book makes would likely remain the same.<br /><br />One does not need to read \\"Last and First Men\\" (or \\"Last Men in London\\" for that matter) to read this novel.  The few remarks made in the narration that reference \\"Last and First Men\\" will not cause the reader any difficulty.  They pass by almost unnoticed, as the reader's focus is on the amazing scope and vision which are contained in this novel.  Stapledon's works are not the easiest reads, but they are well worth the effort.  The echos of Stapledon's ideas can be read in the works of numerous authors and in some of the greatest works of science fiction.<br /><br />This book was tied for 13th on the Arkham Survey in 1949 as oneof the `Basic SF Titles'.  It also was tied for 30th on the 1975 Locus All-Time poll for Novels; and 32nd on the 1998 Locus All-Time Poll for Novels written prior to 1990.  This particular edition includes a Foreword by Brian W. Aldiss, and also includes A Note on Magnitude, Time Lines, and a Glossary all created by Olaf Stapledon.  This is the 21st of the SF Masterworks paperbacks released by Victor Gollancz Books.  If this is an indication of the quality of work they have done throughout the series, then it is a very worthwhile series to own.	2004-03-20

As for this printing of \\"Who Goes There?\\", it is well put together; the binding and paper are high quality.  They could have done a better job in proofreading though, as there are several places where there are missing letters, or spaces that appear in the middle of a word.  It does not occur so often as to make it a big problem, but I found it to be noticeable.    This printing, from Buccaneer Books, is a reprint of the 1948 book of the same name.  It contains seven short fiction pieces originally published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" between November of 1934, and August of 1938.

In addition, on the 'Astounding/Analog All-Time - Book' polls in 1952 and 1956 it was rated 5th and tied for 13th respectively.      John W. Campbell (1910-1971) was undoubtedly best known as the editor of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" from 1937-1971, but he also wrote quite a few books and short fiction pieces along the way.  This collection includes perhaps his best known stories: \\"Who Goes There?\\", \\"Twilight\\", and \\"Night\\".    \\"Who Goes There?\\" is the classic story of a group of scientists in Antarctica who discover an alien who was frozen there millions of years ago.  The \\"Thing\\" revives when thawed, and due to telepathy and the ability to take other shapes it replaces members of the group as well as their animals without being easily detected by the remaining humans.  Fear and paranoia spread through the outpost as the remaining humans try to wipe out thealiens before they are able to escape out into the rest of the world.  There were two films based on this story: \\"The Thing From Another World\\" (1951), and \\"The Thing\\" (1982).  The story was first published in \\"Astounding\\" in August of 1938, and is probably Campbell's best known work.  The story was tied for 6th on the 'Locus All-Time Poll - Novella' in 1999.  It tied for 1st (with Twilight) on the 'Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll - Pre-1940 Short Fiction' in 1971, and was 26th overall for Short Fiction regardless of year.  This story works as well today as ever.      \\"Blindness\\" was first published in March of 1935.  It is the story of a scientist who wants to leave a legacy by solving man's energy problems by discovering how to produce atomic energy.  He determines that to solve the problems he has encountered in his research, he needs to examine the Sun more closely.  He works through the problems of getting a spaceship close enough to the sun for his research, and he and his assistant spend over 3 years in isolation studying the Sun before he finally finds a solution.  This story does suffer from its age, but putting aside the historical and scientific problems, the story still delivers its message.  There is more than one kind of blindness.    \\"Frictional Losses\\" was published in July of 1936.  It is the story set in a post-apocalyptic Earth, where an old man tries to keep civilization and technology alive.  Humans were nearly wiped out by an alien invasion, and there is rumored to be a second expedition of aliens coming.  Old Hugh, spends his time searching through ruined cities for old tubes, pieces of metal, whatever he can find to keep his radio transmitter working and keep communications alive between the few outposts of humanity that still have the technology.  He accidentally makes a discovery that could save the human race.  This story is a bit dated as well, but not too bad.    \\"Dead Knowledge\\" was published in January of 1938.  Three human explorersto another world find that all the inhabitants have killed themselves.  They are unable to determine the reason why, as they cannot decipher the alien culture's written language.  When one member of the crew commits suicide, the other two fear that he learned the secret of what drove the inhabitants of the planet to suicide, and that they too are all doomed to the same fate.    \\"Elimination\\" was published in June of 1936.  A patent attorney tries to explain to a close friend's son why a fantastic invention would be better forgotten.  He relates the story of the greatest invention in the history of man, which ultimately destroyed its inventors and could never be used.  The premise for this story is definitely contrived, and it doesn't work well.  However, the story related within the story is quite well done, and that makes this an enjoyable read.    \\"Twilight\\" was the first piece in this collection to appear in \\"Astounding\\", published in November of 1934.  It finished tied for 1st (with \\"Who Goes There?\\") on the 'Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll - Pre-1940 Short Fiction' in 1971, and 21st overall for Short Fiction of any era.  It is a story related third hand, about an experimenter who is sent forward 7 million years in time after an accident.  He has returned to \\"modern day\\" (1934) in an attempt to get back to his own era.  He relates to a man who gives him a ride the tail of his adventure where he witnessed the twilight of humanity.    \\"Night\\" is the sequel to \\"Twilight\\", and was published in \\"Astounding\\" in October of 1935.  It was rated 5th on the 'Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll - Pre-1940 Short Fiction' in 1971.  In this sequel, an experimenter in current times (1935), gets sent far forward to the future, he relates his adventure when he returns.  The future he witnesses is the \\"night\\" to the previous story's \\"twilight\\", after man has disappeared, and only machines remain at the death of the universe.	2004-03-14
US	53054493	R3K744UECZQFWV	0812966007	951161016	Theodore Rex	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Theodore's Presidency	Theodore Rex by Edmund Morris from Modern Library is the second in a three volume biography of the 26th President of the United States.  The first volume The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography in 1980, setting high expectations for the rest of the series.  In my opinion, this book easily meets those expectations.  This is a fantastic biography, in which Mr. Morris does an excellent job of bringing Theodore Roosevelt's presidency to life.<br />This prologue of the book starts with the death of President McKinley on September 14th, 1901, and the epilogue is March 4th, 1909, the day he hands the Presidency over to Taft.  In-between is a well researched, richly entertaining discussion of his time in the White House.  It covers not only the actions, but the decisions, the political feeling in the country at the time.  <br />Mr. Morris does an outstanding job of providing the entire scope of the events, and presents them in a way that makes the reader feel as if he is observing them at the time they are occurring.  The perspective one gets on race issues, labor vs. business, and North vs. South during that period, is excellent.  Also well discussed is the near war with Germany, and a understanding of the relationship between the U.S. and Japan that would ultimately result in war when a different Roosevelt was in office nearly 40 years later.<br />I received this book as a gift, and read it without first reading The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt.  From that perspective, I can say that this book does not require the reading of the first volume, but that I expect that doing so would enhance the experience.  I certainly intend to go back and read the first book, and look forward to reading the third as well.  Theodore Rex easily earns 5 stars.	2004-03-14
