The difference is that the other books you read are dealing with a house or an apartment and his deals are hundreds of millions of dollar deals.<br />His deal making rules are simple, yet insightful. Try this rule: Protect your Down sides and the Upsides will take care of themselves. How many people actually follow that? Most beginner Real Estate Investors go out, load up a ton of debt, and buy houses without thinking about any down sides. In this book, you'll see that Trump is actually quite a cautious and very patient guy...and he is somehow geniusly able to get his capital back in some cases that makes it into those infamous &quot;no money down&quot; deals that gurus are always so proud of pointing out. Like i had mentioned earlier...the only difference is that this is a no money down MILLION dollars deal! I think a lot of us DREAM of doing one like that, Trump shows you how he actually DID it.<br />This book may be a little out of date...but it does show the reader a glimpse of what it means and takes to dream big.	2004-04-29

What struck me most is how &quot;uncluttered&quot; his mind is and his clear passion for doing things in the most efficient way possible. Granted, the writing style at that time can be a bit tedious and long winded, but he certainly does not mince words and his style is &quot;refreshing&quot; amidst all the jargons and words you see in today's business books and magazines. He shows that how an intensely focused on increasing the buying power of the customer, combined with a relentless desire to be as efficient as possible can be enormously benefiical to society. For me, it's interesting to compare him with Michael Dell's book &quot;Direct from Dell&quot;...you'll be amazed with the striking similarities with both of their visions...only one is supplying a motor car and the latter personal computers.	2004-02-20

It argues for the importance of first knowing yourself, your habits, etc before creating your own system.<br />(2) Exit Strategies: The book attempts to explain why Exit Strategies are often more important than Entry Strategies, how other systems often focus too much on entering the market and not enough on exiting the market and why this going against the grain is important.<br />(3) Positive Expectancy: It teaches you how to create a system of keeping track of your trades so that (1) you'll know your batting average and (2) don't get discouraged like everybody else when a trade doesn't go your way.<br />(4) Create your own System: It shows you a bunch of other people's systems in the hopes that you can pick and choose the right trading tools for yourself.<br />This book is definitely not a get-rich-quick book and it's more about developing a proper trading mentality which the author sees as a key ingredient for most successful trader.

The book is organized into 51 chapters/Keys that provide short but concise explanation of important real estate investing concepts. The discussions are to the point, succinct, and very easy to grasp. The points are put forward in such a straight forward manner that it is very easy to remember. Because of its small size, I've also found it to be a highly useful reference guide.<br />A few suggestions: Once you have grasped the concepts in this book, I would highly recommend Robert Campbell's book \\"Timing the Real Estate Market\\" to get a better sense of how the real estate market works. After that, Gary Eldred's book \\"Investing in Real Estate\\" to learn about negotiation techniques, financing options, finding deals etc. Finally, Andrew Tompos's \\"Analyzing Investment Properties\\" will give you an excellent knowledge on how to evaluate a real property by working through cash flow calculations etc.	2003-06-11

For almost a century, this book has also influenced every great architects in the 20th century.<br />Having said all that, this book needs to be read with the reminder that not everything it preaches is &quot;correct&quot; and the many manifestations of modern architecture is darn right &quot;de-humanizing&quot; and &quot;souless&quot;.

It reveals his design process and the way he envisions, plans, and designs his projects.

Arguably, it is also one of the more &quot;comprehensive&quot; monogram that features Pei's architecture.<br />Although the photographs are beautiful, this book lacks depth if you are planning to study Pei's work.

The texts are fun to read as well as easy to absorb. In a short time, i feel that my reading comphrehension skill level has shot up dramatically. There are a few reasons why this book is successful:<br />(1) Unlike other language programs which gives you set conversational pieces (which quickly becomes boring and too regimental), the stories in this book built on each other. Key phrases are repeated in different chapters to reinforce learning.<br />(2) the stories are memorable and fun to read. I've also found that in a very short time i've become very familiar with how phrases/sentences should be put together - something i had not experienced with other French learning materials. This teaching method is remarkably effective.<br />(3) Because the stories are so interesting, i want to read them over and over again. I would also recommend that you should read them aloud. <br />(4) Finally, it teaches you a lot about French culture and history. You will learn about all the important periods in French history, French kings, famous French authors and their works.<br />All in all, it is a very good book to supplement your French studies. Bonne chance, mes amis!!	2001-03-23

Its contents are very clear and extrememly easy to follow and it is perfect for any beginner. However, this book will not teach you how to do any of those 'cool' stuff that one usually sees on the web. Flash is a very powerful program and this book literally addresses only the pinnacle of the iceberg. I really love the way instructions are laid out in the book, but i just feel that if the authors could use more real life complexed projects as their examples, it would really help someone to learn how to laid out a project and how to put all those great tools together to churn out a cool final product.	2001-02-12

Without those long-winded discussions (and incessant distractions) that plagued most computer learning books, this one made learning Dreamweaver extremely easy. I've basically learned it in a 2 hour sitting (i do have a little bit of Basic HTML background though). Each lesson is visually very pleasing and very VERY easy to follow. If you would like to learn Dreamweaver by yourself, you should definitely check out this book first. Good Luck!	2001-02-12

It also ends with 3 case studies which demonstrate how the theories of a media plan are actually put into action. Overall, it is a highly readable, useful, and pragmatic guide to media planning.	2001-01-06

This  book has done an excellent job in synthesizing other seminal works (Michael  E. Porter's 'Competitive Advantage', Slywotzky and Morrison's 'Value  Migration', 'Profit Zone', and 'Profit Patterns') and presenting the  materials as a coherent systematic tool for analyzing operational supply  chain problems. The case studies are well chosen and the diagrams at the  end of the book are ready made summaries/checklist. The topics are based on  a framework of Value Proposition, Scope, Profit Capture, Strategic Control,  and Execution. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to get a  practical understanding and use of the Value Chain.	2000-08-23

This book is an invaluable study on those business designs that are based  on the Value Chain model. Its premise: Changing customer priorities are  responsible for the displacements of old business models which in turn  catalyzes the need for the creation of new business designs. This book  describes the process that triggers the migration of values from a non  profitable design to a more profitable one with the help of seven patterns  (multidirectional migration, migration to a non-profit industry,  blockbuster migation, multicategory migration, from integration to  specialization, from conventional selling to low-cost distribution, and  from conventional selling to high-end solutions). Useful Case studies are  given to illustrate the problems. Overall, this is a very informative book  although this book is not as clear and direct as the author's book 'Profit  Patterns.' However, it does serve to provide a better understanding on the  value chain/migration thesis a lot better than the 'Profit Patterns'.	2000-08-15

At the time of this review, I think this is one of the best language program on mandarin. The conversations from each lesson are lively and very pertinent to what one would use in everyday's conversation. Unlike other  programs which give you basic (perhaps too basic) lines to repeat after,  the living language set has cleverly incorporated cultural habits and  humors into their conversations. Each lesson is well organized and fairly  easy to follow.<br />This set is ideal for those who already have and can  speak some basic knowledge of mandarin or who is taking mandarin lessons at  school. If you are totally new to the language you may want to consider the  Pimsleur Mandarin set instead. However, there aren't as far as I know or  find in the market at the time this is written other mandarin sets which  can deliver the same quality as this living language set.<br />However, this  doesn't mean this set is without drawbacks. The most notable drawback is  that it doesn't provide the Chinese characters for each word. It would be  nice to have the Chinese characters as well as a stroke chart to see how  each word is written. A CD set would be helpful too to make rewinding a lot  easier.<br />Otherwise, this is the best set the market could offer at the  moment.	2000-06-30

The book is written in a candid and sincere manner. The main emphasis of the investment approach is based on (1)buying and holding and  (2)focusing on industry leaders' stocks. Although these two principles are  nothing new, what is refreshing about this book is the fact that it  provides the profiles of millionaires who have succeeded using the long  term value approach. These profiles are great encouragements to those who  are beginning investors who might feel insecure about what they are doing  amidst all the 'noises' they are constantly hearing from newspaper,  television, etc. This book has done an excellent job discussing the two  principles. After the reader has finished this book, the beginning investor  might also want to check out Mary Buffet's Buffetology (a book about Warren  Buffet's method of choosing companies) and Philip Fisher's Common Stocks  and Uncommon Profits (a book that teaches you how to evaluate a company's  management team who is key to the long term success of a company.)

It lays out the criterias used by Warren Buffet in choosing the kind of companies he likes to invest in. This is not a book about complex  mathematical calculations but a sound fundamental approach in evaluating  the 'intrinsic' value of a company (i.e. whether or not the company is  successful in generating profit consistently &amp; predictably and whether  or not the company is going to be around for a long time.) For those who  wants a 'get rich quick' approach, this book is not for you. For the  beginner investor, the calculation part of the book should be very valuable  and should be studied with the financial economics of the actual companies  you are going to invest in.

What is your relationship with money emotionally? How can you live a spiritual and meaningful life by putting yourself in the pilot seat in  terms of controlling money and not the other way around? This book points  out that a lot of people simply don't really understand where they stand  emotionally when it comes to money. Their conceptions of money are often  the result of all those things they've heard and picked up over the years  from parents and others. These become our psychological burdens which often  prevent us from using or allocating money wisely. As a result, we 'suffer'  so to speak. To come to terms with this and to overcome it, the author  suggests that there are 7 key stages from which we must all go through in  order for us to build a strong and healthy relationship with money. They  are: Innocence, Pain, Knowledge, Understanding, Vigor, Vision, and Aloha.  This book is enlightening and should be invaluable to those who wants to  develop a sense of purpose and control over money.	2000-04-13

It also teaches you some common French expressions.<br />The weakness of this program is that the learning is pretty  dry. You go through about 360 words per one side (45 mins) of the 90  minutes tape, one after another. The words are divided into sections. In  the French/English section, a French word is introduced before its English  equivalent and vice versa in the English/French section. I didn't find this  format very useful. The background music is also too loud and it sometimes  make it difficult to hear what the French speaker is pronouncing. Because  it throws at you with so many words, the only way to learn them is simply  by repetition (to listen to the tapes over and over again until the words  are beginning to get stuck in your memory). However, I did start to  remember them after a while.<br />This program should supplement your other  French learning programs. The words will only become meaningful if you  learn how they are used via reading books, watching television programs,  and speaking to others.	2000-03-29

When you finished this set, you can expect the following:<br />(1) You will continue to learn a lot of basic sentence structures along with important French expressions from the audio lessons and the supplementary text  booklet.<br />(2) Your command of the language will improve subtly. I've found  that when I had finished the 30 lessons (it took me about 2-1/2 months and  on average 2 or 3 days on 1 lesson), I didn't think I know a lot more than  when I started UNTIL I went back to go through each lesson again. I was  amazed at the amount of materials I have actually picked up. It was then  that I realized how NATURAL those expressions have become to me. I could  recall about 90% of the lessons. The second time around (one day on each  lesson) allows me to work on those 10%.<br />(3) Do NOT expect to carry out a  long conversation with a French person or be able to watch French TV  programs and understand what everything they are saying. I feel that I am  now very competent in handling simple questions - albeit within the range  of questions and answers practiced in the course. The problem is that I  don't have enough VOCABULARIES to go into a `deep' conversation.  VOCABULARIES are what this program doesn't give you. Indeed, this program  excels in giving you all the BASIC FRAMEWORKS to build upon, but it's up to  you later to expand your vocabularies and learn how verbs conjugate. (To  learn more vocabularies, you may want to check out the `Vocabulearn' series  - it is not the greatest or easiest learning program but it does give you a  lot of vocabularies.)<br />I had very high expectations when I bought this  set. Perhaps because of that I was slightly disappointed when I discovered  that I still couldn't understand 30% of French television programs. But  having gone back and reviewed the 30 lessons again, I realize I've actually  learn quite a bit and the seemingly simple Pimsleur program has succeeded  in making the language become very natural to me. Enjoy the program. It  really works. Just remember that the strength of the Pimsleur program is  its emphasis on SPEAKING skills and PRONOUNCIATION at the basic to  intermediate level. You will be amazed at how much you've learned when you  go back to do the whole set again after you've completed the 30 lessons. I  am looking forward to the third set.	2000-03-28

It  teaches the potential investor how to establish connections with local  authorities and then how to gain more information via those relationships.

(If you want help on creating a strategy or  framework, check out Luigi Salvaneschi's book- &quot;Location, Location,  Location: How to select the best site for your business&quot; (Luigi's book  is more geared towards the retail industry, but its methodical approach in  getting and analyzing data for your chosen location is, I think, still  relevant.)<br />Otherwise, this is a great reference manual with a lot of  objective insights and useful information.

The pimsleur method has proven itself again. It guides you through slowly and effectively while working at your own pace. It builds a solid foundation from which you can advance to higher levels. However, compare to other pimsleur language programs i've bought (French and Japanese), this one does seem to be a little bit too slow and too repetitive. At the end of the 30 lessons, one can only speak very basic travel phrases. Considering the fact that one could spend more time on one tape before moving on to the next tape, it is very disappointing that they didn't pack more materials in the program. Taken this into consideration the price does not 100% justify the result unlike other pimsleur language programs. Also I really wish they have a second and a third box set to follow this one. 30 lessons are just not enough. (My French and Japanese Pimsleur programs have 90 lessons each!)However, like I mentioned earlier, this program teaches a lot more effectively than any other program, so if you are considering to learn the language properly, i would still recommend this set to you.	2000-02-19

This indirect strategy is predicated on his firm belief that wars/battles should be won  quickly, decisively, and with the least amount of casaulties. In this book,  he continuously demonstrates to the reader that, ironically in almost every  century, the uses of surprise and manoeuvres have largely been ignored by  most military leaders except the competent ones. This book then is  therefore not only a commentary on strategy but it is a voice intended to  remind the reader the necessity and usefulness of a strategy that could  minimize deaths and has proven itself to be most effective way of winning a  war. Hart strongly believes that we should learn from history to avoid  repeating the same mistakes over and over again. As always with Liddell  Hart's work, this book is written in a lucid manner and full of life.  Highly recommend.	2000-02-16

By focusing on the geo-political realities of Israel, this allows the authors to bring a new light in the accounts of the Old Testament. It relates an exciting story of the struggles and establishment  of Israel in the heartland of the Palestinian Land Bridge from 1000BC to  100BC - an often neglected historical period in military history. It  unravels the brilliant uses of political and military intrigues by a people  who struggled to establish and maintain a kingdom amongst conflict after  conflict. A real tour de force!	2000-01-29

Perhaps it's because of the rather unspectacular historical engagement from both armies. The book is a straightforward and  is a fairly dry account of the events leading up to the battle. The  illustrations are not as good as some other ones in the series. The lack of  photographs of the battlefields and geographical features of East India  also contributes to the poor showing of the book.	2000-01-29

This earliest recorded Battle in the human history is recounted and critiqued by the author in an exciting manner.

This introductory book is well  illustrated and provides photographs of key areas of the battlefields.  Highly recommend.	2000-01-29
