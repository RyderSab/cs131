The US, as is often the case, was an exception.<br /><br /> Harry Turtledove, in the series begining with &quot;How Few Remain&quot;, imagines a 20th century in which we were _not_ given a &quot;get out of jail, collect $200&quot; pass.<br /><br /> It's an epic accomplishment -- accompanied by splendid action, characters who are living, breathing human beings, and an ironic affection for and understanding of our flawed species.<br /><br /> Bravo!

It's an interesting and entertaining romp, with fun characters and good action.<br />If there's a problem, it's the same one I have with the whole series:  the downtime characters are too 21st-century.  And they have too much of a tendency to read a Grantville history book, or talk to a Grantviller, slap their foreheads and proclaim:  &quot;How could I have been so blind!&quot; as they abandon or modify their beliefs.  It's the same fault that L. Neil Smith's work has, although not to the same annoying degree.<br />People in the past were _different_.  By our standards, they were mostly villains and thugs, and they really _believed_ in the things that made them burn witches and heretics.	2004-03-31

This leads to absurdity; the current PETA campaign, comparing farming with the Holocaust, is one logical result -- Hitler believed Jews deserve no more consideration than pigs, and in our day People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals believe exactly the same thing.<br />Singer has reasoned himself into the same position of moral imbecility, in which it's unethical to kill pigs but perfectly all right to kill newborn human infants, or the senile.<br />The problem with Utilitarianism is, of course, that suffering of itself is merely a physical phenomenon.  There's no inherent reason for it to have any _moral_ importance.  The assumption that pain is \\"Bad\\", in the moral sense, as opposed to simply being unpleasant for those animals or humans who feel it, is purely arbitrary and has no logical basis.  Only those who've been taken in by the foggy-minded confusion of empathy with ethics will be fooled.<br />Human suffering has (some) moral significance, in some circumstances.  Not because it is suffering, but because it is human, and only humans are moral agents.  Animal suffering has no more moral significance than a rise or fall in the air temperature.<br />Does this make me a speciesist?  Of course.  I'm also a wettist -- I believe water is wet.	2003-03-01

The scenes are often very good, but they're isolated.<br />Second, while nobody can actually say how an alternate history would turn out, and while granting the turbo-Black-Death McGuffin, the plausibility factor is low.<br />The Scientific and Industrial revolutions were extremely low-probability accidents; they've each happened exactly once in human history -- with a near-miss among the ancient Greeks.<br />This is, as the saying goes, \\"no accident\\".  They required a whole confluence of extremely unlikely historical accidents, in areas ranging from theology (the victory of Aquinina theology) to politics (the lack of a unifying Imperial state in Europe)and on to economics -- the triumph of early capitalism in Western culture.<br />Absent the West, it's extremely unlikely that \\"science\\" would have ever advanced beyond the quasi-Aristotelian level reached by medieval Islam.  And while some technologies would still have spread -- gunpowder, paper, the compas -- it's also vanishingly unlikely that anything like an Industrial Revolution would have occurred between the 14th century and now.<br />In other words, the ox-drawn plow would still be civilized humanity's most characteristic technology, half of all infants would die before age 5, and they'd still be cutting out hearts down Mexico way.	2002-06-08

But they don't make it just as they please.&quot;  Feminism arose not because someone wrote a book out of the blue, but because it expressed the working-out of tendencies inherent in our culture.<br />The &quot;non-working&quot; wife was a temporary little historical blip; a Victorian status symbol for the wealthy of the middle classes, based on a complete misunderstanding of the role of the aristocratic women they took as a reference group.<br />Most women, throughout history, have worked for a living -- hard physical toil, with childcare cut to a minimum and stuffed into bits and pieces of time here and there.<br />We're now returning to the norm, except that women now also get a chance at the minority of really _good_ jobs.  &quot;Motherhood&quot; and keeping house is not one of those.<br />Let's face facts:  99% of &quot;motherhood&quot; is a boring, mind-killing crap-job.  It's slave work; every class in human history who could afford to do so has pushed it off on subordinates, just like we do with our Mexican and Asian nannies.<br />Ditto housework.

It isn't going to change, except to get more so.  Western civilization has always been individualistic and market-driven, and it the market and individualism continually colonize new territory.

It shows how various systems succeed or fail at tasks such as flexibility, manouver, combat cohesion and morale, and why the German army was generally qualitatively superior to both Western and Eastern rivals in both world wars.<br />That being said, the authors tend to overemphasize the capabilities of infantry on its own -- particularly unsupported light infantry, and particularly in the theoretical section which concludes the book.<br />While rightly critical of the excessive logistical tail some modern &quot;armies of drivers&quot; drag around, they lose sight of the fact that foot infantry by itself totally lacks operational mobility -- 20 miles a day vs. over 200 for forces with their own organic transport.  And they neglect the degree to which infantry alone lacks even tactical mobility on a battlefield saturated with automatic weapons.<br />It's no accident that the armies which actually do a lot of fighting -- the Israelis, for instance -- structure combined-arms teams around honking great monster tanks like the Merkava III or the M1A2 Abrahms, 70 tons or so of massively protected lethality.<br />Mobility means the ability to move, but tactical mobility means the ability to move _under fire_.<br />This poses a genuine strategic dilemma; forces light enough to move rapidly _strategically_ are often too heavy to be mobile in the tactical and operational sense -- you can fly light infantry quickly to the other side of the world, but they can't move when they're actually fighting.<br />Still, an excellent book on the whole.	2001-04-07

This book suffers from that fault, despite good writing and a nice plot.<br />Apparently the &quot;Cuban War&quot; of 1962 results in the US getting hit by something on the order of 10-12 Soviet nukes.  This is reasonable, if slightly pessimistic.  (My own guess would be something on the order of 6 or 7.)  The Soviets simply didn't have many delivery systems which could reach North America.<br />Two things aren't reasonable:<br />First, after losing 3 or 4 cities and a few military bases, the US is shown as still devastated ten years later, with widespread areas dangerously radioactive and the economy only just recovering from a near-total collapse.<br />Not!<br />My father stood in a slit trench 1.8 miles from ground zero during a bomb test in the late 1950's, and he's fine at age 83.  Yeah, if you're under the immediate fallout plume from a multimegatonne ground-burst, it's game over.  But two weeks later, the same territory is pretty safe; a year later, virtually completely so.  Most active isotopes have very short half-lives.  There are exceptions (strontium-90, some metal isotopes), but there were scores of above-ground tests, and the increase in the cancer rate nationwide was undetectable without fairly sophisticated statistical analysis.<br />Hiroshima and Nagasaki were reoccupied immediately after the explosions.  Generally speaking, ten years after a bomb goes off you can go to ground zero, strip naked, rub the dirt all over your body and eat it with a spoon, and all you'll get is a dirty skin and indigestion.<br />Hence the US, with a largely undamaged infrastructure, would recover quickly.  Germany and Japan did, from far worse damage -- they don't call 1945 &quot;The Year Zero&quot; in Germany for nothing, and the damage in Japan was worse.  The firestorms in Tokyo and Dresden killed about as many people as nuclear attacks, and did as much physical damage.<br />Second, the USSR did have a very dangerous launch capacity in 1962... only it was aimed at Central and Western Europe, and the book shows those areas getting off scot-free.<br />Not going to happen.  Not even remotely possible.  The missiles and bombers were set to go and would have launched immediately against European targets when SAC went into action against the USSR.  Western Europe was chock-full of USAAF bases, just to start with; and the Soviets planned for a city-busting strategy, as well.<br />They certainly weren't going to let the _Germans_ come through intact, for Christ's sake!<br />As the joke went in the 1950's and early 1960's, the Soviet Union's deterrance capacity could be summed up as:  &quot;If you Americans attack Holy Mother Russia, we will nuke the hell out of Germany, France and Britain!  Just see if we don't!&quot;<br />Britain, for instance, would have lost at least a dozen major cities -- and given the dense population and restricted area, would have been an absolute charnel house.<br />The actual result of a nuclear war in 1962 would be:<br />Moderate damage to the US.  Moderate if you didn't happen to be in NYC or Washington, that is.<br />Total devastation of the USSR.<br />Very severe damage in Europe.nuclear attacks, and did as much physical damage.<br />Second, the USSR did have a very dangerous launch capacity in 1962... only it was aimed at Central and Western Europe, and the book shows those areas getting off scot-free.<br />Not going to happen.

And most certainly not in California! Like most agrarian writers, he's not really in the business himself.  Thomas Jefferson, one should note, lauded the independent family-farming  yeoman from the mansion of a plantation worked by hundreds of slaves.<br />And  _he_ went broke!<br />Since the beginning of European settlement (and before,  because the Noble Savage is a myth) American farmers have been mobile,  land-mining, profit-maximizing nomads.  They've all had a 'walking price'  they would take to walk off their farms, and they cut and slashed and  burned and eroded their way from the Atlantic to the Pacific in search of  better deals.  Land speculation was the primary national industry for  generations.<br />California -- acquired through naked theft and robbery,  accompanied by blatant genocide -- was developed largely by the  &quot;agribusiness&quot; of its day, generously helped out by public  subsidy.  Anyone who's read Frank Norris and heard of the Union Pacific and  the &quot;Wheat Ranches&quot; should know this.<br />Where does he think those  irrigation canals came from?  Horny-handed sons of toil?<br />Next, Mr. Hanson  apparently thinks a fruit-farm is where our food is produced.  Wrong:  it's  where our luxuries are produced.<br />We get our food from farms like the  ones my relatives run in the northern prairies -- 16,000 acres, millions of  dollars in equipment, and occasional holidays in St. Barts.<br />If Mr. Hanson  wants to run a small farm, he should study some economics.  My jaw dropped  as I read that he was trying to grow _Thompson Seedless grapes_ on a  postage-stamp holding.  Those grapes are a mass-production staple; of  course he and anyone else who tries to compete with the big boys will go  broke!<br />Rising producivity hitting a relatively static market will put  him inexorably in the scissors of a profit squeeze and eat his capital  dollar by dollar, no matter how hard or well he works.  He can write --  can't he add, multiply, subtract and divide?  &quot;Get big or get  out&quot; is the only advice applicable.<br />Growing staple crops on a small  farm is like trying to compete with mass-produced cars from a backyard  artisan's shop.<br />Producing premium wine grapes for a boutique winery, or  specialized organic vegetables and cheeses under contract to high-priced  restaurants -- those could be viable with a relatively small acreage.<br />But Thompson Seedless grapes?

When this book arrived, I took the entire day off and read it.  There's only one problem -- I want the other two, and I want them _now_.<br />Turtledove avoids the convention; alien invaders land in 1942, and  they... neither win nor lose!  Instead of a melodrama, we have the messy  tragedy that's most of human (and here, inhuman) history -- a draw.<br />Now  the Colonization Fleet has landed, and everyone's in more trouble than they  can twitch their tailstumps at.  Old friends return, and intriguing new  characters make their appearances; and at the end, we're left wondering  just what the hell the _Lewis and Clarke_ IS.<br />More!  More!  Everyone, go  out and buy!	1999-02-10

It's got Arthur, Enkidu, Yetis on the Internet,  Davy Jones' Locker, a family-conscious were-coyote in New Mexico who  doubles as a raven, and much else.  Plus great characterization, lovely  backgrounds -- I live in New Mexico myself, and I can tell how accurate she  is about our beautiful light-filled landscape -- and dynamite action.  Not  to mention a wry and puckish sense of humor!<br />Buy this book.	1999-01-21

Urban fantasy is hard to do well, but when well done it's dynamite -- it combines the fantastic and the everyday in a way that sharpens the appeal of both.<br />Lindskold does it; throw in a dynamite plot, intriguing  characters, and an excellent, supple prose style, and you've got quite a  book!	1999-01-11

Mallory's &quot;In Search of the Indo-Europeans&quot; is the best  one-volume survey of the origins and dispersal of the Indo-European  languages.<br />The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; is more technical, but gives a  highly detailed view of the interrelationships of the IE languages and what  we can deduce concerning the speakers of the original ur-sprach.<br />NB: in  view of the review above, and out of consideration to uniformed readers,  one should point out that Indo-European linguistics is a well-established  field throughout the world scholarly community.	1998-10-20

It has  intrigue, suspense, and a pair of sympathetic antagonists -- the Videssian  Avtokrator and the great Makuraner general Abivard.  Both of them are human  beings, complete with crotchets, faults, virtues, and a three-dimensional  life away from the battlefield and council-chamber.<br />The action scenes are  as vivid and gripping as Turtledove's high standards lead us to expect, and  the final resolution is both satisfying -- full closue -- and realistic.  Life goes on after the end of the book...	1998-10-12
US	52880648	RNBHDKZY23I2O	0312866992	992395733	Justinian	Books	5	1	1	N	N	History comes alive!	This book covers the live of Justinian II, the last of his dynasty -- and  given his obsession with revenge, not surprisingly!  Turtletaub has made a  blood-mad Byzantine emperor live as a human being, brilliantly showing how  the isolation of the throne and absolute power, combined with great ability  and a driving will, bring about Justinian's decline into solipsistic  madness.<br />A rousing good read, with battle, treachery, intrigue, and  exotic settings vividly and accurately described.  &quot;Justinian&quot; is  worthy of comparison with Grave's &quot;Count Belisarius&quot;!	1998-08-13
US	52880648	R2QENZWYGYTMKA	034540615X	412492536	American Front (The Great War, Book 1)	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Turtledove knows history... and people.	I've long been an admirer of Harry Turtledove's work, and GREAT WAR: AMERICAN FRONT does not disappoint.  It combines a fascinating what-if -- a divided America drawn into the European alliance system, and hence Europeanized -- with an epic scope suitable to the Great War, the war which launched the modern era.  Yet it also keeps us focused on the _human_ aspect of the titanic struggle, and we see the war, its horrors and the social change it unleashes from the viewpoints of very real, very human characters.<br />Besides that, it's a ripping good read!  Go ye forth and buy it.	1998-06-25
US	52880648	RCRO3X7JAR9SC	0312862024	737885864	Between the Rivers	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Turtledove does it again!	Harry Turtledove's work has certain characteristic strengths -- solid characterization, realistic motivations, good description, and fast-paced action.  BETWEEN THE RIVERS adds a witty, intriguing look at the Bronze Age... in a world much like ancient Sumeria, but one where the gods are very real.  Turtledove's extrapolations from this idea are solid, down-to-earth and a mixture of the hilarious and the horrific.  For as one character says, to be a god you don't have to be very smart -- just very _strong_.  His hero's adventures in a world where humans are still -- literally -- as insects beneath the feet of a very solidly realized pantheon are a treat for any reader of SF, fantasy or historical fiction.  Highly recommended!	1998-03-08
US	52880648	R22XSMBI8TRJ39	0345416619	426738597	How Few Remain	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Turtledove is among the very best.	Harry Turtledove is in a perilous position -- with books such as GUNS OF THE SOUTH and WORLDWAR:  IN THE BALANCE he has high expectations to meet.<br />With HOW FEW REMAIN, he meets them -- and betters them.  Every year hundreds of books appear using the Civil War and its aftermath as their launch point.  Turtledove takes us on a journey both startlingly original and  yet chillingly plausible.  The British and French had decided to intervene on the Confederate side in 1862, and only McClellan's unlikely victory at Antietam stopped them.  Those three cigars and Lee's Order 191...<br /><br />Yet my greatest pleasure in HOW FEW REMAIN was not the masterly historical extrapolation, but the characters themselves.  Nothing in fiction is more difficult than catching the authentic voice of a great speaker or writer, yet Turtledove succeeds triumphantly with two; Sam Clemens, in this timeline a newspaper editor who never left San Francisco, and Abraham Lincoln -- aged, weary, burdened by the sorrow of a lost war, yet still fighting for freedom with all his wisdom, iron will, shrewdness, and cool political calculation.<br /><br />Bravo!  I look forward with impatience to the sequels, which deal with that other great turning point of Western civilization, the Great War of 1914-1918.  As Woodrow Wilson of the CSA and Teddy Rooseveldt of the USA declare war in 1914, the world will hold its breath!	1997-10-06
