What should a sista do when her husband's job is making music with local teens in a haze or weed smoke...or when her baby's father is a minister in the church and swears her to secrecy...or when she thinks she has the perfect marriage (and can share her wisdom with others) only to discover that her husband has a baby from one of the women you're trying to mentor?<br /><br />Well, a sista could do a lot of things, but in Tiffany Warren's engaging debut debut, what Pam, Yvonne and Taylor should do is pray. Though the three main characters that the story shifts between live very different lives, all of them are coming to learn something new about God and about themselves.<br /><br />Pam, a mother and employee in corporate America, starts the novel sitting in her car because she doesn't want to lose her peace amid the chaos behind her front door. Having long since laid down her own dreams to let her husband Troy explore his dream of becoming a record producer, Pam is too stressed to blessed more often than not. On top of everything, Troy accuses her of putting church before him. Will her husband ever understand what it means to turn his life over to Christ or will they always be at odds?<br /><br />Taylor is holding things together the best she can. Between the scornful looks of people at church and the probing questions of her two-year-old son about the father he's never met, she's having a hard time making it through. God has forgiven her for having an affair, but the pressure of raising a child alone and keeping silent about the father's identity are proving too much, especially with all the gossipy church women who seem to want to tell her what to do. What would they do if they really knew the truth?<br /><br />Yvonne knows how to get a man...and how to keep him. If more women in the church would be like her--stay home, cook, clean, not let themselves go--there would be less divorce and mayhem in God's house. Though her husband needs some time away here and there, it doesn't mean a thing. She knows her man and her God. Now if only she could teach some of these young hotties in the congregation how to get a man and settle down, things would be a lot better. For some of them though, it's already too late. They've snuck around and got a baby from some man in the church. What a shame. What kind of man would sit in church every Sunday with his own child without standing up to his responsibilities? Too bad that everyone can't have a man of God.<br /><br />When these three women come together and share their hearts and hurts, lives change and laughter flows. If you're looking for a story that gets real about some of the struggles of women in the church without leaving Christ out of the equation, this one is for you. Be careful though, don't start this one too late at night. You won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />Four and a half stars.there, it doesn't mean a thing. She knows her man and her God.

Lois Lowry amazes me with her ability to tell a compelling story and ask deep questions about art, life and relationships at the same time. Readers who have read GATHERING BLUE will quickly recognize Matty, the once rowdy, dirty boy who traveled the forest with his little dog.<br /><br />Now a citizen of The Village, Matty has learned to read and write, keep clean and is even learning not to lie (though he's still not sure about the practicality of that rule). He lives with Seer, the blind man who sees more than many people with 20/20 vision. Leader, who readers will recognize from THE GIVER, has the ability to actually \\"see beyond\\" the forest that warns so many not to enter its woods.<br /><br />Matty, however, has never had a problem with Forest and continues upon its paths happily until an encounter with a frog changes everything he knows about himself. Will his name be Messenger or something more? Does he too have a gift like his friend Threader, his friend Kira who he left behind?<br /><br />When the loving people in the village begin to trade away the deepest beliefs and even their health for physical beauty and gaming machines, Matty has little time to learn about his gift or consider his future name. For now he is simply Needed--if the Seer's daughter Kira is to make it to the village before Forest becomes inpenetrable.<br /><br />In another beautiful installment, Lois Lowry contrasts yet again the frailties and strengths of the human spirit. Though I've heard this is the last in the series, I sincerely hope not. To know what happens with Kira and Jonah would definitely be worth wait for another story.<br /><br />Ms. Lowry's knowledge of nature again enriches this short but layered story. I have to admit, the narrative didn't capture in the same way as the first two books, but the thoughts about community that the book provoked made me give it an extra star.	2005-06-27

I wasn't sure what how much I'd enjoy a book by a menswear designer, but I have to say that this book was a joy. From his humble beginnings in a Middle Eastern Boston neighborhood, Joseph Abboud moved from a kid with a face pressed to the window of a men's shop to one of the top designers in the world. I will definitely never look at a tie in the same way or a men's suit. The insight into the polo shirt craze of the 80's was endearing also, as I remember everyone in my high school sporting one in every color available.<br /><br />Probably the most curious thing to me after reading this book is why I've never heard of Joseph Abboud until now. Some of the people he's dressed have definitely caught my attention. We live in a more casual time, but reading this book has definitely made me think about how people perceive appearance, even in this dot-com-shorts-and-sandals world. There's still nothing like a good man in a good suit. That's what made me fall for my husband. Check this one out. There's more than clothes here.	2005-06-08

Whether it's a funny chapter book or one of her futuristic fantasies, my children and I can always count on her for a great read. I got more than that here. A good story and rich characters are something I treasure whenever I can find them, but when there is something underneath, a sea of glass refracting all that I bring to the book, well that it truly special.<br /><br />Kira, the narrator of this tale, buries her mother in the field and leaves her for the beasts, hoping that she won't meet the same fate. Though skilled with her hands, Kira's feet make no such quick moves. Her twisted foot, now dragging at her side, should have been cause for her death at birth, but her mother saw her strength (Kira gripped her thumb tight) and begged to keep her child. Though the seamstress won out, many residents of the village, all survivors of the great wars and ruin, long to rid of Kira to take her land. Returning from her mother's grave, Kira is met with the smoke of ritual burning, something done to any house where sickness has been, although in this case no one was sick but Kira's mother and there was no fear of illness spreading.<br /><br />Once home, the women stand read to stone Kira and build a pen to fence in the children and livestock (they value both about the same). Only when Kira stands them down in an incredible bluff, reminding them what could happen if she is killed without the matter being taken before the guardians, do the women and their leader, a scarred woman said to have lived a fight with one of the beasts that terrorize the village, put their rocks down.<br /><br />Kira goes before the Council, listening to the accusations against her existence. It is only the scrap of beautiful fabric in her pocket, a piece that came to Kira's hands at her mother's bedside that keeps Kira calm when a pair of kind eyes meet hers from across the Council table. Jamison, the elder who looks at her so kindly, is her choice for advocate against her accusers. She chooses well, as the man pokes holes in every charge and at the end of the hearing saves her life, but not her land. Thankful to be alive, Kira tries to make a plan of what to do, where to go. Instead she is told to return to the stained glass building where the Coucil meets. Her new home.<br /><br />In this building where water comes out in a little room (Is it for cooking?) Kira learns that she is to be the new threader of the The Singer's robe. Her mother did the annual repairs to the uniform of the old man who told the story of civilization in song each year, but now it will be Kira's job, including dying the cloth, something her mother had only begun to teach her. In addition, she will have to fill the bare spaces on the shoulders, stitching the future of the village, a future that the elder will dictate to her--and to everyone around them.<br /><br />When she finds a young orphan carver down the hall who spends his days toiling over The Singer's staff (etched with prompts for the his long song) and an orphaned girl with a beautiful voice on the floor below her, Kira begins to realize that the kindness of Jamison and the elders may not be as wonderful as she once thought. As each of the captives share, the truth becomes evident--the are artists and those who cannot create have taken them captive, perhaps killing their parents to do so.<br /><br />The most provocative party of the story for me was the dying of the cloth and Kira's learning the plants to do so. A woman with a four syllable name and much wisdom is Kira's teacher. (The length of one's name correlates with the length of life in this community). When Kira arrives exhausted after being chased by beasts one morning, the woman makes a startling proclamation,\\"There be no beasts.\\" Confused, Kira shares this with someone and the old woman disappears along with all her knowledge. How will Kira every learn how to make blue, the one color that cannotbe found in the village? Where are \\"the others\\" the old woman talked about who have it?<br /><br />With the help of friends and a twist reminiscient of the movie THE VILLAGE (though this was probably written first) Kira finds blue along with the truth about her past. Though many preferred THE GIVER's technologically advanced setting, something about the crude humanity of GATHERING BLUE rang even more true. My daughter and I love this book.that cannot be found in the village?

But when Jerome's mother flees her loveless marriage (the work ate his father's heart and his hope) to the big city among many blacks of The Great Migration, everything changes. Jerome is favored because he excels at his studies and Isaiah slips away into a world of afros and tight synthetic shirts, becoming everything his \\"Little Professor\\" big brother isn't.<br /><br />Washington makes it to Harvard with heart and mind ready to change the world as his mother hopes he will. The Kent State incident and a broken heart from a fellow revolutionary send Washington into another direction--the study of the classics. Here he is alone, safe and undisturbed. After an ineffective (in his mind)stint in the Boston Public schools and more family tragedy, he lands at Chelsea, a secluded--and exclusive--school for boys in Connecticut. While the world changes and many \\"other negroes\\" come and go from the campus with their angry, insistent ways, Washington stays on in quiet excellence, shaping the minds of tomorrow's presidents, changing the world the only way he knows how, by making the best of the chance he's been given, though he chafes at the role of \\"minority recruiter\\" and other school political demands, why should the color of his skin play any role in his job?<br /><br />Rashid Bryson is alive. His older brother, who went off to a private prep school on scholarship the year before, only to be gunned down while going for a coke at the corner store, is not. Tired of watching his parents drown their grief in too much food and too few words, Rashid decides to make his own escape, to Chelsea, a school whose brochure he found in his brother Kofi's things. There is no help from his parents like what his brother received. Only numb nods of agreement and empty goodbyes when he's accepted. When he sees the wide open campus, with cows, barns and a sea of creamy-skinned white faces, he wonders if he hasn't traded one loneliness for another. At least there is that black Latin teacher, right? Wrong. After joining Mr. Washington's class and learning more about his roommate, the son of a black lawyer, Rashid is sure he's the odd man out. Only Jana Hansen, his English teache seems to have a clue.<br /><br />Jana Hansen has never seen so much chalk in a classroom. And she didn't even have to bring it herself. Before Chelsea, she spent twenty years in the Cleveland public schools, often the only white face in a s sea of brown and gold faces. There was never enough there. Not enough time, enough money, even love...even for one of the students she'd held out the most hope for, she hadn't been able to save him. Or her marriage. With her only daughter living as a LUG (lesbian until graduation) at her alma mater, nothing seems left but to return to a private school in her native state and teach in classrooms with plush carpet, prepared students and plenty of chalk. Two things, however, never figured into her plan--Jerome Washington and Rashid Bryson. Both will change her forever.<br /><br />They certainly changed me. Though I expected to relate most to the dreadlocked and defiant Rashid, I found pieces of myself in the Jerome Washington, the intelligent negro determined to prove that race doesn't matter, even if it means denying the very core of his existence to do so; and Jana Bryant, an open-hearted impulsive woman learning how to live again after betrayal, learning to find her place in a world that doesn't always make sense. Jana sees both sides of the world--the side lined with skin like hers and the side that some people either assimilate or ignore. The side that makes her see a man and not a black man when she looks at Jerome Washington's graceful fingers, the side that makes her hurt when school diversity is about getting donor funds more than making a difference.<br /><br />This novel is dense, but not long. Quiet but powerful. For a look at race from several sides and both the damage and healing words can bring, check this one out. There is quite a bit of profanity in places, but this is a young adult title too.etting donor funds more than making a difference.    This novel is dense, but not long. Quiet but powerful.

What I learned was that there were many different types of women and what marked all of them was godliness, strength and kindness. Still, I struggled with the balance between modesty and just looking frumpy as what appealed to me in clothing sometimes seemed extreme to others. So for a few years, I rested in a tomb of taupe and gray, trying very hard to be quiet and good.<br /><br />Then I read DAUGHTERS OF THE KING.<br /><br />On each page almost, I had to pause and cry as God affirmed that although He had work to do in me, He'd made me the way I am for a reason. It takes all types of women to do the will of God. Unfortunately, sometimes we persecute each other because we are not secure in our own identity. This book does speak about fashion, but that's not all it's about. It's about discovering who you are...and remembering whose you are.	2005-05-08

While reading, I felt my own grandmother's hand at the small of my back, the Eva in my family story, marrying a very light man from a not-so-accepting family. My blurry memories of her \\"colorstruck-ness\\" focused into fine view. I can imagine how she, a widow with five girls, saw each match as a blessing or curse for future generations--lips too full and skin too black. I wept many, many times for the women of Cane River, both in their sorrows and joys. In this busy world that we live in, it is easy to forget how hard our ancestors fought just for a chance to love, to have a family, something now so easily thrown away. I walk away from Cane River, Louisiana slowly, peering over my shoulder at Emily standing behind, hearing the rushing waters of Clement and Philomene, the pain of Joseph Billes. Something of them will always be with me.	2005-04-02

Orange personalities and mustard silk sentences, phrases that slip over you like a favorite spread. I tried to write down the quotes, but there quickly became too many to count.<br /><br />And there was soon too much story to bother with such things, too much humor and heartbreak. Too much truth, sheathed in just enough grace to cover the hard parts until I could take them.<br /><br />Others have told of the top layer of TIGER LILLIE, a spicy mash  sprinkled with the love inherited by the daughter of a blind Episcopalian and the need exploited in her younger sister. It's a tale of sufficient grace, of facing the skeletons, sometimes even the one under our flesh. Between the flamboyant flowers, wonderful gowns and delicious food of the employees of an extreme wedding planning company, rest courageous, kind souls whose collective, quiet love is always on time.<br /><br />Beneath the story rests a mirror, a glassy sea, allowing the light of Christ to refract between the pages. It is this light that brings me here, breathless, minutes after turning the last page. It is this light that brings me back to Mrs. Samson's books again and again. It is this light that draws me closer, for a better glimpse of Jesus.	2005-01-28

Armed with elephants, walruses and barumpusses, this colorful family moved into the backyard in a giant bed while the animals had their way inside. They painted the house in red zebra stripes and when Mr. Pinch made his threats, they only stared wondering what he'd said and why he was so loud.

This tale of many mothers--Lia, Becky, Kelly and Ayinde--hit every angle of that weird tangle that is new motherhood.<br /><br />Lia, an actress whose baby died in the care of a neighbor, flees her Hollywood home for her real home, the house of her mother, a fifth-grade teacher who never approved of her daughter when she lived there as Lisa Ulrick and doesn't seem to approve of her now. As Lia moves through her days with two-toned bangs and half a heart, a chubby pregnant woman reappears in the park. Lia's past disappears into the lady's diaper bag, a silver spoon here, a Tiffany rattle there. Little does she know that the full-figured chef will later return the favor with the gift of friendship.<br /><br />Ayinde, a bi-racial sportscaster who married Richard Towne a 76er with long pockets and a sad childhood against the advice of Lolo Mbezi, her magnificent and sometimes too much to take mother. When in her first prenatal yoga class Ayinde goes into labor it's Becky and Kelly who come to her aid. Her husband returns home as soon as the game is over smelling of . . . perfume? Surely not. As scheduled feedings and hopes of being the perfect mother cut between them, Richard retreats to the guestroom, in more ways then one. Though Ayinde never thought she could get through this year, a baby makes all the difference, especially when little Julian has a health scare on top of her rocky marriage. In the end, she'll only get through it with help from her friends.<br /><br />Kelly is an uptight event planner who should have been a PR person. She's the queen of spin. Her mail carrier father works for the government and her laid off husband is on paternity leave. If only she could make up something for herself to be besides tired and angry. Doesn't Steve realize that she grew up poor? Why does he keep sitting on the couch watching As the World Turns while she's killing herself so they won't have to dip into their savings? When a reporter comes to interview her as a mother who has it all and finds out how little that really is, Kelly loses it--and loses Steve. In the end, she discovers there are a lot worse things than not being perfect and cuts both herself and her husband some much needed slack.<br /><br />Becky, a volumptuous chef and co-owner of Mas, a scrumptious restaurant is married to a surgeon with a big heart and a needy mother. Mimi cries more than the baby and gets what she wants just as quickly. Between stuffing muffins in the newborn's mouth and trying to dress the baby in ripped jeans and shirts with phrases to \\"make the boys want her\\", Mimi is driving Becky totally crazy, especially during the 26 days that she comes to stay with them and kicks them out of their bed. Becky cracks like you know she will and gets Mimi told but eventually has a change of heart that even surprises her along with a few other surprises. Through it all, she nurses a friendship with Lia and the other girls and holds hands with them all through life's Little Earthquakes.<br /><br />This one is not to be missed.nto their savings?

After months of her prodding, Virgie's parents agree that she too is free and that even little girls needed to learn. Her big brother CC looks out for her on the trip (she falls in the river but doesn't cry) and enjoys her wonder upon seeing the school and the wonderful, beautiful bookcase full of books. \\"I'm going to read them all,\\" she says touching them lightly.

This is far from what people would consider a Christian novel, there is cursing, violence and sorts of goings on. Yet there's more scripture in it than a few Christian novels I read lately and more truth too. Bailey's Cafe isn't defined by just one character, but rather it's world, a way station on the edge of any city anywhere, the place before there's no more places. Each day only one thing is offered, chicken one day, corn beef hash the next. There are no menus. Each customer decides whether to stay or go. Bailey is careful not to cook too carefully or people might actually think they're coming for food. They're not.<br /><br />These folks, churchy Miss Cassie who comes to doom everyone to hell, Sugar Man the short pimp, Sadie [...] who carries herself with such class the glass mugs turn to china in her hands . . . And we aren't even going to start on the maid, Miss Maple, a straight man who finds comfort in summer dresses.<br /><br />These are the folks of Bailey's Cafe. And that's just the beginning of it. Across the street there is a Jewish pawn shop that never opens except to tell people to go elsewhere and a blossoming home for women called Eve's, which one can only find if you know what to ask. \\"No woman finds this place until she's ready for it,\\" Eve says. And she's right. God didn't let me read this book until I was ready. And thankfully, I will never recover. Use your discretion on this one. It ain't for the faint of heart.	2004-11-16

Only sort of. The time traveling disorder, the chromosomes, circadian rhythms and circular plot, that is difficult to explain, but then there are the people--Harry, Clare, Gomez, Charisse, Ingrid, Celia and even Harry's other selves from other times that come along for the ride.<br /><br />Harry DeTramble aka Library Boy is the non-musical son of a violinist and a dead opera singer. He works in a library, but it's a while before we see him there. We meet him most often in Clare's meadow, naked and thrashing having just arrived from many years ahead. As their love winds through the past, present and future, the reader is catapulted through many of the painful realities of life as well as some of our own worst fears. Yet their love proves stronger than time itself. This one is not to be missed.	2004-11-16

(Except for the making out with her boyfriend Mitch Pingborn, a future history professor who she's battled for the best class ranking since sixth grade. He got into Harvard on early decision). In the background of her life of ironing her father's pants, checking her brother's ashmatic snores for peak flow and maintaining her size 4 figure by running cross-country in the freezing winter, there is Teri Litch, the bully girl who peed her pants in fifth grade and sat in it and is strong enough to beat up most of the football team, though it doesn't stop them from teasing her.<br /><br />Just as Kate's life falls apart, Teri's life crashes into Kate's in a tragic and unexpected way, exploding with secrets and a kind of pain unknown to a middle class minister's daughter. Or is it? In Kate's quest to balance the equation of her existence, she discovers that the catalyst for who she will become might be closer to home than she thinks.	2004-11-03

She's someone you could put on your houseshoes with and eat food with your hands. Her life has been hard, jagged even. Yet Charmaine still manages to love, despite being abandoned by her pretty waitress mother at age eleven or a string of other tragedies that follow every time she tries to care, to stay. Her love is preserved in part by a special gift, tied up with a bow and placed in her throat by God himself, the voice of a songbird.<br /><br />Lisa Samson never ceases to amaze me with the quiet strength her characters possess as they erase the lines between secular and sacred bringing the reader to a better understanding of humanity as a whole. So many times in this book, I saw something of myself or people I know. No wonder this won a Christy Award. It's magical.	2004-11-03

Though there are many teenage stories lining bookstore and library shelves, this one is different, both in plot and in language. Inclan's metaphors open up the lives of sisters, daughters, neighbors, friends, husbands and wives. The story that unfolds is tragic but all too true, with blame to be had by someone or everyone, but you're not often sure for on every page there is a feeling you've had, a thought you've thought or a hurt you can identify with, even if you can't condone it.<br /><br />And there there is the biggest character in this book, the one who never says a line of dialogue or appears on the stage in real time. Deidrde, the mother, lover, gardener who took life and transplanted it wherever she went until cancer ravaged her once and then again, finally pulling her away from her workaholic husband and her two young daughters, one, the youngest, is taught to be strong and be a helper, another just hurts, watching as Deidre slips away. There are others who love her too, who stick their toes in her dirt, delight in her laugh. But when she's gone, the world seems all too silent and her house and her family fall apart, unraveling little by little until only one yank will destroy them.<br /><br />Sleeping in the closet in a onsie from Goodwill is that yank, a baby with her mother's eyes.	2004-10-25

What struck me most though was that grownups have some of the same cliques. Do we really grow up or not? Sometimes I wonder. Anyway, every girl-boy-man-woman should read this and be reminded of what one moment can do to a life and how another moment can redeem the same life. Bravo.	2004-10-05

Dealing with her own secrets and determined to succeed with her business, Mona's fierce independence and great need suck Joe right in to what quickly turns into a mystery with him as the first suspect. Watching Mona and Joe drop the walls of their hearts and learn to trust and forgive--and fall in love--is as scrumptious as one of Mona's strawberry muffins. Treat yourself.	2004-05-22

When the tablet appears years later and Emilie is the one chosen to translate it, it seems everyone wants a piece of the tablet--and Emilie. With more twists and turns than most country roads, this seeker sensitive novel probes the thinker's path to faith through the eyes of a kind hippie-turned-Christian named Margaret who gives out kindness and truth in equally generous doses. From ancient Babylon to present day Israel, this book is a thrill from cover to cover. I look forward to reading her backlist and future titles.	2004-05-18

The tale of the Baxter family and it's patriach Dr. John Baxter and his wife Elizabeth stirred my heart with the tender honesty I crave in fiction. Everyone didn't pray the sinner's prayer or make all the right choices, but this book filled me with hope and faith. We are all so weak and fallable and in need of the great grace Christ offers.<br />From the fragile memories of the Alzhemier's patients at Sunset Hills to the each of the Baxter children's journey to recapture the love and faith they'd left, lost or never discovered, REMEMBER is unforgettable. Bring the tissues and be prepared to leave this book's pages with a renewed understanding of faith, family and country. I'd been thinking this week that a depressive feeling I hadn't felt since September 11th had begun to assail me again in light of recent events. This book was a refreshing chance to truly remember, not only the sorrow of 9-11, but the charity and unity that followed. May God strengthen us all.	2004-05-15

This soul-stirring page turner of people trying to keep it real and keep it holy at the same time. From single Mary whose friends want to turn her hair don't into a hair-do so she'll be datable, to Moor, the African prince whose head says he has no time for love, but his heart sings a different tune to Puddin' and Joe a married couple of thirty years who have a pot full of secrets between them (all dipped in flour, dropped in a sizzling skillet and fried hard).<br />There were times in this book when I laughed loud enough to wake my sleeping house (usually there a piece of chicken was flying somewhere). At other moments, I put the book down and smiled, nodding to myself. \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Uh huh.\\" \\"I know that's right.\\" Before the book was done I'd said all that and more out loud. For anyone who has good friends, nosy cousins and church members or just likes a good piece of chicken with tea and lemonade (mixed together of course), AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN is a trip up the rocky terrain of seeing ourselves as we really are, fragile humans in need of grace. Pick this up and enjoy the view at the top . . . and the truth it resonates at the bottom of your heart.<br />It was great to see a few flashes of Garvin and Meemaw from AIN'T NO RIVER as well. Much wisdom to be had here and more than a few laughs! Just have some chicken or ribs on hand! You'll want it before it's over.	2004-05-05

Surely somewhere back in high school I'd combed over it along with the other books on the list, but this time, with a little living behind me, I could appreciate it, accepting its gifts. The first gift was the reminder that a book is not a movie on the page. Even with our short attention spans gorged on TV and computers (myself included) and our starved imaginations, taking the time to think through a book like this raises the mind from its slumber. An ordinary tale of a Chinese peasant who goes from a poor farmer purchasing a slave from a rich man to a rich man himself, THE GOOD EARTH, shows the cycles of mankind with all their rejoicing and regrets. There are no contrived right turns or easy wrap-ups, neither for the land-thirsty Wang Lung or the reader who follows his journey. I think I will spend this summer revisting my high school AP reading list and be much better for it.	2004-05-02

Who can swashbuckling warrior queen and her tortured warrior-turned-priest hostage husband all flung against the backdrop of Scotland's isle? Not me. I fell for this couple instantly. She's my kind of girl--stuck halfway between her breastplate and her role as a bride. Instead of a broom for her part of the hearth and home at the wedding, eighteen-year-old upstart Maire, whose been training for her role as queen for the last nine years with two foster brothers, throws down her sword on top of her husbands.<br />The spiritual thread here is well woven and very authentic, describing the often overlooked struggles and questions of God's character and how He relates to us. I know Mrs. Windsor is writing more contemporaries now, but she definitely hit her groove on this one. This was an awesome read.	2004-04-24

Kudos to Mr. Sparks for switching things up and trying new things. I've read a good bit of romantic suspense though and this just didn't stand out from the usual girl-in-jeopardy story. I loved the dog though. Mike and Julie were likable. Richard was hatable. Andrea was pitiable. Probably only Mabel, Henry and Emma were interesting and they didn't do anything. Their characters had little quirks though like Mabel's disappearance and reappearance (that'd make a great book) or Emma's unexpected advice to always marry someone who loves you more when it seems she's the one who adores Henry. There weren't many surprises from the main characters, but it was a fun ride. I appreciate authors who try different things.	2004-04-19

Ruby Taylor is real woman learning to love God, her family, herself--and maybe the new guy on the policeforce. Or didn't she already decide that wasn't a good idea? At the rate she keeps running into him while investigating a former co-worker's suspicious suicide and her long lost brother's strange activities, it's hard to forget her feelings for Wesley, the town's rookie cop. I loved Ruby's sassy attitude and her sincere faith, but the cleaning lady and her simple, honest love impressed me most of all. Though the main plot will keep the pages turning, Sharon has sprinkled a few jewels about families, forgiveness and forgetting the past between the pages. Pick it up. You won't be sorry.	2004-04-15

Seeing marriage, especially a long marriage, through the eyes of a man who worked too much and loved too little was a different, but interesting ride.

If Mr. Spinelli's wife is a bit like this wonderful-but-different girl, he is a lucky man. Books like this make you think about who the real you really is, the kooky person singing in the shower or the phony trying to hold it together under the lipstick.<br />Sure, this book is about a formerly homeschooled social misfit (in the eyes of everyone else) but it's also about taking chances and standing up for the right sides, the sides you love, even when it's gonna cost you. I read in the interview at the end that this novel kicked around in Mr. Spinelli's head for many years. I can tell. And I'm grateful for every extra minute he let it simmer. As an adult, mother, teacher and writer this book and its title character challenged me in many ways.

I don't know what it is about her writing, but I adore it. I polished this in a day, most of it spent in a room full of miserable people at H&amp;R Block. I laughed so many times it was rude, but I couldn't help myself. As a wife, a daughter, a woman who planned many weddings only to elope herself and the mother of a nine-year-old who lives to dance, this book was the best. (not to mention that it was full of lawyers and I'd just polished off Grisham's KING OF TORTS).<br />I love all Ray's husbands too. Probably because they're so much like my own--hard-working, hard-loving everyday guys with kids and bills and regrets who still know how to make you laugh. Sure there were a few dips here in there in this story, but I loved every moment of the ride. It's what I love about her books, I know exactly what I'm getting, but I'm never quite sure how I'll get there.<br />And the characters... George was a dream. What better son, brother, fiance' could you have? And Kay, well, let's just say I couldn't be a bit mad at her. Been there, done that. Picked the right guy. Taffy probably made the longest trip of anybody in the book, much like Ruth's mother in EAT CAKE, but in a different way. I would have liked more flesh on Woodrow. (He was at the table but didn't seem a full partaker? I felt he had more to give) All in all though, it was great, refreshing and I hope she never quits. If she does, I'll keep writing drivel. She's one of the few people who make me consider quitting all together.	2004-02-04

How much is a soul worth, Grisham asks in this tale, with an even harder question whispering underneath,Who has to pay for it? Clay Carter decries his beatup Honda Accord, condescending would-be in-laws and deadend job. When saddled with a murder case, the public defender thinks things have really hit rock bottom.<br />And he's right. But not for long. Enter a slick guy dressed in black and rippled with muscles, a corporate fireman who needs to silence Clay before he runs onto a secret that can destroy his client--and everything changes. Ten million everythings. Dragging his co-workers and roommate along for the ride, Clay gets sucked into the vaccuum of wealth over the next year, only to be spit out at the end, grasping the one thing that's eluded him despite his millions, a relationship with the girlfriend he loves.<br />Though some describe this as fluff or boring, I urge them to read between the lines. The background cast of THE KING OF TORTS is just as important as the main cast. Tequila Watson, Ramon Pumphrey, the Hannas and definitely the Worleys all give a picture of the reality of tort litigation, drug companies and the criminal justice system. It's not just about the writing, but the thinking the writing makes you do. :)	2004-02-02

I suspect it's some of the same thing that makes Ruth's cakes so intriguing and full of \\"character\\" as Florence, the occupational therapist, puts it. And she should know. She's got a good bit of it herself.<br />Ray's characters are real women, living, loving and trying to deal with what happens when what you thought was true isn't true anymore? Or was never true at all? I read through this book in a night, crying, laughing and nodding as God answered through these short pages some of my own questions, one's I'd been too afraid to ask.<br />A good book wounds with questions and sends a reader scurrying for answers.

In an honest and gripping tale of an American woman taken to Scotland by her abusive husband, her despair and cry to God for deliverance as he seeks to take her life and that of her son, EMBRACE THE DAWN unfolds into a glorious story of hope amidst Scotland's green hills.

While some romances bore me, Catherine Palmer's Heartquest titles always keep my attention and fed my spirit. I wondered if ***A Dangerous Silence***, her suspense debut would be as good.<br />I wasn't disappointed. In a whirlwind of a story, Palmer took me to Kansas to save a family, a farm and the faith of burned out FBI agent. When old Ed Morgan falls out his barn loft and can no longer run his farm, his pediatrician daughter, Marah, must decide whether to return to the home she fled so long ago.<br />When she gets there, she finds more than her father's shattered leg--a team of archeologists from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a drifter looking for work, and harrowing details of her mother's death years before.<br />With fluid ease, Palmer weaves a tale between tornados and family secrets with her telltale romantic thread in the seams. Perky, the child character, is so realistic she could have been my own daughter.<br />Tyndale has a winner in this one. Don't miss it!	2003-10-20

Write His Answer, a Christian writer's devotional, is a weapon for every word warrior's arsenal.

I put it down several times at first, swimming in the NASA jargon and not really identifying with anyone except the astronaut's wives, who didn't get many pages.<br />But I hung in there and kept reading and boy am I glad I did. Talk about a pace change! Somewher in the middle, this book blasts off like the Apollo 19 team whose story is told within the pages. I started flipping pages like mad and ended up staying up all night and having to go to the second service for church. (Now that's a book!)<br />There were some confusing parts (and some scary ones). There were times when I stopped and thought,\\"Where is this guy going with this?\\" but when he got there at the end...man. I had glimpses of things but I kept thinking I was wrong. He got me for sure. I had to stay up and finish it. I was thinking too hard to go to sleep. It wasn't what I was expecting, but it worked somehow! I'll be looking for the next book, Mr. Johnson. It'll be interesting to see what you think up next!	2003-10-12

Ivy's sisters and their reaction to her new place in the family are charming as is the dark, pirate of a hero who wants to please God, but skip the pleasantries. Like LOVE'S PROOF, this title showcases Ms. Palmer's flair for the period and her knack for writing about wonderful women across the ages.	2003-10-02

Like THE COLOR OF WORDS, this book illustrates all the richness of life in a family of color and the power of writing, specifically poetry here, to help a person realease his words into choices. As a mother, a writer, a poet and former seventh grader I salute Ms. Bertrand and look forward to more work from her.	2003-10-02

After recently reading Catherine Palmer's SUNRISE SONG, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this historical as much. I was wrong! Exhibiting the height and depth of her writing talent, Ms. Palmer took me on a delightful journey through the English regency period with side stops in some of my favorite subjects--mathematics, chemistry and history.<br />Feisty Jane's search for proof, both of God's existence and to save her father's life, is a true picture of the thinking believer and the struggle between logic and faith. Thomas Norcross is equally intriguing hero with his own thirst for answers and adventure. This couple is a treat, as well as Ms. Palmer's storytelling.	2003-08-12

Not many people do it well. Fewer do it like this--masterfully. Take a trip to Kenya and into the hearts of two very different, yet very alike people, both wanting and needing the same things, but not able to identify what they want...until they meet each other. Mrs. Palmer always sprinkles a little suspense along the way to keep the pages turning as well. I appreciate all her hard work. Both this and the first book in the series are my favorites.	2003-08-03

Ms. Rivers has provided me with another book full of mirrors, drawing me to look closer at myself, my relationships with the people I love and with God himself. A few things tied up too neatly for me, and I never recovered from the slap Paul gave Eunice partway through. NEVER. Eunice's reaction to that (or lack or a reaction) turned her back into character instead of a person.<br />In fact, neither Paul or Eunice rang true for me in many sections--she was too good and he was too bad. It'd take more than a jackrabbit to wake that guy up. Well, maybe not, God can do anything or I wouldn't be writing this. I think Stephen came across as the most believable, which strange since I'm a woman and I've never been an alcoholic, but he, Samuel and a minor character, Karen Kessler came across as real. Stephen's ex-wife too and the blame game they played.<br />But Lois and Eunice lived up to the biblical namesakes a little too much for me. Timothy turned out to be a great kid. The elder Hudson was a piece of work. The effect of parent's expectations on their children definitely hit home.<br />But all in all, it was just Francine, doing her thing, being herself, being honest that I loved. She got preachy in spots but the real deal on other pages balanced the scales some. Why aren't there more &quot;real&quot; Christian books? Maybe these publishers should visit some of the churches in America and talk to their buying public. These people have real problems. And not just the parishoners--the leadership on down. Let art do it's job, to just be and let people take from it what God put there for each of them.	2003-07-09

As a divorce \\"survivor\\" myself who experienced the battle for the second time at about Tree's age, I could identify all too closely with his tale. Bauer reminds readers, young and old, to never give up on love's battlefield even when the address changes and to stand tall...even if that means you look a little strange.

Although prepared specifically for the African-American palate, Christian families of any culture will find sustenance in Soul Food and Living Water. The poignant accounts of the Powells' journey through submission and respect in marriage, raising teens with understanding and maintaining bonds and wisdom from grandparents and ancestors will help all Christian households navigate the rigors of raising a world-changing family against a pulsing, flashing landscape of sin. Single parents also will find practical ways to keep their families dining at God's table--even if all the seats aren't occupied.<br />At almost three hundred pages, Soul Food and Living Water offers enough to keep readers consumed for a long time. Each part of the book-individual spiritual relationships, marital intimacy, parenting and cultural heritage through extended family-could have easily comprised a book of its own. In an attempt to encompass all aspects of family, some subjects are probed more deeply than others, most notably marriage, understanding the influences of hip hop culture on teenagers, creating a home of peace and order and specific suggestions on dealing with family problems. The book is worth buying for these passages alone.<br />The editing team at Moody can be commended for maintaining the voices of the authors as well as many references to African American culture, such as the principles of Kwanzaa and the spiritual significance of cultural gatherings like Friday night fish frys and other get togethers. Focus on the legacy of endurance found in African-American culture will leave the targeted reader uplifted and satisfied. The cover shot and images throughout are positive and appealing as well.

I really enjoyed this story, though I thought that the journal entries would be more intertwined with the action in the present, I really enjoyed them. I did feel that the husband got off a little easy and perhaps didn't grow as much as he could have, but it was true to his personality. For him, he'd gone a long way. I would have liked to know more about some of the ladies and the club and what happened to them and if they were impacted by the main character's growing faith. All in all, it was an engaging read and kept me thinking long afterwards. That is what I love about Mrs. Rivers' books--that they draw me to pray and think.	2003-04-07

When I received this book recently as a door prize for the Shades of Romance Online Writer's Conference, I was elated. A new book! A new author. And a historical at that. (I have a soft spot for a good historical.)<br />Well, I wasn't disappointed. Linda Windsor transported me to medieval Ireland with ease, burrowing her way into my favorite author's closet as well. Fiery Riona, the main character has the heart of a nun and temper of warrior. When Kieran, her handsome, but unbelieving foster brother arrives home with news of their brother's death and his deathbed wish for them to marry, well, Riona has all the men running for cover.<br />Before she can fully vent her anger though, there's a murder in the abbey and Kieran is the main suspect. With the three orphans she plans to adopt and a mouthful of prayers, Riona sets out to rescue Kieran and herself.<br />It's a bouncy ride through the Irish hillside full of the wonder of Christ's love.

It wasn't the miracles, the bright lights or even Caleb's powers that impacted me, but rather the words of the dying leader,\\"Who says that a straightened hand is more powerful than a healed heart?\\"<br />Little Caleb's battle with the \\"brine\\" in the oil of his heart and his struggle to \\"walk in the kingdom\\" reminded me of my first days as a Christian and how much I earnestly desired Christ and His kingdom as the pearl of great price, worthy of surrendering everything in my life for.<br />That the book caused me to evaluate my desire for Christ and whether He was still my first love was this book's success for me, not the fiction. The story dragged in places for me and the constant use of the phrase \\"The Greek\\" to describe the priest threw me for some reason. In some ways, all the good characters seemed the same and all the bad characters seemed the same. Only Caleb and the dying man really stood out, but perhaps that was intentional. After the last page, I was on my knees, so the book did its job. :)This is my second Dekker title. It won't be the last.	2003-03-27

ATONEMENT CHILD was the first. After reading both of them, I found myself praying and thinking for a long time after. In my opinion, that's a good book!<br />Some reviews stated they thought Cadi and Fagan's King James Bible talking unbelievable. I had no problem with it. Like the masterfully woven dialect, the way the children talked after being saved kept pace with the rest of the story.<br />For three nights (two in Fagan's case), they'd been listening to the \\"man of God\\" speak to them in this way (King James) for hours and hours. These children had no television, no deficit of attention as we do. :) They soaked up and repeated everything they'd heard over and over--to Miss Elda, to Bletsung, to the sin eater, to each other.<br />I also saw their child-like faith as a perfect picture of the new believer. The Word is everything then--nothing else matters. There is an urgency to witness and share that can only be described as \\"life or death\\".<br />For me, Rivers recaptured my own salvation experience and fascination with the Word of God. Althugh I still study the Bible daily and witness often, I spent hours after the final page searching myself for the initial passion (and compassion) for the lost I had during those first hours, days, weeks, of my conversion.<br />This book is not only an entertaining read, but a picture of how God blesses those who love them, even to a thousand generations. I wonder too, who among my ancestors held out, praying, hoping... for me.	2002-12-14

The little boy in the story just needed some attention. But his parents didn't give him that. He did a really stupid thing. He went and got his father's gun. He was late for school and he took it to gym. He was going through some bag things at home and at school. The best thing about this book is that you get to finish the book yourself. I would make Danny take the gun and go home and put it away. Then, I would make Danny go back to school and explain to everyone about the gun. He should go home and explain to parents too. He shouldn't even touch it.<br />This book reminded me that killing is really bad and guns too. You should not even think about stuff like that.
