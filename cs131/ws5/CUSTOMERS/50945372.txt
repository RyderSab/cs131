I look forward to April each year knowing that the next Benni Harper edition will be at the book store. I took my time reading  STTA simply because I didn't want it to end. Each book is true to the characters of Benni Harper and her husband Gabe and her entire family. Seeing another side of Gabe added to the intrigue of STTA. Also, it was great bringing back Hud! I am amazed at how each book is so completely different from the previous book. While so many authors become stagnant after writing nine or more novels, Earlene keeps growing with each book. <br />Benni and Gabe's marraige hits a fork in the road. While happiness fills the air around their family with two weddings, Benni and Gabe have some big decisions to make. Benni stumbles across a murder in San Celina after agreeing to help the historical society. How will she work on solving a murder and her marriage at the same time?<BR> <BR>I can't wait for April 2003!	2002-04-13

I have loved needlepoint now for over thirty years. Probably one of the greatest things my mother gave me was a beginners needlepoint class when I was eight years old. I basket-weaved away for many, many years. Then, I discovered this book. It took my love for needlepoint to new levels of creativity. There are so many easy to follow directions for stiches that I had never seen before. This book brought out a new and creative aspect to my stiches. From the brand new beginner to the heartend veteran, this book is a must have! I have several other guides in my needlepoint library,  yet I always come back to this one.	2002-01-25

Follett is still the master of suspense, espionage and intrigue. The reader meets Luke, the main character, after Luke wakes up to learn that he has lost his memory. With clandestine CIA operatives tailing him, Luke must find his identity. Along the way, he uncovers a plot where he is the subject to be silenced. Watch as Luke attempts to prevent an enormous disaster in the Cold War.	2002-01-22

The author, Mignon Ballard, has a wonderful imagination and a great premise for a new series of cozy mysteries. A guardian angel by the name of Augusta Goodnight appears from above to help Prentice Dobson solve a mystery. Prentice is on to something and she is not sure what that might be. Will Augusta keep her safe and solve the mystery?<br />I would have enjoyed learning more about Augusta Goodnight, and to see more of her. Prentice does most of the sleuthing. There is not much of Augusta in this mystery. The back cover of the book calls Augusta a &quot;baggage-toting, wisecracking, guardian angel&quot;. This statement must have come from the previous mystery. I did not see this side of her. The mystery would have been more entertaining if there had been more character development in the guardian angel. There were also several &quot;sub-plots&quot; throughout the book which were enjoyable. It just needed more of Augusta Goodnight.	2002-01-18

I purchased his first book on impulse at a grocery store in Austin, TX. Since then, he has been one of my favorite authors. Over the past several years I kept checking to see if he has written a new book. <br />A Kiss Gone Bad was nothing like I expected. Language, Serial Killers, gore, etc. kept me from finishing the book. He took the path of Patterson, Sandford, and King. I'm sure that there is a large audience for A Kiss Gone Bad, and I hope that he finds it. Call me sentimental and bring back Jordan Poteet.	2001-11-11

Arkansas Traveler is a wonderful addition to the Benni Harper series. The author has branched out with a bold statement about racism and the heart of people. She twists in a murder while two churches are attempting to merge. The characters are wonderful. The reader gets a new understanding of Benni's best friend Elvia and Benni's husband Gabe. The rest of her family comes to life too. There is a delightful Southern charm to Arkansas Traveler. Growing up in the South made all of the references to food and stores a lot of fun!

How often do we look at someone (in passing, or someone we know) and wonder if they know Jesus? Do we dare take the next step and talk to them about Jesus? Yes, we all should. There is a wonderful boldness to this story that I know I could use. After reading this book, I continue to ponder the story. God is moving and our hearts need to be ready.

This is a good book in an excellent series. Mr Jenkins and Mr LaHaye have done something incredible-getting more people to read about the Holy Bible. Of course this is their fictional interpretation of the book of Revelation. Yet it is peppered with Bilble truths and scriptures from the Bible.  Scholars continue to debate over the book of Revelation (secular and Biblical). If the reader is concentrating on the grammar and sentence structure of The Mark, they are missing the point of this series- for people to think about the end of days and most important to bring people to Christ. There are books dating back decades on the subject of Rev., and they will continue. Yet, how many have been on the best sellers list? How many of those can get strangers talking about how far they are in the series and praising God for all that He does? What is important is that people are reading and hopefully cross-referencing the material with their Bible. Or better yet, maybe they are motivated to read the Bible for the first time. I personally know of people who after reading the first book of the series had a change of heart and dedicated their life to Christ. What an awesome testimony of what Christ can use in our daily life to get our attention. This is a wonderful series because it provokes the reader to ponder his relationship with Christ.	2001-01-17

Bonita Faye is one of those novels. This is a timeless, hopefully soon to be a classic. I was completely captivated throughout the entire story. I consider Bonita Faye to be one of the most wonderful characters in liturature. She is strong, gustsy, loving, friendly and very funny in her own down-to-earth Sourthern way. You meet her in the beginning of the story as a very young naive girl. She also happens to be married to Billy Roy; a repulsive, mean, no-good man.

I felt like I had  been dropped into the middle of their quaint neighborhood. Many times in a  mystery when the characters and the setting are great, the mystery lags.  Not in this story!  Miss Claire keeps the action and the mystery flowing  throughout the entire book. She grabs the reader at the beginning when  Leigh Koslow finds an embalmed body in the hammock in her backyard. Add a  slightly neurotic pregnant cousin, and you have the beginnings of a  terrific story. Plus, it was a great who-done it! I am looking forward to  starting Never Sorry.
