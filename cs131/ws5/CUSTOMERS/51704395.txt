Let's get on with it and keep science within the realm of REAL alternatives in origins research.<br />That pretty well summarizes No Free Lunch, which brings the reader up to date with the latest in mathematical research and design theory. The \\"No Free Lunch\\" theorems establish that information does not arise by either chance or order - the two mechanisms available to naturalism, AKA atheistic Darwinism. The only thing left is intelligence as the source of information.<br />This is hardly the first book to make this claim (cf. Werner Gitt's In the Beginning was Information - or for that matter, the ancient Greek philosophers had it figured out). But in a world saturated with the religion of naturalism, this blunt work destroying that religion at its very foundation stands out. When the last Darwinist is dead and buried, William Dembski will be highly ranked among those who laid the evolutionary ideology to rest.<br />Demski's handling of Darwinian critics, blinded by their own preconceptions and faith commitments, is excellent. While the book as a whole is too technical for many readers, Dembski outlines the main themes very well, limiting the mathematical proofs to some sections so that the remainder of the work can be read profitably by just about anyone.	2003-08-12

Oral and written traditions of this momentous event in human history are found in hundreds of cultures around the globe. Nevertheless, despite a landslide of geologic evidence for the Cataclysm the story of Noah and the Ark is still treated with ridicule by humanistic scoffers. (Just as prophesied by II Peter 3 of the Bible.)<br />What veteran origins scientist John Woodmorappe has done is collect dozens of skeptical attacks against the record of the Ark and then painstakingly researched each one in the scientific literature. The result is a landmark work demonstrating that the concept of the Ark as presented in Genesis feasible. Moreover, based solely on the peer-reviewed, modern scientific literature, low-technology solutions to each problem facing the occupants of the Ark have already been established and proven. The result is a very readable work, capped with almost eighty pages of references.<br />Readers will be amazed at the folly of Ark critics, many with science doctorates, seemingly in competition to make the most absurd claims. Darwinian fundamentalists have insisted that the Ark had to carry everything from all plant species to carrying fish and whales ? despite the plain testimony of Genesis which negates such nonsense. Fact-free claims of the critics are met with calculations and hard data to show that critics of the Ark account have invariably failed to do their homework. <br />The result is a book that belongs on the shelf of every student of the Bible, as well as being a useful tool for homeschoolers, students of animal husbandry and related disciplines.	2003-08-12

This monograph is a critical review of inorganic radioisotope dating and the difficulties involved in interpretation of the raw data. Woodmorappe establishes the fact that other factors (besides the passage of uniformitarian time) must be considered as potential major contributors to any given isotopic array. The isochron method, developed to overcome these difficulties is found to be subject to non-temporal factors as well. <br />The question is not &quot;is radioisotope dating perfectly accurate&quot; so much as it is &quot;how inaccurate is radioisotope dating?&quot; MMDM demonstrates that it requires faith to believe that time &quot;must&quot; pass for a given parent/daughter ratio to exist in a given geologic setting. Inheritance of mantle source isotopes, leeching, and other more exotic factors must also be considered, and can never be completely ruled out. Radioisotope data thus provides only a guideline and not a &quot;factual&quot; absolute date. This is exhaustively documented with usual Woodmorappian thoroughness.	2003-08-12

It is more of a challenge to walk the talk. Having a biblical worldview equips you for the tough times. Ironically, skeptics who ask \\"if there is a good God why is there so much evil\\" often miss the point that evil only exists as an objective reality if there is a God who defines good in the first place. Authors Ken Ham and Dr. Carl Wieland show how evil exists as a consequence of human sin, and show through their personal experiences how this understanding gives the strength to overcome profound tragedy.<br />Without giving too much away, this includes a horrible head-on collision that shattered medical doctor Carl Wieland's body, as well as the Ham families' recent experience with the untimely loss of his brother due to a degenerative brain disease. My wife was able to relate to the experience of the first, having been broad-sided by a driver running a red light and having suffered permanent back injuries as a result. This is not fluff Christianity, and if it does seem stilted at times in the latter half, it is only because the authors have been talking the right talk for so long they've got it down pat, which is not a bad thing.	2003-02-19

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Another vote to read the books before the movies	Even if the movies are very well done I can't imagine they will capture the moral dimensions and the epic scope of the Lord of the Rings, indeed, of Middle-Earth. Superb thrillers on par (or even beyond) Indiana Jones and Star Wars they might be, but they will still pale in comparison with the written word.<br />Moreover, once you see a movie it is stuck in your mind. You can never really go back and read the books with an open mind, to form your own opinions about what Gandalf should look like, or how ruggedly sylvan Rivendell appeared, or Minas Tirith shining in the morning sun. And that's a shame, because it takes away a wonderful opportunity for you to exercise your imagination. Read the books first and then you will have something to compare the movies against in your own mind, and appreciate both all the more.<br />Another reason to go for the books involves the moral coherence of the books, something likely to be lacking in the film. Now, this moral coherence is not perfect, being the work of a morally imperfect author like any other human work. But modern sci-fi and fantasy is astonishingly lacking when it comes to presenting novels with a coherent moral framework. To the morally sensitive person much of the genre is simply obnoxious - even the most highly praised works, by other criteria, are like a manuscript filled with typographical errors from this perspective. So check out the work of a master, not just of words but also of worldviews.	2001-05-25

In daily conversation I notice the tenets of postmodernism cropping up all the time. People who have no idea what &quot;postmodernism&quot; is are nonetheless deeply influenced by it, mouthing its words, speaking its assumptions, believing its claims because they have been so deeply inculcated with it without even realizing it. I don't think people realize just how distinctively different a philosophy of epistemology it really is, compared to historical norms. <br />That said, Veith's book is a good introduction to the subject, and worthy reading for every person who is seeking a well-rounded education. From a Christian perspective (more specifically a Lutheran, not protestant, one) Veith traces the rise of Modernism from a biblical worldview, and the inevitable transformation from Modernism's empty claims to certainty to Postmodernism's notorious uncertainty and relativism. Between the two Veith charts a path that seeks to avoid the errors both of pompous Modernist dogmatism and Postmodernist denial that truth can be reasonably ascertained.<br />Veith's book conveys understanding and insight, if not a straightforward guide to helping others out of the morass of Postmodernism. Ultimately Postmodernism fails because it is so internally inconsistent (how can one argue rationally for it if rationality itself is suspect?) Rather than point to the internal inconsistencies, I suspect a better route will be to present a positive epistemology that is more consistent than the Modernist ideology that Postmodernists abandoned; in short, the biblical worldview.	2000-10-23

Of course, this index only lists research within creationary circles, not the much greater volume of papers and research done by creationary scientists in secular publications that do not have (obviously) divisive implications.<br />Bible-believing scientists do research the same as anyone else, as this monograph demonstrates.

The following is excerpted from a lengthy response to IGDC I put together when I first read it.<br />IGDC is designed for youth who are also frustrated with dating but want to be conformists, who don't want to be seen as &quot;extreme&quot; or lose the acceptance of mainstream friends. It  promises the benefits of courtship without the rigor...<br />In the third  chapter of his book Clark tries to set his own book apart from courtship  books and give justification for doing so. He does so by maligning  courtship, tarring with a bigots brush without bothering to give an ounce  of evidence. He owes advocates of courtship an apology....<br />Clark would  have us believe legalism is the only error we can fall into, but as the  discussion above shows, there is an equal and opposite error, known as  PIETISM. Pietism is the notion that &quot;holy thinking&quot; and right  motivations will somehow magically result in good ends, without any  identifiable process adjustments. Pietism is more naïve than heretical, but  it leads to ineffectuality because in the real world right thinking and  right motivation must be utilized in the context of right action - doing  something different than would otherwise be - or it all comes to  nought....<br />...It is difficult for a courtship apologist to name some  principle of courtship to which Clark does not subscribe. Seek  accountability with others such as parents he says (p. 87), build your  character (p. 57), set criteria by which you judge whether you are prepared  for marriage (p. 69), don't date non-Christians (p. 36), communicate on  dates rather than focusing on entertainment (p. 48), and on and on and on.   Clarks' whole book is a tacit acknowledgement of the program and means and  ideals of courtship. (Not that courtship advocates invented every such  principle, but in courtship they are explicit.) So where's the  difference?<br />The difference lies in the issue of accountability and lack  of structure and external counsel.In IGDC everything relies on the  willpower and thoughtfulness of the individual. Although accountability is  mentioned it is brief and late in the book, not a fundamental principle  that is needed to make the others more effective. If we sought  accountability naturally that might not be so bad, but we don't. And by  providing a slew of good ideas while downplaying the idea of actually  changing behavior by raising the legalism bogeyman, he eviscerates his own  self-improvement program....<br />...Clark's thesis is that problems in dating  arise because people are ignorant. If they would just learn what the  Biblical standards for relationships are, we'd be OK. In order to support  this thesis, it is necessary for IGDC to make some astonishing assumptions.  Notice the presumption of ignorance on the part of his young friend in the  example above. Does he really think ignorance is the problem?<br />IGDC seems  to forget that we do have a conscience. Those standards of purity and godly  living aren't just in the Bible, they are also written in our hearts. And  to assume that everyone having problems in dating is ignorant of the Bible  and what it teaches is remarkably naïve. Over and over IGDC tells us what  we already know. He repeats what most of us have already learned in Sunday  school, and Bible study, and in sermons and listening to Christian  speakers. We may learn a few pointers from his book, but overwhelmingly  what IGDC has to tell us is old news.<br />That's why IGDC will probably be  relatively popular, and will definitely be ineffectual. Telling us what we  already know is an easy way to win approval but a poor way to achieve  change and fix problems. We've had these exhortations for decades in the  context of dating, and it hasn't made any discernable difference on the  population of dating Christians as a whole - not from the statistics I've  seen....<br />...Neither intellectual nor moral ignorance is the main problem.  Weakness in temptation is the main problem. IGDC's exhortations do nothing  to address that effectively. Jeramy, we already knew God wants us to be  pure. We already knew we should treat the other person with honor. We  already knew we should ask the counsel of others. We already knew we should  think with our head not our hearts.<br />IGDC also fails to cope with other  major problem areas of dating. As I mentioned, it focuses exclusively on  improving yourself by addressing presumed ignorance. It does nothing to  protect a young lady (who has read IGDC and taken it to heart) from a date  rapist who doesn't care about such exhortations. Or a young man from a  manipulative 'gold digger' who can put on a good front. Not only is IGDC  ineffectual in addressing temptation, it is also ineffectual in providing a  safe environment that protects that reader from abuses (incidental or  deliberate) that are epidemic today....<br />Those with a heartfelt desire to  be pure and keep a whole heart on the road to marriage will be let down by  IGDC. The author is surprisingly callous when it comes to dating and  breaking up. [See p. 154]...<br />...IGDC asks us to avoid legalism, but keeps  us in the bondage of failed cultural systems that so many of us found to be  more brutal and repressive than any legalism... Courtship, as I am  continually at pains to show in day to day discussions, is not legalistic.  It is a matter of understanding the principles so we can customize rules  for each situation, to achieve good ends. Clark never provides evidence to  justify his accusations of legalism...	2000-04-10

That's a bold claim, I thought somewhat cynically. But after reading it I can't dispute it from personal experience!<br />The Ludy's make a passionate  appeal for God-centered romance and purity, using their own lives (warts  and all) as a case study. Although the book is not proscriptive (that is,  it does not give a set of rules to follow) it does an excellent job of  providing biblical principles and insight for singles seeking to avoid the  pitfalls and traumas of dating. And in our current holocaust of abortion,  divorce, romance-related suicide and depression, STD's and more, there's is  a message that is desperately needed. <br />This book is an inspiration,  that's for sure. Just reading it gave me a wholesome feeling and reminded  me that there are other godly singles out there seeking His best in their  lives. As I learned in the years following my own romance-related suicidal  depression as a teen, faith in God and attention to His Word really is the  solution to all our problems. Kudos to the Ludy's for spreading that truth.	2000-03-24

The best critic is one who earnestly seeks to study and understand the reasons someone holds a position. At the other extreme is the fanatic, the insecure caricaturist who does not even care to understand his subject  matter before tearing into it. I'm sorry to say that this book is in the  latter category.<br />Eldredge demonstrates no significant grasp of his  subject matter (creation science, the interpretation of natural science  data in a framework based on Genesis), the result being a work that should  shame a freshmen college student, much less the co-author of punctuated  equilibrium! He stoops to blatant falsehoods and absurdities, such as  claiming no creationist scientist has ever published in a science journal.  While admitting that they win all the debates early in his book, he chalks  it up to theatrics, which is surely an insult to the intelligence of  audiences at origins debates.<br />In one of his two quotes from creationary  material in the entire book he claims creationists quote out of context -  and then quotes a creation scientist out of context to support his claim.  His other quote of a creationist is equally bizarre: taking a section of  text in which the term &quot;kind&quot; of animal is used in the same  casual context context we use in everyday conversation, he imputes a  technical meaning to it based on the Hebrew term baramin that is rather  obviously not applicable to even the more casual and uninformed  reader.<br />Probably the most usable portion of his book is the section based  on his own expertise in the study of trilobites. But anyone with an  interest in this subject would surely be better served reading books more  directly applicable to that specialty. His book closes with a chilling  appeal to evolutionists to work together to suppress academic freedom and  toleration for dissenting viewpoints under the rubric of &quot;defending  science.&quot;<br />Creation science could be well-served by thoughtful,  informed critiques of its' models and theories. Some evolutionists do  occasionally produce these and they are to be commended for rising above  the fray and refraining from the kind of behavior characterized by this  book. But as it is, I realized that if the co-author of &quot;punk  eek&quot; could only do such a poor job of criticizing creation and  defending evolutionism, the evolutionary worldview had indeed become  indefensible.

It is filled with biblical wisdom and practical insight  into personal relationships, and the apologetic for courtship principles is  superb without being fierce or legalistic. Christian families will be  blessed by this book.<br />Books like this are providing the basis for a  Christian cultural revival that will encourage and attract a spiritually  starved and unhappy pagan society.

It may go  only 10 meters where I hope for people to travel 20 meters, but at least  it's going in the right direction!<br />Mr. Harris's book I would describe as  &quot;Courtship lite&quot; - the valuable contribution of his book is the  principles he brings out, but he doesn't really go all the way with them or  really outline the full courtship methodology.

Lewis appeared at least twice in the list - The Abolition of Man was second, and Mere Christianity also placed high.<br />Mere Christianity is  that rare book that can be read by the average person yet even an advanced  scholar can learn much from it, if they are willing to open their mind and  think. His key arguments are undefeated, unless one calls denial and  affected arrogance &quot;winning.&quot;<br />I don't always agree with Lewis  or his worldview, but this book deserves it's ranking. If you don't get  anything from it, that's your own fault. I encourage everyone to consider  it.	1999-04-30

Any mention, or at any rate any positive mention, of  religion and the role it has played in the unfolding history of America.  This censorship has led to profound misunderstandings about everything from  the Thanksgiving at Plymouth to the importance of the Bible as a guide in  the establishment and form of American government. Federer's sourcebook  helps reveal these largely suppressed realities.	1999-04-26

Are you aware of the hidden beliefs and assumptions that shape how others teach you, tell you in news media, and try to influence you?  Probably not. That's why this is a superb resource. <br /> Dr. Noebel takes a  wide variety of educational topics and compares the three major worldviews  today (Christianity, Marxism, and Secular Humanism), showing the basis and  logical interrelationships for each, and how each looks at the evidence.  <br /> PS: I can quibble with a few points, and I'm sure other informed  Christians could also add their own observations... but when you see people  expressing hatred and fear of this book and then claim to be a Christian  while everyone else loves it, what does that tell you? If the Enemy hates  it, it must be good! :-)	1999-04-22

Einstein paid homage to the few believing Christians left in Germany by the time Hitler came to power. Hitler's Cross is the story of the Confessing Church, the remnant who stood against Hitler in the darkening  days before WWII. It is also the story of a corrupted and humanistic  institutional church that was all too ready to throw out the Cross of  Christ for Hitler's &quot;Twisted Cross&quot; and earthly message of Aryan  &quot;salvation&quot;.	1999-04-22

These are books that are tremendously fun for children, or adults, to read, yet they teach moral  values and build character. And that is something we desperately need in  society today. I would encourage anyone with boys aged 11-13 in particular  to get these books. You won't regret it.	1999-04-21

Dr. Lubenow's work laid the foundation for an understanding of hominid fossils in the creation model. Although much work has been done to advance the model since this work was published it is still an important beginning  point.<br />Despite attempts by annoyed or frantic evolutionists to pooh-pooh  this work it is filled with valuable information. I would urge  evolutionists to try with a straight face to study evolutionary literature  and show how it accords with the evidence Lubenow points out. Evolutionary  theory can best be described as fighting the evidence, not flowing with it.  If this is not the case, why do evolutionists avoid &quot;big picture&quot;  analyses like the one Lubenow has performed that survey ALL the accepted  evidence and chart it together? Why are they so selective even within their  own camps and factions?	1999-04-20

What it is, is a book that explains why creation science, and more specifically, belief in Genesis, is vital to the Christian church and society in general.

National Review just put out a list of the top 100 non-fiction books of the 20th century. Michael Behe's book destroying evolution by chance, Darwin's Black Box, came in at #92. I beg differ. With all due respect to  the estimable work loathed and feared by evolutionists, Dr. Spetners' book  is the more significant work. <br /> Dr. Spetner's book literally puts those  who believe in primordial soup-to-man evolution in the same boat as  flat-earthers. He demonstrates that we are not evolving up from a  primordial soup but down from the Garden of Eden. Every iota of evidence  from evolutionary biology fits this pattern of degenerative change. It is  significant that when Dr. Richard Dawkins was recently asked for a single  bit of evidence for innovation - not degeneration or neutral mutation - in  nature, he was literally speechless.	1999-04-17

(If you don't believe me, read chapter one.) What are gripping  descriptions of a drive-by shooting and a bizarre murder of an innocent  scientist doing in a book on the dull topic of ancient fossil remains? What  is this, Indiana Jones Meets James Bond?<br />I had read several of Dr.  Cuozzo's technical and popular papers on the subject of human origins, and  had high expectations for this book. It exceeds them. What I was not  expecting was the ferocity and tactics of evolutionists seeking to suppress  the evidence Dr. Cuozzo presents.<br />This is more than a dry book of  science. It reveals the all too human side of paleoanthropology. When the  famous British scientist, Lord Zuckerman, doubted whether there was much  science to be found in the field of human fossil research he was hinting at  the degree to which evolutionism, philosophic beliefs and assumptions  distort what the public is taught about the evidence.<br />This book is the  stuff of which Kuhnian scientific revolutions are made. A poorer  explanation of the place of Neanderthal in the human family tree has been  replaced by a superior one. Moreover, Cuozzo's findings of degeneration  from Neanderthal to modern man mesh well with everything we know from  empirical evolutionary biology. (C.f. Dr. Lee Spetner's book, Not by  Chance) We are not evolving up from a primordial soup, but rather down from  the Garden of Eden.	1999-04-15

A book of this sort is a must for pastors and leaders in lay evangelism. The strong negative reactions to this sort of work exists  precisely because draws blood from enemies of the faith.  A personal note:  creation evangelism was key to turning my life around. I only wish and pray  the critics would stop ranting so much and be honest with themselves about  their failed worldview. Screaming won't help, kiddies. :-)	1999-04-11
