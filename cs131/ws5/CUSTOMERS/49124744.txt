I was inspired to read this one on the strength of that, but sadly I was not as impressed.<BR>The book is not a bad read - parts of it are gripping, there are some interesting details and descriptions, the plot is unusual and the timescale well-balanced.  However, the word that came to mind when reading it was 'lumpy'.  The gender issues seemed to be shoved into the mouths of the characters in order to Put A Point Across, and this meant their dialogue sometimes seemed unconvincing.  Also, the final twist was not something I expected - good - but that's because it just seemed totally unreal and out of character for the protagonist in question.  <BR>Overall, I'd recommend borrowing this book from your library if you're an Elton fan, or you're interested in gender politics or the army, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.  Not bad, but it needed some fine-tuning.	2003-11-06

After I read Akira Books 2 and 6, I was really looking forward to Book 1 - and when I did read it, I was initially a little disappointed.  <BR>Then I read it again...and loved it.<BR>The thing about the Akira books is that you really have to read them more than once.  The first time you don't engage with the story so much, and parts of it may seem confusing - especially anything involving explosions.  DOn't worry.  Just reread the book, and it all becomes clear.<BR>Another thing I would say is that, if you can, try and get hold of this (or any of the books) in colour.  I've read it in both colour and black-and-white, and the colour version is so much more enjoyable - not to mention it seems to make the story easier to understand.  <BR>I loved the way Otomo links so many characters together and this book does a brilliant job as a beginning to the series.  It's probably my favourite because of all the characterisation woven into the narrative (plus I prefer to read apocalypse stories before the apocalypse has happened...)  I would definitely recommend borrowing this book from your local library, because (a) it's quite different from Western comic books e.g Marvel, yet still enjoyable (b) it's a good story, and (c) it may just convert you to Akira...in which case you have 5 other books to read!	2002-10-23

The only other Akira book I have read is Book 2 (though I am attempting to rectify this situation) so when I came to this book, although I knew the basic storyline and the characters, I still had quite a few gaps.  It didn't matter.  This book was dramatic, powerful and eerie.  The drawings are excellent and it's an amazing finale to the story.  <BR>Part of the reason I was so impressed with this was that although the story is sci-fi/apocalyptic, Otomo has not (unlike quite a few others writing in this genre) neglected character development and complexity.  I don't want to give away the story, but I'll just say a lot of this book made me cry - and not a lot of things do that.<BR>The ending is...ambiguous, and pretty poignant - something about Tokyo rising from the ruins still gives me a lump in my throat.  I disagree with those who say it's a cop-out, or too weird - it suited the book, and it was such a contrast to all that had happened.  <BR>The only reason I took a star off is that sometimes there's too much violence for my taste, and also I found the expulsion of the soldiers at the end sort of weird.  But this may simply be due to my lack of knowledge of the other books.<BR>Overall, I would recommend this book HIGHLY, but do read the others first.  It can only enhance your enjoyment of this one.	2002-09-04

When my brother came bouncing in with this book, my first thought was 'you paid 23 pounds for that?  are you mad?'  I felt no interest in it, but after a bit of persuasion/arm-twisting, I was persuaded to read it.  It didn't seem anything special...but somehow I couldn't stop reading.  Now I'm on a quest to find Book 1, and nothing will stop me...<BR>This book is a good story, well-drawn, and has this strange power to make you keep going back to it to spot more details.  The other Akira book I've read is Book 6, and this one isn't as hard-hitting or powerful, but it's still a good read.  If you've read Book 1, by all means buy this and keep going with the story.  If you haven't, check it out anyway - you might be pleasantly surprised!	2002-09-04

First of all, I'm an over-achieving, teetotal, drug-free, boyfriend-free, slightly plump jobless teenager.  See - some similarities and some differences with Bridget.  I'm also Christian, and I find it very tiresome in chick lit books when the heroine sleeps her way through for no reason other than drunkeness/boredom/mild lust.  <BR>So - I don't know whether I'm \\"meant\\" to like this book, but...you know what?  I do!  I like it because it makes me laugh.  A lot.  Humour, as we all know, is in the eye of the beholder (or something like that) and so whether you like this book depends a lot on whether you find Helen Fielding's humour funny.  <BR>But I do NOT agree that this book is demeaning to women OR that it provides a role model for them.  Okay, no one should choose to try and emulate Bridget (well, I don't think so) - but on the other hand, as a female I didn't feel degraded or stereotyped by this book.  <BR>Other people have criticised this book for saying that you're nothing without a man.  A lot of chick lit books DO do this, but Bridget Jones's Diary isn't one of them.  Trust me, I get very frustrated with books that say this, and this book isn't saying it.  It may be saying, however, that it's nice to have a boyfriend - and where's the problem with that?  Why can't women be allowed to say that they really want to go out with someone?  Why do we have to act like admitting that is degrading?<BR>I recommend this book highly.  If you watched the film and are interested in the book, you may be disappointed as the two versions are somewhat different, but read it anyway!	2002-06-26

The bare bones of the story are original, and you probably won't be able to predict the end.  The description is also pretty good, and Harris switches from Vianne's to Renaud's viewpoints neatly and creates realistic voices for the two characters.<BR>BUT...<BR>This book is prejudiced and shallow.  All the people on Vianne's side are wonderful, kind, sensible and interesting.  All the people on Renaud's side are evil, cruel, vicious, pretentious and/or violent.  Why couldn't we have had some Christians who wanted to worship yet liked chocolate?  Or some chocolate-lovers who were mean?  <BR>I totally lost sympathy for Vianne after she slept with Roux.  This seems a completely unnecessary plot twist.  She had no intention of forming a relationship with him - her only excuse is that now she has another child who will grow up loving \\"life on the road.\\"  Considering she herself, as well as Anouk, has felt lost and rootless sometimes I wonder that she's so confident about bringing another child into such a situation.  <BR>The final conflict with Renaud was also poorly handled.  His motivations and background were set up throughout the book and then at the end he just left, his story unresolved and his beliefs held in contempt.  There was no proper resolution.  Also I felt sorry for him and actually liked him a lot more than Vianne!<BR>I find this book offensive to Christians, prejudiced and one-sided in its views and characters, and overall tiresome.  I don't recommend it unless you are (a) anti-Christian (b) very, very into chocolate or (c) bored.	2002-06-26

I read this book after seeing the film, and so I don't know how much one has been affected by the other.  (Hugh Grant was perfect casting for Will, in my opinion.)  But overall, I felt that this book was humorous and enjoyable, making me laugh out loud at times.  Marcus is written believably and I really enjoyed the chapters from his viewpoint.  <BR>My only gripe is that the end of the book is a little laboured, especially the conversation between Marcus and his dad.  Also Marcus and Ellie's friendship was cute, but didn't always come across as believable.  But these flaws didn't seriously detract from the book and I recommend it as a comfortable and gently humorous read.	2002-06-26

I had nightmares from it and I couldn't stop crying.  So part of me wants to give it 1 star.  But it is actually a very good book.  It really brings home to you the consequences of nuclear war, especially long-term effects like radiation sickness.  I recommend it to people who don't mind a depressing read or who are interested in dystopian novels, but don't read it if you're soft-hearted, or if you're already frightened about the topic.  It will just make you worse.	2002-06-26

I finally got to read this book, and I'm very glad I did.<BR>The main strength of 'Carrie' is definitely its story, which is simple, chilling and painful.  The plot aches with tension as it unfolds, helped by the articles and books interspersed with the dialogue which foreshadow the violent conclusion.  This conclusion is inevitable - things had to play out as they did because of the characters of the people involved - and this is one of the most tragic things about the story.<BR>However, this book isn't perfect.  I can well believe it was King's first novel because although it's a good read, it is in some ways rather amateur.  My main complaint is that I would have appreciated more information about the 'villains' of the piece, that is, Margaret White and Chris Hargensen.  Both of them are truly horrible characters, yet there's little or no explanation of why they are like this.  Margaret seems to have been a fundamentalist from an early age, but we aren't told why, and considering that her religious beliefs go a long way towards making Carrie what she is, more information would not have been out of place.  Chris has even less information, and consequently comes across as pretty two-dimensional.  <BR>The other main problem was that of Sue Snell.  King seems to have been unsure whether she was as important a character as Carrie - although she contributes to the story by asking Tommy to take Carrie to the prom, etc, her own plotline seems a little superfluous.  Her pregnancy fears are unexplored and difficult to empathise with simply because of this.  I would have liked a little more interaction between her and Carrie simply because this would make Carrie's death scene with her less - unexpected.  Sue just doesn't seem to interact with Carrie enough for the story to demand that she be present at Carrie's death.<BR>However, I still recommend this book. If nothing else, it's a good read, and it does make you think about high-school politics and bullying and if you havepicked on someone like Carrie you'd feel pretty guilty.  It's a very dramatic story - the writing is vivid and you can see the scenes play out in your mind - and it lingers in your mind after you've read it.  Partly this is due to the fact that you are both very sorry for Carrie and horrified at what she's done - it's very hard to make a decision about her.  Also the realistic academic books, newspaper articles and courtroom transcriptions add a nice touch because they root the story firmly in the real world (I feel this is especially valuable when talking about telekinesis, as this has often been written about and is very much identified with ghosts and unreal situations.)<BR>Read this book.  You'll be left wishing King had said more about various things, but read it anyway...	2002-06-24

It's dramatic, exciting, and pulls no punches, especially at the end.  My main gripe with this was that I missed Briar, Daja and Tris - one of the most interesting bits of the original CoM series was the interaction between the four very different children.  Pasco was an average character, but didn't interest me as much as Briar does.  This is one of the best Tamora books for action, but if you want character, you might want to try something else.	2002-04-22

I originally thought it would be boring, but I was totally wrong!  It's dramatic, tension-filled, and gives you a lot to think about, even if you're not a religious person.  The last scene is especially powerful.  Admittedly, when reading the play, some of the comic scenes come across as rather annoying - they really need to be seen on a stage - but it doesn't harm the book to any great degree.  I would have appreciated less comedy, but I still recommend this play.	2002-04-10

Kel doesn't have a consistent enemy to fight against...Joren crops up occasionally during the book and Kel has him taken off her hands by outside means.  Many of the issues in the book (i.e sexism, class divide, sex) are cliched and tell me nothing new.  Kel doesn't have half as many things to struggle against (unlike Alanna) and her character isn't interesting enough to sustain my interest.  Oh, and the gift giver thing was boring.  Everyone I knew thought it was ALanna, and it was.  Wow.  Sorry, but this book is far too issues-driven.  I hope Lady Knight will be better!  Oh, but I did like the way Kel had several different crushes to contend with, the trial was good, and I liked the way she confronted the Chamber as it built up to her final confrontation with it.	2001-11-27

King managed to keep me interested in all the characters and I was really desperate to know what was going to happen to them.  However, I took one star off for the sickening description (the second electric chair scene) and one off for the ending, which, I'm sorry to say, was really disappointing.  After all that story, all the narrator could say was 'Life sucks.'  That's it?  That's all the whole book was about?  Life's a - uh - lady dog - and then you die?  Sorry, but King really flunked out on the ending.  However, the rest of it was great and I'd recommend it despite the ending because it challenges your perceptions on justice, hell, death and execution, and because it's full of feeling.  It's just such a pity King didn't carry the brilliance all the way through.	2001-10-01

Feet Of Clay and The Fifth Elephant have more interesting mysteries and Men At Arms and Guards! Guards! have more interesting character development.  I don't know, maybe it's all the sand, but Jingo has always seemed a little unsatisfying.  But I reckon that that's because I am comparing it to the other Guards books - there's still a lot of good moments and it's worth a read.	2001-04-20

The descriptions of the theatre are eerie and ring very true, the jokes seemed more natural - although I still don't get the plot properly and Agnes still seems a rather forced character.  Also, I think I missed out on a lot of the humour because I haven't seen Phantom Of The Opera.  Worth a read, but not the best Pratchett book.	2001-04-20

Possibly the darkest Pratchett novel, with Teatime being, as some sensible person a few reviews down wrote, truly repulsive.  But even though parts of the book are black as black can be, others still crack me up, like the scenes with the wizards, or Death's 'jolly' laugh.  But I don't rate it as high as some others because although it's a brilliant book, it can be a bit too unsettling.  I mean, with the rain lashing against the window, the thunder rolling, the lights flickering etc etc...I think I'd rather stick with the guards than read Hogfather.

I think that this book is well-written, with some very good new characters i.e Lalasa and Owen.  Some of the situations are great esp. the Balor's Needle scene at the end.  However I think that Kel is in a way too mature for eleven and the story, although enjoyable, is never as gripping as Alanna's.  I think there should be more life-threatening situations - even when Kel fights the bandits you know she's going to win.  But Ms Pierce handles the Lord Wyldon situation very well and there's nothing seriously wrong with the book...	2000-12-06

The book also has avoided the traps of other historical fiction by presenting the 12th century as not totally grim - there is fun and enjoyment as well. There is some beautiful description as well.  As to complaints that Birdy is unrealistic, how do we know there weren't other maidens in that time who wished to escape from their lives.

I was pleased that  the book was so long as I read real quick and it was nice to have something  I could enjoy for more than a morning.  Rowling is letting the characters  grow up without removing their appeal and she's letting puberty come in  without it taking over the whole story.  The only thing is that this book  depresses me if I read it to the end as there is no reassurance that  everything will be OK.  Maybe some kids will find it a bit scary, I don't  know.  As to the people who say that magic in the books is bad...well I  know the Bible doesn't like magic, but it doesn't like murder either and  the paper has stuff on that all the time.

The thing is,  books 3 and 4 have so many revelations about various people's pasts,  presents and futures that you can read and reread them loads of times, but  book 2 doesn't have half as many.  Also it doesn't have many new characters  - Lockhart is ok but he gets tiresome, and the others - Ginny, Aragog, Tom  Riddle etc - just don't have as much depth and interest as those in the  next 2 books, Sirius and Moody, for instance.
