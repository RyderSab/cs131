Thompson takes us across America in search of love, success and a few extra bucks.<br /><br />The underlying tale is how Jim tried to come to grips with his relationship with his father and himself.  Luck always intervenes -- sometimes Good and sometimes Bad.  As one of the kings of the character novels, Thompson does a great job on himself and his family and friends.<br /><br />This is a classic, sometimes funny, sometimes uplifting, sometimes sad but always real.<br /><br />It is also a great history of the America of the 1930s, 40s and 50s.<br /><br />-Mike	2005-01-15

Reading the reviews here, I am surprised at how critical people can be with what is admittedly a NOVEL, not an intended biography.<br /><br />The people here who feel the need to point out that it IS a novel seem to want to rate it lower, as if it somehow degrades the subject.<br /><br />I would think a novel would be the most appropriate way to capture Plath's life.<br /><br />I was not a real student of Plath when I read this.  I actually received it as a gift.  But I read it immediately and I must say I was very moved by the story.<br /><br />Had this been a novel with no connection to real people it might not have been so moving.  But as a story of how things Might have been or what Plath May have felt it seems to open up the pain and tragedy of the story.<br /><br />This work is definitely one sided.  For the Plath beginner, it made me choose sides concerning Hughes and Plath's mother.  It is probably too powerful as a novel in that sense.<br /><br />But as a novel, it allowed Moses to go where she otherwise couldn't have gone.  I applaud her for a tremendous first novel that moved me and interested me in a subject I had avoided until then.  It succeeded in making me realize the highs and lows of a life gone astray.  I closed the book both angry FOR Plath and angry AT Plath.  But I was also grateful to Moses for giving me something accessible to approach Plath as a person without losing her in her work.<br /><br />I would recommend this for anyone just starting to examine Plath and her works.  Certainly this is an excellent vehicle to examine the works, the person and even as a case study of someone who can never quite live up to their own goals of perfection and achievement even in the face of success.<br /><br />-Mike	2005-01-15

All of his work is fascinating, moving and accessible.  The Killer Inside Me reads more like a modern day news story than a fifty year old thriller.<br /><br />Thompson patiently builds the story and sets the stage in the first two thirds of the book and then after he has crafted the foundation of the twisted mind, begins to spin the story.<br /><br />This is a classic thriller and a classic character.  Believable and still thrilling after all these years.  And true to form of Thompson, you don't know how it ends until you turn the last page.<br /><br />Chilling, believable and gripping -- and good clean psychotic fun.<br /><br />Mike	2005-01-15

At once a guide book on his beliefs and how he transformed himself from \\"bookish\\" into a physical specimen.  But you can see his troubled focus shift from the internal Mishima to the external Mishima.<br /><br />To me this is an explanation of something even Mishima doesnt understand.  More of a catharsis of the self than a clearly defined work.<br /><br />Many of the descriptions of Mishima's internal evaluations sound almost as if he was dealing with aspects of Borderline Personality Disorder.  Which would make his style of death even more ironic and symbolic.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is true Mishima -- makes us think and examine ourselves even as he talks of himself.<br /><br />Any work by Mishima is worth reading and adding to your collection.  It took me years to find a copy, now it is available for everyone -- I wouldn't hesitate to buy or read.<br /><br />-Mike	2005-01-15

Even today, Central Asia is a mystery to most people in the US.  \\"Like Hidden Fire\\" is a great place to start to learn how complex the world is and why the peoples of the Middle East and Central Asia might have just a little mistrust of the West and its motives.<br /><br />The story is the down and dirty of the German efforts to unseat the British Empire leading up to and during the First World War.  It includes efforts to create a Holy War against the British and champion the Kaiser as a \\"Defender of the Faith\\" (the Faith in question being Islam, of course).<br /><br />The trail takes us from intrigue to counter intrigue through Turkey, Iran and into Central Asia where then, as today, the Westerners are more pawns in the local struggles than vice versa.<br /><br />This is totally relevent to today both in understanding the local issues as well as how shallow the West is in dealing with the people and culture of the Middle East and Central Asia.<br /><br />The work is as vast and complex as the region and the people it covers.  Set some time aside to read it and don't be surprised if you find yourself exploring the people, places and other works that are cited in the book.<br /><br />-Mike	2005-01-15

I don't know how Parks ever came up with the basis for this book, but the characters are real and fun.<br /><br />Even better is the style.  The characters tell the story in their own words and we get to hear everyone's thoughts about everyone else.  It is a fun look at how people communicate and don't communicate and how simple events in our lives -- even casual remarks -- can change the way people think and feel for years.<br /><br />I read this book in Baghdad and had to email and call home with excerpts to share.  This is a tremendous personification through the eyes and words of simple -- yet complex folk.<br /><br />It is also a tale about love and sacrifice and how some people place their family above even their own wishes and desires, while they face their fears that they think can threaten their very happiness.<br /><br />I can't equate the picture of the author with the depth of the lessons and the quality of this book.<br /><br />There are a lot of frank thoughts and comments here dealing with the issues of love, sex, communication, racism and how we deal with each other.  So be warned up front.  If you are used to the standard novel of third person storytelling and linear chapters then you are in for a lesson in storytelling.  But stick it out, in the end you will like the style.<br /><br />It is a kind of \\"Butterfield 8\\" with a southern sharecropper touch.<br /><br />Thanks Suzan<br /><br />-Mike	2005-01-15

I wasn't really surprised to see that if you want a copy of this book from Amazon, you'll need to shell out 100 dollars for a soft copy in good condition.  (No, I wont sell you mine).<br /><br />Maybe Yale university should rectify the situation and re-print an edition of this excellent social study of revolutionary Iran.<br /><br />There is a reason why the US has a failed policy with Iran.  We never understood Iran or Iranians.  We haven't taken the time in the last 100 years to study and get to know the beautiful, unique and yet complex people of Iran.<br /><br />This book probably isn't a good starting place.  (I recommend \\"The Mantle of the Prophet\\" by Mottahedeh -- if available).  But it certainly cannot be beat as far as the depth of scholarly analysis contained within.  My copy has about 25 dog eared pages out of the 307 in the book.  The notes and bibliography are as vital as the book itself.<br /><br />The book chronicles background on the Pahlavis and the Revolution itself.  It then goes back and examines the Mojahedin movement and the rise of the secular revolution and the clerical revolution in Iran.  It finally looks at how and why the clerics won out.<br /><br />Today's Iran is still a political battleground between the secularist and the clerics.  The US has no real formula for how to deal with either side in Iran because our leaders can't seem to step back from 1979 and look at things rationally.<br /><br />This work can help understand the internal struggles within Iran.  Contrary to our government's view that the US is central to all peoples' thoughts and decisions, this is one book that will help you see the how and why Iranians make decisions that affect their world view for themselves.<br /><br />Maybe some day, the important works of political analysis will go back into availability.<br /><br />-Mike	2005-01-15

Sure there was the common theme of motorcycling, the part of the conversation I could relate too.  But really, that was the setting around which she wove a great personal tale.  Overcoming -- not fear -- but deep anxiety.  I see reviews written that this is anti man or other strange interpretations.  I think if you read closely she lays out her own issues early in the book.  The book is her journey to overcome those.  She learns about herself -- the good and the bad -- and about people.<br /><br />I think it is a fun, interesting adventure.  I recommend it often and buy copies for my friends.	2004-10-20

Funny how whenever you write something that even touches the edge of religion, the zealots come out.<br />This is NOT a story about the Mountain Meadow Massacre, though the incident and its characters figure prominently.  This is NOT a story about merits or evils of Mormonism, though most of the characters are mormon and deal with their beliefs. Instead Freeman forces us to look at how humans have to come to grips with the complexities of belief and the realities of harsh everyday life.<br />This is a story centered around a fictionalization of part of the life of John D Lee.  Executed for his role in the massacre.  But even more than that, it is centrally, a story about women, and how they love.<br />Emma, the devoted wife who was in love with Lee when he took her as his 8th (well 17th) wife.  How she dealt with the love and desire for a man she could not possess for herself but who totally possessed her.  How she was bound more to the land and the religion by the man than the other way around.<br />Ann, who at thirteen married Lee for complex reasons but in the end, was taken by his personality and her own curiosity, shall we say.  But who was tormented more by the man whom she lost belief in and the religion she never believed in but was wary of.  Lee's memory amd her mixed feelings for him dogged her life even when she had left.  Moreso, maybe.<br />Rachel, who in the end, realized that she was devoted to Lee for what he could promise her in the next life.  An eternity next to the sister she idolized and loved.  But Rachel's devotion may appear more as love than the love of the others.<br />There was a certain fascination in this book for me.  It is well done and I literally read it in two days almost straight through.  The characters are real and their interactions, relationships and differences are real too.  Even down to the point where you wonder what private characterizations one character has for the next is based on truth or an unadmitted jealously.<br />Each part is told by one of the woman and each part represents their personality and fate.  Emma's is rich and boisterous and hopeful.  Ann's is meandering, lost, with moments of warmth and richness.  Rachel's is cold, empty and barren with promises of hard times even among the good.<br />This is very well written and very well researched.  It is a small insight to what mormonism was under the eye of Smith and Young while it was still a living entity.  It is also a beautiful insight to some of the most harsh and spectacular places on earth.  Finally it is an insight into how women view love and even men.  Maybe in the end, that is what I was reading for -- to find a little insight into myself.<br />If you find it at the yard sale, pick it up, you will read it that night.n truth or an unadmitted jealously.<br />Each part is told by one of the woman and each part represents their personality and fate.

This is a story of a young combat veteran for whom the superficial luxuries of the world no longer have value.  He must decide if his life was worth saving and why.  What he discovers isn't the \\"Meaning of Life\\" or any religious ecstasy -- in fact, he arrives closer to the beginning than he thinks.  But he goes with an appreciation for life and lives.<br />I tried to be a Somerset Maugham fan but for me, this is far and away his best work.

References to \\"God\\" and \\"Christ\\" or Jesus are probably not appropriate translations.<br /><br />While I do not doubt that Hafez probably reached a point where he transcended common distinctions between religions, he was a Muslim and there are issues about using \\"God\\" as a translation for Allah and references to Jesus as a diety run against the current of monotheism.<br /><br />There is no need to present the poems in a way that would make them seem Christian.  Most Christians can appreciate them for what they are as songs to Allah.  Just as anyone can appreciate the beauty of the Psalms or even Shakespeare's sonnets.<br /><br />Dont get me wrong, I do enjoy Ladinsky's work and it does persent Hafez in an attractive, accessible manner.  I just feel that presenting them with the Christian slant is distracting where it needn't be.<br /><br />Certainly you should add this to your collection especially for the casual enjoyer.  For serious access to Hafez, this should be supplemented with more serious works.	2004-01-17

Neither is accurate.\\"<br /><br />This book should be required reading for all Western heads of state, attorneys general, members of congress and parliament, AND journalists.<br /><br />The authors' outlook is counter to decades of American posturing and shows how current policies to \\"contain\\" the Shi'a in the region by the US and allies is a downward spiral and the exact opposite of what needs to happen if there is to be stability for all in the region.<br /><br />This is an excellent discription of of how the Arab Shi'a have been marginalized in the Arab world, including those countries such as Iraq and Bahrain where they represent the confessional majority.  The authors go on to attack western fears of Iranian led Shi'a revolution in the Arab world by delving into the religious, social and cultural differences between the Persian Shi'a and the Arab Shi'a and how the Arabs have historically in each country chosen race and nationality over sectarian alliances when push came to shove.<br /><br />More shocking, as they review the conditions of the Shi'a in each country where they make up significant parts of the population, is the treatment of the Shi'a by fellow Muslims and Arabs.  Especially in those cases where they represent a numerical minority.  In those places the Shi'a are oppressed but cannot claim minority status, even though their own Shi'a sect may be marginalized or even unrecognized by the Sunni majority.<br /><br />They go on to describe how this marginalization is a far greater threat to regional stability and the West's image in the region.  The question is whether the Western countries can turn a blind eye to the treatment of the Shi'a and still tout themselves as focused on Democracy and Human Rights. This loss of \\"face\\" and continued support of oppressive regimes is a far greater threat than the threat of Iranian efforts to purposely destabilize regimes and the region.  Although in the end, the oppressed may look anywhere for answers.<br /><br />Finally, this book is extremely relevant in today's world even though it was written when Sadaam still controlled Iraq.  Iraq is central to Shi'a culture and history.  Iraq could easily once again by pass Iran as the center of influence of the world's Shi'a.  More importantly will be the Iraqi influence on the Arab Shi'a in Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Syria and Lebanon.<br /><br />America and the West stand at a crossroad of being the actors who help the Shi'a majorities to achieve their just share and the Shi'a minorities to achieve justice.<br /><br />As Fuller and Francke say:<br /><br />\\"... an Iraq that that does not permit the Shi'a to play the role accorded to them by their demographic majority is doomed to failure, schism and manipulation by outside forces, especially Iran.  Saudi and Kuwaiti objections to the establishment of democratic processes in Iraq should be ignored\\"<br /><br />Funny, we've been hearing the opposite for over 20 years.hough in the end, the oppressed may look anywhere for answers.

Ali Rahnema's biography is probably a textbook example of how to write biography.<br />Dr Rahnema has given us an example of objective writing.  He offers insights into the complex life, actions and writings of Shariati while never burdening us with judgement or synthesizing the matter for us.  He lays the story out and let's us draw our own judgements.  Rahnema gives us facts from the sources and doesn't draw conclusions or lead us to a thesis.  He let's us draw our own.<br />The story is divided into three parts - the young Shariati at odds with his intelligence finding a haven in poetry.  He then takes up the struggle between classical poetry and modern poetry.  Rahnema uses this to prepare us for the last third of the book where Shariati carves out a modernist theology of Shia Islam in the face of the classical and institutionalized system.  In the middle we learn of his education and exposure to the post war critical thinkers in Paris.  Rahnema takes us through Shariati's complex synthesis of Economic theory, political theory, liberation theology, Sunni and Shia thought and how Shariati wove these sometimes with his own fictive additions to arrive at a living Shia ism which was definitely at odds with the traditional interpretations.  Shariati found himself trying to change Shia thoughts and beliefs into a dynamic revolutionary system -- not anti western, but true to Iranian culture and history and the problems of Iran, not regurgitated problems of the West.  His was definitely an Iranian centric view of the world, but taking from and using Eastern and Western thought where it was appropriate.<br />To Rahnema's credit he never bothers us with his judgement or critique of Shariati's work.  He presents a man whose thoughts are complex and who often revised his own thinking.  He presented the facts as he could of Shariati's concessions to SAVAK and his role as one of the flames of the Revolution.  But through all this we see a man who was often frustrating to his supporters and critics and yet true to himself, even as his ideas may have evolved.<br />This isn't a quick read but it will definitely enlighten you and fuel your desire to go further with Shariati and inner complexities of Iran, the Shia themselves, Sufism and ideological transition and revolt.<br />Bravo *****f the flames of the Revolution.

There were mixed reviews and the general tone of the negative reviews were that the book was superficial or possibly inaccurate.  Well I bought the book in spite of those warnings.  I am very glad I did.  To begin with Prose has done an outstanding job of weaving together 9 separate and unique lives.  She does not claim to have written the definitive work on artistic influence or motivation.  She did not claim to corner the market on thoughts of Eros and Art.  What she did was describe nine woman and the artists they inspired.  It was clear from her references and asides that she had done research on far more than these women.  She freely borrowed from other muses and interests in other relationships and wove together not only nine separate stories but craftily connected them into a thread that takes us from the most simple and reticent muse -- Alice Liddell to a modern woman artist whose own identity and influence is lost in the artist and his in hers, not always in a positive way -- Yoko Ono.  I found that Prose walks briskly through each life but also is telling us a greater story.  A story of feminine influence and the evolving way women have been viewed as muses, lovers, artists and people.  Often I stopped to examine or reexamine an artist or their work.  As Prose opens a new semiotic eye on a work, she looks not from the reader's perspective of the work, but from the artist's perspective and intent.  Not so much to say what the artist was trying to describe to the viewer, but why he was creating it at all.  I can't say if Prose' work is accurate or inaccurate.  I dont know enough of these lives.  I do know that I have a new perspective on some of the artists and a desire to learn more of these women and their influence.  Buy it and read it.	2003-09-14

When I read the notes, I wanted it to be a biography, not fiction, well I must not have read close enough.  Because it is as real as it is troubling and hilarious.  Augusten Burrough's boyhood unraveled for all to see.  I was impressed by not only the story, which is a classic, but Burroughs style and pacing.  For all the heavy topics, he seems to be able to write it as he experienced it -- a troubled maybe, but seemingly optimistic, boy.  From the beginning you identify with Burroughs.  He brings out those generic memories long forgotten, like waiting for dad to get home and hearing the gravel pop under the wheels of the tires.  But within that you start to sense a pattern of disturbance.  And even if you can't identify with his fixation for shiny objects and desire to market hair products, or play a doctor on TV.  You can identify with the fear and uncertainty of a young boy growing up without the normal anchors and boundaries.  Uncertain about himself, his future and his family.  This is a heroic work.  It is sad and painful at times but up beat and uplfiting in the end.  It is not without uncertainty and sorrow, but peppered also with humor and insight.  In short it is a damn good slice of a boy's life.<br /><br />COMMENT FROM 2011:  8 years after reading this book, I still reference some of Burrough's insights.  This is more than a mere novel, it is a lesson in understanding how useless labels are and how complex people really can be.  An important work	2003-09-14

I believe it would make a decent book for beginners, but some background in Arabic would be helpful. For those proficient in another Arabic dialect who want to learn Iraqi it does tend to be a little basic, but it still gives you a decent grasp of the basic structure of Iraqi Arabic.

I had heard of Rankin in passing but I watched an interview with him in July.  I had to give him a try.  Knots and Crosses shows that it is his first major work.  There are some flaws to the story and the flow, especially in the beginning.  But at some point, it grabs you and won't let go.  I had to read 2/3 of the book today because I was interested in seeing where the plot twists.<br />While K&amp;C may not be much more than basically formulaic on many levels, I enjoyed the realism of the characters.  Certainly, in a shorter work, it is difficult to establish too much complexity or red herrings.  I enjoyed the idea that the main character was solving the crime more by accident than by effort.  As a novel outside the genre, I think it is a very worthy effort at combining characterization and plot.  For those of you who view it as a not too clever example of the genre, maybe you should read something else for a while and freshen up.<br />Very much worth the money, esp if you intend to read the later books.<br />Great effort Ian and much fun!<br />-Mike	2001-12-24

It begins with a 217 page disassembly of &quot;Sarrasine&quot;.  He explores not only how the work is assembled but almost each and every word and phrase.  Appendix I is the 33 page original text of the novella in full. Appendix II is the Sequence of Actions where every action is broken down and cross referenced with its lexial position in the novella.  Appendix III is the Summary of the Contents of the whole lecture itself.<br />The whole work boils down to an understanding of the novella in the same sense of understanding why a painter chose a certain color to depict a tree in the background as it relates to the whole work.<br />Very facinating and in no sense trivial -- but, at the same time remarkably entertaining and readable.<br />This is THE place to begin a serious study of literature or semiotics.<br />-Mike	2001-11-26

I can no longer wash my hands and not think of rain and mountain streams.<br />This is an incredible memoir and philosophical discussion.  Thich uses the memoir as a vehicle to teach his philosophy.  But in that you can still sense the pain of loss, the pain and frustration of rejection by his country and his abandonment.  But it is also a hopeful piece.  He does not let the external struggle defeat his soul and his personal peace.  He accepts wars and destruction as things he must try to change but must not allow to change him.<br />The beauty of this book is its honesty.  Thich's religion is attractive as a portrait of his individual testimony and light.<br />There is also a history in the story.  A struggle of a simple man and a patriot.  A patriot who perhaps lost the war for now.<br />Also a man who understands that thought and love and peace are separate from the boundaries of politics and culture.  He may have lost his war at home, but he certainly won a larger war.<br />-Mike	2001-11-24

But do him a favor DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.  &quot;Red Dragon/Manhunter&quot;, &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; were classics -- both book and movie.  The 1st 1/2 of Hannibal was looking good with plot twists and characters galore.  At some point, I think Harris either sold out or got bored.<br />In his effort to explain the tragedy of Hannibal Lector, Harris tried to make him a hero whilst still carrying fatal and unredeemable flaws.  It doesn't work.  I wanted to throw the book across the room when I finished.<br />Please Thom, explain to us what you did here.<br />-Mike	2001-11-24
US	52667719	RXHW1NNXXPCM6	1561005878	579488546	The Razor's Edge	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Just a man searching	While some rate the quality of the religious or philisophical references of this book, that really isn't the soul of the story.  This is a story of a young combat veteran for whom the superficial luxuries of the world no longer have value.  He must decide if his life was worth saving and why.  What he discovers isn't the &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; or any religious ecstasy -- in fact, he arrives closer to the beginning than he thinks.  But he goes with an appreciation for life and lives.<br />I tried to be a Somerset Maugham fan but for me, this is far and away his best work. The characters are reallistically shallow, or lost, or gritty -- as the case may be.  I reread this every couple of years just to remind myself of what a good story really sounds like.<br />-Mike	2001-11-24

An incomplete struggle to understand himself, his family and his two countries.  In America, Pham finds himself not quite American.  Not quite understood, nor understanding.  It is a struggle that played itself out for his sister.  He thinks the answer is back in Vietnam from which he and his family escaped after the fall of Saigon.<br />In Vietnam, he finds that he does not understand the Vietnamese, nor do they understand him or his motives.  His journey to Vietnam is rewarding but not totally satisfying -- raising as many questions as answered.<br />On top of all of this, Catfish and Mandala is a facinating travelogue.  A bicycle trip across a country, time and society.<br />Leaves you longing to give Andrew a hug and pat on the back.<br />-Mike	2001-11-24

It is excellent to get conversational/survival skills up to speed in a short time.  It is also good to get an ear for certain dialects and see their quirks.<br />I already had experience with Arabic before using this.  Regardless, I would warn that it is ESSENTIAL that you acquire BOTH the book and the cassette.  I can't see either as useful separately.  The marketing for this, especially on the web, is fairly vague since they are available as a set and as casette and book separately.<br />There is no reason why this wouldn't be a good gateway for a person to learn aural arabic skills.  The book is done entirely in transliterated latin text -- no Arabic script.  And it works fairly well, especially if all you want to do is get around in Egyptian.<br />I recommend this set.  If you have a limited budget, this set and a Lonely Plant or Rough Guide Egyptian phase book would get you pretty far.  ...	2001-06-14

If you can find one -- new or used -- BUY IT.<br />This is without a doubt a classic book on computers and programming but, moreso, it is a model for how to write introductory guides.  If they had followed this model long ago, we'd all be better off.<br />Forget &quot;The Idiot's Guide to ...&quot;  Socha respects his readers but he still walks them carefully through what is an intimidating process of assembly language programming -- while having a bit of fun.<br />I will find a copy somewhere tonight on the web and buy it.

I only just picked it up and started it a second time.  This time however, I ploughed right through it.  It is tremendous to remind ourselves in this time some of the REAL causes of Middle East conflict.  Remind ourselves that much of the current problems were laid between 1914 and 1930.  This is a frustrating work because you can see the root of so many problems and you have to bear through the story knowing how it ends, or continues as it were.<br />The root causes of the Middle East conflicts are not ancient, they are fairly recent.  Much of them based on the Western systems \\"inflicted\\" on them during the times described here in Fromkin's book.<br />Fromkin has an easy style and his research and study cover an exceptional breadth.  Rather than looking at certain isolated instances, he throws up a mosaic of the whole region and how it intertwines with the West and the East.<br />If you never understood what the Ottoman Empire was or why the Middle East seems so complex, pick up this book.	2000-11-13

If you're a budding intermediate level student of Arabic, you must have this.  I use this as a self study course to reinforce my reading foundations, vocabulary and current idomatic useage.  I waited MONTHS for the tapes, but they are essential now that they are universally available.<br />This book is useful for self study, group study or with a (preferably) educated native instructor/tutor.  There is also a fine teacher's supplement.<br />Overall this is a tremendous value.  The soft cover and the tapes together are less than 50.00 and there is a mountain of challenging material.<br />Not to mention a good deal of pragmatic reading in geography, culture and social studies.  Each chapter is broken down into the same exercises from reading to classical texts to listening.  The classical texts are dealt with deliberately, not haphazardly.  The whole thing is, in fact, deliberate and well thought out.<br />Shouldn't disappoint...	2000-11-13

Like always, about half way through Bukowski has us hanging our heads and shaking them in amazement.  I'm not sure what he left out of this novel, but it wasn't much.  Bukowski throws in the  kitchen sink and then ties it all together.  Bukowski shows us life from  the crud under our fingernails to analysing our vomit and on to internal  motivations.  The whole time he keeps the story line going.  Bukowski is  really up against the whole world in this one, and then some to include  space aliens and the un dead.  Luckily for him he's just unsavoury enough  that no one really wants him spending eternity with them. In the end  Bukowski will have you rooting for the good guy and wishing fatal accidents  on his adversaries. Save plenty of hot water because you'll want a bath  after this one. -Mike	1999-12-26

I love Bukowski, but this is the real thing.  It hangs in there.  Fante turns the camera on the main character while the others are  mere foils for deeper probing. Whereas Bukowski builds a picture of society  around his characters, Fante here truly explores values and value through  one man's eyes.  If you pick this book up and hate it, read it anyway.  If  you don't understand it, struggle through.  If the only other book you've  read is the bible, read this.  Feel free to be offended, feel rejection and  dejection.  If you love Bukowski, you'll really like this.  If you don't  love Buk, that's okay too because Fante keeps the story moving without  taking us all the way into the gutter. -Mike	1999-12-26

Adams' book is not so much a book about Vietnam as a chronical of what happens when intelligence units and agencies report what the commanders WANT to hear.  The CIA and J2 of MACV in Adams' book become pawns in the  politics of Vietnam.  They ignored facts and basic tenents of intelligence  reporting.  The agencies feared reaction to the facts and its possible  effect on public sentiment to US involvement.  Because of that they  purposely, according to Adams, reported and knowingly maintained false  information.<br />Even more disturbing are Adams' insights into the CIA of the  middle and late Sixties.  Though deeply entrenched in war in Vietnam, they  seemed to take an overall cavalier approach to the mission.  Adams notes  after Tet-1968 there were &quot;considerably less than 6&quot; CIA agent  handlers in Vietnam who spoke vietnamese.  These same case officers  received a grand total of 2 hours orientation on Vietnam and their enemy  prior to assignment.<br />This book is a MUST read for intelligence personnel,  policy makers and anyone who wants to  learn how, the hard way, not to run  an intelligence organization.	1999-06-22

Ashtiany divides the work into topic  such as political, business, etc., and then delves into the more common  vocabulary and useage tricks.  This greatly eases the transition from  academic study to practical, intermediate use.  Government and defense  users will find this very useful in increasing proficiency and  comprehension.	1998-09-18
