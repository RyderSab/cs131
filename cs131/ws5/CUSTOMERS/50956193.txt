But when the three networks news programs had that power, they abused it. Two decades ago Peter Jennings gave an interview in which he said that his job was not merely to present the news but also to interpret it. <br /> <br />What if you don't like the way a newscaster is interpreting the news, yet many millions watch that newscaster? <br /> <br />Nowadays nightly network news audiences have dropped to the point where it doesn't matter how a network news anchor interprets the news, because the audiences are small.  <br /> <br />The author mentions favorably how Walter Cronkite had a big impact when he announced that the US was in a quagmire in Vietnam. But that was an opinion, not news.  <br /> <br />The author is correct that the country is worse off for people not following the news. But the country is better off for the demise of those dinosaurs, the half hour network news broadcast and the weekly newsmagazine.	2005-06-25

There are some weaknesses in this work, but even so I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />The book provides alternate definitions of what is a blog. A  useful one is that a blog is a chronologically ordered, regularly updated website that is primarily the work of one person and contains a high number of regularly updated, chronologically ordered links to other sites. The links and the other ordered chronological material are often contained within the same short piece of micro-content.  <br /> <br />I am not sure what micro-content is. The phrase pops up in the book but is not explained. <br /> <br />We've Got Blog focuses on diaristic blogs or blogs in which the blogger blogs about whatever is of interest or about a very broad topic. But there are many tightly focused blogs. (Mine is for liberals who oppose a certain nominally-Democratic politician and  his machine in a single congressional district. How is that for narrowcasting?) <br /> <br />The book rarely discusses topics of specific relevance to single issue blogs. It devotes great space to people who have diaristic blogs and want to have other diaristic bloggers like them and link to them. For single point-of-focus blogs this concept is irrelevant. Often we are the only blog dealing with a subject and there would be no one to link to us even if we cared for them to do so. <br /> <br />Some of the material in this book is already dated. The book describes the robotwisdom.com blog, but when I visited it I got the impression that it has not been updated for a year. When some of these essays were written Google was not the overpowering presence that it is today. It would have been nice to see some discussion of how Google placement affects blog. <br /> <br />But the proof of the pudding is in theeating. Within 24 hours of purchasing this fairly thin volume I had read it in its entirety, and for me that is the highest praise that a book can earn. <br /> <br /> <br />Jonathan Mark <br />Blogmaster <br />GoodbyeJim.com	2004-11-28

The language is often stilted or archaic. <br /> <br />However, I sense that these translations may be truer to the original than Robert Bly's. Indeed, reading these helped me to understand that some language that I thought was Kabir's was actually Bly's. For instance, I was always impressed with the line in Bly's translation that refers to a place \\"where those who live are not afraid to die.\\" <br /> <br />But in Tagore's translation, that same reference was something to the effect of a place where there is no fear of death. The contrast between the living and the dead was not Kabir's but Bly's. <br /> <br />If I could only read one translation I would read Bly's. But why read only one?	2004-09-21

Britons are as oppressed at the end of the book as they are at the beginning. <br /> <br />Occasionally this author lets us know his opposition to the recent US and UK led war against Saddam, and possibly, to other US policies in the Mideast.

Tolkien drove home the point that Beowulf was a masterpiece, and that has been the general consensus ever since.  <br /> <br />That being said, the anthology features the big names in Beowulf criticism, including Kemp Malone and E. Talbot Donaldson. This thin volume is definitely worth the time spent reading it.  <br /> <br />When I first started reading this book I was a complete Beowulf neophyte, and I didn't understand what they were discussing. I put the book down and returned to it several years of Beowulf study later.  <br /> <br />I recommend that people read and reread Beowulf several times before reading this anthology of criticism. Or at least that they return to this anthology again after becoming familiar with the sections and structure of Beowulf.	2004-09-11

I got this book because it is short and inexpensive, thus providing me with the needed background without a large investment in time or money. <br /> <br />The book was written in Danish and translated into English a century ago. Its strong point is the succinct summaries of the Norse myths. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there is at least one curious omission. The book refers to the death of Baldur, but makes no reference to the story of how Baldur died, in a William Tell type archery contest.  <br /> <br />Another strange feature is that its summary of Beowulf, which the author considered to be a Norse myth, is incorrect. Contrary to this book's claim, Beowulf did NOT cut off Grendl's arm with a sword. On the contrary, Beowulf said that he would not use a sword because Grendl did not, and pulled Grendl's arm out of its socket. <br /> <br />It turned out that Grendl was enchanted and so impervious to swords.	2004-09-08

It is a prose translation, so Donaldson did not need to select words based on their sounds and could get the meaning more accurately.<br />The exactness of the translation makes this language sound archaic. <br />The footnotes are quite helpful, especially when going through the difficult passages at the start of the Dragon story that describe the wars of the Swedish succession.<br />Read this translation and then try a poetic translation such as Heaney's.	2003-06-17

The book's strongest point is its illustrations: paintings of what artists thought the Vikings looked like; maps; and photos of Viking artifacts, ruins and habitats.<br />The last portion of the book consists of excerpts from writings by or about the Norsemen.<br />The text suffers slightly by being a translation. It implies that Weland the Smith was a real person. I doubt that the author originally intended to give that impression.<br />I noticed a slight error at one point in the book.

I actually had to look up Kant in other books in order to understand somewhat Critchley's description of his work.<br />Critchley then started talking about the German Idealists, and he does not define what an Idealist is. He assumes the reader knows already.<br />Even a beginner can learn from this book, but it is not an introductory text. It is a discussion of a relatively arcane professional dispute among philosophers, and about the generally different focus of philosophy in Continental Europe as opposed to the English-speaking world.<br />The sections on Heidegger were incomprehensible to me. Towards the end Critchley talks about Popper and positivism and it was like a breath of fresh air. Finally a simple subject that seemed comprehensible and meaningful!<br />I will read other books by this author, but if I were to approach this book again I would first read more about Kant, the Idealists and even that Nazi Heidegger (Critchley is quite upfront about this aspect of Heidegger.)<br />Here is a question: If Heidegger does not claim to be presenting scientific truth then why should I want to learn about his ideas? Heidegger the man was a lowlife and a Nazi. Whatever benefits one might get from his philosophy, it is not likely to make one a better person.<br />Carnap on the other hand was great and opposed the Nazis.	2003-03-29

Am I a better person? I do not know. Did the ancient Greeks tell me anything I did not know already? Maybe not.<br />Yet I think Prof. Annas might say, along with the ancient Greeks, that philosophy is worthwhile even if we derive no benefit from it at all. This is a book about those who practiced philosophy for its own sake.<br />So I would say that a beginner such as myself ought by all means to engage with both the ancient Greek thinkers and Prof. Annas's exposition of them. You might find yourself wanting to learn more and more about the ancient thinkers, without being sure why.	2003-03-18

Each half-line contains two beats. The first beat in the second half-line must alliterate with at least one of the two beats in the first half-line. The two beats in the second half-line cannot alliterate.<br />Reading this translation I enjoyed picking out the alliterations and the beats. Eventually the poem appeared to flow into a rhythm, unlike prose translations and unlike my reading of Heaney's Beowulf.<br />I would say that this translation is not a good one for understanding the meaning of the poem. But once one has read one or two other translations and understands what is going on in the poem, this is a great version to read. It enabled me to experience a Beowulf whose sounds are based upon alliteration and meter, much like the poem sounded to its original audience in those mead-halls a millenia ago.	2003-02-16

As a Jew, I really appreciate Paul Johnson's deep sympathy for the Jewish people as well as his insightful and informed descriptions of events.<br />Today I looked up Johnson's treatment of the Crusades. He pointed out both the violence of the Crusaders towards the Jews and the sometimes successful attempts by some bishops to save the Jews. One bishop even hung the ringleaders of these attacks.<br />I had not known about the latter aspect of the Crusader violence. Historians are interpreters and filter the past through their own experience. This book is a commentary on the Jewish past as seen by an erudite outsider. Bravo.	2003-02-08

That being said, she is a Jewish woman living in Israel and thereby helping her country stay Jewish. One ought not to reject her point of view on the basis of a foolish petition that she signed. <br />The title of her book means that the 1948 war is still going on. Otherwise the book's title would be \\"How to End the 1967 War.\\"<br />But Israel did not capture the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza until 1967. If the war between Israelis and Palestinians is only over the land that Israel captured in 1967, and the Palestinian sides accepts the loss of the land that Israel captured in 1948, then in what sense is the war of 1948 still going on?<br />Her book's title indicates the contradictory nature of her analysis. On the one hand, Reinhardt claims in her text that the Palestinians have renounced their claims to the 77 percent of 1948 Palestine that became Israel in that year. On the other hand, in her title Reinhardt indicates that they have not accepted this loss.<br />At first Reinhardt tries to hide the contradiction. But even readers of this book eventually learn that Palestinians continue to demand something that they call \\"the right of return,\\" and that this demand means that some Palestinians must be allowed to settle inside of Israel's PRE-1967 borders. Mere withdrawal from land captured in the 1967 war will not be enough to satisfy even the most minimal set of Palestinian demands.  <br />Reinhardt downplays this contradiction, but her book's title shows that she realizes the contradiction is still there. The war between Israelis and Palestinians over the Palestinians loss ofland in 1948 (not just in 1967) continues.	2003-01-28

For instance, Bahn wrote about theoretical archeology, but he never described an instance in which a researcher used theoretical archeology to arrive at a particular conclusion.<br />The book was easy to read, but I did not learn that much from it. Mostly what I got out of it was that carbon dating does not assume that the levels of radioactive carbon have been constant throughout history. Varves are a way of dating that involves counting the layers of annual sedimentation deposits in certain frosty locales. <br />The book needed to be short, but I thought he should cut back on the breadth and provide more specific info about what he does discuss. Some of the discussions are pointless. He goes on at length about archeology's obligation to teach us about the past, but we all knew that anyway.<br />The humor was mildly amusing, but the writer is not a gifted comic.	2003-01-23

The book is sort of like a ufological Tom Clancy novel in that respect.<br />Read this book and you will learn about Nikola Tesla, volcanoes and Easter Island. <br />On the other hand, this book is a lot harder to follow than the original novel which set off this series. I found myself skimming the endless action involving the aliens and lingering on the interesting passages. There are a number of well-written scenes with vivid imagery, such as the frozen mountain climbers on a ledge.<br />I will probably read other books in this series, especially if I am at an airport looking for something to read on a flight.

Where did the Sumerian language come from? Who built the stones at Carnac and why? Who was buried in the Great Pyramid.<br />What do the mysterious inscriptions found at Easter Island say? And what were the stone statues for. Those are the mysteries of Easter Island.<br />The tragedy was what happened to the Easter Islanders. The westerners were not all evil, and the islanders themselves were not all good (e.g., they practiced human sacrifice) but the enslavement, kidnapping, rape etc. of the islanders by western maritime visitors is shocking even today. And the book tells that story too. So it is not just a book about the mysteries of Easter Island but about the almost complete destruction of it by Europeans and I am sad to say Americans.<br />And the two are related. If slavers had not taken hundreds of islanders to Chile to work as slaves, including the king and prince of the island, perhaps enough of the culture would have survived for western scholars to meet with those who could read the writings of the tablets. Perhaps we would really know why and how the islanders built their mysterious giants.<br />This book (published by Harry Abrams) is an English translation of one of a series of small, lavishly illustrated French historical guides. One really cannot go wrong with this series, whether in French or in English.<br />Everyone involved in this Easter Island book did a great job, and they produced a wonderful way for a beginner to learn about some of the strangest archeological sites on our planet.	2003-01-09

Seeing the original words provides an additional sense of how ancient and otherworldly the kingdoms of the Geats and Spear-Danes were.<br />In addition, the original text permits one to understand better the format of the original poem. The verses did not rhyme but they relied heavily on internal alliteration. <br />The English of the translation is modern and as readable as most others. One aspect which I liked is that the name of the first Beowulf in the book is given as Beow in order to avoid confusing the reader with the hero of the book who only appears later.	2003-01-01

For instance, he says that terrorists have demands that we should consider meeting and that terrorists are not like insane people who simply go berserk on a killing spree.<br />Zinn thus creates a false dichotomy between the rational terrorist who would stop if only you would go far enough in meeting his demands, and the crazy person.<br />But a moments reflection would reveal that terrorists can have political motives and be crazy too. The Nazis for instance.<br />The DC Sniper who was attacking people this year discussed with a friend in Washington state how unjust US foreign policy was. The DC Sniper claimed that what Al Qaeda did should have been done a long time ago. The DC Sniper travelled to the only synagogue in Tacoma, Washington and shot at it.<br />Yet the DC sniper was also shooting some people for no reason at all. To say that if one has some political beliefs about injustice then one cannot be killing people at random in an insane manner is contrary to common sense. What about the Manson Family who believed that they were precipitating a race war.<br />As mentioned, the Nazis were political, and crazy too.<br />That is why I say that Zinn is namby-pamby. He assumes the best in other people instead of the worst. But in the case of 9-11 is his namby-pamby view of the pure motives of Al Qaeda likely to result in a proper response to the tragedy?<br />I doubt it. Zinn's response is more likely to result in Neville Chamberlain-like \\"peace in our time\\" declarations accompanied by a sacrifice of modern-day Czechoslovakias.	2002-12-03

Does this book's title mean that its author believes that there is a \\"Holocaust industry\\" the way there is an advertising industry which produces advertisements or an automobile industry which produces automobiles? I suspect that Finkelstein may believe that there is literally a \\"Holocaust industry,\\" but I cannot tell in this book where the metaphor and hyperbole ends and the alleged literal truth begins.<br />The author severely underestimates the extent to which the average Jewish-American understood the Holocaust forty years ago. One need only look at popular films like Exodus and The Pawnbroker, bestselling novels like Last of the Just and Mila 18, and even popular expressions such as \\"she is so skinny that she looks like a concentration camp survivor.\\"<br />In order to explain why this alleged minimization of the Holocaust occurred in the 60s, Finkelstein then overestimates the extent to which the economic and political situation of the Jewish community has changed over the past forty years. He  provides a leftist, class-based analysis of why Jews allegedly focus on the Holocaust more now than in the fifties. <br />Most American Jews by the 1960s were native-born children of native-born parents who lived in the suburbs and were predominantly Democratic. That remains the situation today. It may not have been the case with respect to the author's own family, but he was not typical.<br />Again, it is not clear what parts of the author's analysis are metaphor and what parts are intended to be literally true. Perhaps Finkelstein's allegation of a change in the class status of American Jews over the past forty years is also a metaphor. Who can tell?	2002-11-20

In some of the other Journey editions the names and nationalities of characters are changed and the first chapter reads differently. To check if you have an honest translation, see if the professor is named Lidenbrock (correct) or Hardwigg (fake).<br />The characters on this mission boldly go where no man has gone before. They resemble some of the cast on American space voyage shows of the sixties. The Icelandic guide Hans is like Spock, stoic, unconcerned with ordinary problems and fearless.<br />Prof. Lidenbrock is not really like Kirk, because he is not emotional. He is actually a lot like Spock also. In fact, Hans and Prof. Lidenbrock are both heroic figures.<br />Axel the teenager(?) on the trip is more like Kirk. He feels emotions, often fear or regret. He also never wanted to go on the journey in the first place, and thus has some aspects in common with Dr. Smith of Lost in Space. However, morally Axel is as upright as the others.<br />Verne took great care to place realistic details in his story. The early chapters where Lidenbrock and company visit 19th-century Iceland are not so much science fiction as they are travel literature, and Verne mastered that genre as well.	2002-10-12

These people claimed to be coming here for an education, and that America needed to help them. They betrayed us.<br />About half of the text humanizes the victims, and about half describes the terrorists and their families and backers. The information is not well-footnoted. For instance, there is a reference to Saddam's links with Al Qaeda that I had never heard before, but where Der Spiegel (the German magazine that produced this book) got its information was impossible to tell.<br />The most memorable piece of info I gleaned from this book is that Marwan Al-Shehi the Islamic fanatic homicide pilot enjoyed going to strip bars while he was here.

It also helps to understand who the various emperors were, their personalities and the problems they were facing outside of Britain.<br />A short book like this one cannot discuss in detail the environment within which Roman Britain existed and then disappeared.

Each pair of facing pages concentrates on one subject. <br />I liked the maps that conveyed additional info. There is one showing the last great expedition to reopen the trade routes with the Arabs, an expedition which ends in disaster for the Swedish adventurers. <br />The Khazars from Jewish history (a south Russian tribe that may have converted to Judaism) even make an appearance. It seems the Khazars gave the Vikings permission to loot their neighbors in exchange for half of the proceeds. But the Vikings were so brutal that the Khazars reneged on the deal and massacred the Norsemen on the way back from pillaging.<br />The Vikings eventually got even though, and their revenge led to the demise of the Khazar empire.<br />Reading this book is like leafing through a series of magazine articles on the general theme of the Vikings. By changing topics so often the book holds the interest of the casual reader who finds the Vikings strange and mysterious.	2002-08-14

Liberty, during the 1967 war.<br />Oren refers to claims that Israel had a motive to intentionally attack a U.S. ship as being \\"conspiracy theories.\\" This book is a useful source of information on the subject and refutes the conspiracy theory version of the attack.<br />Oren confirms the findings of the U.S. Naval Commission of Inquiry in 1967 which determined the attack was a case of mistaken identity. He included a piece of information of which I had been unaware, namely, that after an initial air raid on the ship the Israeli attack had halted but then began again after a Liberty crew member fired on Israeli patrol boats.<br />This return fire directed at the patrol boats confirmed to the patrol boats that this ship was Egyptian, and after which a commander fired the torpedo which tragically killed 25 men.<br />This book will have an impact on perceptions of Israel for years to come. Many of us who discuss topics found in this book will refer to it, and if we disagree should come up with plausible evidence to refute the book's analysis.	2002-06-18

Today I consulted it hoping that it would help me to understand Perl processes (fork, exec, etc.) and to my surprise this Advanced Programming book did not have a chapter on processes! Camel does.<br />It has some stuff on Network programming that relates to threads, but nothing on a topic that I consider to be essential to moving past the baby Perl stage, namely how to start up processes, pipe to them, etc.<br />So I would say that this book probably won't add much to your Perl library.	2001-08-17

Leisure, hobby and professional accomplishment merge. Hackers are not like medieval monks copying manuscripts. At their best they are more like guitarists for rock bands but hopefully without the drugs.<br />What the book says to me is that okay, perhaps I can continue to arrive at work 10 am instead of 9. Perhaps I can continue to sometimes read the internet when I am paid to work. After all, that is what the hackers of this book would do, based upon their redefinitions or work and play.<br />BUT if I want to act like a hacker with respect to my relationship to my time at work, then I had better make sure that I really am a hacker, and not just some shmoe goofing off. That means I had better refine my programming craft as a hobby on my own time, using my &quot;hobby&quot; tools for office projects. And I had better read up on how to solve office-related programming  problems and think about them regularly, not just at work<br />Being a hacker as described in this book is a double-edged sword. You will not necessarily have more free time. But it seems to me that if you really are a hacker as described in this book, and people sense your passion, then they will understand that you are working in a different way but producing more. <br />Just make sure you are in the right environment to be a hacker. Pekka Himanan suggests that working for Microsoft is not a good place to exhibit the hacker work ethic.	2001-07-09

However, he touches on some feeling of religion or something that he got in the deserts of Sinai, Israel and Jordan.<br />Even this kind of personal religious narrative is actually rare among liberal (non-Orthodox) Jews. Being a non-Orthodox Jew myself I got a lot out of Feiler's recounting of his experiences. Indeed, I plan to read this book a second time to squeeze out some of its remaining nectar.	2001-06-27

Tattersall describes remains from 30,000 years ago in Sungir, Russia bedecked in garments decorated with thousands of ivory beads. And these humans were just like us physically. They had art, religion and a social structure.<br />Tattersall then goes on to discuss our precursors, the australopiths, Homo heidelbergensis and Homo habilis. This part is less interesting to me because I feel farther removed from them than I do from those people in Sungir. Indeed that is the point of this book. How did we become who we are? How did we acquire those characteristics (an appreciation of art, spirituality, social stratification) which makes us identify with those cave painters and bead-makers from so long ago?	2001-05-26

I could have told you when Gilgamesh probably lived (2600 BCE) but I did not know when the Egyptians built the Pyramids or that the Incas did not have a system of writing. This book was perfect for filling some of the gaps in my knowledge. It is written at a high school level, which is good. I just wanted to learn some ancient history at a relaxed pace, and Dr. Ryan provided this opportunity.<br />I suspect that a few parts of the book may be in error or an oversimplification. For instance, I have always thought that Homo sapiens...were the first anatomically modern humans, and that they (we) first appeared about forty thousand years ago. Dr. Ryan says that anatomically modern humans appeared 100,000 years ago, but does not explain why he says this. I have read of \\"archaic [Homo sapiens]\\" dating from 100,000 years ago but I was not aware that they were like us.<br />He also distinguishes between the Sumerians and the Akkadians in terms of the latter invading the former. But some scholars such as Jean Bottero believe that the Sumerians and Akkadians, while speaking different languages, were in fact the same nation and the same culture. Bottero's view seems plausible to me. Some Irish speak Gaelic and some English, but they are the same nation. <br />So perhaps this book has some oversimplifications or mistakes, but it is well worth reading for those, like me, who need a general and gentle introduction to areas of archaeology that they missed out on learning about in the past.	2001-05-22

Not only did I get to learn about a recently popular band, but I also found out that there are two kinds of rugby, that Birmingham is in the middle of the U.K, and that an awful lot of young Englishmen are leaving school at age 16.<br />The book was written at the start of 1999, when Golden had hopes that Five would someday be big in the U.S. Unfortunately their second album stiffed in the U.S. and Five's manager Bob Herbert died. In a way anyone who reads this book knows how the story ended even though Golden herself did not.	2001-03-29

He waxes indignant at the unwillingness of Senators to travel to the  House's secret evidence room to view such evidence.<br />He never explains why  such evidence was not presented when the House controlled the process. As  an attorney, surely Schippers knows that we do not convict defendants of  crimes in this country based upon secret evidence in secret evidence rooms.  What was he thinking? <br />This book doesn't go far enough into the mental  processes of Schippers and other impeachment supporters. He never displays  any self-doubt, even now that impeachment has failed. We never know how he  would answer the objections of the President's attorneys and others that we  do not convict of crimes in America based on secret evidence.	2000-09-06

This masterpiece of Jewish commentary by the late Chief Rabbi of Great Britain J.H. Hertz  incorporates not only the thoughts of Rabbi Hertz himself but also those of  Rashi, Saadya and many other Jewish sages.<br />I have been picking this book  up and browsing through it, or referring to it for a specific point, for  almost thirty years. If you can only have a few books in your Jewish  library this book ought to be one of them.<br />A further point. I, too, used  to think that Hertz's commentary used Hertz's own translation of the  Pentateuch, the Five Books of Moses. In fact, Hertz'z book uses the  normative (in his day) 1917 Jewish Publication Society  translation.<br />Hertz's approach is decidedly Orthodox, but you don't have  to be Orthodox to appreciate this work, which I believe will be in print as  long as there are Jews who speak English. And if you are thinking of a gift  for a Bar/Bat Mitzvah or for Chanukah I can't think of a better choice than  this one.	2000-07-23

The exhibit featured the objects  which Woolley recovered in the first part of the last century from the tomb  of Puabi, a Sumerian priestess whose court was sacrificed and buried with  her.<br />This book is a look inside his mind, how he viewed the people whose  past he was uncovering. Sure, he got some things wrong. He did not have the  benefit of the research of countless others who came after him. In  particular, he appears convinced that there was something he calls  &quot;Sumerian nationalism&quot; which was in conflict with rise of Semitic  speakers in Mesopotamia. There is no evidence that the ancient  Mesopotamians had a concept of an ethnic group or that this concept was a  source of conflict.<br />Woolley was also writing during an era when it was  considered scientific to view history in terms of what he called  &quot;race,&quot; so he returns regularly to contrast his view of the  racial stock of the Sumerians with that of the Semites in  Mesopotamia.<br />Yes, this book is a period piece, but I learned a lot from  it, and I am a beginner. Indeed, this is the first history of the Sumerians  I have ever read from cover to cover. The listing of the Sumerian King's  List early in the book is particularly valuable. I find myself returning to  it from time to time. What city was Gilgamesh king of? Oh yes, Erech.	2000-07-22
