The plot has been pretty well described by other reviewers and true, the ending is kindof preposterous but!  everyone is here!  And each one is funnier than the one before.  Grandma Mazur (when she gets behind the wheel of Joe's car, I was laughing out loud.)  Lulu trying her best to replace Stephanie as a bounty hunter but not doing very well.  Valerie who provides a big surprise on her wedding day.  Her fiance, Albert who seems to be fitting into the family very well - but not the way Stephanie's mom had hoped.  And my favorite, Stephanie's mom who tries to relieve her stress by ironing - constantly.  And when that doesn't work, she tries something else.<br /><br />And then there's Ranger who only has to say one word and causes a reaction to everyone who reads the book.<br /><br />Morelli was a little boring in this book but he was recovering from a broken leg(see above:  Grandma Mazur).<br /><br />One last thing, The Cluck - in- a Bucket fiasco is unbelievably funny.	2005-06-24

And their stories will take place at Rose Cottage, their family summer home on Chesapeake Bay.<br /><br />The first book is about Melanie who goes to Rose Cottage after she finds out her boyfriend is married - a fact he neglected to tell her.  It has been years since any of them have been to the Cottage and it has really been neglected.  A fact which has her neighbor Mike Mikelewski very annoyed.  He is a landscaper and can not bear to see the state of neglect the property is in.<br /><br />He too has his problems.  He has a 6 year old daughter, Jessie.  His wife was addicted to drugs before Jessie was born so Jessie has some serious behavior problems.  Mike and his wife are divorced and he has sole custody of Jessie which is not easy for him at times.<br /><br />Neither one of these characters is looking for entanglements.  Mike especially doesn't want his daughter to be hurt by someone she may grow close to who will then leave her like her mother did.  And Melanie makes it clear that she is only there for the short term.<br /><br />The secondary characters, especially Pam (a close friend of Mike's and very protective of him) are very good.  There are no easy answers as Mike and Melanie work their way to an understanding.  This makes for a good read with people you care about and will see more of.  It becomes especially good when Melanie's sisters come and put Mike through the wringer.  After all, they're very protective of their sister and don't want her to be hurt again.  With all of this \\"help\\", Mike and Melanie really have an uphill and interesting struggle.<br /><br />Eagerly awaiting for the next book (Maggie's story) which will come out in April.	2005-03-07

While there she meets Mrs. Selwick-Adderly, a relative of the Purple Gentian who allows her to go through a trunk of old letters and papers relevant to her search.  Unfortunately, her nephew Colin doesn't approve but in the end, Eloise wins out.<br /><br />And what a treasure trove it is.  And the characters are absolutely wonderful!  Amy who wants to become part of the Purple Gentian's league of spies, her sidekick cousin Jane and my personal favorite, Miss Gwen - their chaperone.  These 3 travel to France in the hopes of finding the Purple Gentian and having great adventures.<br /><br />This book has so much humor - I think you could read it more than once and pick up more nuances.  It's absolute fabulous, not to mention suspenseful and surprising.  The identity of the great spy, the Pink Carnation, comes completely out of the blue!<br /><br />The Pink Carnation will have more adventures and I will be the first in line to get the next one.  I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did.	2005-03-07

It is so eloquent that you can just picture every scene.  The contrast between the rich (which was almost sinfully gaudy) and the poor (so dark and gloomy and hopeless) come to life.<br /><br />It brings all the characters through the years to their meeting point at the Buffalo World\\"s Fair where anarchist Leon Czolgosz shoots President McKinley.<br /><br />This book is absolutely riveting and probably different from anything you've read lately.

A struggling writer Steven (with a v) King is having trouble coming up with his first novel.  In the midst of his struggle, he is presented with a unique opportunity - he takes it and suddenly the sky is the limit.  He's published, he's famous, he's bestselling and he's rich.  Everything he touches turns to gold.  Life couldn't be better until ---- he's face to face with the consequences of his impulsive decision.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, suspenseful and insightful book about the publishing industry and how the best of people can make the wrong decisions.  You won't be able to stop reading until you find out how Steven resolves (or not) his situation.<br /><br />There's also a completely surprise twist at the ending.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this one.	2005-02-25

In fact, I didn't finish it and I only had about 75 pages left.<br /><br />Too many things just didn't make sense.  Why did Mack leave home?  Why did his mother have the stroke?  Did it have something to do with his leaving?<br /><br />Abby didn't seem to have any consequences for her very bad choices.  And how were they so stupid as to think that a 10 year old would have a gallery art show????  And Sara and Reuben just didn't seem to have any spark.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book - after all, I paid good money for it but I just didn't.  Save your money - if you want to read it, get it at the library and if you like it, write a review.  The authors deserve to have every opinion (especially favorable) heard.	2005-02-23

I'm not particularly interested in racing but I knew enough about it to know that I don't care for Dale Earnhardt.  But somehow, I started reading it and let me tell you, it is GOOD!!<br /><br />The wide variety of characters and we learn about all of them during the trip.  From the elderly couple where the wife has Alzheimer's to the young couple who gets married at the race track and spends their honeymoon on the tour.  Terence Palmer who is trying to find a link with his dead father.  The small child, Matthew, who is very ill.  The very opposite 3 sisters and the former racer tour guide.  They all come together beautifully as their stories are told.<br /><br />And along with that - the racing trivia (dare I say trivia in regard to racing?).  From how drivers get to the track, how ancient Romans kept score during the chariot races, what do idiots think NASCAR stands for and who the drivers talk to on their headsets.  It's all very interesting.  And it all fits into the storyline beautifully.<br /><br />By the end of the book, I felt I knew and really liked these people and I certainly knew more about racing history.<br /><br />Give it a try - you may be surprised.	2005-02-20

It is a wonderful combination of art and literature.  Definitely a \\"rainy day magic\\" book to browse through and take in each wonderful picture and idea.<br /><br />The magnificent color and fonts add emphasis and interest to the material.  The illustrations make you want to share the book with your grandchildren and see their excitement as each page is turned. It's done in such a manner as to make you want to linger on each page.<br /><br />However, it is hard to get by the old convictions and preferences (and doing it the easy way) of publishers. I'm afraid there will be few books like this.  Format and predetermined style will be hard to overcome.<br /><br />As a lover of books and words, I applaud anything and everything that will get children (and adults) to experience the pure enjoyment and adventure of books.<br /><br />Good luck, Ms. Kirschenbaum.  You are truly an imaginative and inventive teacher.	2005-02-20

What do you want to bet he's single and will turn up in the next book????<br /><br />But Leatrice , Annabelle's 80ish nosy neighbor is the quirkiest of all and she really makes the book.<br /><br />It's a good, funny read and I'm anxious for the next one.	2005-02-20

Until then she was an inquisitive 12 year old girl who dreamed of becoming the next Nancy Drew.  She even has a bread box where she keeps things she finds which may be clues to a mystery further down the road.  The bread box is a secret and is buried in a corner of the yard.  The only one she shares the secret with is her big sister Izzy (Isabelle).<br /><br />The family is spending the summer, as usual, at their summer home.  Izzy is 17 and interested in boys - especially Ned Chapman, the boy next door.  Lucy is 9 and is afraid of everything so mainly stays close to home.<br /><br />But Julie spends the summer playing Nancy Drew, taking the boat out on the canal and fishing with her friends on the other side of the canal.  Friends she's not supposed to see because they're black.  Of course, being Julie she goes anyway.<br /><br />Izzy sneaks out at night to sit on the platform and meet Ned.  Julie sneaks out too just to see what's going on.<br /><br />All pretty typical - until Julie mixes in Izzy and Ned's relationship and their lives are changed forever.  Someone is murdered and someone is convicted of the murder.<br /><br />But years later, a letter is found which changes everything!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book - the story just gradually grew until it became absolutely riveting.  And full of surprises.  In fact, I stayed up until almost 2AM to finish the book because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />In other words, a VERY good read.	2005-02-18

It doesn't claim to be of great literary value.  How seriously can you take a book which was orignally titled \\"Ivan Takes a Wife\\"?<br /><br />But it is interesting to see how Janet Evanovich practiced with the characters which were finally refined in her best selling Stephanie Plum novels.  Each of these early books has a tone of the later ones and that is good to read in and of itself.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book - read it on a winter afternoon in Wisconsin.  No, not on the front porch I love.  Parts of it were quite funny.  Some of it didn't make too much sense but really - some of the Stephanie Plum books don't either and we still gobble them right up.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I read it and I think you will enjoy it too.	2005-02-08

I can see it as a movie with Harrison Ford - of course - and its even left open for a sequel.<br /><br />A plot started in 1973 reaches its goal with a presidential election.  And it looks as if its going to suceed.  I won't go into details on the plot.  Let's just say, I hope it stays fiction.<br /><br />The suspense builds and reaches the point you can't put the book down. It's a race against time with the future of our country hanging in the balance. One part of the ending is a little unbelievable but otherwise, a really good read.	2004-11-11

This book has just been re-released and it was really a good choice!<br /><br />Josie and her husband Cooper have their lives pretty well arranged.  He is an architect and she runs a thriving computer company.  Well, maybe its a little too thriving - she does put in very long hours.  But they manage to work out an arrangement to even accomodate that.<br /><br />Then something they didn't expect happens.  Her brother and sister-in-law die in an auto accident and they have been named the legal guardians for their 2 small children (Lucy, 4 years old and Ben, 9 months).

Josie becomes more and more involved in work and it seems as if there is no viable solution.<br /><br />The main point of the book is love.  Love between couples and love of family.  With love and cooperation and listening, miracles can happen.<br /><br />Cooper and Lucy really carry the book.

Her husband is very successful but hardly ever home.  When he is, he takes her for granted.  When she mentions going to law school, he is violently opposed to it.  One daughter (Eliose) agrees with him and the other (Zoe) sides with her mom.<br />At the funeral of her stepfather, she runs into a friend from childhood, Brad.  Brad, Faith and her brother Jack (who is now deceased) were inseparable as children.  Brad lives on the other coast with a very successful wife.  He is a lawyer, but tends to want to defend the underdog which drives his wife, Pam, crazy.<br />What I liked about the book (formula or not) is the slow pace and the idea that childhood (friends and feelings) can be regained.  As one who is moving back to my hometown again, I guess it was the right book at the right time.  I hope it is for you too.	2002-12-17

She was very young and married when Henry cast his eyes on her.  She was then sent to court to be a lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine.  She was very fond of the Queen but had no choice when Henry wanted her to be his mistress.<br />She had 2 children by him - first a girl and then a boy.  While she was recovering from childbirth, Henry turned from her to her sister, Anne.<br />In one of the unforgettable scenes in the book, the Boleyn family calmly discusses which sister should be the one for Henry.  And when it is decided it should be Anne, Mary asks, \\"What shall I be?\\" and the answer from Anne:  \\"You'll be my lady in waiting.  You'll be the other Boleyn girl.\\"<br />Mary always did as she was told but her real longing was to live a peaceful life in the country - far away from court - with her children.  But once Anne became Henry's favorite, she controlled Mary and her children like pieces on a chessboard.<br />Anne became very cruel.  The Boleyn family was ruled by blind ambition and anything and everything they did was done to gain access to the throne. Mary was kept from her children and from the man she then fell in love with to serve Anne.<br />One of the amazing things about Mary is she was the only one of her family who just wanted to be common.  She managed to stay friends with Queen Katherine even when she had Henry's children.  And when Anne and her family had completely lost favor with the King, Mary survived.<br />An absolutely riveting book.  Don't miss it.	2002-05-25

It's light, its funny, and its true to life.  The bride starts out sensible and sane - not wanting to be like any of her friends who have gotten married.  She thinks all she needs to keep her perspective is a good list and maybe one bridal book to refer to.<br />She makes the list, buys the bridal book, then adds to the list.  She has to change the wedding date so it doesn't interfere with basketball season (or any other sport) and slowly loses her sense of humor, her friends and even her groom (temporarily).<br />Her wedding dress is a story in itself and the final madness seems to hinge on the search for wedding shoes!<br />I enjoyed the book immensely - could there maybe be a sequel??	2002-01-10

The writing is solid, the characters engaging and the storyline flows gently to its finish.  What I liked most about it is the relationship between Daniel and Cale.  Even tho they're going through the most difficult of situations, the love and respect for each other shines through.  Ruby adds humor and Miranda adds gentleness.

True, its written by a very successful and funny comedienne but there's so much more to it than that.<br />This is the type of book that you find yourself thinking about long after the last page is turned.  For instance, you wonder why she put &quot;A Comic Novel&quot; on the cover and why this particular title for the book.<br />There are many different degrees to this novel - it IS comical but its also very serious - about show business, about how hard it is to get started but mostly about friends and relationships and what happens to them when life happens.<br />As Mindy's mother would say, &quot;Fish banana&quot;.  (Don't worry, the explanation is in the book).<br />It's funny, intriguing and very, very readable.	2001-11-19

Just try to picture that.<br />So Marilee pulls herself together.  She gets several interesting (to say the least) jobs and tries to put her life back in order.<br />But more than that, this is a book about friendships.  There are so many wonderful secondary characters but the one who really made me glad I continued reading is Winnie.  I just kept reading to see what gems she would come up with next.<br />So if you want a good read, don't let anything put you off this book.  It delivers in fine style.	2001-11-15

This is a book that needs to be read in a quiet corner where you won't be disturbed.  It can get a bit difficult to keep track of the many plots, counter plots and even the changes of names of the characters.<br />Mary returned to Scotland from France to take up her throne when she was 18 years old.  From that moment, she lost control of her destiny as she became the object of other people's ambitions and schemes.  Her half brother James wanted to be the King of Scotland.  Her secretary of state, Lethington, wanted to gain the thron of England for Scotland.  Her two husbands both wanted the throne.  The only people who had her interests at heart were the four ladies in waiting who came with her from France.<br />If Mary had had the cunning of her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England, she may have survived. As it was, it seems that she was manipulated by everyone who came in contact with her.  She was completely out of her depth.<br />The book didn't seem to provide any insight into Mary's thoughts or feelings.  One example being when she was held prisoner in England for 18 years.  She must have wondered about her small son still in Scotland.  This is barely mentioned.<br />I learned some Scottish history but Mary, Queen of Scots is still a mystery to me.	2001-01-24

Benjamin is happy with his life as it is - hanging out with his &quot;guy&quot; friends, drifting through life as a sometime stand-up comic and engaged to a girl he really enjoys being with - Mel.  But they've been engaged for 4 years and Mel would like (gasp) a permanent commitment.<br />Told completely from Benjamin's perspective makes this a book somewhat different from what you may have been reading recently. Just the chapter on their shopping trip together to pick up furniture is worth the cost of the book - not just for the humorous value but from what Venus may learn from Mars.<br />You definitely won't go wrong with this book. You'll laugh, even cry and hope there's a sequel.	2001-01-24
