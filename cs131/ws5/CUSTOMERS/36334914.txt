From the early days in the military industrial complex to the recent \\"election\\" to the presidency...lazy reporters have let scandal after scandal, deal after deal...just slide.<br />If nothing else, this book shows our national press corps to be lazy elitists.	2004-01-06

I, for one, had no idea that the Congressional Cemetery just a few blocks from my home contained the first Civil War era monument erected. Nor did I know that the first major Lincoln Memorial was right here on the hill.<br />The book is fascinating and can provide either a brief, or detailed, look at the monuments.<br />The only thing the book is lacking is a MAP to help the unitiated into the world of DC's complicated streets.	2003-04-21

It looks like Joe was just looking for another pay check.<br />The book is, thankfully, a balanced account of the Clinton years unlike so many of the predictable, boring conservative smear books in recent years. Klein gives needed attention to the many accomplishments of President Clinton's tenure: NAFTA, the 93 Budget Bill, Family and Medical Leave, GATT, the Balance Budget Act, and welfare reform. He also writes of the great Clinton failures: gays in the military, 94 elections, health care reform and Monica.	2002-12-28
