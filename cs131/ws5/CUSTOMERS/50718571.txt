I used the concepts and ideas all the time. I read that book in about three days and gleaned so much from it. So, I was very excited to start reading Max Q. At first, because of a mishap with a not so bright phone operator at Harvest, I received the Student Journal in the mail. I leafed through it but didn't take a lot of time with it. Then finally my leader's hardback copy arrived from Amazon.<br /><br />The concept of the book is that our students are at critical mass everyday in their world. They are under huge pressure all the time. We need to prepare them for the world. We need to help them understand how they can be people of influence to the world around them. The book speaks of how our students can be the light in the dark world of their schools and work places.<br /><br />I agree completely with the theory of this book. I believe that our youth ministries need to be preparing our students for the opportunity to affect the real world. I think one of the hardest parts of being a Youth Pastor at my current church is that we have such a large home schooled group of teens (51% of our total group are home schooled) that they just don't know any non-Christians. I have heard that come from them every time we speak about evangelism. That concept makes me sad. It is as though the parents in our congregation, in an effort to shield their children from evil, have removed them as influencers in the world. This book encourages wisely handled friendships with non-Christians. It presupposes that if we have prepared our students for the \\"real world\\" then they can become influences on their non-believing peers.<br /><br />There is caution given by the authors that students need to be careful to be sure they are always doing the influencing. It also encourages us as leaders to remind students of grace if they fail. I think Stanley and Hall are right on in their assessment of the need for Christian students to be making a lasting impact on the spiritual life of their friends.<br /><br />Where I think the book is weak is in the area of how that works out practically. I think that time and time again they go back to the point that students should be doing this without offering situations where they can actually be living out this concept. It gives some hows but I think in all it had to say, the book of about 225 pages was way too long. I found it very repetitive. Again, I agree with the concepts but felt like they offered me a challenge without helping me to see how to obtain the goal.<br /><br />I have discussed the concepts of the book with my Senior High Guys Small Group and we agree the need is there. I have encouraged them to be on their toes and remember they are always representing Christ. The book was a great reminder of that concept. I just wish it would have spent less time on proving the need for such relationships and more time on how I can help my students live that life out in a practical way.in their assessment of the need for Christian students to be making a lasting impact on the spiritual life of their friends. <br /> <br />Where I think the book is weak is in the area of how that works out practically.

I have found it to be one of the most effective tools I have used in my 13 years in Youth Ministry.

He shares with us the philosophy of their minstry and how they arrived to use it. The book is strong and offers quite a bit of good material but it is not the best book encouraging modelling a youth minstry. Doug Field's book PURPOSE DRIVEN YOUTH MINSITRY is far superior. This book however, is a nice complement to PDYM and adds some supplemental advice as well.	2001-05-29

The training kit comes with an interactive video featuring Doug Fields. It is a great discussion starter for your youth team. The book guides the participants through the different concepts of a PDYM. The questions for discussion help to lead your minstry team to discover why they do the things they do in minstry. It lays out the proinciples of PDYM clearly and concisly. I recommend this kit to anyone who wants to train a youth leadership team in the church in the best way they can. The kit is just one step down from having Doug Fields come and explain the model in person. No youth pastor should be without it!	2001-05-29

This book will not suck up all of your time as you read however, it does not have any groundbreaking new principles. As youth ministers we should already know that we need to create community in our youth program. We have read many books and periodicals that have told us that our own spiritual life needs to be on track before our student ministry can be up to par. We know that a team approach is best. So, other than making these principles part of an easy to read story, Blunt really has nothing new to say. If you are at the VERY beginning of youth ministry this book could help you. One of my biggest problems with this book is that it is at its heart a commerical for the TeamCE youth ministry program. It blatantly gives you the web site address for this program as a natural part of the story that Blunt is telling. It is a little offensive to me that they would stop in the middle of the story that they are telling and advertise for a product. My original review was more harsh and for that I apologize. This book can be of some value to beginners in ministry. The Team CE Series that is offered on their website has some strengths. This book will not break much new ground but it will help those of you who need a fresh perspective for the first time.	2001-05-29

His intervies with Rachel's brother on the night of the shootings is chilling. There is so much pain and raw emotion displayed. Even the content of his speecha t the memorial service inspiring people to lift the martyr's torch that the title refers to is very compelling. Whree the book starts to drag and lose its bite is when Porter starts to get preachy and give advice. This needlessly enlongates the book and takes away from both the heartfelt stories of Columbine tragedy and the over all quality of writing in the book as a whole. I recommend Rachel's Tears for a life changing book about Columbine and the tragedy of April 20, 1999.	2001-05-29

Doug has organized these titles aphabetically but the index helps you sort them by theme. Using the films in this book can really enhance your teaching and your minstry.

We pulled it out at our last Thnksgiving banquet and even the &quot;staunchist&quot; elders we intears of laughter after watching the stories unfold.

However, my opinion of this book is not as high as many others. I feel sorry for the Bernall family as they grieve the loss of their daughter but I feel that  this book was written too soon. I feel that many times Misty rambles and  jumps from one subject to another. Perhaps this is in part to her own  wounds from April 20th not being completely healed. I also feel that she  does a disservice by not confronting the issue that Cassie probably did not  get the chance to say anything to her assasins that day. I reccommend the  powerful books &quot;Rachel's Tears&quot; and &quot;The Martyr's  Torch&quot; for more comprehensive and non-biased reading on the life of  Columbine students. I do beleive in the life changing grace of God that  occurred in Cassie Bernall's heart but found Misty's retelling self serving  and sometimes incoherrent.	2000-05-10
