I went with Vise based on his Pulitzer Prize. Frankly, I was disappointed. The book is not very well written. There's not much new here you couldn't get from the New York Times. Vise fills pages by writing alternating chapters about FBI director Louis Freeh. But Vise's lionized portrait of Freeh as courageous crime fighter rings hollow, particularly in light of September 11, and other FBI failures on Freeh's watch. The book gives you all the relevant information about Hansson, who was clearly a very dangerous and disturbed person. But the writing doesn't read like top rate journalism; it feels like gossip column filler. Although I haven't read the other books on this case, I'd recommend starting elsewhere.	2002-06-16

It culminates in a balanced account of the development of the International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and exposes the role of Western nations in supporting- and in some cases, obstructing the tribunal's work.  Bass' thesis is that Western nations value human rights and the rule of law,- but not more than the lives of their own soldiers - thus accounting for the sporadic Western support for War Crimes tribunals.  This is provocative book which has many insights into the complexities of international organizations, human rights, and diplomacy.	2001-01-25

This book is absolutely worth reading, if only so that you can judge for yourself.  <br />For those who are interested in understanding more about what Greene rally meant in the whiskey priest's character, try reading his novel Monsignor Quixote, whose main character is a cross between Don Quixote and the whiskey priest.	2000-11-20

I found myself looking back to the Federalist papers so much during my first year of law school that I wanted a small, paperback edition.  This was a great choice.  The best feature is that the Papers are cross-referenced to the relvant articles of the Constitution.  It also includes copies of the Constitution, the Articles of Confederation, and the Declaration of Independence.  It makes it much easier to be aware of the context the Papers were written in as well as the result of the debates.<br />The only thing missing was a copy of the Anti-Federalist papers -- but I haven't found a single volume that includes both yet.	2000-11-07

A labor of love, Ambrose spent over 20 years following the trail of Lewis and Clark with family friends and students.  That passion for his subject shines through.<br />What emerges is a fascinating portrait of Merriwether Lewis.  Ambrose examines the the voyage, his relationship with Clark, with Native Americans and with Thomas Jefferson, his mentor/father figure.  Few Americans, with the exception of Jefferson, have possessed as much talent as Lewis, a true Renaissance Man.  Fewer still have mad such a mark on their country.<br />Ambrose takes us back to a time &quot;where nothing moved faster than a horse- and no one thought anything ever would&quot; and examines the opening of the American West.  This book is a true masterpiece, and the kind of history which can make americans proud again-- accurrate, examining, yet reflective of the best in America's hopes and aspirations in the early years of the republic.  Plus- it's a great story!	2000-10-31

March to Quebec is history as a primary source, and it is amazing.  The volume consists of the journals of then Colonel Benedict Arnold and several of the patriots who accompanied him on his ill-fated march through the Wilderness of Maine during a sneak attack on quebec.  The idea, which Arnold and his mentor General Washington cooked up, was to take Quebec and add it as a 14 colony/state.  There was much adventure and intrigue.  Some famous names invloved on the March are Nathaniel Green, Daniel Morgan, Dearborn, and even a young Aaron Burr.  These journals leap off the page and are probably the best journals available outside those of a genration later, Lewis &amp; Clark.  Highly recommended.	2000-10-27

The author syphons through 2 centuries of myth to find the true Benedict Arnold: a complex human being with amazing military talent, caught over and again in a web of politicking which he neither understood nor approved. Arnold's treason becomes more heroicly tragic than dastardly. Indeed, the reader cannot help but see similarities of today's &quot;look out for my own best interests&quot; philosophy in business, sports, and politics. It would seem Arnold may be the ultimate example of American individualism.<br />While Martin's work is well written, interesting, and highly readable, it is far too incomplete to be anything other than a suplementary source. Martin ignores key activites in Arnold's life, most importantly his time spent as commandant in Philadephia, and also ignores the romance and marriage to Peggy Shippen. Col. Andre is mentioned in only a cursory manner. The treason itself is barely touched upon. The book essentially ends after the Battles of Sarasota, when Arnold was badly wounded. What emerges is an interesting but incomplete portriat of General Arnold. <br />This book would be a great Volume One, if Martin were to continue the biography by addressing these other events in Arnolds life. But for one who is interested in learning about Arnold for the first time, this book is best left on the shelf for after a more thorough biography.	2000-10-27

For an overview of the war's battles and tactics, it is top notch.  I grew frustrated, however, with a missing personal touch. For example, there were was very little coverage of the everyday life of a soldier in the battle, or what it was like to be in a trench.  Still, it is worth reading.  One other criticism I have is that the maps are poor.  While Keegan does an excellent job of detailing battles around small villages and towns, theose same towns are nowhere to be seen on the maps in the book.  I found myself using maps from other books to follow along with the reading.  I'd reccomend this, but be aware of what you are getting.	2000-10-20

He certainly challenges the reader with a very strong case for the inevitablility of continued globalization.  It  certainly makes one realize that in order to stay afloat in the new world  order, one must stay informed.  The only problem with Friedman's analysis  is an age old one:  what do we do for the people who are left behind?   Friedman points out that in the past, the Big conquered the small.  He  argues that in the future, the fast will conquer the slow.  Friedman  provokes many questions, but doesn't offer answers -- we have to pick it up  from there.	2000-06-14

Shaara may have taken too  much on here, for he is unable to really examine the issues of the Civil  War as well as his father did.  <br />He does offer good recreations of the  battles, but his portrayals of Civil War generals border on caricature,  particularly the portrait of Stonewall Jackson as a dour puritan.<br />Still,  this book is worth the read; just don't get your hopes up.	2000-06-01

The detail is excellent and gives the reader a very good picture of how the Battle of Mogadishu played out.  What is missing is the larger context of the overall  Somalia crisis.  For example, there is no analysis of what role  the Somali  warlord Aidid played in coordinating the battle, nor of the broader  American mission there.  Bowden makes a few attempts to give the Somali  perspective, but they are disjointed at best.  All that said, Bowden admits  his goal was not to write a comprehensive history of the situation.  He  does an excellent job of what he set out to do-- recount the battle.  But  as a reader, I found myself wishing for more information about the larger  context.  In short, he does a great job answering who, what, when, and  where, but leaves alot of unanswered whys.	2000-05-02

The story is well written, with character development and an honest attempt to show both the American and the Somali perspectives of the battle. <br />I  have not read much about modern warfare, and this was an amzing peek inside  the dynamics of the modern military, the ethos of soldiering, and the  competition between special forces and regualr units.  Plus, it was a both  an exhillarating account of modern battle and a heart breaking story of  tradgedy. <br />My only criticism is of the editing.  There are many soldier's  stories to follow, and mush of their character development took place  early.  So I often found myself flipping to the index to reference where I  had read about this soldier or that one, etc.  The index, however was  incomplete and innacurate. Some of the page listings did not reference the  topic at all, others were mis- numbered, etc.  As far the book goes,  though, it was great and I highly reccomend it!	2000-04-08
