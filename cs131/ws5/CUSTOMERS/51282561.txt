These are words I have longed to hear: \\"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, I have all the previous collections, in their various iterations, but when that big hardcover \\"Complete Far Side\\" came out a few years ago, THIS was the one strip I had hoped somebody would compile. And here it is. <br /> <br />I can't imagine anyone reading this far in this review who would have no exposure to this tyke and his tiger, but if you are in this small, lamentable cohort, you are among the luckiest people on Earth. You get to discover all this, all at once, much to your delight. <br /> <br />The only real precursor to C&H is \\"Peanuts\\" (also being lovingly collected in beautiful hardcovers), with the deceptively simple lines and boundless imagination. However, in direct contradistinction to that strip, Calvin has never been fully merchandised. Everything that is \\"Calvin & Hobbes\\" is right here. It's a world that had a beginning and an end. It is self-contained. <br /> <br />And...it's funnier. <br /> <br />What you get here is three large, exquisitely detailed tomes filled with the most hilarious, hysterical, touching and surprising stories you'll ever read.  <br /> <br />Prose, poetry, film, comic books...just like those media, these are also complete stories. Some are told in three panels, some across weeks. Some are told magically in a single wordless panel. Wit, pathos, drama, suspense...even science fiction...all here, and all woven effortlessly and seamlessly together by Bill Watterson. <br /> <br />The construction of the book itself is something to behold. The binding is hefty, the paper thick and lustrous. The color reproductions are gorgeous. All contained in an illustrated slipcase. <br /> <br />I can't say enough about the strip itself. I don't think I've ever laughed harder at anything in my life. I've seen funny movies, heard comedians give killer lines during stand-up...but the convulsive, explosive laughter that this little guy generates is, I believe, unique. <br /> <br />This is something a lot of people will treasure for the rest of their lives. You will want your kids to read this. And their kids. <br /> <br />Now they'll be able to!	2005-10-06

Hank Aaron was my baseball hero; I was ten when he hit that famous home run off All Downing. <br /> <br />I knew very little about him as a person, and next to nothing about his struggles during the chase for the home run crown. <br /> <br />I just wanted him to hit number 715. Apparently, that's what he wanted as well. <br /> <br />This book briefly recounts a bit about Babe Ruth, and spends a little time going over Aaron's childhood, upbringing and early career achievements. The bulk of the book takes place between homers #710 and #715, bridging two seasons of baseball. <br /> <br />If there is an \\"enemy\\" in this tale...a \\"bad guy\\" if you will...it's the entire city of Atlanta, with Commissioner Bowie Kuhn as henchman. The apathy of Atlanta, especially when compared to the obvious respect Aaron gives the town, is inexcusable. Almost unbelievable. The disrespect Kuhn shows is heinous. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, in his own, relatively quiet manner, Aaron does the right thing, graciously and humbly hitting #715, shifting Mr. Ruth into second place on that particular hit list. <br /> <br />I said \\"relatively quiet\\" in that it appears Aaron was not afraid of stating what was on his mind. His model for being outspoken definitely was the post-retirement Jackie Robinson, but he wasn't as inflammatory as that legendary figure. It was as if Aaron took over the reins, so to speak, and continued to fight for \\"black\\" rights in a \\"white\\" game. I don't think it's accidental that around the time of these events, we finally started getting black managers in baseball...and I find it interesting that several of the ballplayers for which served as mentors have now become some of the best managers in the games, like Dusty Baker, Felipe Alou... <br /> <br />The reason I give this book \\"only\\" four stars is that the writing could have been better. More elegant. More vivid. Just \\"more\\". Maybe it's not fair that I am comparing this book to those written by Halberstam, Kahn, Angell and theother greats of baseball literature and journalism, but there you go. <br /> <br />This book still will have a place in my library of baseball books, and it should in yours as well.	2005-10-01

Although I suspect that most people who will read this book already know how BIG Babe Ruth really was to Americans, I wish those who do NOT realize his profound inlfluence on modern culture would take the time to check this out. <br /> <br />Creamer has fashioned an extraordinarily readable, concise yet fully detailed biography of this great ball player. There is enough journalism here to satisfy those seeking accuracy, enough analysis for those interested in perspective, and enough elegant writing to please pretty much everybody else. <br /> <br />Beginning at the beginning, and ending, abruptly, at the end, Ruth's life is presented within a vivid portrayal of early 20th century America. His tenacity, exuberance, lust for life is all here, including many unflattering incidents. Warts and all. <br /> <br />If I had to single out the best things about this book, I'd have to start with how Creamer places Ruth's achievements into context. Staggering and astonishing are the two words I keep coming up with. Winning the Home Run Crown is one thing. Winning it over and over again for nearly two decades is another. Setting a home run record is one thing. Doubling the record is entirely another thing. <br /> <br />It took forty years for Maris to break Ruth's record by one. When Ruth broke the record the first time, in 1919, he broke the old record by three or four, hitting 29. The next year, 1920, he hit 54. He averaged 40 a year for SEVENTEEN years.  <br /> <br />Before Babe, the all-time home run king hit 136 homers. Ruth passed that in his first few seasons as a full-time (non-pitching) player. Every homer he hit after that extended it...when he hit 700, only 2 other players were in the 300's. <br /> <br />And don't get me started on his pitching. Wait till you read about how good he was. I had always known he was a pretty good pitcher...I didn't know he was THIS good. <br /> <br />The name Babe Ruth is synonymous with \\"legend\\", and there are hundreds of legendary talessurrounding his exploits. Creamer sorts of fact from fiction, and most of time, the fact is the legend.  <br /> <br />For example, the \\"called shot\\" may or may not have happened. The events that we are certain that occurred during that game are still amazing. <br /> <br />Plus, I prefer to believe that he hit a ball so hard that it went between a pitcher's legs AND over the center fielder's head. I just love that mental image. <br /> <br />There is a lot of sadness in Ruth's life, from his relative abandonment as a child, to his inability to become a big league manager, to his vitality-robbing cancer...his life had ups and downs like only true epic characters can have. <br /> <br />The book also gets Ruth's media domination right. At least it feels right. I wasn't there. Most of us weren't. But baseball was the only entertainment for the majority of the country, along with those relatively recent upstarts, radio and film...there is nothing today that really compares. There is really no one person whose personality captivated a country like his did. <br /> <br />And it sounds like he loved every second of it. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I would give anything to see Babe Ruth play just once...	2005-09-16

They wipe out all the good guys, and alter \\"regular\\" people's memories so that they believe the superheroes only existed in comic books. This allows the bad guys to operate relatively freely, in a somewhat clandestine fashion. Like the \\"Mob.\\" <br /> <br />One of the top evil-doers is assassinated, and his long-lost, semi-legitimate son is brought into \\"reality\\", where he discovers who he really is, and what he really can do. <br /> <br />Chaos ensues. <br /> <br />Yes, the key characters look like famous people. Eminem, Halle Berry, Tommy Lee Jones. Yes, there are intentional echoes of \\"real\\" characters, like Dr. Rictus reminding you of The Joker, etc.  <br /> <br />Yes it is vulgar. Yes it is very \\"adult\\".  <br /> <br />It is meant for comic aficionados, not younger fans. This is not for the \\"Marvel Adventures\\" set, if you know what I mean.  <br /> <br />Yes, it all works. The individuals issues comprising the story are impossible to read slowly. This is a barrelling freight train of a tale with shocks and surprises that a serious comic fan will read with decadent glee. <br /> <br />My only problem with the \\"shocking\\" ending is that I could have used a little more...	2005-09-13

Wow. <br />I am well familiar with the \\"Ultimatizing\\" of the Marvel Universe. And I like it. It won't keep me from reading the original lines, but the fresh approach and undeniable quality of these Ultimate titles means they're simply good comics. Often great comics.  <br />They work just as well for those well-versed in Marvel's mythology as those who confess ignorance. <br /> <br />Having said that, this \\"Fantastic Four\\" blew me away. I loved the story, the art, the characters, the ideas, the images...you can tell by reading these twelve stories that the creators love the characters so much, they've put every creative impulse of their being into them. The four key characters are suffused with love and respect. <br /> <br />They've unleashed genius comic geeks on Marvel's oldest saga, and come up with something startlingly fresh and new. They've tangled with some of the most stale and staid characters in the Marvel Universe, and derived phenomenally interesting and intriguing people out of them. <br /> <br />First, the tweaking of the origin works. Oh Lord does it work. You got Reed, Sue, Johnny, Ben, Victor Von Damme/Doom, Mr./Dr. Storm, the Baxter Building, the Negative Zone...even the freaking Fantasti-Car. I do not in any way want to hint at what their \\"new\\" origin has to do with, as discovering it for yourself will prove to be sheer delirium. I got this fizzy glee reading the first few issues... <br /> <br />Oftentimes, I found myself seeing scenes I had always goofily joked about as a young child.  Does The Thing go to the bathroom, for example? Does The Invisible Girl go invisible in layers or all at once? This story has you seeing your old favorites in a new light, and it's wonderful. <br /> <br />Dr. Doom shows up, and his 'reimagining' is a bit more bold than the others, but it feels authentic. His physical appearance, including one drastic alteration, perfectly fits the new origin. <br /> <br />These twelve issues read like one solid arc, and this \\"Ultimate\\" hardcover just became \\"essential\\" in my estimation.  <br /> <br />This is bravura comic-book-making.	2005-08-04
US	51282561	R1W34Z9HHGVBX4	0345434498	323396054	Hostage: A Novel	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Killer thriller...read this book AND see the movie!	After first seeing the film, THEN reading the book, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  <br />About 75% of the two are the same...basic plot, basic characters, certain plot twists, etc. <br />However, the parts that were DIFFERENT were spectacularly so, and kept me up quite late reading this exceptionally well told thriller. Briefly, a burned-out hostage negotiator retires to a small suburban community and gets himself involved in a hostage situation. Things get immeasurably worse. Period. <br /> <br />Realize that that's like saying \\"Die Hard\\" is a movie about a burned-out cop who encounters terrorists at a Christmas party. \\"Hostage\\" gets deliciously convoluted before the final page. <br /> <br />Having been introduced to Crais via \\"Demolition Angel\\", and not his previous series books, I only expected some sort of good suspense novel. <br /> <br />Which I got...in spades. This sucker crackles with spiffy plot twists and near-hard-boiled dialogue. <br /> <br />Before I go on, there is one specific scene in the film which blows the doors off its' mate in the book. Without spoiling, it's the scene where the hero, Talley, discovers what the \\"bad guys\\" are holding against him. <br />It's interesting in the book...it's shocking in the film. <br /> <br />The book, on the other hand, is allowed to expand on some of the less-central roles...or more properly said, the film pares down (by necessity) the book's peripheral characters. <br /> <br />I was fascinated by \\"Mars\\", one of the three hostage takers. What a creepy guy. Seriously. Crais created three-dimensional characters out of the remaining two amateur kidnappers, but this third one is an epic monster. <br /> <br />Seeing the movie, I bet the actor playing Mars read this book. He infuses his character with the sickness and menace that is vividly depicted in the novel. He let the backstory come out. And you WILL want to know his \\"backstory\\". It's a corker. <br /> <br />The hero figure, Talley, is again a flawed but noble police officer facing impossible odds that get worse with every turned page. The writing is good enough that there is no sense of perfunctory danger...when things go bad, it feels real and not contrived. <br /> <br />There is also more development of the more sinister set of \\"bad guys\\"...the ones who are NOT the kidnappers...and the ending of the book is TOTALLY different than the film. <br /> <br />Reading the book and seeing the film made me appreciate both of them more. <br /> <br />That doesn't happen too often.	2005-07-23

Yes, \\"The Mark of Zorro\\" is a light-hearted, spirited adventure romp, but this hardcover, at 25 bucks, is not a place to start. <br /> <br />The story by McCulley, is a terrific read, from stem to stern, even when you know the ending. <br /> <br />The physical book itself is AWFUL.  <br /> <br />There are numerous typos throughout the entire book. <br /> <br />The letter \\"o\\" gets replaced by the number \\"6\\" a half dozen times in the last few pages alone. <br /> <br />There's a half a page duplicated, making for some confusing reading two-thirds of the way through.  <br /> <br />The word \\"the\\" is often replaced by the the word \\"Die\\", making me wonder if there was some German transcriptionist involved somewhere along the line. <br /> <br />Letters are capitalized in the midst of words for no meaning. <br /> <br />It actually made reading this simple tale a chore. <br /> <br />I loved this story, but I hated the actual book it was printed in.	2005-06-20

Another excellent Archive collection from the folks at DC, \\"The Hawkman Archives, Vol 1\\" collects his early appearances from The Brave & The Bold and Mystery in Space. <br /> <br />The tales are superior examples of Gardner Fox's blend of sci-fi and superhero. Although a bit repetitive (face it...these are meant to be re-read as single stories, not like the multi-issue sagas of today), but always enjoyable.  Check out the \\"Identi-Card\\" which is described as a plastic card used to pay for things that automatically takes the money out of your bank account, or how Hawkgirl does some shopping from home while looking at a screen. All in two panels. <br /> <br />In 1961, Fox accurately predicted the ATM card and Internet shopping. Unbelievable. <br /> <br />Joe Kubert's artwork is beautiful, as expected. Given the other comics around in 1961, it's no wonder he was considered head and shoulders above his competition. His figure are lithe and graceful. and his faces are rough-hewn marvels. <br /> <br />Anderson's artwork, in the last few stories, rises to the challenge. It's exquisite as well. Different style, but perfectly serving the story and a joy to behold. Detailed and precise, with great facial expressions. <br /> <br />Being horrifically addicted to these Archive Editions, this is a welcome addition to the series. I welcome the arrival of these classic 60's comics.	2005-06-15

By a mile.  <br /> <br />This book is educational, informative and inspiring. It is a book that makes you look at baseball with new eyes. It takes you, briefly but lucidly, into the world of the draft, high school sports, minor leagues, retired players, coaches at all levels, computers, the language of statistics...and above all, the inside world of major league baseball. But this time, from a point of view...from a manner of thinking...you have never considerd. <br /> <br />For some strange reason, it now makes me look at my world of medicine in new ways. <br /> <br />Here's the thing: it's more important to not make an out, than it is to get a hit. <br />It took a few minutes for that to really sink in, but that subtle shift in perspective makes an enormous amount of difference. It really does. <br /> <br />Lewis, through the tale of Billy Beane, makes this idea crystalline in clarity with statistics and theory, but not robbing the story of any of its' humanity. <br /> <br />Beane was a high school phenom; Lewis does some of his best work describing what it must be like to be one. He doesn't make it in the bigs, but through some pretty radical decision-making, ends up the GM of the A's. <br /> <br />You will follow a few players from their drafting to singular moments in their careers, and you will cheer. Out loud. <br />I did. <br />I read this entire book on a flight from Detroit to L.A., and many of my fellow passengers thought me daft. A loon. Here's this guy, in his window seat, woo-hooing while reading a hardcover book. Laughing out loud. Saying \\"Yesss!\\" like some bad Marv Albert impersonator. <br /> <br />Scott Hatteberg will stick with me for the rest of my life. I feellike I know the guy. I wanna have him over for dinner. As I do Billy Beane, and Mr. Lewis as well. <br /> <br />There are over a half dozen other people who spring to life, due to some terrific writing, but if you've read this far, I want you to discover them on your own. <br /> <br />How many times in your life will you read a book that changes fundamentally the way you look at something? Something that you have thought pretty much the same about since childhood. <br /> <br />Since Little League and watching my beloved Dodgers back in the 70's, stealing second was \\"good\\", a sacrifice bunt was \\"going by the book\\"...there are whole tenets of baseball wisdom that are challenged here, but challenged for the love of the game, not the contrary.  <br /> <br />His quote from Bill James (a person I now feel I must seek out and buy all his books...) about errors being a statistic of \\"opinion\\" made total sense to me; I almost felt like an idiot that I never thought that way about it myself. <br /> <br />If you love baseball, if you only like baseball, if you like a great story well told, your next purchase NEEDS to be this book. I guarantee...guarantee, mind you...that you will not be disappointed.	2005-06-02

I bet you do too. You'll need a copy too.    I read Alan Schwarz' \\"The Numbers Game\\" just before I read Michael Lewis' \\"Moneyball\\", and I'm better off because of it.  Schwarz was acknowledged by Lewis in his own book (while Schwarz was writing this one), and there are a few passages that are strikingly similar.    Lewis is a better writer; Schwarz is a little more \\"clumsy\\" I guess. Not as elegant.    But still, he tells a story of such breadth it's a bit staggering. He does so with deft, concise descriptions. They're often funny as all get out.    The two books work like two hands, interlocking. The depiction of \\"baseball\\" is more detailed after spending time with both. Schwarz places \\"Moneyball\\" in a bigger perspective; Lewis brings \\"The Numbers Game\\" down into every day baseball.    Here, Schwarz starts with the guy who invented baseball statistics, Henry Chadwick. He then leads us through decades of baseball theory, the development of baseball cards, Strat-O-Matic and Rotisserie (fantasy) baseball, computers, SABR, baseball reporters, fans, players, politics, coaches, the Internet and a whole host of wacky baseball enthusiasts who become hopelessly addicted to the world of baseball stats. Roth, Cook, Dewan, James, Podesta, Evans, Beane...      And this in less than 300 pages. This is nothing short of amazing.  While I raced through this book, I thought of two close friends of mine.     One, a man of about 60, who on occasion has waxed rhapsodically about the box score.     How he loved to simply peruse the newspaper and consider each game in it's two-inch square recapitulation...HE belongs in this book.    Another, a guy my age (41),  shared my pre-adolescent love for baseball by going to Dodger games, watching the All-Star games together, playing Little League and collecting baseball cards. He continued on with his fascination by playing Strat-O-Matic, high school ball, and getting involved with Rotisserie leagues where I did not.HE belongs in this book.    Now that I think about it...they both already are in this book. These are the guys who fill every paragraph of this tome.     Baseball isn't just \\"baseball.\\"     To those who do not \\"get it\\", that statement is simply moronic; to the rest of us, it makes all the sense in the world.	2005-06-02

It is less poetic, but more gritty and technical.<br /><br />It is a compliment to compare this to Spiegleman's epic, and I believe it is deserved.<br /><br />This is the first of three available volumes, of English-translated manga. It follows the adventures of three rabbits (U.S. GI's), fighting a very real, historically accurate war.<br /><br />There are even footnotes. The ordnance is referred to by their acronyms in the story, yet they're spelled out for you at the bottom of each page. Events like The Tet Offensive are given short explanatory blurbs to amplify and give context to what's happening in the panels.<br /><br />You will learn an amazing amount of information about the Vietnam War. Geography. Politics. How to take out a bridge. How to perform a targeted bombing. The history of the U.S. Special Forces.<br /><br />I'm being dead serious.<br /><br />Similar to \\"Maus\\", different races/cultures are rendered as different animals. The Vietnamese, for example, are cats. Whether they are \\"good\\" cats or \\"bad\\" cats is sometimes hard to tell, and that's exactly the point.<br /><br />Getting past these technical details, the story here is exquisite. If I had to compare this to a film, it would be \\"Platoon\\". It has that same sort of gritty realism to it. It's a true page-turner. You'll revel in some of the really cool artistic details, but the plot will have you wanting to read faster and faster...<br /><br />To be honest, more than a few times I had a hard time following what was going on, but in retrospect, that was probably the author's intent.<br /><br />Worst thing I can say about this book is that it ends in a cliffhanger...<br /><br />...so I'm ordering the next books as soon as I finish this review.	2005-03-30

There was a time when Jack Kirby the writer must have been ON something. <br /> <br />Seriously...his takes on characters (or runs on titles) often started right in the middle of something. As mentioned in another review, the first issue of \\"Black Panther\\" starts right in the middle of a story...a story that even if you were well familiar with every single printed appearance of the Black Panther, you STILL would have no idea what was going on. <br /> <br />Kirby always did this...taking over Captain America in the mid-70's, his Jimmy Olsen wack-jobs, those admittedly bizarre Devil Dinosaur books...besides T'Challa, you didn't recognize ANYONE here. Except you instantly knew they were characters in a universe only Kirby could have created. <br /> <br />I must admit that growing up, I hated Kirby. I was the total Neal Adams/Gil Kane/John Byrne kinda guy, and Kirby (especially in the 70's) was \\"ugly\\". Unrealistic. These gaping toothless mouths, anatomy that defied logic...just \\"weird looking.\\" <br /> <br />Now, decades later, knowing how he is arguably the single most important creator in the history of comics, I get him. This was a guy whose imagination was, in the strictest sense, limitless. You take a look at some of those celestial visions, alien architectures and vehicles that curve and gleam. Could YOU have come up with anything even CLOSE to that? Has anybody? <br /> <br />His \\"Black Panther\\" run, especially the seven issues here, felt like the lithe, mysterious character from the Fantastic Four, the Avengers and the Marvel Universe was dropped into some Bizarro (to borrow from their Distinguished Competition...) World. He's surrounded by freaks, monsters, alien artifacts...you'll find yourself saying...and often...\\"what the...?\\" <br /> <br />In his career, this brief run on \\"Black Panther\\" is simply a small chapter in this Kirbyverse. It wouldn't be in his Hall of Fame exhibit, but it's an entertaining way to while away some time. Marvel should be applauded forbringing these non-mainstream issues back to life.	2005-03-28

Steve Pond's \\"The Big Show\\" belongs on the bookshelf of everyone with any interest in the Academy Awards. <br />I've read pretty much all the books on the Oscars, and this is one that really doesn't compare to any other. Most of what I was reading here I was hearing for the first time. This books complements every other account of the show, because this is the first book to actually tell the story about the show itself, not the movies or stars.  <br /> <br />Trust me when I say you have no idea how incredibly difficult it is to put this television show together. Unless, of course, you've been there. <br /> <br />It's surprisingly well written; it's a easy fast read. <br /> <br />It's gossipy, but pleasantly so, and often funnier than all get out.  <br /> <br />My favorite Oscar book is still \\"Inside Oscar\\" (the first one...as the second is a bit more vitriolic and less, oh, affectionate...) but THAT book and THIS book are the only ones I will read more than once. \\"Inside Oscar\\" gives us an account of the year in film, and then goes through the telecast, followed by events that happened in the weeks to months after the show. Here, you get that crucial few days right before the show, and then all the fascinating details surrounding what you actually saw on TV. They're a perfect fit. <br /> <br />Each chapter is a year, covering the process of putting on the Oscar telecast: how are the seat-fillers handled; who makes those decisions for those horrible dance pieces; how much thought is put into set design (a lot, but not all the time...)...the stories behind the rehearsals I found to be the most interesting of all. <br /> <br />This period covers the switch from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion shows/Shrine shows to the Kodak Theater. Having a permanent \\"home\\" now seems like such an obvious idea, but it clearly wasn't. <br /> <br />I discovered things about certain stars that surprised me. I will leave you to discover them, but suffice to say, there's a story involving Celine Dion which made me respect her in ways I would have never imagined (although her music still makes me itch). <br /> <br />I loved the insight into each host...so many things are known about them, yet this book assumes that. It assumes that the reader already has a healthy knowledge about Hollywood and film, and gives you the stuff you probably don't know. <br /> <br />THAT'S why I love this book!	2005-03-25

The third book in the Pellucidar series, 'Tanar of Pellucidar' concerns the exploits of of Tanar, and his adventures within the world lying under the \\"outer crust\\", Pellucidar. <br /> <br />Burroughs doesn't deviate too far from his formula, nor would you want him to.  <br /> <br />Tanar is the honorable, fallible, romantically-driven hero, Stellara his love, and a whole host of bad guys interfere with them getting together. This time, they're from a place called Korsar, and look remarkably like pirates. <br /> <br />Yup. Yo ho, yo ho pirates. <br />Like the other books, there are set pieces aplenty, written in ERB's thrilling simple style. Jungles chases and oceanic clashes...dungeons, dinosaurs...oh it's all here as usual. <br /> <br />This time, however, there is a bit more elegance and sophistication slipping in to his prose. First, Mr. Burroughs appears in the prologue/epilogue. The jarring anachronistic presence of the pirates is given a possible explanation, in a tantalizing fashion. He gives us enough information to put two and two together, but you still want to read more, and I think he's setting us up nicely for the subsequent novels. <br />Which I now absolutely MUST read. <br /> <br />One last humorous note: Some of the exotic locales, like Anoroc and Amiocap, I've just noticed to be cities in California spelled backwards...	2005-02-14

At the end of \\"At the Earth's Core\\", David Innes, our everyman-now-Emperor, has returned to the outer world, with an ugly reptilian Mahar instead of his lovely Dian. <br /> <br />He vows to return, and here, in the second book of this particular series, he does exactly that. <br /> <br />Once again, Burroughs' simple vivid prose describes one thrilling adventure after another, in full cinematic glory. There are brutal hand-to-hand combat scenes, jungle hunts, mountaineering escapades and even a sea-faring battle. All this in under 200 pages (per my Canaveral Press copy). ERB doesn't waste a lot of words. <br /> <br />You just have to love the lot of characters on display here. The names alone generate all sorts of mental images: King Gr-Gr-Gr, Hooja the Sly One, Ghak the Hairy One, the Mahars, the Sagoths, the massive lidi, the hyaenadons Raja and Ranee... <br /> <br />Over the course of two books, you'll be hard pressed NOT to cheer for the indefatigable David Innes. He's an old-fashioned, capital-H hero; plucky, smart and brave, yet human. After all, this adventure is what happens to him while he searches for his beloved Dian. <br /> <br />There are two high compliments I'd like to offer:  <br /> <br />One, is that upon finishing one book I cannot wait to read the next.  <br /> <br />Two, is that in this modern age of film, only with computer imagery could they reproduce the fabulous vistas of Pellucidar, with the overhead \\"horizons\\" and that low-lying, rotating pendant moon. <br /> <br />The compliment is that it would never be as \\"fabulous\\" as those ERB created inside my head.	2005-02-07

Let me tell you, I was so hooked the first 50 or so pages, I couldn't stop reading. <br /> <br />I thought this whole \\"nanotechnology\\" business was fascinating...I couldn't get enough of it. As you're reading, you yourself will imagine dozens of horrific ways this sort of stuff can go awry. Thinking back to \\"Jurassic Park\\", he does something similar: a cutting-edge, just-in-the future technology that has one obvious but still quite interesting focus (dino-DNA cloning), and then takes you on a rollercoaster that springboards from that initial conceit. <br /> <br />This book has that locomotive start. You learn more and more about these swarms and computing technologies that seem ominous and powerful and mysterious. <br /> <br />Then, and fairly suddenly, the plot devolves into a sub-standard B-movie scenario.   <br /> <br />You know, a group of people, isolated, with \\"something out there.\\"  <br /> <br />Ooh...run outside! Quick! Get back inside! <br /> <br />I dunno...I just expected so much more from the way this novel opened...something more disturbing, I guess. It seems that the misuse of what Crichton describes could go so way beyond what is conjured here, this seems slight. <br /> <br />Halfway through you'll think this might make a cool movie. Then you think, well, maybe a TV mini-series or something. <br /> <br />Now I think (hope) this is merely a prequel to something far more sinister and suspenseful.	2005-01-28

A terrific adventure novel that will immerse you in a world with simple, descriptive language and rollicking action sequences, \\"At The Earth's Core\\" is an early Edgar Rice Burroughs tale, the first of several books that take place in the land of Pellucidar. <br />Yes, Pellucidar lies in the center of the earth. Jules Verne's take on what lies beneath differs greatly; this one less \\"sci-fi\\" and more fun...like \\"Jurassic Park\\" fun. <br />I think the audience most likely to be enthralled here, is the one comprised of pre-teenage boys...yet anyone who loves a a good story well told will become a fan as well. <br />This is a tough book to stop reading...it's one of those that you want to see \\"what happens next.\\" So much so I've already ordered as many other Pellucidar books as I could find... <br />A synopsis is unnecessary...it's already been nicely done here at the Review site. Just know that, in a fashion that reminds me of \\"The Princess Bride\\", the \\"mushy\\" parts dovetail nicely with the \\"adventure\\" parts. The relationship between Innes and Dian is interesting, non-stereotypical, and surprisingly modern. <br />I was already a fan of ERB's Tarzan books. <br />It seems I've added another series to my \\"must read/own\\" list. <br />I'm afraid to read \\"A Princess of Mars\\" (the Mars series)...or perhaps I should say my bank account is.	2005-01-26

As a person who loves Broadway musicals, yet lives on the West Coast, oftimes the soundtracks to certain shows are my only option. I've also discovered that I tend to be more lenient when listening to a show I've seen than to one I have not. <br /> <br />I wouldn't qualify as a aficionado, but I have seen my share of shows, and own a few dozen CD's.  <br /> <br />This book is exactly what I wanted: a guide of theater (and theater-based) recordings, that separates wheat from chaff. <br /> <br />Alphabetical by title, each show's iteration is given a review. Recordings by various casts (Broadway, London, etc.) are synopsized and critiqued.  <br />The reviewers know their audience: the book is written for us, not for them, if you catch my meaning.  <br />The reviews themselves are short, concise...I almost wanted a little more, but I'm going to make that a compliment and not a criticism; they cover a LOT of ground here. It looks like they got everything up to 2001. <br /> <br />One of the more valuable functions this book performs, is comparing the innumerable variations on certain shows (like \\"Oklahoma!\\" or \\"My Fair Lady\\"), enabling a fan to pick the one best suited for their interests. <br />More importantly, the subsequent film versions of Broadway shows (and occasionally the antecedent film version) are also covered. It's interesting to see how certain shows improve upon themselves, while others clearly lose that \\"something\\" that characterizes the singular Broadway experience. <br />Even more valuable is the curiosity factor: I've found easily a dozen discs I now need to have. The writing is engaging enough that you'll want to seek out either completely different versions of your favorite shows (including some you did not know that were newly remastered or expanded) or simply new shows you've always wanted to hear, but never got around to them. <br /> <br />Soundtracks to films without accompanying Broadway musicals are not covered, nor should they be in this book;it's title is the \\"guide to musical theater recordings\\", not \\"film soundtracks\\".  <br /> <br />There are a few idiosyncrasies. Some shows that I'm pretty sure have film versions (like \\"On The Town\\") do not mention the film soundtrack. Perhaps it's unavailable. The movie soundtrack for \\"Fame\\" is not reviewed, but the musical is.  <br />The soundtrack for \\"Footloose\\" is covered, though, as are both \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Lion King\\", both non-musical film predecessors. <br />This is a micro-quibble, at best. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that this is a well-written, comprehensive, entertaining book of reviews about a specific genre. I honestly don't think they could have done it any better.	2005-01-11

A grim, more bleak version of what you might have been initially exposed to in the first \\"Die Hard\\" film, Roderick Thorp's \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" was a pleasure to read. <br /> <br />There are enough differences to keep movie-viewers off balance, and the writing is tough and terse, befitting it's hero, Joe Leland (not John McClane). <br /> <br />The plot similarities are as such: it opens on a plane from NYC to LAX. He's visiting an estranged family member in L.A., who works in a high rise and they're having a Christmas party when the building gets taken over by terrorists. There's a cop on the outside, there's the cop's \\"superior\\" who's not the most competent, the big bad guy is Anton (not Hans) Gruber...but... <br /> <br />...the tone is really quite different. It's a bit more introspective, withe Leland feeling himself consumed by hatred toward his enemies. When he takes out a terrorist, you get an impression of how it affects him. They're not casual. And as he \\"gets better\\" at it, it starts to change his thinking. It's pretty interesting stuff. <br /> <br />The media presence is handled much more seriously, not as a comic plot device/aside in the film. I thought it was much more realistic...the way media can manipulate the real story, and also how those people actually involved in the news story can manipulate the media right back. There's a few clever sequences that wouldn't have fit in the film, but are nevertheless pretty cool. <br /> <br />I'm withholding the numerous plot differences between the two, as I hope you'll discover them for yourselves, but as a teaser, the hero is going to visit his daughter, not his wife... <br /> <br />The film's screenplay, I think, is a masterpiece of action film writing. Good dialogue, nice exposition, decent plot twists. But the book is not that story; it's waaaay different. It has a different bent, and works equally well. <br /> <br />Thorp writes action well, so many scenes play out vividly in your imagination, without the help of the movie's imagery.  <br /> <br />There are enough differences that I wasn't sure how the book was going to end, and you won't be sure either. Prepare for an unexpectedly pleasurable reading experience...	2005-01-03

Wow. Talk about an eye-opening experience. <br /> <br />If you want to know what really happened...actually, not only \\"what\\", but \\"why\\" and \\"how\\"...this is the sum-total of all the information the United States has been able compile and analyze. <br /> <br />The first most amazing thing about this book, and there are several, is how readable it is for a government report. Not only is it well written, it is carefully written. \\"Careful\\" meaning \\"with care\\" and not \\"cautious\\". Effort was made to create a document that everyone can read and learn from. <br /> <br />The segments of the book are fairly discrete...the events of the day, examining the rise of Islamist terrorism, the history of Bin Laden, the details surrounding our responses not only that day but in the weeks that followed.  <br />There are dozens of people to keep track of, and with the many Arabic names, it was initially a little difficult (for this \\"Westerner\\") to keep up. <br /> <br />Fortunately, the authors do two things to help: a \\"roster\\" of sorts as an appendix, and a pattern of referring to previous key chapters when discussing certain events. <br /> <br />There is so much the common American knows about that day, yet it is truly the proverbial \\"tip of the iceberg.\\" Besides the cold facts, the authors present analysis and perspective. They manage to collate and sum up previous passages as they go along, to create a dynamic read...compelling as well as educational. <br /> <br />And this is unbelievably educational. I learned so much about Islam, Bin Laden, the Middle East, domestic and foreign policy, military and intelligence protocols and tactics...you will discover when talking to people about this book (and you WILL want to talk to people...trust me...) you will find they are startlingly unaware of what really happened that day. <br /> <br />A few tidbits that I find most interesting: <br />The terrorists didn't defeat our security system, they managed to get on board by complying with it.  <br/>There is more than ample evidence that the fourth plane was downed by the attackers in response to the heroic passengers, and was in fact headed for the White House. <br />There really is no connection to Iraq whatsoever. <br />Clinton was worried about Bin Laden throughout most of his presidency, yet his concerns met with many over-cautious or under-concerned ears. <br />While there are glaring problems which allowed this to happen, the truth is that we found this sort of event \\"beyond our consciousness\\".  <br />Like, hijackers hijack, they don't aim.  <br />Terrorists blow up planes, but as of yet, not while they're ON them.  <br />Foreign \\"incoming\\" threats don't come in from over Pennsylvania.   <br />The Middle East seems very \\"far away\\" to Americans; America is \\"too close\\" for many of those in the Middle East. <br />Of all the colleges and universities in the United States of America, on September 11th, only SIX offered courses/degrees in learning the Arabic language. <br /> <br />I honestly feel this is a book that needs to be read by any American who cares at all about what happened. It's almost your duty, if you are ever to form an opinion on what has happened to our country since then, to read this book. <br /> <br />An argument could be made that it was ignorance that got us to where we are today. This single book could do a lot to prevent further problems.	2005-01-02

Just like the title says, here's the Whedon-and-most-respected-company tweaking of the BTVS film into what would be now considered the true Buffy-verse. <br /> <br />It comes not in a TV episode, nor a film, nor a novel...but in the comic book, and somehow it feels like that's where it should have started. It fits this format perfectly. <br /> <br />A synopsis is pretty much unnecessary, as there are many noted above and below, yet the great thing about this little story is that it fleshes out the Buffy Summers character nicely. <br /> <br />In quick, deft images and dialogue, much of Buffy's pre-Slayer history is vividly portrayed. Family relationships, educational priorities, social ideologies...you get a fuller picture of the immediate pre-Sunnydale Buffy that dovetails precisely with the TV show. <br /> <br />I am finding that this universe created by Joss Whedon is one that can be entered in a variety of ways (TV, comics, novels...) yet maintain depth and integrity. I cannot think of too many other concepts that can manage that. <br /> <br />The absolute WORST thing about reading this tome is that now I have obligated myself to get ALL of them...quite a bummer, no?	2005-01-01

So this is the legendary source material for an increasing large portion of our popular culture. <br />This is what is called the first true American Fairy tale. <br />What I found it to be, in my particular experience, is a fascinating artifact...almost like finding an elusive Egyptian papyrus or something. <br />My initial exposure to the story of Dorothy and friends came, as most of us since 1939, from the classic film. The differences between the two keep the book continually surprising, or if not totally surprising, let's just say \\"fresh\\". <br />It has a nagging episodic quality, but about half of the episodes were new to me, so I didn't care. <br />Discounting the Broadway and film versions of the musical \\"The Wiz\\", my next contact with Oz came from the breathtaking Broadway musical, \\"Wicked\\". That show knocked me for a loop, and I wept as the curtain fell. It's a terrific show. <br />I sought out the source book for THAT show, Gregory Maguire's novel of the same name, and found a masterpiece. Much darker and deeper than the musical, it's a head-spinning \\"back story\\" to the Wicked Witch that explores themes like totalitarianism, racism, and the true nature of evil. It's not a casual read...with Dickensian detail and difficult concepts, it is one of the more rewarding reading experiences I've had in a long, long time. <br />Which brings me to the thing that started this whole thing over a hundred years ago. <br />For me, this was a pretty cool way of being exposed to the Oz universe, because I (perhaps erroneously) feel like I know \\"the whole story.\\" The characters have more depth than the book offers, and I feel I know things, say, about the minor character Boq or the Winged Monkeys, that readers didn't know at the turn of the last century. <br />It's a great reading experience if you get the hardcover with all the original illustrations and typesets, as that will transport (just like the tornado did Dorothy...) you back to when a book was your only window into a wonderful universe. <br />One great thing about this is that there are many more books to seek out...can't wait to get more of the story!	2004-12-24

This beautifully written walking tour of lower Manhattan was an absolute pleasure to read, and halfway through, I knew I would be reading it again. <br />Mr. Hamill brings to life the part of Manhattan from Battery Park to Times Square, in a way where you somehow visually experience the change from the Dutch settlement to the sky-scraping metropolis it is today. It's like a time-lapse film, in prose. <br /> <br />I am one of those people who have only recently discovered New York. My wife and I have gone twice this year (traveling from SoCal), to simply spend two or three days soaking up that city buzz. Broadway, fine meals, touristy sight-seeing, casual walks...we have fallen in love with the city. This book puts my feelings into words. <br /> <br />There are historical facts you were aware of, yet have never considered in quite such a manner, and there are historical facts you had no idea ever existed. You will find a host of both here. <br />Hamill's prose is simple yet beautiful; a reporter with an eye for art. <br /> <br />When the Queen Mary pulled into the harbor in the mid-40's, every inch packed with returning WWII GI's, Hamill writes how the roar from the city could be heard in heaven. He allowed  me to hear that.  <br />He allowed me to visit the squalid Times Square, the one I'll never have to see, safely from the comfort of my recliner. He invited me into buildings that I'll never be able to explore anymore, since they've now long gone. <br />Better yet, he has exposed me to places I've surely walked by, but never considered. I feel the need to go find them; I need to give those places the respect and attention they deserve. <br /> <br />When I return to NYC, I'll have this book with me. I'm going to re-read it on the plane flight over, and I'm going to carry it with me as my wife and I stroll along those glorious avenues. <br />This time, I'm going to reach out and touch those buildings and monuments I never \\"considered\\", and see them with new eyes, Hamill's.	2004-12-19

I guarantee you that words will fail when trying to convey the out-of-left-field greatness that \\"Wicked\\" happens to be. <br />Mind you, I saw and loved the musical...this is not the musical. No way.  <br />This is not a book for children. There's violence, language and sex, all frankly described. <br />This is a fascinating and hypnotizing look at the nature of evil, commenting on totalitarianism, racism, economic and political thought...all set in a universe totally familiar. <br />That familiarity enables Maguire to flip you on your head with a few deft phrases, and there you'll stay for the remainder of the book. It's deep and dark. <br />Its' labyrinthine quality is Dickensian, yet utterly contemporary. It is not a book you'd want to read quickly. The language and ideas are meant to be savored like a fine meal. <br />Since my initial exposure was via the musical, the variations that occurred during adaptation were striking, but both are fully viable. The book and the musical are different in tone, in plot and in character, as they should be. I sort of took the musical, especially its' ending, to be like Maguire's \\"happy\\" tweak on the material. He was heavily involved with the creation of the musical, and having experienced both, it shows. For the better. <br />For those of you who have seen the show, here are a few (but not all) of the \\"tweaks\\". First, Glinda is not as prominent as she is in the musical. The tin man is not who you think, nor is the scarecrow. The origin of her castle is fully developed (without you even knowing...what an author this Maguire is!) and the Wizard is...well...THAT you should read for yourself. But if you think about how the Wizard character enters into the world of Oz, and becomes it's \\"leader\\", you'll have a clue. <br />I will say that the book is more well-thought-out than the musical; every detail locks into place later in the book. The musical, honestly, had a few little holes...but I was too involved to even notice.  <br />Themusical, while skimming over a few ideas (hence the hole-y-ness), has such wonderful songs and a head-spinning, deliriously cool ending, I found myself on the brink of tears more than once.  <br />I would say that the show's center is the relationship of Elphaba and Glinda. The book's center is all Elphaba. <br />There. If you liked the show, read the book. You must. They amplify each other.	2004-12-13

This was my first Connelly book, and safe to say I'm totally hooked.<br /><br />From reading about his other books, this is one of his non-Bosch books, and as such, was a fortunate place to begin.<br /><br />What we have here is an old-fashioned page turner. A bare bones summary would be a Denver reporter loses his twin brother cop to suicide, purportedly over a particularly disturbing, unsolved homicide. As he copes, the reporter learns about a number of police suicides, with several seeming related.<br /><br />At that point in the novel, it becomes a struggle to put the book down. I had to remind myself to slow my reading so I wouldn't miss anything, yet I was tearing through the pages as fast as I could. You won't want to be bothered by anything else for a few hours.<br /><br />The manhunt is breathlessly told, and becomes scarier as you peek into the mind of the perpetrator. Comparisons to \\"Silence of The Lambs\\" are understandable, but unfair. Honestly, this book isn't as good as THAT one, but it doesn't miss by much. Lector is nothing like the Poet; they're two different animals.<br /><br />The final quarter of the book is best read at night, or better yet, like 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, with only a lamp illuminating the page. It's a bit thrilling when the pieces fit together so unexpectedly yet neatly. There's a satisfying click to each piece of the puzzle as it fits into place.<br /><br />Here's my big problem: the paperback edition I read ends with a several-page peek at his recent book, \\"The Narrows.\\" If I'm not mistaken, characters from this book make it into that one, but somehow dovetails with his other books, of which there hae been seven or eight in between.<br /><br />My problem then is that I have one heck of a lot of reading to do...	2004-10-23

During elementary school, 1972-1976, baseball was myth to me. The players were larger than life. Baseball cards were treasured. The World Series was something I looked forward to every year. I loved my Dodgers. I read Baseball Digest. <br />I studied those baseball cards and Digests, and I got the impression that this Bob Gibson guy was pretty good. <br />A few years later, I noted he was in the Hall of Fame. <br />Years passed, I did the whole medical school thing, yadda yadda yadda and baseball got away from me. The strike didn't help. <br />Then, whether it was the McGwire/Sosa chase, or I was just ready to come back, my interest in baseball expanded. Now I was reading every book I could on the subject. <br />A grateful patient gave me an autographed baseball. I've never owned an autographed baseball, but I must admit, holding it felt like I was holding something with a strange energy. It was charmed. Almost magical. <br />It was signed by \\"Bob Gibson\\". (He gave me another signed by Lou Brock too...) <br />I went back and found my old baseball cards, and then sought out older Gibson cards. <br />Then I found this book. <br />This is a highly opinionated, often bitter, tell-it-like-it-is autobiography from a pitcher so good, they changed the game. They actually physically changed baseball because Bob Gibson was too good. <br />I simplify, but only a bit. <br />I smiled reading the account of his childhood, in Omaha, Nebraska.  <br />That's where I went to medical school...at Creighton, which is where Mr. Gibson went. <br />He was a player who only wanted to win. To compete. To dominate. <br />AND he played for The Harlem Globetrotters. Seriously. Right before he joined up with the Cardinals. <br />He spent his entire career with the Cardinals. I wish people stayed with their teams more nowadays. You'll read about his fight against racism and bigotry; he followed bravely in Jackie Robinson's footsteps. They're cut from similar cloth.  <br />He became the most feared pitcher in baseball. <br />Not because he was unafraid to use the brushback, which he did and did well. It was because batters often felt beat as they stepped into the batter's box. He would routinely strike out the side on ten or eleven pitches. He pitched complete games, even when they went into extra innings. He won twenty games a year, regularly. <br />Then came 1968. He was, as it is said, the Pitcher of The Year in the Year of the Pitcher. Only five players hit over .300 that year. Gibson's league-leading ERA was 1.12. That's almost not fair. <br />He mentions how proud he was of the fact that he could hit; he's the last pitcher to win 20 games and hit over .300 as well.  One year, he hit more home runs than any other Cardinal but two. Yes, a sad comment on the lack of power amongst the rest of the team, but still. <br />He is sometimes profane, controversial, thorny, uncompromising but somehow still admirable. <br />I think his prickly personality may have overshadowed his amazing career. He defends himself (as if he needs defending) but remains unapologetic.  <br />I couldn't stop reading this book.  <br />He is an essential character in the story of baseball. He is the link from old style, confrontational, rough and tumble baseball of the 40's and 50's and the power pitchers of today. I'm talking specifically Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson and perhaps Eric Gagne. <br />He was overpowering. His legend deserves better. <br />Read this book.	2004-09-02

He truly is a central figure in American civil rights; he might be the single most important figure, more so than MLK.<BR>Jack Rooselvelt Robinson was a well-educated (at UCLA), impossibly skilled athlete who entered the national pastime when very little else held the attention of our country as a whole.<BR>Baseball, for all intents and purposes, was the only sport there was. Football, baseketball, hockey...all in their early stages. Baseball reflected the USA.<BR>And in the post-WWII era, our country was in pretty good shape overall. Life was good.<BR>Then came this one man who challenged the conventional wisdom of the time, and by sheer force of will, changed the way millions of people thought about millions of other people.<BR>And not specifically because he was black.<BR>It was because he was amazing.<BR>Rookie of the Year at age 28. He only played relatively few years, not making the trip out to L.A. from Brooklyn. He died prematurely, ravaged by diabetic complications.<BR>He changed the world in a year. People came to see the &quot;black Dodger&quot;. That lasted a year. Then people came to see &quot;Jackie Robinson&quot;. Race not an issue anymore.<BR>He was the last (the only) player who would get caught in a rundown...a &quot;pickle&quot; as we used to say as kids...and the outcome would actually be in question. Normally, the runner gets tagged out. Every time. A foregone conclusion.<BR>With Jackie, with his stops and starts, head fakes and body lunges,it was a fair fight so to speak. You'd wonder who really had the advantage.<BR>This guy stole HOME from time to time. Home. The single most electrifying stunt possible in a baseball game. The guy tried to beat THE PITCH home. And sometimes he did!<BR>His life needs to be part of every child's basic history education.<BR>He's a hero.	2004-07-16

Roger Kahn's &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; may very well be the best book written about baseball. It certainly lies in the Top Ten of any self-respecting baseball fan's own personal list. It is beautifully written, often poetic. It is elegiac yet alive and vibrant.<br />The book is neatly split into two parts. The first is a reporter's account of his own love of baseball, specifically the Brooklyn Dodgers, while growing up there. The era comes alive with descriptions of his neighborhood, of the city, of what baseball meant to kids at that time.<BR>Of how baseball bonded fathers to sons, children to adults, neighbors.<BR>In that scenario, imagine the fortune of this young reporter who gets the dream job to end all dream jobs: follow the Dodgers. <BR>You get to watch baseball, played by your favorite team and then write about it. And get paid!<BR>It's a lovely evocation of the time...things aren't like the way they used to be. The earth doesn't stop rotating when the Dodgers come back in the bottom of the ninth.<BR>It used to.<BR>You get a sense of how important and vital the Dodgers were to that community. Daily conversations were incomplete without a mention of last night's game. Stickball was everything. A glove was gold. <BR>The parts about being a member of the press in Manhattan for a big newspaper are terrific. I swear I could hear the chattering typewriters, the traffic outside the window, the tinkling of ice in a bar glass...you are there. As the golden era of baseball was ending, so was an era of newspapers. Soon TV would supersede the papers as the way to get your news. The influence of the newspapers on public opinion (and vice versa) would never again reach the heights they did here.<BR>As history, there is no better concise snapshot of that hallowed Jackie Robinson era than this book.<br />The second half of the book has Mr. Kahn travelling around the country decades after the Brooklyn team has ceased to exist. He finds the players...Gil Hodges, Jackie,Pee Wee, Duke, Clem, Erskine, Billy Cox...and gives us a separate little chapter on each player. We find out what has happened after baseball for them, Campanella's injury, Robinson's and Erskine's family problems, if they stayed with baseball (Hodges) or got completely away from it (Cox)...<BR>...it finishes the story of that Brooklyn Dodger team. It also gives Mr. Kahn a chance to return to that era and write about it from the perspective that age and time will frequently offer.<br />If you love baseball, and you love to read, there is no better book. Sure, an argument could be made for a Halberstam book, or someone's well written autobiography, but they would be coin flips.<BR>&quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; may arguably be equalled, but I doubt if it will ever be bettered.	2004-07-04

Fans of science fiction know how great this book is. If you consider yourself a fan of SF, and have not yet read this book...<BR>...you are missing a cornerstone of the genre.<BR>I was. I felt like an idiot after inhaling this book in a few short hours. How could I have neglected this for so long?<BR>Yes, it's about the potential relationship between humans and robots, and addresses several near-theological questions about that relationship.<BR>The book is comprised of several short stories written by Asimov in the fifties, linked via a plot device that works fairly well (an interview).<BR>Each chapter reads like a novella or short story, and some display a fair amount of suspense. Some have an O. Henry type ending as well.<BR>They are prime examples of classic SF...they are so good they will convert those previously averse to science fiction. You will find yourself rethinking about your own beliefs about the soul, about God, about identity, about politics, industrialism, nationalism...and not in any sort of heavy-handed way.<BR>A truly amazing and eye-opening reading experience.	2004-05-13

I was born just as his career was fading, and he retired three years before my first Little League game.<BR>But the name &quot;Mickey Mantle&quot; always meant something. Like DiMaggio or Musial or Ruth, he represented a certain type of baseball &quot;hero&quot; that doesn't exist anymore. <BR>Mythic. Ethereal.<br />I decided to read this book in order to learn more about Mantle, and I have to say I learned quite a bit.<BR>Not all of it good.<BR>The book is written as if Mr. Mantle dictated it into a tape recorder, and was transcribed with minimal embellishment.<BR>He comes across as a plain, simple and often humble man. Not very bright, and not terribly insightful. The language is plain and monosyllabic. Fractured sentences and unfinished thoughts are sprinkled throughout the tome.<br />Knowing what we know now about his alcoholism and eventual death from liver failure, it's a little embarrassing to see him downplay these problems. Shockingly, his drunk driving accident that put his wife &quot;through the windshield&quot; and led to his wife needing &quot;a lot of stitches in her head&quot; is briefly mentioned in a half a page, as really &quot;scaring&quot; him. That's it. There are passages where he is almost boastful about his drinking...which are a little uncomfortable.<br />The book is slight and short. I found myself longing for more information, more detail, more of what it must have been like to be a Yankee at that glorious time in baseball history. Twelve pennants and seven Series in fourteen years? The Yanks OWNED baseball.<br />There are many enjoyable anecdotes regarding his fellow ballplayers...pranks, stunts, arguments, fights...that are the clear highlight of this book. He really doesn't have a bad word to say about anybody. Except maybe George Weiss.<BR>And that leads to the one thing I DIDN'T like about this book.<br />Mickey Mantle comes across as a little whiny. Especially about two things: his salary and his injuries.<BR>And you don't ever want to think of Mickey Mantle as &quot;whiny&quot;.<br />I realize the book was written in 1985. Things WERE totally different in the 50's. But to put so much emphasis on the annual salary negotiations, and to leave out so much good stuff about the actual game itself, is just plain wrong. There's no perspective.<br />Injury after injury gets recounted, with the same &quot;aw-shucks&quot; manner that infuses his less-detailed accounts of his MVP years; it's a bit numbing.<br />Since he's gone, we may never know what it must have been like to be Mickey Mantle. Perhaps had he involved his co-writer Herb Gluck more, or had Gluck been able to draw more out of Mantle, we'd have a better book. There's too much pity if you will and not enough glory.<br />Believe me, Mantle had enough &quot;glory&quot; in his life for half a dozen Hall of Famers. He truly is one of those legends whose reality justifies the myth. Maybe he wasn't the best person to write a book about Mickey Mantle, strangely enough.<BR>Did he ever understand how awesome...I use that word carefully and precisely...how truly awesome he really was to a whole generation? <br />I consider this merely a taste, a tantalizing glimpse, into the life of Mickey Mantle. I need to read more...I HAVE to.	2004-05-08

For  those of us who love baseball, who love the history of baseball, this book explains ourselves to ourselves. You will have complete and total empathy with the majority of the characters populating this tale.<BR>If you don't &quot;get&quot; baseball, this book may provide some insight.<br />Mr. Kinsella has written a highly original story, written so well some passages seem to sing, that addresses such human conditions as parental loss, unreserved trust, unquestioning love.<BR>And baseball.<BR>The line between reality and fiction is playfully drawn. The author and the protagonist have the same last name. J.D. Salinger and Shoeless Joe are real people.<br />The action such that it is centers around a magical ballfield created in the midst of a small Iowa farm. <BR>The book is filled with so many wonderful moments that listing them would be insulting to the book.<br />If you're familiar with the film, &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, then you know the story...but the book is so much fuller.

The key factor of the success of this book is that the first half was written in 1979. KISS was the biggest band on the planet, had peaked in their popularity, and was just about to start a tremendous career slump. The manuscript lay dormant fro a few decades until renewed interest sparked it's release.<br />The second half of the book consists of edited comments from band members, producers and sundry musicians, regarding all of their albums, songs and career choices. This half is fairly dry and clinical, but for those of you unfamiliar with their later phases, indispensible.<br />Let me return to the first portion of the book. What struck me was the singlemindedness displayed by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons from day ONE.<BR>These guys had a plan and despite all odds, took themselves to the top. They were driven. I found their biographies to be fascinating...how they got be who they are.<br />I was the perfect age to be a KISS fan in the seventies. I loved comics. I was in junior high. My father took me to the L.A. concert that was recorded for &quot;Alive II&quot;<BR>I still have the &quot;I Was There&quot; button.<BR>I am the person this book was written for.<br />Having said that, I loved following the development of their &quot;act&quot;. <BR>Wanting only to &quot;rock&quot;. Wanting only to entertain. Wanting to do something that no one had ever seen. I was impressed by their dedication to the concept of KISS.<BR>I was also impressed by their candid comments. When they screw up, they're the first to speak up. When they got a bit too full of themselves, they tell you exactly when that happened. <BR>The tensions between the two &quot;factions&quot; within the group, Paul/Gene vs. Ace/Peter is well described, and all of them are brutally about the faults of their bandmates as well as themselves.<br />Business ruthlessness or substance abuse, everybody's vice is on display here. Not in any tabloid sensationalistic fashion, but as clear sober history.<br />The album-by-album, track-by-track notes section is awesome for fans like myself. I joined the &quot;KISS Army&quot; between the &quot;Alive&quot; albums. &quot;Destroyer&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot; and &quot;Love Gun&quot; were albums I knew inside and out. Played them 'til they were grooveless. I've developed a new appreciation for that era of their music. There's stuff here I didn't know or hadn't considered.<br />I enjoyed this book far more that I anticipated, and I anticipated that I was gonna like it a lot.	2004-04-02

Truman Capote essentially creates the nonfiction novel here in the harrowing \\"In Cold Blood.\\" He vividly recounts the horrific murders of the Clutter family, the capture of Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, and their subsequent trial.<BR>It is known Mr. Capote had extensive contact with pretty much all the key individuals, allowing us into the disturbed and disturbing minds of the killers. It's an unnerving journey, yet one well worth taking. The prose is not flowery, but still elegant. It's an easy read, but better savored when taken slowly. The wealth of detail comes from the enormous amount of research done by the author, who conveys said information most effectively. You'll get goosebumps. More than once. It's not totally pleasant.<BR>This stands as one of the most important books of the 20th century, not just for quality, but for influence.

Despite being nearly one hundred years old, \\"The Sea Wolf\\" reads like a modern adventure thriller, only with more formal English vocabulary and sentence structure.<br />The book opens breathlessly, like you are flipping TV channels and happened upon a spectacular action set piece, with Humphrey Van Weyden involved in a sea accident/capsize, and \\"rescued\\" by a passing sealing schooner, helmed by the title character, Wolf Larsen.<br />Immediately, the reader is placed within the sealing vessel itself, and as Van Weyden is clueless about the sea, so are we. His experience is our tutorial. We learn the harrowing lifestyle of the sealing industry circa 1900 (the author having personal experience, reportedly).<br />The claustophobic details of the ship contrast the vastness of the sea. The more cerebral \\"Hump\\" (as he's called) is alone amongst the id-like crew. Furthering my Psych 101 analogy, Larsen appears to espouse the benefit of the primal, yet does so with an eloquence that betrays any sort of simple association. The fact that he is well-read and speaks thoughtfully (if heartlessly) suggests the reason he is the \\"leader\\" of said crew, and a successful seaman, may lie in the understanding and control of instinct, impulse, nature.<br />Anyways, that is probably a lot of folderol. What you have is a struggling protagonist, an evil slavedriving captain, plenty of duplicitous henchmen, and halfway through, a pretty maiden.<br />There are a half-dozen or so amazing seagoing escapades (and I didn't understand one lick of all that \\"jib\\", \\"topmast\\", \\"poopdeck\\" stuff...nor did it matter...) and finally an extended Crusoe-like sequence on an island to tidy things up.<br />Seriously, this deserves every accolade thrust upon it. It has been named \\"one of the 100 greatest books\\", and a \\"literary classic\\", and a \\"masterpiece of American literature\\"...whatever.<br />It's simply a great read. You'll kick yourself for waiting so long to have read it.<br />I did.	2003-12-07

The author of two previous Springsteen bios (\\"Born To Run\\" and \\"Glory Days\\"), Mr. Marsh has fused the two into a very satisfying history of what may very well be the only rock artist to age with grace and relevance in the public eye, yet maintain his unbreakable bond with his fans.<br />The first tome covered Bruce's career up to \\"The River\\", the second his explosion into the public awareness caused by \\"Born In The USA\\".<br />Now, with some judicious paring and streamlining, Marsh has crafted an account of an impossibly passionate and driven man, who knew as a teenager what he wanted to do, and proceeded against all odds to do exactly that.<br />The book is inspirational much in the same way Springsteen's music is inspirational. Bruce can somehow evoke universal feelings, or make broad statements, by using precise lyrics with cinematic musical accompaniment. The Springsteen saga from small town New Jersey to international fame (and not insignificantly, back to New Jersey) is not exactly \\"rags to riches\\" or \\"the little engine that could\\", but it's sure close.<br />Springsteen the man (as opposed to the musician) is depicted not as a saint, perhaps, but certainly virtuous and often quietly heroic. Allowing for a modicum of journalistic variability, the accounts surrounding his initial entry into the \\"music business\\", the career-stalling lawsuit of the mid-seventies, and the relatively \\"brave\\" idea to release a demo tape of haunting tunes essentially \\"as is\\", all create an image of an artist \\"sticking to his guns\\".<br />Springsteen feels authentic, fresh...real. His efforts towards the needy, the Veterans, the homeless, the hungry were not promotional gimmicks, but clearly based on the belief that \\"nobody wins unless everybody wins\\", an idea found throughout the book. Too many people talk about doing something. Here we have somebody who simply went out and did it. It's presented not in any glorifying manner, more as a personal mission. There but for the grace of God go I. I can help so I shall. It's heartening to know that someone who's such a mythic figure to many, actually may really be a decent guy.<br />Each of his albums, from \\"Greetings...\\" to the massive \\"Live 1975/85\\" gets a fairly detailed history...what was happening not only with Bruce, but with America and with the music business at the time...providing sufficient context for the music. The peek into their genesis is fascinating...how albums are constructed, what \\"works\\" and what doesn't...even the difficulties of the actual record cutting process or creating an album cover...I ate it up with a spoon. \\"Integrity\\" is another word that keeps coming to mind while reading this. Bruce always seems to maintain his, and no more so than during his concerts. Live shows, both here and abroad, illustrate the uncommon bond between Bruce and his audience, and here Marsh nearly places you in the arena.  He does an amazing job of making the performance come alive on the page. If you have ANY familiarity at all with Springsteen, it'll play like film in your head.<br />The E Street band gets a lot of print, but I could have used more. They come across as characters drawn vividly with few brushstrokes, but I would have loved to know more about the Big Man, the Professor, Phantom Dan, the Mighty One and Miami Steve. The names alone conjure up images of a rock n' roll group of superheroes.<br />An enormous part of Bruce's history took place from circa \\"Tunnel of Love\\" to \\"The Rising\\", much of it I personally would love to hear more about. It's all crammed into a paltry 24 pages at the end of a dense 677 page book. It should be another whole book. I feel \\"The Rising\\" album and tour are not given enough credit. They're short-changed, underplayed. I think time will prove to be more generous, and future editions of the book will more than likely amplify what's written here.<br />So I guess my complaint is that I wish the book was longer, which if you think about it, may be the highest possible compliment I can pay.compliment I can pay.	2003-11-17

Baseball was more serious.<BR>Take players like Maris and Mantle, or Gibson and Brock.

The hardships Gibson and Brock went through can only be imagined by today's players. Mantle's brittle knees almost have their own personality here.<BR>Yet the power of a Gibson pitch or a Mantle home run comes across perfectly in Halberstam's prose.<BR>Also, he proves the theory that there is no other sport contest more inherently dramatic (in a literary sense) than a classic pennant race.<BR>This is a pleasure to read.	2003-11-04

A breezy little read, John Buchan's &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; was quite the success in its' day, and has apparently never been out of print. <BR>The book is an example of an author being not so concerned where the story ends, but in having a lot of fun actually getting there.<BR>Hitchcock's film, liberally quoted in other reviews, is a marvel, and should be required viewing by pretty much everyone. But it's about 50% different than the novel, keeping about half of the stuff found between these pages.<BR>That makes reading the novel after seeing the film an unexpectedly surprising experience. The plot justs gallops along, one adventure and colorful character after another. Buchan's evocative and picturesque Scottish highlands breathe. His cocky hero, Richard Hannay, is a joy to follow. I had no idea there are FOUR subsequent novels featuring Hannay, which I now proudly own, in spectacular Folio editions!<BR>One last thing: the &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; mentioned comes only from the decidedly evil character (and is totally within character), and not seen anywhere else in the novel.<BR>This is not a classic in the &quot;heavy, literal, dense, highbrow&quot; sense. This is a classic that you can imagine thousands of people, early in this century, having just the best time reading.	2003-09-04

I buy every hardcover the day of release.<BR>Understand? I LOVE Clancy books.<BR>I believe this book will be universally described as his worst. First, there's no Jack Ryan...it's Jack Ryan Jr now. And although many critics have vilified Clancy for his apparently poorly defined or delineated characters, I always disagreed. Until now.<BR>Ryan Jr. is a nothing. And his cousins, the two other main characters, are mildly entertaining, but no more. The honorable supporting characters are gone, from Jack's wife to Ed to Pat to pretty much everybody!<BR>Another thing I miss is the moment (or moments) where your mouth drops agape at a turn of events. Some amazing and awesome \\"thing\\" happens that just blows your mind. Each book so far has had at least one; some have, like, FOUR.<BR>Clancy does a frightening job of describing a terrorist attack on a mall, and his description of a guy dying from succinylcholine will be a classic.<br />But a \\"huge\\" moment? Nothing.<BR>Actually, the book peters out at the end...no big climax or anything...and abruptly ends. I literally said out loud, my wife wondering if I'm insane...\\"Is this it?\\"...as I finished the book.<BR>I promise I will take this all back if the second half of this story is published in the next six months...<BR>...and...I must say...I will still buy each and every Clancy book the day it comes out. This book doesn't put you off Clancy altogether, it's just sort of disappointing.	2003-09-01

Against all odds, J.K Rowling has produced a masterpiece.<br />Her writing has matured along with her characters, the humor is funnier, the suspense more exquisite and the surprises still shock.<br />From the adult perspective, I found myself laughing out loud. Then staring transfixed at a certain line revealing a shocking plot twist. Then breathlessly tearing through page after page just to see what happened next.<BR>There is a reason that the Potter phenomenon exists. There is a reason that this will be the seminal literary event for an entire generation of children. There is a reason that more people read this book than did almost anything else this weekend.<br />The reason, simply put, is that this is the best reading experience this planet has ever had.  That fact is pretty much inarguable.<br />With tremendous regret, I finished the last page late last night, still wishing for more.  An 870 page novel I didn't want to end. A series I will be very sad to see completed. <br />We are going to have to realize that this is a cultural event we will probably never see again in our lives. <br />Be a part of it. For yourself and for your kids. <BR>There is no Harry Potter \\"hype\\". It's real. This is the real thing.	2003-06-26
US	51282561	R1MAMOW8I02HQJ	0613448758	242035412	Natural	Books	4	6	8	N	N	A graceful parable.	&quot;The Natural&quot; is a quiet, contemplative novel that uses the mythology of baseball to frame a poetic parable of fate...of the idea of &quot;what could have been.&quot;<BR>Baseball, more than any other sport, has a history composed equally of fact and legend. That's its' charm. Using that gauzy place between the real and the myth, Malamud tells the tale of Roy Hobbs, the greatest baseball player who ever lived, but who hardly ever played.<BR>Hobbs' life, at least the part we are privy to, is shaped by his decisions and actions surrounding three women. They each, and I'm reducing this to absurdity, represent a basic ideal: home-spun decency, harsh reality and seductive temptation. It could be said that where he ends up at the end of the novel is determined solely by the choices he makes regarding each woman. His character becomes better defined as the reader discovers Hobbs' feelings towards each as well.<BR>It's difficult not to see Robert Redford's face in the mind's eye, nor to hear Randy Newman's music in the background whilst reading the book. Those images and sounds have penetrated popular culture so deeply, it doesn't matter if you haven't seen the movie.<BR>Read the book first, then see the movie. They actually make the other better.	2003-05-26

I was surprised when I read a fellow reviewer's missive when he referred to Hemingway's &quot;lean, adjective-free style&quot;. I was surprised because the images from this book seemed so unbelievably vivid...but that person is exactly right. His prose doesn't tell you anymore than you need to know, but somehow tells you everything. It's kinda weird, actually.<BR>You can read the exemplary summations for yourself, but I thought I could smell the dust during the bullfights while reading the last half. A plot summary of this tome may seem  slight, but I don't think that was the point. It's clearly the telling of the story, not the story itself, to which people respond.<BR>I love the fact that so many readers interpreted things from the book in so many different ways...yet all with equal enthusiasm and zeal. That phenomenon should tell you more than someone simply giving a &quot;great review.&quot; This is a relatively short book that can (and should) be read slowly, to savor every line. It will drop you perfectly in the midst of post WWI Spain. I look forward to the rest of the Hemingway canon, which I have yet to experience. This is a temporary situation.	2003-04-17

We are lucky to have had someone so gifted in prose be able to witness, and hence document, those giddy and terrifying experiences being an airman in WW I.<BR>Those wonderful primitive planes, flown by men who clearly &quot;pushed the envelope&quot; decades before our test pilots made that a well-known expression. <BR>This is memoir as literature; it is beautifully written with haunting and evocative phrasing. He knows how to write thrilling action pieces, as the dogfights have a &quot;you are there&quot; quality most authors fail to achieve.<BR>Lewis sprinkles in some philosophy (his father's influence), and the parts about technology and warfare are particularly striking given what's happening in the world today.<BR>The book straddles pro-war and anti-war sentiments so fairly and soberly, it should be required reading for everyone.  I mean everyone.<BR>Junior high kids to college students to grandparents. <BR>It's one of those books so well written, it reads effortlessly. I can't recommend this more highly.	2003-04-03

Any modern American crime novel worth it's salt can trace it's genetic lineage back to this book.<BR>To be initiated into the world of Raymond Chandler without formal introduction was an exhilarating experience. Yes, it's hard to not use the term \\"hard-boiled\\", as his work is often simplistically described, but it was so much more than that. Oh so much more. Or is it that most other hard-boiled writers offer so much less...?<br />First of all, I laughed. A lot. Do you know how difficult it is to write comedy? To write something that causes someone to laugh out loud? The dialogue here is to die for. To. Die. For.<br />I agree with others who compare Chandler's Los Angeles to Dickens' London. After reading those authors, it becomes second nature to imagine life there. You can see what exists beyond the page. Another exceedingly difficult feat to perform, but Chandler here makes it look effortless.<br />Most important, we see the creation of a character as indelible as Holmes in Phillip Marlowe. Chandler was lucky to have had Bogart play him in the film; it's a perfect match. You see his face, deliver these lines with that voice, while you're reading this book. It's crime novel nirvana.<br />With his first novel, Chandler vaulted into the pantheon of great crime novelists. I think time has proven he's also a great American novelist.<br />His other six novels sit on my shelf, beckoning me as I type this...I gotta go now...	2003-03-30

Any student of comic history who hasn't read THUNDER Agents (as I was...) is clearly missing a significant part. It's like studying American History and skipping WW I. Yeah, most people find the Civil War and WW II more interesting, but WW I, as an event, gets more influential as time passes.<br />So does THUNDER Agents. Trying to imagine this sort of comic book coming out in the era that it did...it must have been head-spinning to some kid casually picking it out of the circular, rotating comic rack down at the local drug store. Interlocking stories, \\"personal\\" touches, fallible heroes...retrospectively hugely impressive.<br />Add this to your collection...and save space for the next few volumes. You've been warned.	2003-03-23

I've been entranced since &quot;The First Man in Rome&quot;, which was quite a while ago. I honestly wish this wasn't the end.<BR>Having said that, I found this one a little hard to get through. The dozen principle characters are well drawn and three dimensional, but the 752 other people who populate every corner of the novel kinda muddy the waters. Many seem superfluous, although those with a better classical education than I will no doubt enjoy their presence. There are passages which read so fast, I was left breathless. But there are also several passages where I literally had to back up, get some momentum, re-read a few pages, and hammer my way through.<BR>Caesar, Cato, Octavian, Brutus, Cicero...these portrayals are so vivid they will affect every non-fiction account about this time period I'll ever read.<BR>The worst thing I can say about this book is that now I have the urge to go back to Book One and start over. I hope she'll change her mind and take us through Octavian's life...I've got to go get some history books so I can find out what happens with him, Antony, Cleopatra, Caesarion...	2003-03-23

Nicely conceived idea, with the mini-series arc starting in the rubble of Ground Zero. The art will have non-comic-book people scratching their head in amazement, saying \\"I had no idea.\\"  When a plot point centers on the fact that the terrorist strike may have been an attempt to start WW III \\"in the Middle East\\", you'll gasp. Especially when this originally appeared a year ago or more...When Cap underscores his concern by stating, \\"In WW I, 90% of the casualties were military. In WW II, it was 50%. In WW III...?\\"...having to go back just to appreciate the artwork some more. A classy, classic read, and well worth your investigation.	2003-03-16

Dispel any thoughts about the tad-embarrassing Star-Wars-coat-tail film, and dive right into this whip-smart Cold War nuclear thriller. Bond, as he is in the novels, is flinty, flawed, desperate and yes, always heroic when need be. I just keep getting blown away at how three-dimensional Bond comes across in these books.<BR>I truly didn't know what I was missing. I've polished off the first three novels like potato chips, hungrily and ready for more.<BR>I guarantee you that if you pick up this novel, it will only be your first of the Flemings.

Here, in one loaded volume, are some of the best told stories of any kind, in the last year.

The script/screenplay/text and the art/cinematography/visuals I would put up against any type of media this year, or the last.<BR>This represents a great value, as you get quite a few issues in a handsome volume.<BR>The now-famous &quot;issue 36&quot; should be mandatory reading for anyone with at least one eyeball. It could possibly be the single best artistic/creative response to September 11th seen yet.

So the Bond saga continues, in this the second book of the series. I'm finding Bond to much more multifaceted in the books when compared to the films...and I do love those films! His &quot;relationship&quot; with Solitaire is nicely done here, and the finale...if filmed the way it was written...would have been one of the more thrilling moments in cinema history.<BR>The problem here, which will be insurmountable to many people's sensitivities, is the mid-50's pre-civil-rights attitude towards minorities. Political correctness, I feel, will one day be looked back upon by historians in nearly the same way as McCarthyism. It's an embarassing movement in American civil thought.<BR>That being said, the tone towards Africans/Black/whatever the proper term currently is...is antiquated to say the least, and may be offensive to many.<BR>The novel itself is a lightning read, much like Casino Royale, and you will wish for the day that these books...not just their titles...will be made into movies.	2002-12-19

Yes Bond usually ends up being &quot;tortured&quot; in some way, but not like this, my friends...<BR>You get an electric ripple up your spine as Bond describes the perfect martini, like you are present for some unbelievably momentous occasion but you're the only one who recognizes it as such.<BR>Ian Fleming was clearly a developing talent at this point, and now I feel impelled to start the next in the series (..looks like I won't be reading anything else for quite some time...) just to see what he comes up with!	2002-12-13
