Although the book is suggested for 12+, it's more appropriate for - and more appreciated by- an older audience. Tellingly, most of the 5 star ratings here are from adults; most of the reviews that are clearly from adolescents are 2-3 stars.    The story opens with a 15 year old self-mutilating anorexic girl being sent from her home in New York because her father and his pregnant girlfriend can no longer deal with her. She arrives at the English country house- straight out of every Enid Blyton story- of the aunt and cousins she has never met before. Within weeks of arriving she ends up losing her virginity to her 14 year old, cigarettte smoking, underage driving and toll evading cousin, in a house with no adults. And the story has only just started.    Actually, the best bit of the story starts with the outbreak of war. A lack of adult supervision becomes a lack of adult protection. Hunger as a way of getting attention gives way to real hunger. Longing to be taken care of gives way to the necessity of taking care of others. There are a few grisly war bits- people blown up in front of them, foxes eating corpses, etc.- but mostly we see glimpses of the dailyness of life in a war setting.     The book is certainly readable. For an older teen looking for something with a good dollop of angst to read at the beach it's no worse than a lot of other books.	2005-06-15

This book is a great book for reluctant readers- told in a loose poem form, it is highly readable, moves along quickly, and has a wonderful rhythm to it.  It is wonderful for children whose life is in flux (which means just about all 10-13 year olds- a tough age for books, as they have outgrown a lot of the children's books but are not necessarily ready for young adult books). Lots of emotional issues flow through the book, but it is still a good choice for children who are uncomfortable with too much intensity in books, as the writing is light and nuanced and the issues are handled with care. However, as another reviewer noted, it is completely different from Walk Two Moons. In our house, that was a good thing, but if you have major WTM fans in your house you might want to look at the preview pages first.	2005-05-19

Mrs. Gurewitsch was (apparantly) completely unthreatened by the strong, deep, and intimate (in the non-sexual sense of the word)relationship between her husband and the redoubtable Mrs. Roosevelt. She limns the outlines of the relationship gently, with great compassion for Mrs. Roosevelt and frank admiration for her many accomplishments. Still, this is not hagiography- Mrs. Gurewitsch tells her story with simplicity and affection, but is still clear eyed about her subjects human foibles.<br />Through her portrait, and through the extracts of letters to David, it becomes clear that the infamous Lorena Hickok letters must be read in the context of an era (and a woman), in which language was rather more effusive.<br />Like so many things about Eleanor Roosevelt, the book is a bit bittersweet, but she clearly had made her peace with life, and in the end Mrs. Gurewitsch has repaid Mrs. Roosevelt's trust and friendship. The book is not a comprehensive biography, but you may inspired enough by what you read that you go read one!	2002-11-14

This book is not made for people whose worldview is already cast in stone- there is no way that they would be able to endorse a book that sums itself up by saying \\"The fact that in this world there are so many people following so many different paths to God shows that there is no one right way.\\"<br />This book is a rarity in these times: a book that looks at the big picture, written in a clear, accessible but literate manner.  It does not talk down to the reader- precocious 9's will enjoy it, but so will adults.  It is a journey through the evolution of religion, from early concepts of powers beyond our own into increasingly structured and codified faiths. The summaries of the developments of the major world faiths of today are outstanding- they give a clear context and understanding in a very clear, succinct paragraphs.  Illustrations in a variety of styles support and augment the text beautifully.  <br />There are other books for teaching the specifics of different faiths, for every age range.  This book paints a picture of how the religions of today developed, and makes a strong case for tolerance of understanding and respecting other paths to God/ Enlightenment/ Truth etc.  Even the back cover quotes pitch in- I initially ignored them, assuming that they were the usual \\"this is a great book\\" blurbs, but instead they area fine selection of quotes from people as diverse as Frederick the Great and Thomas Paine.<br />If you are interested in a broader understanding of religion as a part of human society - for yourself or for your children- this is a great place to start.  And you may just find some things that lift your faith in the world at the same time.  This is a don't miss book for anybody who can accept the idea that there is more than one right answer.	2002-07-24

Larnel, dragged along by his mother to visit an elderly widowed neighbor (and the picture of him in his chair shows you all that you need to know about how he feels about being there!) surprises himself by feeling compassion for lonely Mrs. Katz. He brings her the runt of a litter of kittens, saying that nobody else wants it.  Mrs. Katz reluctantly accepts the kitten, on the condition that Larnel will help her learn how to care for it. He agrees, and a life-long friendship is begun.  <br />There are so many great parts to this book- the growing understanding about the things that we have in common, no matter how disparate our backgrounds, messages on ethnicity, on generational relationships, and so on- that you could get the idea that this is a 'good-for-you' book. But at it's heart Mrs. Katz & Tush is the work of a master storyteller and illustrator, and is a story that the children ask for again & again & again. Ours are still savouring it after 3 years, and show no signs of growing weary of it.  The illustrations- especially some of the expressions- are some of Polacco's best efforts.  Don't miss this one!	2002-04-01

The standard of information is rather higher than that in the Magic Tree house books, which is reasonable, given that they don't have to worry about plot & characters as well!  <br />If your child enjoys Magic Tree house, and would like to know more about the Amazon this is fine, but I would also recommend One Small Square: Tropical Rainforests (by Donald Silver). We took this with us to the rainforest (see review) and found it to be excellent.	2002-03-14

Each book takes the characters (siblings Jack & Annie) to another place and/or time to get a clue to solve a mystery or challenge. The mysteries come in 4 book units, so this box set gives one full story unit.  Our kids didn't really get that involved in the 'mystery' aspect, in part because we were getting them mostly from the library, which never seemed to have all 4 of a given mystery group. What they enjoyed was that it was a good easy chapter book, with many subjects or topics that were interesting to them.  <br />I would agree with the reviewer who complained about the standard of writing- it's not great- and would add that if your child is particularly well-versed in a topic in one of the books they are likely to find that they know more than is presented in the story. I would put these squarely at 1st grade level... The Boxcar children are regularly threatened by rather sinister types, and because the stories are seen to be more current, it can seem more frightening than something that is clearly happening in another time- Pharoic Egypt, dinosaurs, etc.).	2002-03-14

Each book is extensively illustrated with all of the inter-connected layers of life- from fungus to megafauna- in the Square. On the margin of most of the 2-page spreads are activities that you can do, no matter where you live. Food chains, life cycles & seasons are explored, and the back section has an identification guide to all of the life forms presented in the book.<br />We took One Small Square: Tropical Rain Forest with us on a trip to the Brazilian rainforest with our 5 & 7 year olds. The book was great- for the grown ups & the kids!  We used it as a guide to identify many of the animals & plants we saw, as background to help the girls understand what they were going to see, as reading on the long trips up the river. We did many of the activities- some before, some during, and some after the trip.  Our guide was so impressed with it that he ordered a copy for himself, saying that it was hard to find something with so much information that was both accurate and interesting to people at many different levels of knowledge. Highly recommended!	2002-03-14

This is a fun book w/ plenty of interesting little geography facts for slightly older kids (say, up to 2nd grade; maybe 3rd if they are not strong readers). American kids (at least those who aren't in Montessori programs) don't get much geography, and this is a fun way to broaden their horizons a bit. Our 6 y.o. thoroughly enjoyed reading through it on her own, quizzing us from time to time. Be prepared!	2002-03-14

One Order of Crow!: Inside the Strangest Presidential Election Finish in American History	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Wrap up the election once &amp; for all	If you were overwhelmed by the media circus around the Bush-Gore election season, Jeff Greenfield wraps it all up in a tidy package. A seasoned political observer, Greenfield is as obsessed w/ politics as many football fans are with sport. A long career on both sides of the fence gives him the experience &amp; perspective to see the big picture, and his innate sense of humour keeps it lively and not too ponderous.  He takes the issues seriously, but not the egos.  <br />One of the best features of the book is that it sketches out the run-up to the election, setting things into a framework.  I learned quite a bit about the implosion of Bill Bradley's campaign, for example, and the role that the fall out from that played in the Democratic campaign.  Also, the book is quite even-handed: he points out strengths &amp; weaknesses on both sides, from candidate to party.  If you take his precept- that the election was close because people really were divided- most readers will see another aspect to both the side they voted for &amp; the side they voted against.  Of course, if you are so partisan that you can't read anything less than perfect about your candidate or party- or anything good about the other side- w/out howling for blood, you'd probably best not torment yourself by reading Oh Waiter!<br />The book is a quick, fun read with plenty of humour as it pulls together a good portrait of the election &amp; it's afternmath. One reviewer felt that Greenfield should have been more critical of the role of the media, but I think that he was actually pretty even handed about that, as well.	2002-03-14

Remember your absolute favorite English teacher- the one who made English Lit, or poetry, or whatever come alive, so that you understood it, enjoyed it, wanted more of it? The one who knew endless interesting things about the writer, the world they lived in, and so on? Well, DK classics are like having a master class with that teacher. Instead of hitting The Odyssey for the first time in high school english, imagine already knowing the main characters, the main story lines and quite a bit about what was going on in the writer's world. <br />Obviously, if you are reading a review of it you are considering buying it.  And, from the heading & the stars you know that I think it's a good one.  My 2nd grader loves it.  My 15 year old nephew read & enjoyed it during the holidays, in preparation for starting The Odyssey at school.  My husband, who never did the Odyssey in school, really enjoyed it- and liked knowing what all the fuss is about finally! It is abridged of course, and a purist will have things to pick at, but then, a real purist would read it in Greek anyway... For the rest of us, this is a great introduction to a one of the foundations of our literary heritage.	2002-03-09

Books	5	666	676	N	Y	Everything you need to have fun...(and learn, too)	This is a great book, chock-a-block w/ very accessible experiments. One of the best features is the way the experiments are grouped together: a 'theme' (say, Acids, in the Chemistry section) will have a group of experiments of varying degrees of complexity that together add up to a pretty good understanding of  the concept.  Also, most of the materials are readily at hand- for many of them we really did already have everything in the house. This is esp. gratifying for the kids, who of course want to do the experiment *right now*.  I would imagine that home-schooling families would enjoy this, but our school-going kids enjoy doing these experiments after school & on weekends. <br />p.s., one of the easiest experiments is also a real showstopper, though it takes a couple of days to complete: dissolving the eggshell of an egg, leaving the egg inside intact!	2002-03-09

The DK Classics series is a great introduction to the a good range of classic books.  Having been raised as a purist, I was a bit uncertain about giving abridged versions of the classics to our kids, but re-reading some of the originals reminded me why some of these classics are loosing their shine- becoming historical artifacts, rather than living, engaging stories.  Robinson Crusoe is a prime example of this- although it is nearly an icon as a storyline, it was very much a product of it's time & place, and the world has definitely moved on! But with DK's always-excellent sidebars, giving historical perspective and making the text tangible, and a rather good abridgement, the story becomes possible even for youngish readers. Reviewers who have complained about it being long, slow, overly moralistic or religious should have a go at the unabridged version!<br />The best thing about this Robinson Crusoe- as well as The Three Musketeers and The Odyssey from the same series- is that our kids really enjoyed them, and are building a good background in writings that have shaped so much of how we view the world.  Perhaps they'll read the originals one day- almost certainly in a literature class- and if so they will start with a good understanding of the work.	2002-03-09

It breaks down the Bible, into sections and sub-sections. For example, it introduces the 1st 5 books of the Old Testament as the Books of the Law, explains why they are called that, the main points, the main people, an outline of what happens in each chapter- and then it goes a wonderful step further, and links in known historical information, a map of 'Where It All Happened', and other pertinent information about the world at that time.  The same format is followed for each Book of the Bible. Within each book there are small illustrations & summaries of the main events in each chapter, which are surprisingly well done- not off-putting to an adult, very accessible to a child. The reference materials at the end- a good dictionary of words that one doesn't often see outside of the Bible!, Bible geography, good time lines of the Old & New Testaments, and an amazing 16 pages of good color pictures tucked away at the end make this book a must!<br /> There are bits that are clearly written for children, and the section on 'Becoming God's Child' may or may not fit exactly with your view of things, but don't be put off by those: this is a great tool for getting to grips with a lot of information.	2002-01-29

The reviewer who suggested that it doesn't draw firm enough boundaries for 'manipulative' kids quite clearly missed the point, as is clear by his use of the pejorative word manipulative. In this book Kurcinka effectively moves the goal posts: identify your core values clearly and explicitly, holding your children to those, and then, within that framework, help them (and you...) develop the skills that we all need to cope in the world: knowing what we want, understanding the feelings that are driving our behaviour, negotiating for a reasonable outcome.<br />Kurcinka really does take a lifetime approach: helping us to help our kids (and sometimes ourselves) learn the skills that will help us deal with the inevitable and endless situations in which other people have different wants &amp; needs than our own. And her reminder that improvement, not perfection, is what we are looking for is reassuring on those 'bad-parent' days. That, with the humour &amp; stories of people making a bigger mess of it than you are found in her previous book, make this a wonderful, encouraging book. Don't miss it!	2001-10-19

This is a wonderful book for those of us with kids who are 'more'. The first thing that strikes you is the descriptions of the characteristics of 'more-ness': to see things that you assumed were peculiar to your child fit a pattern is very heartening! One of the very best things about this book (and there are many wonderful things)is a fresh take on language, and the importance of the language we use. As we change the vocabulary that we (and even more to the point, others) use in describing our spirited children, we begin to see the good parts of those traits. And the reminder that many of the things that are so difficult with a spirited child are the very things that we value in adults- that these challenging characteristics are really diamonds in the rough, and we can help our child refine them into the strengths that they should be is so heartening. <br />This was one of my 2 favorite 'be a better mom' books (along with the fabulous Marguerite Kelly's Mother's Almanac) until Kurcinka wrote Parents, Kids &amp; Power Struggles, which is overall even better! But- if you have a Spirited Child, start here and start early. You will appreciate it!	2001-10-19

So the fact that recruiting sites like monster.com aren't even mentioned can be blamed on the cruelties of time.  <br />But the rest of this books (many) limitations are harder to forgive.  The entire back half of the book consists of descriptions of a number of foreign markets that are on the level of a 5th grade research project: lots of data, most of which is irrelevant, and a few tiny cultural references.<br />The front half of the book is very pedestrian- I didn't see anything that isn't in any basic 'how-to' of recruiting, much less any &quot;Secrets&quot; of the &quot;Experts&quot;.  Since the people credited as the authors are from big-name companies I would guess that they had their underlings cobble together some bits &amp; pieces from corporate publications, industry journals, etc. into a book.<br />Save your money.	2001-03-12

This is a wonderful Bible for introducing children both to the world of the Bible- who these people were, how they lived, what their world was like- and to the Bible itself. It is great for families- plenty of visual  interest for smaller ones, great information for older ones, and wonderful  tellings of the stories for all.  A terrific present!	2000-02-28

The pictures are (as in all Dorling Kindersly books) wonderful and the text is just right for kids interested in the workings of a vet office.  The whole series is wonderful- they never talk down to the children, go smoothly from one level  to the next and are full of interesting information laced with a little  humor. Our 4 &amp; 6 year olds love them.	2000-02-28

But the concept is never really developed- we only see a juxtaposition of the two worlds in one brief  scene, and the adjustments required of the heroine are rather perfunctory.   The story quickly becomes a pretty scary chase story where there are no  safe places and all the adults- even the few well meaning ones- ending up  being frightening or intimidating to the children; the bad guys are very  wicked indeed, with explicit Nazi 'better race' overtones. The rationale  for their wickedness is lame at best.  Even the end is dispatched too  quickly, with no tying together of past and present or what this all means  to the parents, the children, or the family as a group.  Very  disappointing.	1999-09-08

It provides welcome comic relief from all those &quot;how to be a perfect parent&quot; books!	1999-03-14

Pre-schoolers get a lot out of it, and will get even more when they come  back to is as older children.  Don't miss it! (and push DK to do a  companion New Testament).	1999-03-14
US	52685853	R16Y48XF4KDQ4B	0385468776	666728325	The Mother's Almanac	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	The single best book on living with pre-schoolers.	The down side: dated in some places; doesn't focus much on situations specific to out of house moms.<br />The up side: everything else. The age/stage sections are great, there are tons of age specific suggestions  and tips.  But most of all, this book helps you remember and feel all the  wonder and joy of having small children- even though you are stuck in the  middle of a tough patch/stage whatever.  I re-read it regularly, because  her genuine delight and ability to help you see the humour has helped us  through more than one dark day!  I am *definitely* a much better mom  because of this book.	1999-01-28
US	52685853	R1IT1JJQ0RU2S3	1564581829	652983725	Conception Pregnancy & Birth	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	The only book you need until your baby is born.	This book gets you through every ache, pain, doubt and unknown, and always leaves you feeling excited about what's happening.  It was the only guide I had when expecting my first baby while living in rural Brazil- no baby  classes there!- with a doctor of dubious training (not to mention the  language problems)I clung to it throughout my pregnancy, and it never  failed me.  Buy it early, read it often and have a wonderful time! (then,  buy the Mothers Almanac by Marguerite Kelly, which is the only book you  need for after the baby comes!)	1999-01-28
