Gales has another friend who is helping without wanting to look like he is helping named Judd. The twist at the end about Judd was fun...	2005-07-19

The main character is a bland judgemental person. The plot lines are old, Andrea is so busy she did not pay enough attention to her boyfriend and best friend...so what? She is not a very likeable character. Miranda Priestley, outrageous as she is, was entertaining to read (which is a reason I gave 2 starts instead of 1), Andrea needs to develop some personality. I heard they are going to make a movie out of this, and glenn close might play Miranda, that would be hilarious. So go to the library and borrow the book, it is not worth buying!	2005-07-19

Even in the begining when Langdon was woken up by a phone call, the same story with the beginning of Da Vinci Code when he was woken up by the police asking him for help.  <br /> <br />With this in mind, I kept on reading but then after Langdon found another body, gruesomely murdered and then met his victim's daughter, I said enough. I am not interested to read more.  <br /> <br />I was really looking forward to this but I am not a fan of formulaic writing, especially for suspense, mystery type.	2005-02-01

Blow fly was a disappointment and this is not that different. <br /> <br />The whole Lucy scenario, Come On stop having her date this horrible women, there is so many bad, emotionally disturbed partner one can have. After a while it is like, get a different story line already. Already we have a very smart tortured heroine in Scarpetta and now Lucy too, seems like a unnecessary competition for stories. <br /> <br />And the whole story about Marino and the mom of missing girl. How lame is that, there is this whole suspense about what happened and he has all these scars and to end it without any closure seems so blah. <br /> <br />And Scarpetta used to cook more and talk about it more, it does not seem like it these days. After blowfly I was still interested in buying another book but now, library will be the way to go.	2005-01-04

I do agree with the other reviewer in terms of Sandini. How come he just went missing from the pages. It seems like when the character was first introduced, it was very strong and has high impact but then just went to zero.<br />Also it bothers me a lot that most of Judith McNaught's female leads have no sexual experience or if they do, they are portrayed as these uptight, rigid, low-self-worth women in bed. Understanding if it is a 18th century setting but the 19th or 20th century ones? C'mon...	2004-02-09
