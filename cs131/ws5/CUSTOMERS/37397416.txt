I own this book, and I would like to respond to the claim that the author plagiarized when writing this book.<br /><br />What happened is that the author chose to write a good book for the general reader while still trying to be highly authoritative. The book is well researched, drawing on the extensive amount of knowledge about Lincoln. At the back of the book he included footnotes to cite the research he used, but he only listed the page of his book where he used the material and not the specific paragraph. He did this to make his writing smoother and to write a good book for the general reader. So he did not steal anything. Unfortunately, this looseness with his citations resulted in mild charges of plagiarism.<br /><br />The plagarism charges were totally refuted. The people making the charges seemed to be simply trying to make the papers. A panel of historians reviewd the plagerism charges and found them to be completely unsubstantiated.<br /><br />The author is an expert on the era. His work is excellent. This is not a work of plagerism.<br /><br />I felt that the author succeeds brilliantly in portraying Lincoln. On the one hand, the book is very authoritative and factual. On the other hand, it reads well. I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Lincoln grew up poor and distanced himself from his childhood. He became a very successful lawyer. He had his failures and successes. As president, he seemed to many as a dumb baboon. So many things went wrong. He was continuously frustrated that he early general would not fight. He had to juggle the wishes of the radical Republicans with those of the conservative Republicans. Then there were the abolitionists and the Democrats. In the end, his leadership was excellent.<br /><br />This book is beautifully written, very informative, easy to read, and at times moving. You get a great sense of Lincoln's struggles and the distressing issues at hand You get to know most of the other players during Lincoln's epic moment in time. In my opinion, the author did not plagiarize in the true sense of that word but simply told the story with authority, yet in a way that is easy to read.<br /><br />Highly recommended for teenagers and up.<br /><br />I also recommend the most authoritative book on the Civil War \\"Battle Cry of Freedom.\\"me.

Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy, 1932-1945: With a New Afterword (Oxford Paperbacks)	Books	5	12	17	N	N	Encyclopedic, Bancroft Prize-Winning Book on FDR's Foreign Policy	This encyclopedic, academic book won the Bancroft Prize and is the best single-volume book on Franklin Roosevelt's foreign policy. Roosevelt was a very clever leader. He understood the importance of public opinion and balanced American idealism with realistic pragmatism. This book covers FDR's foreign policy - his aims, means, and results. Some of the highlights include the fact that FDR had to govern in an isolationist nation, which forced FDR to tactfully manage public opinion to deftly lead America out of isolationism and confront Hitler. Dallek describes looking at his foreign policy as looking through a kaleidoscope. It appears to make no sense until you see the mechanism behind the scenes. Another highlight is his effort to bring meaning to the war with his Four Freedoms. The ingenious Lend-Lease plan gave aid to Britain in a way that the public could accept - although with heated debate. He likened it to lending a hose to a friend with a house fire. He proposed this at great political risk, since opposition was heated and an election was approaching. But he won his policy and it was a landmark moment. Some people suggest that FDR's foreign policy was uneven and confusing, but that was mainly FDR's obtaining his goals in light of the political winds.<br /><br />For anyone interested in FDR's foreign policy I highly recommend this classic by Dallek, along with Conrad Black's masterpiece \\"Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom,\\" Burns's \\"Soldier of Freedom,\\" Langer's \\"The Challenge to Isolation,\\" Greenfield's \\"America's Strategy in World War II,\\" Kimball's \\"The Juggler\\" and Gerhard Weinberg's excellent \\"A World at Arms,\\" which emphasizes the diplomatic and political aspects.	2005-06-24

Pulitzer Prize	This scholarly, yet elegant, book won the Pulitzer Prize, Francis Parkman Prize, and National Book Award. It thoroughly covers Roosevelt's presidency leading up to and including World War II. It is somewhat critical of Roosevelt in tone, such as his treatment of Jewish refugees and difficulties in managing the war. I think the Conrad Black Biography of FDR is a little better and with more information, yet a Pulitzer Prize-winner needs consideration too.<br /><br />&#34;Soldier of Freedom&#34; covers America's dilemma leading up the war. Should America get involved or not? How should Roosevelt lead an isolationist America to responsibly confront the war that waged in Europe? How should America plan for the threat? What strategy to win the biggest war in history? America needed to become mobilized. This book tells the story of war administration in detail.<br /><br />What kind of peace? Once the war began,<br /><br />As one of the reviews states on the back of the book, &#34;Soldier of Freedom&#34; combines rigorous scholarship while being enjoyable to read.<br /><br />&#34;The Time 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century&#34; named Einstein, Gandi and Franklin D. Roosevelt the three most important people of that Century. This book partly explains why FDR was the most important politician of the 20th Century. FDR created the modern, powerful presidency. He transformed America from weak, uninvolved isolationism into an active superpower. He established the firm posture of moral, yet pragmatic, international leadership (FDR Americanism) that would serve America (and the world) so well through the Cold War.<br /><br />James MacGregor Burns has also authored several excellent works about leadership, including the book &#34;Transforming Leadership.&#34; I believe his scholarship is highly authoritative and fair.<br /><br />I remember reading quotes that Burns made in newspaper stating that Ronald Reagan was &#34;a great or near-great president&#34; because Reagan was a &#34;transforming&#34; president, like Franklin Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt. (Reagan, by the way, adored FDR, voted for him multiple times and boasted of this in his speech dedicating the Reagan Library, and I believe I read also even attended one of FDR's inaugurations - a deeply moving event for Reagan).<br /><br />General readers interested in Franklin Roosevelt can also choose from many other one-volume biographies by other authors, such as Black's superb &#34;Champion of Freedom,&#34; &#34;Leuchtenburg's &#34;Franklin D. Roosevelt,&#34; Friedel's &#34;Rendezvous with Destiny,&#34; or Jenkins' very brief &#34;Franklin Delano Roosevelt.&#34;<br /><br />Finally, Roosevelt was a powerful speaker. In one survey of speech experts, Roosevelt was ranked the greates presidential speeker, with Reagan coming in second. (Reagan borrowed heavily from Roosevelt, both in style and content). Roosevelt's inauguration speech in 1940 is regarded as one of the ten greatest presidential speeches. It wonderfully defined the impending struggle for freedom against Hitler. Here is Roosevelt's speech:<br /><br />&#34;On each national day of inauguration since 1789, the people have renewed their sense of dedication to the United States.<br /><br />&#34;In Washington's day the task of the people was to create and weld together a nation.<br /><br />&#34;In Lincoln's day the task of the people was to preserve that Nation from disruption from within.<br /><br />&#34;In this day the task of the people is to save that Nation and its institutions from disruption from without.<br /><br />&#34;To us there has come a time, in the midst of swift happenings, to pause for a moment and take stock--to recall what our place in history has been, and to rediscover what we are and what we may be. If we do not, we risk the real peril of inaction.<br /><br />&#34;Lives of nations are determined not by the count of years, but by the lifetime of the human spirit. The life of a man is three-score yearsand ten: a little more, a little less. The life of a nation is the fullness of the measure of its will to live.<br /><br />&#34;There are men who doubt this. There are men who believe that democracy, as a form of Government and a frame of life, is limited or measured by a kind of mystical and artificial fate that, for some unexplained reason, tyranny and slavery have become the surging wave of the future--and that freedom is an ebbing tide.<br /><br />&#34;But we Americans know that this is not true.<br /><br />&#34;Eight years ago, when the life of this Republic seemed frozen by a fatalistic terror, we proved that this is not true. We were in the midst of shock--but we acted. We acted quickly, boldly, decisively.<br /><br />&#34;These later years have been living years--fruitful years for the people of this democracy. For they have brought to us greater security and, I hope, a better understanding that life's ideals are to be measured in other than material things.<br /><br />&#34;Most vital to our present and our future is this experience of a democracy which successfully survived crisis at home; put away many evil things; built new structures on enduring lines; and, through it all, maintained the fact of its democracy.<br /><br />&#34;For action has been taken within the three-way framework of the Constitution of the United States. The coordinate branches of the Government continue freely to function. The Bill of Rights remains inviolate. The freedom of elections is wholly maintained. Prophets of the downfall of American democracy have seen their dire predictions come to naught.<br /><br />&#34;Democracy is not dying.<br /><br />&#34;We know it because we have seen it revive--and grow.<br /><br />&#34;We know it cannot die--because it is built on the unhampered initiative of individual men and women joined together in a common enterprise--an enterprise undertaken and carried through by the free expression of a free majority.<br /><br />&#34;We know it because democracy alone, of all forms of government, enlists the full force of men's enlightened will.<br /><br />&#34;We know it because democracy alone has constructed an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life.<br /><br />&#34;We know it because, if we look below the surface, we sense it still spreading on every continent--for it is the most humane, the most advanced, and in the end the most unconquerable of all forms of human society.<br /><br />&#34;A nation, like a person, has a body--a body that must be fed and clothed and housed, invigorated and rested, in a manner that measures up to the objectives of our time.<br /><br />&#34;A nation, like a person, has a mind--a mind that must be kept informed and alert, that must know itself, that understands the hopes and the needs of its neighbors--all the other nations that live within the narrowing circle of the world.<br /><br />&#34;And a nation, like a person, has something deeper, something more permanent, something larger than the sum of all its parts. It is that something which matters most to its future--which calls forth the most sacred guarding of its present.<br /><br />&#34;It is a thing for which we find it difficult--even impossible--to hit upon a single, simple word.<br /><br />&#34;And yet we all understand what it is--the spirit--the faith of America. It is the product of centuries. It was born in the multitudes of those who came from many lands--some of high degree, but mostly plain people, who sought here, early and late, to find freedom more freely.<br /><br />&#34;The democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history. It is human history. It permeated the ancient life of early peoples. It blazed anew in the middle ages. It was written in Magna Charta.<br /><br />&#34;In the Americas its impact has been irresistible. America has been the New World in all tongues, to all peoples, not because this continent was a new-found land, but because all those who came here believed they could create upon this continent a new life--a life that should be new in freedom.<br /><br />&#34;Its vitality was written into our own Mayflower Compact, into the Declaration of Independence, into the Constitution of the United States, into the Gettysburg Address.<br /><br />&#34;Those who first came here to carry out the longings of their spirit, and the millions who followed, and the stock that sprang from them--all have moved forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in itself has gained stature and clarity with each generation.<br /><br />&#34;The hopes of the Republic cannot forever tolerate either undeserved poverty or self-serving wealth.<br /><br />&#34;We know that we still have far to go; that we must more greatly build the security and the opportunity and the knowledge of every citizen, in the measure justified by the resources and the capacity of the land.<br /><br />&#34;But it is not enough to achieve these purposes alone.

It speaks to us here in the Capital of the Nation. It speaks to us through the processes of governing in the sovereignties of 48 States. It speaks to us in our counties, in our cities, in our towns, and in our villages. It speaks to us from the other nations of the hemisphere, and from those across the seas--the enslaved, as well as the free.

Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Gordon Wood called this book &#34;the most comprehensive and balanced single-volumed study of Jefferson ever written.&#34; I found the writing to very detailed and to the caliber of a reference work, but probably too lengthy and meticulous for the casual reader. It also is favorable to Jefferson. I believe it to be an authoritative book on Thomas Jefferson, if you like a detailed history of Jefferson.<br /><br />Not for someone casually wanting to learn about Jefferson or the American Revolution. More as a detailed and very authoritative history.<br /><br />What distinguishes this book is that 1) Peterson the Jefferson scholar has an unrivaled understanding of Jefferson 2) Peterson explains Jefferson's thinking especially well 3) Peterson covers Jefferson's life in sprawling detail, though 3) Peterson's emphasis leans towards Jefferson's view in American history, hence the title.<br /><br />The sections in this book about Jefferson's formative years in Virginia are especially interesting. Then he was a young man seeking enlightenment. He loved education, was a planter, and became a good lawyer. He was asked to draft the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson held several political and diplomatic positions. George Washington appointed Jefferson the first Secretary of State - the most important executive position other than president. At this time his views came into conflict with those of Federalist Alexander Hamilton. Jefferson ran against Adams for the presidency and won. As president he orchestrated the Louisiana Purchase, despite the fact he had argued that the federal government did not have this power and favored power for the states. He launched the fascinating Lewis and Clark Expedition. He used to power of the presidency to emphasize the people. Although issues such as westward expansion and where Hamilton was correct will always be open to interpretation, Jefferson's first term was a triumph. Jefferson made some mistakes in his second term as president, such as a foolish embargo. After being president, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia and even designed the neo-classical campus buildings. By then the rival Federalist party had become extinct and there was briefly only one party - the party of Jefferson! He renewed his friendship with Adams late in life, and they both died on July 4. He later advocated more the power of the states, despite exercising strong power as the president of the United States. Jefferson was an egalitarian aristocrat of reason, liberty, ideas, and achievement.irst term was a triumph. Jefferson made some mistakes in his second term as president, such as a foolish embargo.

I may have one policy for Europe and one diametrically opposite for North and South America.

He was so agreeable to so many different people and interests. But as one historian put it, behind that charming mask was a cunning mind.

It may not have always been obvious what he was up to, but look at the results he achieved.<br /><br />Another historian titled his FDR biography \\"The Lion and the Fox.\\" Another historian compared FDR's sly foreign policy to that of looking into a kaleidoscope.

Not as Good as Full Bios	The theme is that the three Roosevelts were elite and rich, and yet battled concentrated wealth. This book caught my attention when it received good reviews from major newspapers, magazines, and critics when it came out (which you can find on the Internet). The writing is interesting and moves along smoothly. James MacGregor Burns knows his material well. He won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of FDR.<br /><br />The section that covers Eleanor Roosevelt is maybe the strongest part of the book. Eleonor Roosevelt was a tireless champion of issues for ordinary people and the disadvantaged. She took up causes that her huspand politically could not. She championed the anti-lynching law when FDR had to be silent or risk losing his political coalition. She astounded a group of impoverished workers on strike by showing up to their gathering to show her support. Here was a well-dressed lady of the highest education and refinement showing up without security to show her support for their cause.<br /><br />The book begins with the solemn scene of President Lincoln's funeral procession, which Theodore Roosevelt as a child watched from his upscale residence. The book then shows how Theodore Roosevelt was influenced by Lincoln's presidency. Theodore Roosevelt did what he thought was right and rejected the life of comfortable leisure. Theodore Roosevelt acted boldly in some circumtances, while in other circumstances he acted compromising. This book has limitations. Theodore Roosevelt's foreign affairs are not mentioned. The emphasis is on the progressive nature of the three Roosevelts.<br /><br />The book shows that Franklin Roosevelt followed the path of Theodore Roosevelt. Like T.R., FDR was born into a rich, elite social class. He entered politics, became under-secretary of the Navy, and then governor of New York. T.R. was in FDR's wedding to Eleanor Roosevelt, who was from T.R.'s family circle. And he used masterful political skills as president like T.R.

A Great Second Book	\\"American Sphinx\\" by Joseph Ellis is an excellent book about Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence and a man of astonishing achievements. However, it is not a standard biography of Jefferson and it is not a good introduction to Jefferson, because it does not tell some of the most important history involving Jefferson. Instead, \\"American Sphinx\\" is a well-written critique of Jefferson.<br /><br />I strongly suggest R. B. Bernstein's concise, yet excellent, biography [[ASIN:0195169115 Thomas Jefferson]] for a great introduction to Thomas Jefferson. That unbiased book is the best brief biography of Jefferson. Then read American Sphinx as a second book. Also consider [[ASIN:0813923611 Dumas Malone's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Thomas Jefferson (six volumes)]]. So many important things about Jefferson are missing from \\"American Sphinx.\\"<br /><br />Ellis previously wrote a fine biography of John Adams to revive the reputation of Adams (deservedly so), overshadowed by Jefferson. Adams and Jefferson bitterly disagreed on some issues, and Ellis admittedly agrees more with Adams. Therefore, it is no surprise that readers come away with a less than impressive opinion of Jefferson after reading \\"American Sphinx\\". Ellis is brilliant and accurate, but some favorable aspects of Jefferson are missing.<br /><br />Ellis states in his biography of Jefferson, \\"My approach is selective... to focus on the values and convictions that reveal themselves in these specific historical contexts... Our chief quarry, after all, is Jefferson's character, the animating principles that informed his public and private life.\\" Ellis selectively emphasizes Jefferson's contradictions.<br /><br />Ellis even writes that some people recorded that Jefferson's eyes were clear blue, while others (and portraits) suggest that they were hazel or green - a contradiction! So? Jefferson's achievements and how he achieved them - sometimes through wily political maneuvers - are more important.<br /><br />\\"American Sphinx\\" struck me as the equivalent of a book about Mozart's public persona. Would that be a representative account of the life and music of Mozart, as well as the historical impact of his work? Jefferson should be judged by his achievements, and he achieved so much, even if he could be wily and hypocritical.<br /><br />Thomas Jefferson was an architect (including Monticello), inventor, musician, prolific writer, scholarly lawyer, and observant scientist (in several fields). He once said, \\"I cannot live without book.\\" He achieved the Louisiana Purchase, the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which really matched his keen interest in natural science, and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which embodied Jefferson's deep convictions about religious freedom. Yet Ellis hardly covers these fascinating aspects in detail. Jefferson was a planter farmer, author, governor of Virginia, foreign diplomat (and celebrity abroad), secretary of state, president, co-architect of Virginia's constitution, founder (and architect) of the University of Virginia, political philosopher, vice president, and much more.<br /><br />Jefferson believed in the enlightened rights of man as reflected in the Declaration of Independence, and he advocated the Bill of Rights to ensure that they were specifically expressed in the Constitution. Jefferson more than any other major leader of the Revolution believed in those lofty ideals, which were radical for the time and which Ellis correctly points out could be naively optimistic. Jefferson was a revolutionary and a dreamer.<br /><br />He also was a legal reformer, supporter of the arts, and a public education advocate - far ahead of his time. He believed in equal opportunity in the context of his time, although he could be quite arrogant towards those of lesser achievement and, like almost everyone else at that point in American history, did not yet believe that women and people of color were equal in civil matter. As president, he was a splendid head of state. Yet these details are hardly covered by Ellis.<br /><br />Jefferson's most enduring achievement is the Declaration of Independence. Although Jefferson borrowed from ideas circulating in the colonies, Ellis writes generously that \\"The vision he projected in the natural rights section of the Declaration of Independence, then, represents yet another formulation of the Jeffersonian imagination. The specific form of the vision undoubtedly drew upon language Locke had used to describe the putative conditions of society before governments were established. But the urge to embrace such an ideal society came from deep inside Jefferson himself... The American dream, then, is just that, the Jeffersonian dream writ large.\\" Jefferson was a man of ideas and ideals.<br /><br />Jefferson sincerely introduced a radical measure into Congress to completely ban slavery in any of the non-original states. Unfortunately, the measure fell short by just one vote. Devastating! Think about what history would have been like had Jefferson achieved that goal. Few people in American history did more to further the long-term cause of freedom than Jefferson.<br /><br />He articulated the American creed of \\"Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness\\" and then worked diligently to ensure that it was cemented into the fabric of America's political tradition.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln was deeply motivated by Jefferson. When the Missouri Compromise unraveled and the south began to export slavery westward, Lincoln was livid. He was willing to accept slavery in the southern states, but he would not tolerate slavery expanding westward. Lincoln's position was Jefferson's position (or what Lincoln believed to be Jefferson's position). Lincoln borrowed from Jefferson's own words to define the meaning of the Civil War. Lincoln said, \\"Four score and seven years ago, our founding fathers brought forth to this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the principle that all men are created equal.... this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom.\\" Read a good biography of Lincoln.<br /><br />Some of Jefferson's ideas as president were bad. Fortunately, his advisors talked him out of many of his bad ideas. His second administration was not very good. He also was probably a better person in his younger years, becoming viciously politically motivated in later years to defeat Hamilton.<br /><br />Jefferson quit his sincere fight in his early years against slavery once he experienced a severe collapse in his financial condition and realized that slavery was a lost cause. He tried his best and then moved on. Why destroy yourself socially and financially for something that has no chance of success? He considered African American to be inferior racially, which is not surprising considering the slaves he saw were deprived of education like that he had, and his views back then, in today's different world, would be considered racist. He late in life became paranoid and feared a slave rebellion, which caused him to become an advocate of states rights, and a different view than the outspoken opponent of slavery in his younger years.<br /><br />The brilliant Jefferson learned to be a cunning politician. He could tell one person one thing and another person a different thing. To survive in the very nasty political arena, he had to be clever. Mobs would tar and feather people. Thousands died in the revolution. Economic interests had considerable power. Other founding fathers had strong wills and very different ideas.<br /><br />Alexander Hamilton praised the virtues of monarchy and resisted a Bill of Rights. Under a fake name, Hamilton savaged Jefferson with vile and false newspaper commentaries, and Jefferson in return the same.<br /><br />John Adams disagreed with Jefferson's democratic vision for America. Adams held a dim view of human nature (not without some truth) and thought that Jefferson's democratic ideaswere radical. The Federalists, such as Adams and Hamilton, were distrustful of the people and wanted America ruled by a small group of elites. This caused a break between Jefferson and Adams, who had been good friends.<br /><br />Thomas Jefferson was George Washington's secretary of state, the most prestigious position besides president. But Jefferson resigned after sharply disagreeing with the Federalists in Washington's administration, especially Hamilton. Hamilton's economic ideas were brilliant (read \\"An Empire of Wealth\\" by John Gordon Steele) but Jefferson the revolutionary was suspicious of Hamilton's motives and ruthless tactics.<br /><br />When Vice President John Adams became president and turned into an autocrat through the Alien and Sedition Acts, Jefferson's worst fears were confirmed. So he ran for president and defeated Adams in a very nasty campaign by both sides. It was a bitter political struggle and Jefferson won.<br /><br />Ellis skips this explosive era of the Adams administration, and he only passively refers to the outrageous Alien and Sedition Acts. Ellis passively attributing them to the Federalists and not specifically to Adams. This works to the advantage of Adams and against Jefferson. Ellis is brilliant but not complete. You really need to read another Jefferson biography first.<br /><br />Once Jefferson became president, he worked diligently to entrench his Jeffersonian democratic ideals and to wipe out the Federalists. Some historians call this the Second American Revolution. First Jefferson worked hard to establish his ideal of the separation of church and state. Then he used the symbolism of the presidency to promote democratic government for the people. Jefferson hated the corrupt aristocratic order that dominated the European powers, including both the clergy and the aristocracy. (Read Sean Wilentz's Bancroft Prize-winning \\"The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln\\" or Joyce Appleby's biography of Jefferson.)<br /><br />Within a short time the Federalists were completely extinct. Briefly there was only one party - the party of Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson the politician was completely dominating - a truly remarkable achievement. His craftiness must be put into this context. He was results oriented - and just look at the results he achieved!<br /><br />Jefferson also came very close to acquiring Florida, later acquired by James Monroe, his former aid and fellow Virginian.

I highly recommend it as an excellent introduction to Thomas Jefferson. The concise book is only 198 pages of text, yet the author paints a vivid, fascinating portrait of the contradictory and accomplished Jefferson - especially his ideas and how asserted them. This book was a joy to read.<br /><br />On the cover of the book is a comment from Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Gordon Wood calling this book \\"The best short Biography of Jefferson ever written.\\" Gordon Wood is the leading historian of the Revolutionary War era and the history of early America. I agree with Wood and would add that it's simply a great book.<br /><br />Thomas Jefferson had a profound role in the meaning of the America Revolution, especially his enlightened ideas. He wrote the Declaration of Independence - essentially the American creed - \\"that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\\" Jefferson advocated freedom, learning, and individual rights for all, not to be infringed upon by the state. He was egalitarian in ideology and fearful of strong controlling powers over people in history, including religious powers. He later used the presidency to transform the revolution into his Jeffersonian ideals, and his legacy through time (taking different forms depending on who is using him as an icon) has helped to define the meaning of America.<br /><br />The first chapter \\"A Young Gentlemen of Virginia (1743-1774)\\" gives the reader a fine understanding of the aristocratic, planter society Jefferson grew up in. The book succinctly details Jefferson's love of learning, his ideas, and how his ideas would play out his life and then into American history. Jefferson was an advocate of liberty, including religious freedom. When his wife died at a young age, Jefferson uncontrollably cried for a week. He loved books, architecture, agriculture, art, politics, philosophy, science and much more. He played the violin, became a lawyer, and held numerous political positions, including legislature, governor, vice president, diplomat, secretary of state, and president.<br /><br />Brief chapters detail how Jefferson was faced with many difficult problems and how he handled them on a case-by-case basis. Bernstein says that Jefferson seemed to compartmentalize his problems which could make various solutions look contradictory. This book clarifies the \\"why\\" behind Jefferson's actions and ideas. You get a good understanding of who he was.<br /><br />Jefferson strongly opposed slavery in his younger years due to his devotion to individual freedom and liberty. He sought to limit slavery to just the original slave states, but the measure failed in Congress by one vote. Younger in life, he and another fellow tried to introduce an anti-slavery bill in the Virginia Legislature, and Jefferson saw the other man attacked for that, so Jefferson learned the futility of trying to fight slavery. Jefferson later expanded his ownership of slaves, according the Bernstein, and became a defender of states rights, so he was hypocritical. He sincerely hated slavery and yet he relied on them for his livelihood. He believed in the brotherhood and egalitarian equality in spirit of all men, and yet he looked down on less educated city dwellers and considered African American inferior, which is not surprising considering the slaves he saw lacked the education he had. So Jefferson was a hypocrite in his contradictory positions against slavery (sincerely and assertively) and yet upholding it with his actions.<br /><br />This book explains the facts transparantly without offering an opinion one way or the other. Jefferson also likely fathered children with Sally Hemings, who was the half-sister of Jefferson's wife (long dead). Bernstein explains the evidence surrounding this controversy in an unbiased way. (By the way, Monticello believes that Jeffersonwas the father.) For example, Jefferson's appointment book shows that Hemings and Jefferson were together around those times of conception. She and her children were the only slaves that Jefferson agreed to free when he died -- apparently a deal between them. Sally Hemings was similar in appearance to Jefferson's lovely wife, whom Jefferson adored.<br /><br />I just loved Bernstein's description of the nasty politics during Adams' presidency and the really nasty election of 1800 between Jefferson and Adams. I could not put the book down. You must read this book to learn about that astonishing time in history. Hamilton and Jefferson, the brilliant founders that they were, could be very wily. They also had different visions of America, and this book gives you a good, basic understanding. Jefferson was agrarian and feared strong central powers, while Hamilton saw an economic future for America that was more modern and close to what actually happened, including the need for an organized national government.<br /><br />Jefferson was mired in debt. Read the book and understand the society of aristocratic land owners requiring high debt and Jefferson's tastes in living, and Bernstein briefly explains the decisions that led to Jefferson getting over his head. This made freeing his slaves economically impossible. Bernstein does not mention, unfortunately, that Jefferson actually had a positive net worth several years before his death and could have covered all his debts but that a crash in property values caused his net worth to collapse.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Bernstein's brief description of Jefferson's alliances and rivalries with other founders, especially Madison, Adams, and Hamilton. Jefferson was friends with Adams, then enemies, then friends late in life. They both died on the same day, July 4. Jefferson and Hamilton viciously hated each other and waged an enduring battle over the future of America. Jefferson the politician was very nasty compared to Jefferson the man of letters and sciences.<br /><br />Jefferson was a strong advocate of religious liberty and successfully achieved a law allowing religious freedom in Virginia. He loved learning and founded the University of Virginia. He was a renaissance man in many ways, which this book briefly explains, and ideologically believed in religious liberty. And he was a agrarian Southern planter.<br /><br />If you want an excellent, concise book on Jefferson, buy this superb book.<br /><br />On the back cover of this book are these rave reviews:<br /><br />\\"Bernstein's Jefferson is a brilliant success.

This book is not a biography of FDR. It is an important reflection of his presidency.<br /><br />Here is a very good review of the book I found by presidential historian Michael R. Beschloss at the Washington Post website.<br /><br />\\"FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT defied tradition in so many ways that it is not surprising that he has seemed to defy even the normal rules of history. After leaving office, an American president usually endures a period of historical eclipse...<br /><br />\\"The architect of the New Deal and the world's saving from fascism did not have to undergo any historical waiting period. The first major wave of Roosevelt scholarship a decade or two after FDR's death -- books by Arthur Schlesinger Jr., and Frank Freidel of Harvard, James MacGregor Burns of Williams, John Morton Blum of Yale, and William E. Leuchtenburg, then of Columbia -- resoundingly affirmed his greatness...<br /><br />\\"Now that the Cold War is over and the domestic consensus about the role of government has fractured, we may have to hold onto our hats for the next great torrent of Roosevelt scholarship. Conservatives will likely turn up the heat against Roosevelt's role in the establishment of a permanent welfare state. Left-liberals will probably be more angry than ever that he failed to do more. Neo-isolationists will fire new fusillades against the four-term one-worlder in the White House.<br /><br />\\"In such an atmosphere, William Leuchtenburg's The FDR Years will serve as benchmark and provocation. An absorbing collection of eight essays and an oral-history interview with the author, most previously published but vigorously revised, the book covers topics from Roosevelt's relationship with Huey Long to the Tennessee Valley Authority and the New Deal's use of the war metaphor...<br /><br />\\"The first is the importance of the New Deal. Leuchtenburg recalls that by the early 1970s, the chief academic attack on Roosevelt's domestic leadership was coming not from conservatives but from the New Left. So much had such scholars shaped the literature that a Harvard friend told Leuchtenburg that his students took it 'to be axiomatic that the New Deal amounted to very little,' not much more than a 'spirited evasion of the overriding issues of the twentieth century'...<br /><br />\\"In a chapter called 'The Achievement of the New Deal' (based on his 1972 Harnsworth inaugural lecture at Oxford), Leuchtenburg defends the importance of Roosevelt's domestic programs to American life. They 'radically altered the character of the State in America,' expanded presidential power, transformed the relationship between government and finance, labor and management, started 'a new system of social rights to replace dependence on private charity,' opened the American power structure to new groups and brought about the great political realignment of the mid-1930s.<br /><br />\\"The second front in the struggle for Roosevelt's place in history can be thought to be the leadership qualities of the man himself. Leuchtenburg lauds Roosevelt's triumph in 'leading the nation to accept the far-ranging responsibilities of world power,' his considerable success with Congress and his eclectic approach to administration. But he grounds his case for Roosevelt as leader on 'his role in enlarging the presidential office and expanding the domain of the State while leading the American people through the Great Depression.' He shows how Roosevelt helped to change America and the world between 1933 and 1945, making him 'one of the few American presidents who looms large not just in the history of the United States but also in the history of the world' and 'the standard by which every successor has been, and may well continue to be, measured.'<br /><br />\\"Only a minority of scholars today will argue strenuously against the importance of the New Deal or FDR's resourcefulness as leader. This opens the way for the third broad front: the wisdom of Roosevelt's domestic and international purposes and the effect they have had on the past half-century. As Leuchtenburg writes, evaluations of presidential greatness 'often say more about the ideological predisposition of scholars than about the nature of presidential performance.' Ever since his death, Franklin Roosevelt has been a figure not just of history but current politics. At a time in which our political culture is debating the extent of the welfare state, presidential power and America's responsibilities in the world, FDR is likely to become an even more contemporary figure. The next generation of historians can be expected to draw portraits of the hero that will be unrecognizable to many of those who began writing about Roosevelt in the 1950s and 1960s. Against such evaluations, The FDR Years will provide us with a point of comparison.\\"eal or FDR's resourcefulness as leader.

It is very easy to read and suitable for high school students. Being written by a man from Britain, it also shows how the world views FDR - as one of the most important leaders in world history.<br /><br />You will not acquire a thorough understanding of FDR by reading this book. For that I would suggest the huge \\"Champion of Freedom\\" by Conrad Black.<br /><br />In response to Mister Syzek, my understanding the post-war settlement is that Stalin broke violated the Yalta agreement, which was quite favorable to the west. FDR achieved most of what he wanted, including the stipulation that Eastern Europe was to have elections. But Stalin broke his promises and controlled Poland despite the agreements that FDR was able to extract from Stalan. FDR got the deal in writing. Stalin did not abide by it.<br /><br />Stalin was determined to control Poland no matter what, so Poland was firmly in his grip, despite what the actual terms of the agreement said. Staling went so far as to say that it was \\"a matter of life or death.\\"<br /><br />Franklin Roosevelt was a geopolitical realist, and the reality is that the Soviet armies controlled Eastern Europe and Poland, and the USSR would be willing to fight - and win - to stay. The American people had no enthusiasm for yet another world war againt Russia. They wanted their soldiers home. Maybe you should ask the American people why they were not willing to suffer 5 million killed for Poland. You see, in America you must deal with these pesky things called voters and democracy.<br /><br />To complicate the matter, the Soviet Union took the brunt of the war (17 million dead), and Stalin was rigidly determined to secure a buffer between Mother Russia and Western Europe. Stalin would not have budged on his goal.<br /><br />So what Roosevelt obtained from Stalin was the best he could obtain - firm promises from Stalin to hold elections. It was Stalin who broke his promises. That made the Soviet Union look like the bad guy.<br /><br />Truman then waged the Cold War (without the millions of dead from a hot war) leading to an eventual liberation of Eastern Europe. It's no surprise that Reagan was a huge fan of Roosevelt, voted for him four times, and attended his third inauguration (a moving event for Reagan). Reagan then brought an end to the Cold War without firing a shot.<br /><br />You may be able to criticize Truman for not liberating Eastern Europe while American had a monopoly on the atomic bomb... or Eisenhower. After all, USSR staged a coup in Czechoslovakia and then staged a brutal crushing of the revolt in Hunguary in which tens of thousands were killed. Clearly this was in violation of the agreement that FDR was able to extract from Stalin. It was the USSR that broke the agreement. FDR did not sell out anyone.<br /><br />Then again, maybe the path Truman took was wise. Maybe waging a long-term cold against USSR was better than a violent real war. Maybe FDR realized that no European-based power has ever conquered Russia. Remember Napolean? Remember Hitler? Could even USA have defeated USSR in 1945? Maybe Roosevelt would have done things differently. We will never know because he died.<br /><br />As this book says, FDR was clearly moving to a get-tough posture against USSR. Indeed, FDR moved closer to one of his advisors who was anti-USSR. I suggest you read this book.<br /><br />At the same time, Roosevelt was an idealist in the Wilsonian tradition when realistic. He believed in the free determination of free people, but he was also realistic. For example, he essentially pushed for an end to world colonialism in his design for the post-war world. Churchill opposed this but he could do nothing about it. The British empire was too weak.<br /><br />By the way, Poland was not even a country at the start of World War One and was viewed by some in a similar way to theBaltic States of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Should American have gone to war over the Baltic States?<br /><br />This fine little book is a fine introduction to Roosevelt. It is the best brief book on Roosevelt.

Politics and production are the main points. This book is widely cited by other books on World War II. This is not a book for pleasure reading about World War II. Instead, this is a look at politics and production to win the war. Probably the best book on the home front for most readers is &#34;No Ordinary Time&#34; by Dorin Kearns Goodwin.

In his time, Kindleberger was regarded by many as the highest authority on the economics of the Great Depression. He also was an economist of the highest order. (Check out his other books.) This book is an outstanding analysis of the Great Depression.<br /><br />Kindleberger explains that the reason for the Depression was a lack of a stable international economic structure and mistakes preceding the Great Depression. In other words, the financial structure we enjoy today simply did not exist at the time. The flawed international system could only have led to a financial crisis eventually.<br />There simply was no financial structure in place to exact a powerful enough of a force on the global financial system. Great Britain had abdicated the leadership role and the United States was yet unwilling to assume that role. Nations turned inward (and I would add that countries that devalued from the gold standard quickly faired best).<br /><br />Macroeconomics had not yet been developed. Keynes General Theory only came out in the mid-1930's, and then it was largely unknown. Friedman would not develop his monetary theory until well after the Great Depression had ended.<br /><br />The book is not the only explanation of the Great Depression, nor pretends to be, but is a highly valid one and should be considered by anyone seriously interested in the subject. This book is a classic for the subject.<br /><br />The financial world used a flawed gold standard. Great Britain (and finance minister Winston Churchill specifically) played a leading role in implementing the flawed international system. Then when the depression hit, Great Britain quickly dumped the gold standard and recoverd the soonest. Herbert Hoover rigidly stick to the gold standard. FDR dumped it once becoming president, and GDP grew strongly. But full employment from the great depths of the Great Depression did not occur until the massive spending of World War II.<br /><br />Also read [[ASIN:0691118205 Essays on the Great Depression by Ben Bernanke]] and the premier summary of the economics of the Great Depression.the massive spending of World War II.<br /><br />Also read [[ASIN:0691118205 Essays on the Great Depression by Ben Bernanke]] and the premier summary of the economics of the Great Depression.	2004-05-23

If you are writing a college paper or just want to read an authoritative book on the subject, read this book.<br /><br />I was impressed with how thoroughly the author detailed the people, the times, and the policies that were enacted (and the political reasons they came about in that form) and kept the book moving along. There are details and more details.<br /><br />I was surprised with some of the things I read. Messy politics seemed to drive many of the policies adopted to deal with the Great Depression. The New Deal was not a tidy, consistent program but a series of pragmatic reforms in a sea of economic turmoil. You get a good feel for that era.<br /><br />It is obvious that most people back then felt that capitalism was \\"obviously\\" flawed because of the \\"self-evident\\" disaster in the economy called the Great Depression. There had been a feeling since Theodore Roosevelt's big stick attacks against \\"the malfactors of great wealth\\" that capitalism needed to be tamed. The Great Depression brought those concerns to a head. Many people living back then acquired a deep fear of laissez-faire capitalism, and many people wanted something done. FDR was reelected by landslides.<br /><br />Some of FDR's political maneuvers detailed in this book seemed designed to neutralize some of the more radical activists at that time, like Father Coughlin, Huey Long, and the Townsend plan. The Townsend plan and Huey Long's share the wealth programs were radical schemes to redistribute wealth. They had huge followings of millions in America. So FDR moved to cut them off with what was then a slim version of Social Security (later expanded by others).<br /><br />In retrospect, FDR appears in this book as a master politician, an opportunist, and a pragmatist. In a sea of Depression era politics, he navigated himself and the country (like the sailor he was) from the center-right (an advocate of balanced budgets, reduced government payrolls, and mild relief efforts) to the center-left (Social Security, more extensive relief programs, populist speeches attacking \\"economic royalists\\"). The result is that he disarmed the more radical elements of society and saved the free market system.<br /><br />My only complaint with the book is the obviously-biased introduction that the author has written for the most recent edition in which he assails Reaganomics. The author clearly mistrusts capitalists and suggests that Reagan was trying to undo the New Deal stabilizers put into place during the Great Depression. The rest of the book, however, is excellent.<br /><br />In fact, if you read Reagan's memoir \\"An American Life,\\" Reagan makes angrily clear that he voted for FDR four times and would never undo the New Deal. Instead, he made it clear that he tried to undo Lyndon Johnson's Great Society from the 1960's. The SEC, FDIC, Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, and other pragmatic New Deal measures are still operating strong. So the author's opinions have been shown to be wrong.<br /><br />Yet I think the author's opinions are very revealing, even if I do not agree with most of them. The Great Depression was a great trauma. I think it is important to understand the time as it was back then.<br /><br />In short, this book is an authoritative study of the HISTORY of the Great Depression era, with a dose of the author's liberal opinions. The dates, facts, people and events are explained thoroughly and in a way that is easy to read.

These fine work projects are seen across America and represent a hard period in American history, and a period of hope and achievement.<br />I found this H-Net review of this book on the Internet.<br />&quot;Carroll Van West. Tennessee's New Deal Landscape: A Guidebook.<br />Reviewed by Edward Salo, Geo-Marine, Inc.<br />Published by H-Tennessee (September, 2002)<br />&quot;Creating a Modern Tennessee through the New Deal<br />When most people think of the New Deal's impact on Tennessee, the concrete dams of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) are the image that comes to mind. However, like many states, Tennessee's public landscape was drastically affected in other ways by a variety of New Deal projects. In Tennessee's New Deal Landscape, Dr. Carroll Van West, project director for the Center for Historic Preservation, Middle Tennessee State University, examines over 250 of Tennessee's historic sites constructed during the New Deal and uses that information to catalogue how Depression-era federal government work changed the built environment of the state. West's book serves both as a heritage tourism guidebook and as a scholarly work. It also succeeds in illustrating how &quot;New Deal agencies transformed the state's public landscape, leaving in their wake the infrastructure for the emergence of a modern--and different--Tennessee&quot; (p. xii).<br />&quot;Students of Tennessee's cultural landscapes and historic preservation will be familiar with West's earlier scholarship. Because of his work at the Center for Historic Preservation, West has either written about or is familiar with most of the New Deal historic properties in the state. His previous book, Tennessee's Historic Landscapes, is the definitive study on the different historic landscapes across the state. West's new contribution focuses exclusively on the historic properties that were constructed during the New Deal era in Tennessee. He has mined both primary and secondary sources on Tennessee's New Deal experience, including TVA records, the WPA guidebook on Tennessee, cultural resource reports, and National Register of Historic Properties nominations to produce a similarly authoritative examination of the state during the 1930s.<br />&quot;In his first chapter, West presents a short thematic history of the New Deal, identifying the ten major New Deal agencies that worked in Tennessee. Unlike his previous book, which looked at the state's regions, he divides New Deal Landscapes into chapters based on the resource's property type. The next seven chapters include discussions of state offices and county courthouses; federal courthouses and post offices; community buildings and institutions; schools; housing; parks, memorials, and museums; and infrastructure. Each chapter contains a short narrative focusing on political, cultural, and social patterns that influenced the resources, as well as individual descriptions of other examples across the state, organized alphabetically by county. By not designating the properties as belonging to West, Middle, and East Tennessee, West makes his information accessible to those unfamiliar with Tennessee's traditional geographic divisions. A bibliographical essay also directs readers to important sources for further research.<br /><br />&quot;West makes it clear in his preface that the book is not comprehensive. The examples he uses are fairly divided between the rural and urban sections of the state. Many of the properties discussed in the chapters are representative and are not the only examples in the state. The identification and description of New Deal property types, however, is one of the book's strengths, making it easier for local historians to examine Depression-era landscape and distinguish significant buildings.<br />&quot;The examples that West uses illustrate two interpretations of the New Deal in Tennessee: construction and destruction. Although many projects created new buildings, some, such as the TVA dams, also destroyed rural areas and displaced people from their traditional homes. Additionally, the construction of TVA lakes disrupted rural life, while also laying the groundwork for Tennessee's economic growth during World War II and the Cold War. This dichotomy shaped many Tennesseans' attitude toward the federal government both during and after the New Deal years.<br />&quot;Although the book's only problems are cosmetic in nature, a few changes would have helped the reader. First, all of the pictures in the book are modern, but many readers would appreciate historic views of some of the buildings. Additionally, sidebars with brief descriptions of architectural elements or styles (for example, WPA Moderne style) would have made the book more accessible to laymen. Also, with the growing interest in environmental history, West's discussion of the creation of state parks and soil conservation only begs for more study.<br />&quot;The study of New Deal landscape has bloomed during the 1990s. Many state historic preservation offices have developed New Deal theme studies to assist in placing 1930s properties on the National Register of Historic Places. Although these theme studies are helpful for historic preservation planning, they are not easily accessible to the public. Public historians should use West's book as an example on how better to communicate historic landscapes to the general public. The book takes &quot;gray literature&quot; and presents it in a manner that is useful. The framework that West has developed also lends itself to other possible historic themes, such as railroads, military, agriculture, industrial, and ethnic landscapes. This book should be read by public historians not only for the content but also for the methodology.&quot;pression-era landscape and distinguish significant buildings. <br />&quot;The examples that West uses illustrate two interpretations of the New Deal in Tennessee: construction and destruction.

Classic on FDR's New Deal	This book won the Francis Parkman Prize by the Society of American Historians for excellence in history and the Bancroft Prize for historical excellence at the same time. The historical research is so good that this book is considered practically a primary source itself. It is an essential book of the era. The three-volume \\"Age of Roosevelt\\" is an essential history of the Great Depression era, written by a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author.<br /><br />This renowned book is also an important look at the American political process and, in general, political science. If you are student of American history or politics, this book is essential reading.<br /><br />However, general readers interested in President Franklin Roosevelt should read a good biography of Franklin Roosevelt first before reading this history of the Great Depression era. The best FDR biographies tend to have more information.<br /><br />\\"The Crisis of the Old Order\\" brilliantly covers the years leading up to the Great Depression and then the three long years of Depression under the Republican Congress and Herbert Hoover. The facts are reported as if you were there. Hoover callously said that unemployed people desperately selling apples in the streets were actually doing so because selling apples paid more than their regular jobs. His image was made worse by the Hoovervilles where unemployed people lived in small shacks. The tone of the book is slightly sympathetic to Roosevelt.<br /><br />By the way, during the economic contraction, Hoover's Secretary of Treasury, Mellon, deliberately sought a policy of contraction, waging war on workers, when he should have been providing liquidity to the system. Hoover's treasury secretary was the worst. He came out and said to squeeze them all, which was a disaster. At that moment of crisis we needed an infusion of liquidity, not the Treasury secretary wanted to contract them.<br /><br />In the second volume of this history, Schlesinger details the bold actions that FDR and the new Democratic Congress took to confront the crisis during FDR's legendary first 100 days. That book is outstanding. It also describes the radicals who found receptive audiences during the Depression, like Long/Coughlin/Townsend, and how FDR outmaneuvered them to avoid radicalism. It was a time of turbulence and unsurpassed legislative achievements by FDR.<br /><br />FDR won reelection in 1936 with the biggest electoral landslide in modern history, a triumphant endorsement. He won another landslide reeclection in 1940.<br /><br />Beware of misleading attack books by others disguised as history that smear Roosevelt without telling the full history and without even including the most important facts, such as the GDP numbers, industrial production numbers, and the stock market numbers in FDR's first term.

The book explains much about how today's modern economy and society emerged. The Progressive Era (Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson) takes center stage, which created the foundation for the New Deal and the dominating political figure Franklin D. Roosevelt.<br /><br />This is a specialized study of the activism, so those interested in a more general history of the Progressive Era should consider \\"Pivotal Decades\\" by John Milton Cooper. Those interested in the New Deal should read a book about the New Deal or a good FDR biography.<br /><br />I found these more extensive publisher comments on the web:<br /><br />Publisher Comments:<br />In one of the most brilliant and dramatic historical narratives ever written about the American experience, Eric Goldman tells a story of the men and women who have been the stuff of American reform. Beginning in the years after the Civil War, when our tradition of dissent was fueled by industrialization and urbanization, he deals not with theories but with the lives of the dissenters, Populist and Progressive, with their political organization and schemes, their popular support, the newspapers and newspapermen who controlled them or followed them, the several dramatic flood tides of reform, and the subsequent ebbing. Mr. Goldman has the gift of personal portraiture; by returning directly to men and events, he shows that reform groups have often been patched-up alliances of planners and libertarians, centralizers and decentralizers. The tradition of freedom and the tradition of welfare - both passing as liberal - haphazardly merged in the New Deal, where only Franklin Roosevelt's political skill held them together.ng as liberal - haphazardly merged in the New Deal, where only Franklin Roosevelt's political skill held them together.	2004-04-22

I also read the review of this book at the Retired Naval Cryptologists website, which completely destroys the credibility of this book \\"Day of Deceit.\\" This book appears to be misleading research, based on what the former cryptologist said. I strongly urge you to read what military experts have said. It's just incredible that the author of this book can say that! RESEARCH THIS YOURSELF, PLEASE. The misleading information in this book also claims to have recieved \\"new\\" information through the Freedom of Information Act, but what he has done is to reinterpret old information already thorough examined to make his case, according to the review below.<br /><br />FDR goaded Japan by cutting off the oil, and they knew Japan would attach Indochina, but FDR did not know about Pearl Harbor. MacArthur was stunned to learn about Pearl Harbor because it was so far from Japan -- nobody thought it was possible. FDR was a navy man and would never have allowed that. This book is not good.<br /><br />Go on the Internet and read the full review at Naval Cryptologic Veterans Association. I cannot post the whole review of the evidence by Jacobsen because it is very long and thorough, but here is part of it:<br /><br />Review By Jacobsen:<br />\\"Day of Deceit\\" argues that... Roosevelt through his co-conspirators (who apparently include General Marshall, Admirals Stark, Ingersoll, Anderson, Captain Turner and Commander McCollum and by implication Admiral Noyes, Captain Redman, Commander Rochefort and many others), attempted to cover up his and his co-conspirators' dastardly deeds.<br /><br />It is well established that the SRN series of Japanese naval messages in the National Archives were decrypted in 1945-46 and translated in 1946-47, but Stinnett INCORRECTLY suggests they may only have been transcribed at those times and that these decrypts (or at least some of them) were available not only in radio intelligence centers in Washington, but Stations Hypo (Rochefort) in Hawaii and Cast on Corregidor...<br /><br />Although Stinnett obtained definite information from Captain Whitlock that no significant JN-25B decrypts were made by Station Cast on Corregidor during the period in question, he disputes this fact and MISINTERPRETS other documents and sources as proof that Whitlock is wrong. Some navy cryptologic veterans involved in this book have complained Stinnett gained their confidence by agreeing to tell their stories but IGNORED their version of events in favor of the monstrous conspiracy theory finalized in the book. Admiral Layton terminated his interview with the author, most likely when he learned where the book was going... The book MISLEADS ITS READERS by not revealing there were two distinct codes, the earlier JN-25A and its much more complicated successor JN-25B used during the period in question and refers to them collectively as \\"Code Book D\\" or \\"5-Num code.\\" Thus, the final successes of JN-25A are IMPROPERLY imputed to JN-25B which was not read to any significant extent until March 1942 when the first published decrypt is found...<br /><br />In an effort to give some credence to its allegation of a massive conspiracy, the book CONTRADICTS THE PLAIN MEANING on the face of translations of these two decrypted messages, established Japanese naval communications practice, and standard decryption procedures. These messages were reported on long ago by Frederick D. Parker in \\"Cryptologia\\" Vol. 15 (4) p. 295... The GLARING OMISSION in the book of this vital \\"unavailability\\" information is instructive.<br /><br />...Nevertheless, the book BALDLY CLAIMS, WITHOUT ANY SUBSTANTIATION, that the words Hitokappu Wan were sent in plain language while the rest of the message was sent in code, an INCREDIBLE ABSURDITY... No one else has had the temerity to make such a RIDICULOUS assertion when confronted with the JN-25B code designation on the face of the decrypt and no reference to a plain language insert in the decrypt.<br /><br />The second GROSS MISINTERPRETATION contained in the book is that Yamamoto's famous message of 2 December 1941 only referred to as \\"Climb Mount. Niitaka 1208\\" may have been sent in plain language... Captain Pelletier in the Naval Cryptologic Veterans Association History Book CONFIRMED this message WAS sent in JN-25. To show the extreme lengths the book will go to CONJURE up his implication of conspiracy, it OMITS the fact in the narrative that this message labeled SRN 115376 by the National Archives had a cryptographer's reference below the heading CLEARLY showing that it was encoded in JN-25B. Furthermore, Stinnett does not clearly point out to his readers that \\"Climb Mount Niitaka\\" was prefaced by the words, \\"This dispatch is Top Secret. This order is effective at 1730 on 2 December #10...\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, IT IS STILL CLEAR THAT NO U.S. OFFICIAL KNEW BEFOREHAND of the Japanese plans to attack Pearl Harbor or discovered that the Kido Butai was on its way to Hawaii for such an attack.<br /><br />Official OP-20-GYP-1 reports verify that ZERO decrypts of JN-25B were made prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. All the early JN-25B decrypts are listed in numerical order with Station Hypo, Pearl Harbor making the first decrypt in January 1942.

Books	5	2	2	N	N	Excellent Book on the Purpose of the U.N. and Today's Issues	60 million people died in World War II. 18 million died in World War I. The financial costs were huge. Franklin Roosevelt was determined to prevent a third world war, and to foster stability and prosperity in the world. His plan worked, though the U.N. has not unfolded as he envisioned.<br />This insightful book examines the creation of the U.N. and today's issues. Below is an abbreviated review by H-Net I found on the Internet:<br />----<br />Begin quote<br />Reviewed by Matthew S. Magda, Sacred Heart University.<br />Published by H-USA (December, 1997)<br />FDR and the Creation of the U.N.<br />The United Nations has received renewed attention since the end of the Cold War. In the early 1990s, especially following the success of the U.N.-authorized coalition against Iraq's military seizure of Kuwait, hopes rose among internationalists that the United Nations would now play its proper role as primary deterrent of international aggression. No longer fettered by the rivalry between the most powerful members of its Security Council, the United Nations could begin functioning as the guarantor of international peace and prosperity...<br />Currently, Americans are involved in both rational and emotionally-charged discussions about the future role of the United Nations and its potential impact on U.S. foreign policy... There are those who argue that a strong United Nations is essential because it will serve the long-term interests of the United States to have an institution with legitimate international credentials to turn to for help in settling conflicts and subduing threats to global stability. This latter view is shared by the authors of FDR and the Creation of the U.N.<br />In the Preface of their book, Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley tell readers that they hope to add needed historical perspective to the current debate on the future role of the United Nations. They believe that by doing so, they will remind Americans and others of the vital role played by Franklin D. Roosevelt and the United States in the creation of the United Nations. Finally, they seek to elevate understanding and discussion so that Americans would come to a more reasoned and consistent support for an institution which &quot;embodies the highest hopes of mankind&quot;<br />Hoopes and Brinkley explain how the failure of the League of Nations shaped the ideas of FDR and American policymakers... The absence of a strong League enabled aggressor states to pursue expansionist policies which eventually led to World War II. Therefore, FDR was determined that the mistakes of the past would be avoided. He wanted the United States to be a leader in the formation of a postwar international security organization.<br />... Hoopes and Brinkley believe that international peace depends on the formula first developed by FDR: a United Nations organization firmly backed by the United States. Such a formula worked well to deter aggression in Korea in the early 1950s and in the Persian Gulf in the 1990s.<br />FDR and the Creation of the U.N. is well written and its central idea persuasively argued. Readers will especially appreciate its tight organization with ample headings to identify topics or issues...<br />End QuoteRoosevelt and the United States in the creation of the United Nations.

Few people better understand the Great Depression in America and the New Deal than Badger. This is a work of the highest caliber.<br /><br />The book should actually be titled \\"The Great Depression and the New Deal,\\" because it first brilliantly describes the Great Depression and the causes. He presents differing interpretations, which I really appreciated. Not everyone agrees. Not all aspects of America experienced the Depression the same, so Badger presents several observations. The portrait he paints is simply outstanding.<br /><br />His analysis of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal is excellent. Badger has read everything written about the Great Depression, it seems. There are no better studies than this book, in my opinion. This is an important and authoritative review of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, and is even suitable as a college text.<br /><br />My only quibble is that Badger should have more thoroughly covered the massive infrastructure investments that Roosevelt made, which greatly contributed to the economic boom during the second-half of the 20th Century. Badger also does not cover the post-war boom, which is an extension of the New Deal reforms and investments. In my opinion, Badger somewhat focuses too much as the relief aspects of the New Deal, but only slightly.<br /><br />There recently has been a slight reinterpretation of the New Deal, with an emphasis on the infrastructure investments and the political economy. For example, read  \\"Building New Deal Liberalism: The Political Economy of Public Works, 1933-1956\\" by Jason Scott Smith. Also read \\"The New Dealers: Power Politics in the Age of Roosevelt\\" by Jordan A. Schwarz.<br /><br />Also consider Schlesinger's classic multi-volume history of the New Deal era.	2004-04-04

Roosevelt: A Rendezvous with Destiny	Books	5	6	8	N	N	The Best FDR Historian -- The Standard FDR Biography	Frank Freidel of Harvard is the greatest historian of Franklin Roosevelt. Freidel spent years researching Roosevelt. He documented more interviews of people in Roosevelt's life than any other historian. His contribution to the historiography of Franklin Roosevelt is unsurpassed.<br /><br />Freidel originally wrote an outstanding [[ASIN:0316293040 four-volume biography of Franklin Roosevelt]] that meticulously detailed FDR's life from childhood, through his [[ASIN:B000OL0BU4 ordeal with polio]], to [[ASIN:0316293032 the early years of FDR's presidency]]. Read that well-written biography if you want a deep understanding of the man and his times. Freidel never finished that multi-volume biography of Roosevelt into the war years; it was suppose to be six volumes.<br /><br />Instead, Freidel wrote this excellent one-volume Roosevelt biography called Rendezvous with Destiny, which condenses Freidel's lifelong research into one volume. The coverage of FDR's early years and Eleanor Roosevelt's story are especially excellent. This is the standard reference biography of Franklin Roosevelt by probably the best historian of Roosevelt.<br /><br />This biography starts with a superb background into Roosevelt's early life in upper class New York. His personal life was fascinating. FDR was born secure and confident. His mother was assertive and doted on her only child. Franklin attended Groton and Harvard. He loved to sail and greatly admired his cousin Theodore Roosevelt. He courted Eleanor, married, and then chose a life of public service - then a nasty world of politics. This biography details Roosevelt's New Deal programs, how he achieved his legislative goals, and who the other players were. Freidel briefly, yet vividly, describes the Great Depression era. If you read only one book about Franklin Roosevelt, this would probably be your best choice.<br /><br />However, I thought that something was missing. Because Freidel of Harvard sticks closely to the strict rules of historians, he rarely provides opinions or commentary. There are no opinionated points of view - just the accurate events of FDR and his times. The book could have been better at describing the epic drama of World War II.<br /><br />Readers should supplement this book with a great book on World War II, such as the masterpiece [[ASIN:B000Y4M8WU A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II]] by Gerhard Weinberg or the masterpiece [[ASIN:0671728687 Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich]] by William Shirer. After first reading Freidel's biography of FDR, I would then read the massive [[ASIN:B000C4T424 Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion Of Freedom]] by Conrad Black, which covers the war years extensively and brilliantly, and is loaded with opinions and juicy insider tidbits.<br /><br />For the Great Depression years, readers should consider Arthur Schlesinger's three-volume [[ASIN:0618340858 Age of Roosevelt]] history of the Great Depression era. If you are interested further in FDR's fascinating private life, read Geoffrey Ward's award-winning [[ASIN:0060160667 A First-Class Temperament: The Emergence of Franklin Roosevelt]].<br /><br />This book would be a great first book to read about FDR. If you were to judge this book on historical accuracy, then you would have to give the book the highest rating possible. However, people highly interested in the era, especially the war, will need to read other books.s or commentary.

I thought it was appropriate.<br />&quot;Book Review: Guns or Butter: the Presidency of Lyndon Johnson by Irving Bernstein.<br />&quot;Warfare, rioting, assassinations: mayhem continues to be the dominant image of America in the mid-1960s, with Lyndon Johnson presiding. This book is intended to redress an 'unfair balance' in the treatment of the man and his time in office, which has skewed our perception almost exclusively to what went wrong.<br />&quot;The tragedy of Lyndon Johnson's presidency, according to the author of this new political biography, was that Johnson believed that he could have both guns and butter - that his vision of the United States as a 'great society' could be fulfilled alongside the waging of war in southeast Asia. It was to be a tragedy of epic proportions.<br />&quot;In the aftermath of Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, and especially after the Democrats' landslide victory in the presidential election a year later, Johnson set about the task of continuing and extending his predecessor's liberal reform programme. Legislative achievements included the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, Medicare, and a series of progressive measures relating to immigration, education and conservation. Together they constituted a new 'New Deal': FDR was LBJ's political hero.<br />&quot;With rapid economic growth in the mid-1960s, the Democrats could have looked forward to a lengthy stay in office during which Johnson's vision of the 'great society' might have been made still more a reality. But his decision to engage US military forces in the long-running conflict in Vietnam changed everything.<br />&quot;Bernstein has produced a very readable narrative of the domestic triumphs and foreign travails of the Johnson administration, richly documented from the archives of the LBJ presidential library in Austin, Texas. His book gives fascinating insights into the American political process, and into Johnson's complex personality.<br />&quot;Despite the author' s hope to rehabilitate LBJ's reputation by focussing on the domestic accomplishments, it is the descent into the quagmire of Vietnam that comes to dominate his account. The style of writing is often vivid, sometimes colloquial, always lucid. There are useful historical backgrounds given to all the issues under discussion, and brief biographical sketches of the principal policy-makers in the Johnson administration. The book is generously illustrated, and is a storehouse of material from which teachers and students can draw readily for a better understanding of those dramatic years of American hope and despair, dream and nightmare, over which LBJ presided.&quot;<br />American Studies Today Onlineas.

It is flawed in that it detaches the Great Society legislation from LBJ's political skills, the nation at the time, and the political environment at the time.<br /><br />Many Great Society programs have provided a hand-up to success, better medical care, less polution, and much more. I would rank college funding very high, along with health care for the elderly.<br /><br />However, the book details that Great Society was also misguided in some ways. The urban renewal programs were flops. CAP and Model Cities come to mind as being especially inept. It was these Great Society programs that Reagan railed against as &#34;big government, and correctly so. I walked away thinking a lot of the Great Society was political favors down through the political machine that did not work, like CAP and Model cities. There were achievements too before the Vietnam War, Guns and Butter, would put the nation into inflation, and civil rights would fracture the New Deal political coalition.<br /><br />In defense of the Great Society, despite some failures, high school graduation rates doubled, and college graduations tripled. Poverty was almost cut in half (although the ways that was measured and means (like simply raising amount paid through Social Security and increasing the future burden_, even if the underlying causes of poverty sometimes remained.<br /><br />(Johnson failed in his proposal to reform welfare).<br /><br />Head Start has helped tens of millions of children prepare for school. Pollution of the air, soil, and water was greatly reduced. Mass transit we take for granted in many cities was built.<br /><br />Medicare has served a couple hundred million people, when before few elderly people had health care of any kind. The number of doctors graduating doubled. Good medical centers became far more widespread, and medical excellence in our society reached new heights through research and funding. Life expectancy has jumped substantially.  We owe our advances in medicine in large part to the programs of the Great Society.<br /><br />The National Endowment for the Arts has greatly expanded the arts in the nation. And how about public TV?<br />So there were successes, and there were failures. This points out what is going right, what could be done better, or what should just be left alone.<br /><br />The author suggests that LBJ should have imposed more radical means to save costs (such as health care) and ensure proper outcomes; accountability. However, that was not possible at the time. Johnson, the politician of amazing instincts and legislative power, rammed his massive programs through while the window of opportunity was there after his landslide election, leaving it to later leaders to review his work later.

This book helps us parents to make sure our children know what they need to know. This is really an important book for our childen. Use this book as a valuable guide. It really is a great book.<br />America's educational system cannot teach our children everything they need to know. Parents are primarily responsible for teaching our children what is most important in life. YOU need to devote your time and intellect to this goal. Parents are the primary source of learning in our country. <br />This book tells you what you need to do to supplement your child's learning. Use this book to help you do your job.<br />One word of warning: There are a few subtle conservative political action requests in this book. I urge you, if you are a moderate or liberal, to not let these very minor suggestions deter you from buying this excellent book. The material is really excellent. And it is true that not all children learn the same.<br />But what is true is that parents need to be completely involved, and there are some tried-and-true lessons YOU need to teach your children. As a start, help your child to learn as many words as possible by age two, and then foster a rich environment of reading. Read to your child. Buy your child lots of great books. Teach (yes, you) your child to read well before first grade, at least, and make a strong reading start before Kindergarten.<br />And read this book.<br />I praise Mr. Bennett and his colleague for putting together an outstanding book grounded in excellent education fundamentals.<br />I also recommend the excellent book by E. D. Hirsch (editor) called \\"What You're First Grader Need to know.\\" This series continues through other grades, though I don't know anything about the other ones. Also get the \\"Dorling Kindersley Children's Illustrated Encyclopedia\\". And enrich your children's lives with the music of the greatest children's musician of all time, Raffi. Do a search for \\"Raffi.\\" He's the Mr. Rogers of music. It will pay dividends manytimes over.<br />Teach your children.	2002-03-11

Use this book as a valuable guide. Your children will benefit greatly.<br />Parents are primarily responsible for ensuring that their children receive a good educational experience. You need to devote your time and intellect to this goal. And that starts in the home. This book gives you a general guideline of what you need to do to supplement your children's learning.<br />This book also gives you an excellent blue print of what a good school district should be like. The ideas are proven, common sense, and based on firm empirical research. I didn't find them rigid at all. Compare the learning experience in your children's schools to what you read in this book. Hopefully, your childen are experiencing a quality educational experience.<br />Luckily, the portrait of a good school vividly describes the elementary school my seven-year old child attends Cedar Ridge). My wife and I have observed and participated in numerous classes, and I can tell you that it feels good to know that our children live in a great school district, (even if the class sizes could be just a little smaller).<br />And a reminder... we starting educating our children long before they started school. The earliest years of life are the most important. That's when you need to work on vocabulary, thinking, reading, learning, etc.<br />Despite the fact that William Bennett is a social conservative, I found nothing obviously conservative about this book. The materials in the book are well respected, practical, and accurate. Use these guidelines to make sure your children learn what they should.<br />Some activist types might consider some of the study topics liberal or conservative, such as civil rights and the classics, respectively. But I see them as simply what our children need to know. I really don't see anything political about this book. I suspect that the meat of this book really comes from the work of other education experts, with Bennett the visionary to bring this core knowledge to the public through mass publication. After all, he was the Secretary of Education, a position of leadership.<br />I praise Mr. Bennett and his colleague for putting together an outstanding book grounded in excellent education fundamentals.<br />I also recommend the excellent books by E. D. Hirsch (editor) on what your children need to know at various stages of education. (What Your First Grader Needs to Know, etc.) Do a search for E.D Hirsch. The books include great children's stories, fun poems, songs, basic history, art, and much more. We've been reading the first grade book at bed time for awhile now, and both my seven-year old and four-year old enjoy different parts of it. Next year we'll buy the kindergarden and second grade books.<br />I also strongly recommend the outstanding children's music by Raffi, the Mr. Rogers of children's music. \\"Singable Songs for the Very Young; Great with a Peanut Butter Sandwich\\" would be my first choice for precious young children. It has sales surpassing the Triple Platinum mark in North America, and it's just right for little ones.

We've been reading the first grade book at bed time for awhile now, and both my seven-year old and four-year old enjoy different parts of it. Next year we'll buy the kindergarden and second grade books.<br />I also strongly recommend the outstanding children's music by Raffi, the Mr. Rogers of children's music. \\"Singable Songs for the Very Young; Great with a Peanut Butter Sandwich\\" would be my first choice for precious young children. It has sales surpassing the Triple Platinum mark in North America, and it's just right for little ones. Do a search for \\"Raffi.\\"	2002-03-11

I bought this book used from a library, along with a dozen others, a decade ago without much thought of what I was buying. Wow! I ended up with a lifetime of excellent reading. I've since had this book at my bedside, off and on, for the last ten years. So much excellent information is packed into this book that you can keep coming back to it and learning the most important writings of civilization.<br />This book summarizes the works for you. With just a little reading you can say something like, &quot;What Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity did was radically change our perspective of time and space, and matter and energy. He showed that all motion is relative, and that the velocity of light is independent of the motion of its source. The implications are profound. To illustrate...&quot;<br />Or, &quot;What Socrates means by his definition of love, as written in Plato's Symposium, is that love is the pursuit of the beautiful; a desire for the immortal though reproduction. This, at its highest state, is manifested in a generalized love of universal beauty - beautiful souls, thoughts, laws, institutions and the immortal afterlife.&quot;<br />Everyone needs to read these works, and here is a condensed way to do it. It's a small investment in your education.	2002-03-01
