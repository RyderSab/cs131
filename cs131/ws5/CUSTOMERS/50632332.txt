Hiaasen usually takes you through a wild ride through the craziness Florida with evil and incredibly stupid villains.  The incredible wackiness of his previous works was missing here.  Hiaasen fans like me will enjoy this, but if you are new to Carl Hiaasen, you would be better off reading gems like Strip Tease and Tourist Season.	2004-12-28

I was ambivalent until reading this book, but Rose convinced me that baseball should never allow him back.  Read it for yourself and I'm certain you will agree.	2004-09-16

Instead I found a tome about a very self-absorbed woman.  This really is a terrible book.  Don't look for any insight into Mubuto Sese Seko or Nelson Mandela.  I did a Google search on Lynn Duke because I couldn't--and still can't--fathom that the Washington Post would hire a person who wrote a book this bad.	2004-06-20

I agree with every high school student who was forced to read the book and hated it, but the story came alive in the audio version.  The value is not the story, but the colorful path through which the reader is led.  I can see myself opening the CD to a random spot in the book and enjoying it all over again.<br /><br />Give this book a full chance.  Skip the opening chapter if necessary and come back to it later.  It took me some effort to get used to the writing, but once I was able to appreciate Hurston's style, the story became thoroughly enjoyable.	2004-06-16

It took a Google search to prove that Ms. Duke actually wrote for the Washington Post.  If you read this book, you might have the same doubts . . . but the Post did accept her byline.  I hoped to read about recent trends in Africa.  The title suggested I would get insight into Nelson Mandela, who overlooked 27 years in prison to rebuild South Africa, and Mobutu Sese Seko (Kuku wa za Banga), a ruthless despot whose plutocracy bled the resource rich nation of Congo dry.  Instead it was a self-serving, egocentric view of an African-American woman as she tried to fit the paradigm of Africa politics into her own narrow prejudices.  I hoped to learn more about the history of post-colonial Africa, but this book was a waste of time.	2004-04-04

This is a book at allows you to think outside the box.  Anyone who doesn't understand should treat themselves to a read.<br />  I'm no sci-fi fanatic.  I've never watched a complete episode of any version of Star Trek, I've never seen any of the Star Wars movies, and I quickly lost interest in two of Heinlein's other books.  This is not a little-green-come-to-earth story.  It is, instead, a medium that allows you to look with your nose and see with your toes.  Conventional thinkers will be bored and confused.<br />  I've read it twice and will listen to the audible.com version when I get my monthly credits	2004-03-04

Franken is witty and intelligent, but he distorts the truth as much as Ann Coulter or Bill O'Reilly.  For example, he goes on about \\"lies\\" by Coulter, and makes a point about Evan Thomas not being--as Coulter claims--the son of Socialist Norman Thomas.  True enough, but Evan Thomas is the grandson of Norman.  He apparently notes the distinction in the footnotes, but those of us listening to the audio book didn't get footnotes.<br />  Second, Franken is especially venomous toward Christianity.  His comments about wanting to be photographed on a cross at Bob Jones University were neither funny nor tasteful.<br />  Those comments aside, this is a very interesting and-for the most part-funny book.  The section about the pig geyser is not to be missed.  \\"Fair and balanced\\" it isn't, but entertaining it certainly is.	2003-11-09

I borrowed this book on tape for a trip across Florida.  When I returned home I immediately purchased it and shared portions with my sixth and seventh grade students.  My copy now looks one hundred years old after having been carried in backpacks for a few months.<br />  Schlosser tells an amazing story that I found both entertaining and disturbing.  His liberal bias is evident, but even an ardent conservative will be able to look past his rhetoric to learn how the market has created an efficient but chilling industry that shapes they way almost all Americans live.<br />  This book is both good reading and a good read.  It's a page turner that holds its own with a Grisham novel, but it also tells an important story that is overlooked.  Schlosser footnoted his statements, so I trucked down to the Palm Beach County library to verify their claims.  My unscientific review of has proven to me that the author can back up his statements.<br />  I listened and read Fast Food Nation with a critical mind and I am pleased that this book--while both entertaining and disturbing--presented me with facts that I needed to know.<br />Mike Dowling<br />...	2003-07-11

Meet her truly wonderful friends, get a glimpse at winter on the South Pole, and understand the demons tyhat would lead one woman to leave America for the ice.  I think anybody who enjoys adventure stories will like this book.<br />I must warn you, however, that I listened to the audio book, and Dr. Nielsen is a horrible reader.  She even manages to mispronounce her maiden name -- or at least come up with at least three pronounciations.<br />Other reviewers have complained about her use of repeating e-mail in the book.  I did not find that distracting.  Her use of narrative helps to weave the messages together.<br />Another common complaint is that the book is not about surviving breast cancer.  It is not.  You will learn little about the disease or how she coped with it.  Perhaps that is a flaw, but I think you must view Dr. Nielsen as an adventurer.  She tells a marvelous story.  I recommend this book.	2002-08-02

Reid manages to explain a topic as vast as the Far East in a serious but entertaining book. Reid describes his experiences in Japan as he navagates Tokoyo, and eventually enrolls his young daughters in a Japanese elementary school.<br />  Reid became enchanted with Confucius, and my guess is that he had to have missed other factors that contribute to the Asian mind. He glosses over Taoism and Shinto in a few short paragrahs while spending and entire chapter on the history of Confucian thought. Nonetheless, the book managed to be a page turner.<br />  T. R.

An evangelical minister takes his wife and four daughters to central Africa for one year.
