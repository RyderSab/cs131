I'm over halfway finished with the book and I'm thinking of putting it down. It's just boring.  Read one of their other books.	2005-06-13

If you can completely suspend your disbelief perhaps you will like this book.  There is a lot of action and the story keeps moving.	2004-12-05

Once I started reading, I just couldn't stop.  I lost a lot of sleep. It's one of the best books I've read in a while. <br />I read The Relic just prior to reading Cabinet and I think Cabinet is, by far, a much better story.  <br />I was especially pleased when I found the [...] site. They provide additional information and an alternate ending that was never published.   I think I like the alternate ending better than the real ending.  I'd like to hear what other's think.  <br />Great book.  Enjoy.	2004-11-24

I had heard such great things about his books but I was sorely disappointed.  Sure, the action was great.  I love good action.  However, the characters were so waaaaay over the top it became truly annoying.  Dirk Pitt does everything so perfectly.  He never makes mistakes.  He is super-human and super-macho.  The character is completely unbelievable.  The book could have been great had the characters been more \\"down to earth\\".	2004-11-06

It looks like Flynn has found a formula for his books and he's going to keep using it over and over.  It's another book where Mitch Rapp seems to have all the right answers.  It wouldn't be a Flynn novel if there wasn't a really annoying presidential aide.  It it would be a Flynn novel if Rapp didn't verbally abuse them a few times.  <BR>It seemed like two books. I liked the second one better, I guess. <BR>Big disappointment.  Term Limits was a true original novel.  What can't he do that again?	2003-05-25

He does a fine job of displaying his knowledge.  However, the book lacks any real depth.  We never really get to know the characters.  The action scenes lack any umph! The book reads like a movie. For once, I think the movie will be better than the book. And you know there's movie around the corner.	2001-02-09

It's not necessary.  This could have been really great.  Too bad there's so much fluff in between the covers.  Overall a great story and well thought out, as usual. However, I and others, grow tired of Clancy's longer-than-necessary novels. <br />The story reveals a very real look at what could happen should a nuclear device fall into the hands of a terrorist.  This is quite possible today.  What makes the book good is how real this situtation is.  The terrorist group in SUM brings us to the brink of WWIII.  Clancy makes it all make sense and so real.  If you can get past the fluff, this is a good book.	2001-02-05

Yes, this is the book that caused Bill Clinton to finally realize how real the threat of a bio-strike is on the United States.  Too bad this realization didn't come from hearing his advisors but from a book of fiction. Keep in mind, that if this book had such a profound effect on a president, imagine the effect on you.  You will come to realize how truly probable a bio-strike is in the near future.  The book is unsettling only because it is all too real. True, it is fiction but it isn't far from the truth at all.	2001-02-05

This could have been a 5 star book.  The book is packed with very interesting and well documented information.  However, the book is riddled with errors.  I found so many spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors  that the book was actually painful to read.  I could not read 2 pages  without finding a word missing from a sentence.  I can only assume that the  book was not edited before publication.  Without these problems, this book  would have been great!	1999-11-04
