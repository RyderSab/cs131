'Think' was far ahead	After reading Blackburn's other book 'Think' I had to read 'Being good' but I was rather disappointed in the presentation of the subject matter. First of all I didn't like the fact that he is addressing the subject by starting with threats to ethics. I think including some more daily life examples would have made the book a lot more enjoyable. To hell with the theories of great philosophers of age old. I'd rather look at the problem without classifying it as falling into some particular school of thought. The peril of doing otherwise is that if your thinking on some subject, lets say 'a' [somehow] aligns with a particular school of thought then what about problem b,c and d? I'd rather have the author tell me what he thinks about it and leave it upto me to 'judge' for myself if I agree with it or not. <br />Anyhow, the book is still readable if you are looking for a more traditional approach to the subject at hand. <br />And the painting on the cover is refreshing..	2002-01-30

Well I'l leave that for you to figure out as to who and where the nudist is but I had fun reading this book. Being one of the techie myself in the bay area but not a dotcom-er it was interesting to read the inside scoop on the wheeling and dealings of some of the cyber companies. The insider IPO tale of one of them is downright amazing. The ending is kinda blah and Po lingers forever on that stupid clock story.<br />I think people who have not experienced the valley-phenomena yet would find this book even more amusing since the locals tend to take a lot of things for g-r-a-n-t-e-d!	2001-11-02

There are certain things which make a lot of sense and stand out from the rest of the stuff we read and hear about, be it on TV, internet, or magazines. The most important thing this book presents is the argument against the common notion of stocks as the best long term investment option when compared to bonds etc. It is definately not something I'm used to hear or read. Even the champions of long term investing, the Motley Fool, believes in stocks as the best long term investment. This book has compelling arguments to suggest otherwise. For instance, the lack of factoring in inflation factor while comparing performance of stocks vs bonds etc over any period of time. I'm still thinking about it and need to read some more stuff before I fully agree/disagree with the author.<br />Besides that, the book talks about various personal, social, and psychological factors affecting the moves in stock market which underneath has nothing to do with economy in general. There are some interesting observations about the social/political/economic climate at the time of two stock market crashes of 1929 and 1987 and what was the general feeling of people about the stock market before and after the crash.<br />The book also talks about the media frenzy and how 'celebrity' guests on CNBC and the like play a role in stock market behavior and how the so called guests can never really tell the truth because of their vested interested in the inflated stock market. This should not come as a surprise to anyone who catches even few minutes of CNBC before heading out for work in the morning!<br />There is another interesting argument presented against the hoopla surrounding the 'new economy' and the author talks about how internet has not really played a big role in the current stock market booms (well speaking of when NASDAQ was @ 5000 level). Again, I don't fully agree with his explanation but some does make sense...<br />Oh well, a refreshing and thoughtful book, will give you something to tinker upon and perhaps diversify! and go back to the old fashioned 'savings' rather than messing with your 401K by putting 100% in stocks (sounds familiar?).	2001-06-26

I think the author has done a great job exposing a non physicist to the world of higher dimensional physics. <br />Kaku starts the Hyperspace theory (also called Superstring or Supergravity theory) in a chronological fashion. Obviously he talks about Einstein's general relativity and then moves on to the pioneer's in the high dimentional geometry with a broad and very lucid description of Kaluza theory (later to become Kaluza-Klein) and Riemann matrices. <br />According to Kaku , hyperspace theory tells us before the Big Bang, our cosmos was actually a perfect ten-dimensional universe, a world where interdimensional travel was possible. However, this ten-dimensional universe &quot;cracked&quot; in two, creating two separate universes: a four-and a six- dimensional universe. The universe in which we live was born in that cosmic cataclysm. Our four-dimensional universe expanded explosively, while our twin six-dimensional universe contracted violently, until it shrank to almost infinitesimal size. This would explain the origin of the Big Bang. If correct, this theory demonstrates that the rapid expansion of the universe was just a rather minor aftershock of a much greater cataclysmic event, the cracking of space and time itself. The energy that drives the observed expansion of the universe is then found in the collapse of ten-dimensional space and time. According to this theory, the distant stars and galaxies are receding from us at astronomical speeds because of the original collapse of ten-dimensional space and time.<br />This is by far the best description of the theory I've read so far in a book. The subject matter does require concentration. Even though personally it is hard for me to come to terms with many aspects of the theory, it is definately a mind opener.	2001-02-18

I had started reading QM with Nick Herbert's book 'Quantum Reality' and in the middle of the book I realized that I need a little subtler treatment of the subject matter and hence ending up reading this book, 'Taking the Quantum Leap'. I have to the say that Fread has done an outstanding job at explaining the wave-particle duality with reference to all the famous experiments and their interpretations. He then moves on to the famous Bohr vs. Einstien debate EPR. Much of the book is devoted to exploring the point of views of these two schools of thought.. complementarists vs. the continuists. There are chapters on the theory of Parallel Universes etc.<br />My dismay begings, and thats why I gave the book 3 stars rather than a 4! is when towards the end of the book, the whole QM is tunred into a hodge podge of philosophies of human consciousness, fate and free will. To my surprise it seems that the author has made up his mind that whatever the state of QM is today, IS indeed the complete description of the physical world. At least I got that impression. In my opinion, this is only 2001 and who knows what discoveries are waiting to be happen in next several hundred years regarding our current understanding of the physical world. <br />As Einstien once said something to this effect to one of his friends, 'do you really think the moon is there because someone is there to see it!' and yet QM has proven to be successful in proving thores of physical phenomena.<br />Yet indeed I'm still bothered by QM as I was before reading this book but know a lot more about the various schools of thoughts. Could the Schrodinger's cat be alive and dead at the same time in parallel universes?!?<br />All in all, an excellent reading for starters in QM.	2001-02-06

I was browsing the bookstore to look up an IS-IS problem and just happened to pick up this book and to my astonishment it had 45 pages of IS-IS config and troubleshooting, diagrams, IOS output and what not. I just had to get my hands on this book.<br />The book starts from the basics of IP routing with cisco IOS in mind, even tell you about 'routed' vs 'routing' protocols! The protocol coverage starts from RIP then moving on to IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS and BGP. It has an entire chapters on Static and default routing, Redistributing routes, DDR. Appendix has a nice brief discussion of access lists, VLANs, NAT and HSSRP.<br />If you deal with cisco routers, you got to have this book. Specially the beginners can get a lot from the text coz it not only covers the config issues but also the theory behind various routing protocols.<br />All in all, a pleasant book to own and benefit from. And yes I did find solution to my IS-IS problem in the book.	2000-11-15

What had happened in the NASDAQ in 1999 before the correction was absolutely mind blowing and this book might have looked like a bad joke i.e. advocating to invest in companies like International Paper! but now that the dotcoms are down the drain, the valuations are somewhat back on earth, the margin-debt bitten people are done crying, maybe it is time that us i.e. average investors read this book.<br />This book as the name says is all about investing in Dow companies, the giants of the US and global economy. The companies which I truly believe that world could come to an end but GE would still be there. The book covers all the Dow components individually along with their historical financial performance, weaknesses, strenghts and their power to stay in business by being profitable over years and years. There are many different 'low risk' investment strategies covered in this book such as 'High Yielding 5'. These are the 5 Dow stock that you pick annually based on the criteria described, HOLD it for 1 year, redo the math (barely any)and pick your 5 stocks again. You also sell some at this point that didn;t meet your criteria and pick the new ones to fill their spot.<br />Sounds simple, yes! and that's the way it should be. Not only you can ride out the swings of the stock market in this way but also save a ton on commisions, taxes and most importantly be less stressed.<br />If you read the Motley Fool, you'll notice some of their strategies are derived from O'Higgin's methods. <br />A must read for all investors, specially younger people like myself who want to start building the nest yesterday!	2000-10-24

You can imagine what a page turner this novel was that I couldn't keep it down even when I was undergoing an ultrasound! I so vividly remember that day when my parents thought the pain I was having was because of appendicitus and took me to the hospital but I just couldn't keep this book down. It is almost as if you were a part of all that was going on in the plot, your feelings on a roller coaster ride, feeling sympathies for the bad guy (you have to read to find out). The Einstien's character is one of the amazing portrayals I've ever come across. <br />The movie later on never did justice to the book, so please don't watch the movie!<br />Oh yeah, the reason I picked up Koontz was because of the relatively smaller size novels he writes when compared to Stephen Kings. Back in undergrad school as EE major, we were really short of time and there just wasn't enough time to read mega King's novels. A friend of mine handed me this copy of Koontz and wow! I was a believer in Koontz from that day onwards. <br />Another thing I love about Koontz is the fact that his story develops from the very first page and sorts of grips you right there. Perhaps this was the best of Koontz I've read so far.	2000-10-23

Some of the guys I lended the book to, who are beginners in the field, right out of school and have not actually worked on the routers find this book helpful because of its basic coverage of cisco IOS features. <br />It starts from the very basic configurations tasks and moves on to adding other IOS features such as routing protocols and access-lists. It talks about configuring IP addresses along with little theory, serial, ethernet, tunnel and loopback interfaces and encapsulation types.<br />However it does not cover all the knobs provided by IOS to fine tune the protocols such as OSPF, BGP etc. It covers  the legacy protocols as well. There is no coverage of IS-IS at all and that's the sticking point. There is a vast amount of ISP deployment of IS-IS and the author ignores this fact. There are no troubleshooting tidbits regarding the routing protocols, such as how to avoid and fix routing loops etc.<br />So if you are just starting in cisco routers, you can use this book. Keep in mind that for hands-on practise and doing excercises in the book you'll need 3 cisco baby routers (2500 series).	2000-10-13

Keeping that in mind this is a good book helping you overcome the early stumbling blocks for beginners in drawing. People who are doing it on their own as opposed to class instruction wil find it quite helpful.<br />It covers all the basic aspects such as materials, medium, line drawing, blind contour, tone, value, perspective, composition and some figure.<br />I learned a great deal from this book.

I had it for the art history class and I think a lot of schools use this as a standard text.<br />It starts from the prehistoric era including the cave paintings in Lascaux, moving on to the Egyptian era to Etruscan to Roman to Greek..... so on so forth.<br />In the new edition there are plenty of color pictures as opposed to monochromes in older editions. The book does not specifically and individually talk about different art movements and artists during the course of history, which is perfectly ok.<br />Also in the new edition some of the prehistoric dates have been revised based on the results from carbon datings (according to my instructor).<br />All in all the best art history book in the market available today. It comes as a handy reference if you want to look up quick facts such as who the hell was Hatshepsut!	2000-10-11

I remember during my first job after graduating, our HR rep was telling me about my company's 401K plan and how good it is compared to others given the plan options and company match and boy did I turn a deaf ear to her! Like many new graduates I was just happy to get the paycheck and had no clue about retirement plans and IRAs. The older wiser employees used to talk about 401K during lunch etc and I wouldn't know what the hell they are talking about. I did figure out that it is something 'good' and everyone is ought to enroll.<br />I finally went to the bookstore and picked this book (at random). It turned out to be a life saver. It clearly explains what actually 401 plans are and how they work. It did not assume any previous knowledge on the subject. The book talks about the legal aspects of the plan as well and ofcourse how the employees can take advantage of this. You will clearly understand pre-tax deductions, company match, taxes relevant to 401K, what plan administrator is, what kind of different plan options are out there etc. <br />Most importantly it gives you an idea as to how you can set financial goals for your retirement and based on that and your age now how much you should contribute to your plan. There are many other facts about 401K covered such as taking a loan out of your 401 if you want to buy a house for instance. Ofcourse there are some 'penalties' associated with it and the book does a great job explaining those.<br />After reading this book I realized how important it is to enroll ASAP in 401K plan coz why the hell you'd want to miss out on $ for $ company match. Its literally free money for god sake!	2000-10-10

All I knew at that point was that I would be better off getting into computer field as opposed to any other professional career. This was the time in my country when PCs were unheard of in my country but I was one of the lucky ones to play games on my dad's Mac at work. This book was a gem and I remember reading it and rereading it. I was fascinated by the course of events that took place in the silicon valley and consequently changed our lives forever, literally.<br />There is a lot of history in this book as to how Wozniak 'the mozart of digital design' and Jobs put the Apple together, what was happening in Xerox PARC, what was Amdahl doing (remember 'em?!) in those days, how the employees of IBM used to sing the company song (yikes!), how did Intel come into existense, who created Visicalc but did not cash on it etc etc...<br />Oh yeah you will read a lot about the history of 'killer apps' in the valley and who was behind them.<br />Anyone interested in the silicon valley history is ought to read this book just to see how it used to be in the olden days (relatively speaking in internet time). We might appreciate things a little more than just taking them for granted.	2000-10-10

Now that I finished it I give it four stars. I learned a great deal about world lines and Minkowski's spacetime diagrams. This is such an important concept that Einstien has shunned in the begining but later on used it as the foundation fot his general theory of relativity. <br />The book also has a prologue written in 1996 reflecting on some of the facts stated earlier in the book and new advancements in the field of relativity/quantum physics/cosmology.	2000-10-05

This book actually covers all the cisco implementation details of OSPF and talks about practical real world scenarios. It has some really cool case studies in which you have to design an OSPF network to connect several remote locations with the campus network. In fact, you can download that chapter from cisco's website. <br />I didn't read this book from cover to cover but use it as a reference to figure out OSPF related issues. For instance if you want to see how the 'designated router other' selection works in cisco, you can easily look up in this book. It has good explanation of all OSPF parameters that cisco has implemented in the IOS and the examples show the actual configuration as well. You'd have guessed already, but it covers in detail the implementation of OSPF areas, NSSA, stub area, virtual links, IGP interaction and interface related parameters etc.<br />One of the reviewers who recommends TCP/IP vol 1 instead of this book is obviously comparing apple with an orange! Comer's book is classic and a must read for all networking folks but its targeted towards TCP/IP suite of protcols and not specifically towards routing protocols.	2000-10-02

Primarily, it is Armitage's writing style which is a little turn off. If you have read other research papers by Armitage then you'd know what I'm talking about. I had to read a lot of those during my thesis work.<br />Another reason for being luke warm is that QoS is a little vague topic to write about. Comparable works that I've read are: 'Quality of Service' by Ferguson and 'Supporting Service level agreements in IP networks' by Verma.<br />This book touches upon a lot of different current topics in networking such as DiffServ, Inteserv, MPLS etc without going into too much detail.<br />Unless you have practically worked on either developing or configuring QoS in routers, you'd have a hard time grasping some of the concepts because they might seem little too abstract at times. If you understand link coloring, CoS, constraint based routing and how routers (such as Juniper) actually implement it, then this book will make more sense.	2000-10-02

For instance if you want to check out K1 K2 bytes in a SONET frame and what they do, you can easily find it in this book. In a similar way it covers a broad range of topics, such as ATM, Frame Relay, SONET/SDH, digital hierarchy, xDSL etc.<br />Its not a definative guide since it does not cover any theoretical aspects of the technologies but still a good everyday reference with tons of pages.	2000-09-30

We had it for a junior level course in advanced electronics and I learned a lot about amplifiers from this book. The maths is a little too much to handle at times but it really clarifies the theory once you get it.	2000-09-30

If you have loved TMF website, you can certainly gain a lot from this book. Be prepared to face the music when you are filling out  the workbook to figure out your networth! I was pleasantly surprised though.<br />This book is practical and every adult should read and work through it to figure out one's financial standing. The guys are straight forward and tell you like it is.<br />You can use it to figure out your budget, spendings, how much you can actually invest and how to pay off your high interest debts.<br />Talks about DRIPs and DSPs, mutual funds, index funds etc etc.<br />I recommend to all my friends who are thinking about investing in stock market but are buried in debt from their fancy car purchases!	2000-09-29

If you are one of those person who feel inspired at times and get this urge to 'draw' but you never have and you are scared, apprehensive, shy or whatever.. just pick this book and follow the instructions page by page and do the exercises. Trust me, by the end of the day/week you will be able to draw whatever you want to draw. This is my first hand experience.<br />I never had drawing instruction in entire school life growing up and I picked this book (some old version)from some old used bookstore and it was like magic.<br />It starts from the very basic yet so daunting exercise to draw a picture which is upside down. And this where you make the shift from left to right side of the brain. Growing up in this world, we associate 'symbols' with everything we see. For instance, an eye has a shape, do does a face, hair etc. When we look at ourself in the mirror or look at a picture we never pay attention  to the fact that our eyes are located halfway from our chin and forehead... <br />This book will make you see the things the way they are and not they way you 'think' they are.<br />Kudos to Betty, she taught me drawing from her book.	2000-09-29

Written by the best in the business today.<br />I picked it up basically for BGP and it covers all the details of BGP with real world applications. Icky topics like Synchronization, IGP-BGP interaction etc are explained with amazing clarity with diagrams and later on in chapter 10-11 you can see the actual IOS config. I learned a lot from Tuning BGP capabilities chapter which also covers route filtering and route-maps.<br />Apart from BGP, the entire book is full of useful information. If you have a job in which you have to deal with routing protocols, be it design, implementation, testing, administration you ought to read this book, if nothing else, just for the heck of it.	2000-09-29

I found it to be little unnatural as opposed to 'natural' way of drawing.  There is a lot of emphasis on blind contour (which is a good thing to help loosen up) but the way exercises are designed just doesn't fit in today's day and age. It takes away the spontaniety from you if it tells you to sit for 3 straight hours and do this exercise then move on to the next one, so on so forth.<br />The chapter on Drapery is probably the worst and goes nowhere.<br />If you dont't like this book it doesn't mean you are not disciplined. Its just that like everything else in life, people have different likes and dislikes.	2000-09-29

The book provides you with sound mathematical background for techniques used in encryption etc. It covers all the mathematical aspects of Markov chain processes, public key encryption, cryptography etc.<br />It was just too boring for me but was a required course in a way &lt;sigh&gt;.<br />Yarlagadda has a lot of practical experience working for US defense projects in commmunications but he wasn't able to transform that knowledge either in his books or lecture (or slides should I say!)	2000-09-28

Certified Tech Support	Books	3	3	3	N	N	just another book on cisco	The book has question and answer format.<br />It is good for novices encountering IOS for the first time. It only covers the fundamental configurations and does not really talk about different pitfalls.<br />I primarily bought it to get some help on BGP cases and it did answer some of my questions regarding route-maps etc. Some of the examples are wrong. For instance on page 196, as-path access list example, refers to access-list 100 but the access list actually later configured is 200... this kind of thing can throw new folks off a little bit.<br />It does not talk about RSVP and MPLS/Tag switching at all.<br />Not a must buy but it can help you on and off resolving day to day problems with IOS.	2000-09-28

At the time this book was published, people didn't even know the term MPLS as opposed to now when it has become a latest acronym to be exploited by marketing parasites.<br />This book gives an excellent description of different label switching techniques implemented by different vendors at the time, such as IBM, Toshiba, Ipsilon and cisco. This breaks down the chapters on vendor by vendor basis, explains their implementation and then at the end compares all the different approaches.<br />Even though Yakov and Davie are both from cisco, you can't tell it from reading the book because they have presented the implementations in total impartiality and fairness and only judging the implementations on its technical merits.<br />After reading the book, you'd understand fundamentals like FEC, label stack encoding, LDP and various techniques/signaling to carry label switching information.<br />If you want to buy a book om MPLS today, you should go for the latest edition of this book, titled, 'MPLS technology and applications'.	2000-09-27

The author clearly has no particular audience in mind and sways from writing about probability density functions to QoS to SLAs. <br />This book is just a collection of the terms and acronyms floating around these days such as Intserv, diffserv and label switching etc.<br />After reading the book I still could not understand what he is trying to explain and what was the purpose of writing this book.<br />The subject matter does not have any practical implementation and he fails to demonstrate the use of theory in practice.<br />I'd like to hear what other readers have to say, unfortunately there is only one review on the board, perhaps silence speaks louder than words!	2000-09-20

Admittedly,  the book is not as detailed as Stevens' but for anyone starting in the  field of networking this book should be a must read.<br />It comes as a handy  reference as well while performing day to day job functions. This book is  the theory behind cisco and juniper routers. You might find that it does  not cover all the subtelties of routing protocols but whatever is in there  is good enough for starters.<br />This book will give you a solid foundation  and background to read other books such as 'Routing in the internet',  'Anatomy...OSPF' and 'BGP4' etc.	2000-07-27

This book is nothing to be scared about, coz without  going in mathematical details of tensor analysis! he has presented the  complex ideas in plain english. All you have to know is basic high school  physics. Igor's writing style is personal and you'd feel an afinity towards  him while reading his personal accounts.<br />The chapters in the end need a  bit more concentration but it pays off big and makes you wonder 'can this  reallt be!

I was waiting for this sequel ever since the Switching in IP networks book. <br />The details about  Toshiba's CSR and IBM's ARIS are narrowed down. Most of the information in  the following chapters is pretty much the same as in the previous book but  chapter 7 and onwards is a killer. I have not seen such a good explanation  of constraint based routing, CSPF calculation and CR-LDP. Armed with this  information, relevant RFCs are making whole lotta more sense to me now.  Intserv and Diffserv are briefly explained but in a style that makes you  say 'aaaah I get it now!'<br />There are some spelling and typos here and  there. Signaling is mostly spelled as 'signalling'. All in all this book is  a must have for anyone working on MPLS technology.

This is the best description of BGP4 I've come across so far. Working for a networking company that makes products for the internet core I was asked to educate  myself in BGP. <br />This book covers all the basic BGP path attributes to the  advanced topics such as router reflectors, confederations and communities.  After reading this book I fully understood what routing policy means and  how BGP uses that to make the internet work. BGP is indeed the work horse  behind the internet.<br />I recommend to read this book before indulging  yourself in the RFC1771 for more details.<br />I even the like the simplistic  round diagrams throughout the book, a fresh look... something non-cisco  &lt;thank god&gt;<br />And who better to write the book but John himself, one  of the brains behind Juniper networks!	2000-07-20

I think its because of the subject matter itself. QoS is an elusive topic and the war of religious proportions between IP and ATM proponents make it even more vague at times. The first few chapters are a  good introduction for someone new to the topic of QoS. The author(s) lost  me on the Integrated Services topic. <br />As for later chapters, for example,  MPLS, the description is just so so. Definately 'Switching in IP networks'  by Rekhter is a mother on that topic.<br />Other than that, lot of editorial  and spelling mistakes. Wake up Wiley Publishing!  On page 83 for instance,  spell checker did not catch 'theto' and 'layer 813'.	2000-05-03

This book is a winner. <br />That said I agree with the other reviewers  including the first gentleman who seems to be quite turned off by the book.  Personally I like the treatment of topics like BGP messages,  AS-path/attrib, I-BGP and multihoming. I didnt quite get the BGP community  concept thoroughly from the book.<br />I like the 'practical' approach of the  book and the way John has used the ISP examples to explain the concept.  Come to think of it, its more of a BGP concept book. For any protocol's  message type def, ofcourse, nothing compares to RFC.<br />After reading the  book, rfc1771 was a breeze and you can used this book as a handy reference  to accompany the rfc.	2000-04-13

Ihave been dealing with IP and IPoverATM networks for three yearsnow.

The book has no spark and in certain chapters its totally incoherent, specially the chapter on BGP. The edition that I have does not talk about BGP4. <br />I've always found RFCs as my source of information and I regret wasting time on this book.<br />On a different topic if you like an interesting treatment of IP/ATM integration, read 'Switching in IP networks'. This one definately goes beyond RFCs!	2000-04-05
