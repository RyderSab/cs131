This reknowned book about the notorious correspondence womanizer and murderer Harry F. Powers from Clarksburg West Virginia that caused quite a stir back in that community in the 1930's with a theater substituting for a courtroom and of course his ultimate hanging.His persona was loosely based on Robert Mitchum's portrayal in the movie\\"The Night of The Hunter\\" based on the book by Davis Grubb.It's a rare book,hard to find that was published back in 1931 and hopefully it should be republished someday especially in paperback.West Virginia University Press and other publishers should take note!!!!!!!!!	2005-08-04
