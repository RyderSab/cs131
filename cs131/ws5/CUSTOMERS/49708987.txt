Why Harry Potter weapons, why Dr. Doom Armor? He stole not only from himself (which I, admittedly, found somewhat clever) but from other people with way too much leeway.<br /><br />I did, however, read this book end-to-end without interruption, much the same way I'd devour a bowl of instant pudding.  It's a pretty good dessert, but ultimately unsatisfying.	2004-11-03

I sought this book out using Amazon's new &quot;full-book&quot; search feature.  I had read it as a kid, but couldn't remember the title or the author.<br />It was great reading it again.  I appreciated Tevis' way with storytelling and the fact that he didn't waste time with too much scientific explanation.	2003-11-18

Wanting to complete my collection, the \\"Essential\\" series is a nice way to read up on stories that were published before I was collecting. (Indeed, in this case, before I was born.)<br />This is cheaply printed and bound, (Mind you this is not necessarily a criticism) the B&W art starts to hurt your eyes after a few pages.  Some of these stories are so badly dated that they're barely worth reading anymore.<br />If you're a fan, you need this, but don't expect any of it to surpass the mediocre.	2003-08-28

That's very similar to Coulter's attitude in this book.<br />Dissent is not treason and should not be mistaken for such.  Honest disagreement with our government is as much in our role as Americans as is our loyalty to its causes...and when we disagree, we should take action at the ballot box or the editorial page.<br />If this were not so, we'd still be British Citizens. (Long Live the King!)<br />I'll support Coulter's right to be a loudmouth if she'll support mine.	2003-08-06

I especially enjoyed Evan Dorkin's humorous contribution.  The reprints were unecessary.  Any Cap collector worth his salt has them already.  Why not give us two more original stories?  Or if you MUST reprint something, why not reprint Joe Simon/Jack Kirby's original Cap stories?  Or some 40's or 50's stories we've rarely seen?<br />The original stories here, however, are stellar.  Worth the asking price for a nice hardcover.	2002-09-29

A bad, bad, sense of \\"contractual obligation\\" is passed by this. Frank Miller \\"writes\\" (and I use this term loosely) an adaptation of something much better done in \\"Kingdom Come.\\"<br />What is Batman's motivation for the ultimate carnage in issue three?  I don't know.  Where is the art that made \\"Dark Knight\\" the treat that it was?  I don't know.  Why does Plastic Man's hair keep changing color?  I don't know.<br />For those of you gluttonous enough to purchase this anyway--I'll avoid a spoiler and say that the threat to Carrie Kelly in issue three (which appears out of nowhere and is not referred to in either of the previous issues) is the most ridiculous \\"deus ex machina\\" of any that I've ever read in a comic book. (A field full of them.)<br />If Frank Miller didn't want to write a sequel to \\"Dark Knight\\" he should have refused rather than spreading this swill on toast and calling it a sandwich.<br />I beg you folks, re-read \\"Kingdom Come,\\" a much worthier sequel to \\"Dark Knight\\" and force DC to send unpurchased copies of this [junk] to the shredder.<br />You'll find this in cut-out bins in 3 months at less than cover price....	2002-08-02
