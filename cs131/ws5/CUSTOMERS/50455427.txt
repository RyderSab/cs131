US	50455427	R16EFVF9MFLK3Q	0679728058	315945962	The Vintage Guide to Classical Music: An Indispensable Guide for Understanding and Enjoying Classical Music	Books	5	240	242	N	N	A no-brainer recommendation for classical music newbies.	I spend a fair bit of time (well, perhaps *too* much time) participating in classical music discussion boards on the internet. A frequent question that arises from people new to classical music is that of a good reference book to acquaint them with the field. Generally, what these newbies ask for is, in my experience, too much to expect from a single book: typically, they are looking for both composer information (and how a particular composer fits into the canon of classical music) and recommendations for specific recordings of works of classical composers. While I have a few such books in my own library, these tend to date themselves quickly on the recommended-recordings side while remaining serviceable on the composer-description side. I have a better recommendation for those interested, which I provide in my concluding remarks. For now, I'll limit my comments to the composer-description (or, better, composer-contribution) side of the matter, and the strengths of Swafford's book.    My experience with such books goes back to Aaron Copland's 1957 \\"What to Listen for in Music.\\" This classic played a large role in getting me on my own journey in classical music, but it is now quite out of date; it doesn't even touch on the most recent half-century. (William Schuman updated this book, but even that fell well short of the mark for those interested in contemporary music.)    This Swafford book is, I believe, the best of its kind for the purpose of setting out the \\"essential canon of classical music\\" and the composers (and their key works) who comprise it. To better understand why I think Swafford's book is best, perhaps I should begin with the fact that I have a few views, somewhat strongly held, regarding what such a book should contain if it is to encourage the classical music newcomer.    The first of these is that it should cover, in helpful detail, the entire tradition of western classical music from the Middle Ages to (more or less) the present day. To do less, by including less, is to downplay the role of historical development: an isolated composer, or period in music, lacks context to understand his, or its, place in the canon.    The second is that, like it or not, all composers are not equally \\"canonical\\" in the sense of being of equal importance from an historical perspective. If the writer is *too* inclusive by including a large number of composers of lesser stature, this will only serve to dilute the importance of the true \\"canonical\\" composers unless the effort is of encyclopaedic length.    The third is that temporal context, i.e., the societal and cultural milieu in which a composer has worked, is a key component to understanding what, how and why the composer has written what he (or she) has. A part of that understanding is how the composer acted within that milieu and reacted, or worked, according to the tradition and the materials available.    The fourth - and perhaps most important - is that the author's preferences and prejudices should not affect objectivity: there must be a sense of even-handedness indicating that, whether or not the author *likes* a specific composer, the composer is properly included on the merits.    With these views as a given, Swafford's book is easily the best of its kind. Swafford grasps the long arc of classical music beginning in the Middle Ages with chant (both monophony and polyphony, with worthwhile comments on Protin and then Machaut, the first clearly acknowledged contributors). The Baroque, Classical, Romantic and Twentieth-Century modernist periods then unfold logically as each successive period builds on its predecessor(s).     Each important composer is given approximately 8 to 12 pages for a satisfactorily detailed description of his importance and contributions, his relationship to his milieu and how he built on the tradition in place before him, and sufficient biographical information for us to see the human side of him. This is then followed by 2 or more pages thatdescribe what his most important works were: what they are like, and why they are important. More than a few of these composer sections are inspired in their writing, with the ones on Beethoven, Berlioz, Debussy, Ives, Bartk and Stravinsky being particularly fine examples of Swafford's craft. And, while the emphasis is on instrumental and orchestral, rather than operatic, music, three primarily operatic composers (Monteverdi, Wagner and Verdi) share equal billing because the \\"long arc\\" would be incomplete without them.    Swafford's detailing of important composers ends in the 20th century with Shostakovich and Britten. But he includes briefer descriptions of many other 20th century composers (and their key works) at the end of this chapter. (He does likewise for the preceding music periods as well; no one of true historical importance is overlooked.)    The book is interspersed throughout with extended \\"sidebars\\" that discuss various classical music concepts (e.g., melody; consonance and dissonance; monophony, polyphony and homophony; sonata form; tonality and atonality) in simple terms. An afterword, \\"Music: An Approach to Defining the Indefinable,\\" comes as close to an all-inclusive description of what music is, and its \\"ineffability,\\" as any I've ever read. The book concludes with a summary of recommended works for building a classical library (actually, a compilation of the recommendations that Swafford had earlier made in the body of the text) and a glossary of technical terms in easily-understandable language.    Swafford's writing throughout is masterful, and he always seems to find the words that clarify, rather than obfuscate, without being didactic. This should come as no surprise to anyone who has read his superb biographies of Charles Ives and Johannes Brahms.    Since Swafford's recommendations for building a classical library don't include specific recordings (except in very rare instances for early music), I recommend that a classical music newcomeralso acquire something like \\"The Penguin Guide to (Classical) Compact Discs.\\" These two books, used together, should get you well on your way.    Highly recommended!    Bob Zeidler	2004-12-02

This quote, attributed to Milton Babbitt in his 1958 High Fidelity magazine article \\"The Composer as Specialist,\\" sits in the middle of this intriguing book by Michael Broyles. Never mind that this was more editorial license than Babbitt, and that it haunted Babbitt forevermore. It conveniently divides Broyles's book into two unequal chronological parts: The \\"before,\\" when composers were mavericks out of necessity, and the \\"after,\\" when it seemed that every composer in a new aesthetic but not a serialist was saying \\"I want to be an American maverick too!\\" Put briefly, this book is all about \\"unorthodoxy\\" amongst American composers from Colonial times to today. It is well-written by Broyles, an expert on the history of American classical music and its relationship with culture and society.    Nearly 250 years of unorthodoxy in American music is a huge subject, and Broyles does well by it, if not quite to the extent suggested by the dust jacket blurbs. But that's a matter of the size of the assignment. Without highlighting some mavericks at the expense of others (and some interesting ones have been overlooked), this book would have been much larger. As it is, there is no shortage of material to hold one's interest.    Broyles covers the beginnings of American music with two early mavericks: William Billings in the Colonial era and Anthony Philip Heinrich in the decades prior to the Civil War. Both were mavericks by being composers when this was hardly a socially-acceptable endeavor. Both were self-taught and radical for their time. Billings is remembered for his hymnody. Heinrich is barely remembered at all, but in some respects was a precursor to Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Stephen Foster and Charles Ives. The post-Civil War decades of the 19th century largely get glanced over; these decades were hard times for this maverick tradition: The establishment of symphony orchestras in America during this period, led by European conductors, marked a sea change toward European- or at least European-influenced - art music.    Broyles conveniently divides the 20th century in half: \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" the \\"tyranny of serialism\\" that took hold at mid-century. The first two decades were dominated by two mavericks: Charles Ives, the private composer who waited decades for much of his music to be performed, and Leo Ornstein, the Russian firebrand, newly in America and concertizing with his dissonant keyboard compositions.    The 1920s roared with the ultramodernist movement, including Edgard Varse, Carl Ruggles, Charles Seeger, Ruth Crawford, Henry Cowell, George Antheil, and even Aaron Copland in his formative years. Much of this ultramodernist \\"outbreak\\" took place in the brief 1922 - 1926 period, which Broyles calls American music's Cambrian Explosion. The ultramodernists didn't find public audiences for their radical music, so they simply did what the serialists were to do three decades later: They became their own community audience (enhanced by a few brave souls looking for something other than European art music).    With the Depression years, and then WW II, ultramodernism fell out of favor and went dormant. During these two decades, America saw the rise of populist music (Copland, Seeger and Crawford [by then Crawford Seeger]) and the relatively conservative comforts of neoromanticism and neoclassicism.    Broyles reserves most of the second half of his book for the recent half-century of these 250 years. This period is likely the one to interest most readers (and I include myself in this category). Regrettably, this is barely enough space to skim the surface, given that his emphasis is on \\"the tyranny of serialism\\" and a few (but hardly all) of the reactions to serialism: The last 50 years in American music has seen \\"upheaval after upheaval\\" and is easily worth a volume of its own.    The first such upheaval was, of course, total serialism itself, with its overt objective of removing all traces of Eurocentric expressionism from music, to be replaced by calculated parameters of pitch, duration, timbre and dynamics. That total serialism baffled and put off concertgoers at the time is to belabor the obvious; this was \\"academic\\" music-making that found its natural refuge in universities (but not necessarily music conservatories, which, by and large, stuck by their \\"traditionalist\\" roots). And, while Milton Babbitt's words, quoted at the top, largely fit the situation at the time, they seem better placed in the mouths of Pierre Boulez, and, to a slightly lesser extent, Charles Wuorinen, composers who - Broyles makes quite clear - were totally unsympathetic to audiences' pleas.    The major reactions to total serialism were the aleatoric (\\"chance\\") works of John Cage and the early minimalism of LaMonte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich and Philip Glass. It almost seems beyond the point to state that virtually all of Cage's music, and much of early minimalism, was just as devoid of expression as was total serialism. What we DO begin to see here, particularly with Cage, is both a move toward \\"music not as 'music qua music' but as performance art\\" (a theme that Broyles carries through to the conclusion of the book) and the emergence of the \\"composer as cult of personality.\\"    These two aspects lead quite naturally into a pair of strange bedfellows who share a chapter: Harry Partch and Frank Zappa. Had I my own druthers, I'd have placed Zappa and Cage in the same chapter, and given Partch a full chapter of his own: There is a \\"purity\\" to Partch's efforts to develop a unique compositional aesthetic and a true gesamtkuntswerk, well above and beyond the early steps toward \\"music as performance art\\" as put forth by Cage and Zappa.    In a penultimate chapter (\\"Looking Back: Puritanism, Geography and the Myth of American Individualism\\"), Broyles endeavors to summarize the American maverick composer tradition and its place among culture and society in general, mostly successfully. The final chapter (\\"Looking Forward: 'The End of the Renaissance?'!\\") is, I think, less successful (or at least less hopeful in its outlook). Using the works of Meredith Monk as a new paradigm for \\"music as performance art\\" (with a mention of Yo-Yo Ma's highly-stylized video of the Bach cello suites as a near-final throw-in), it is difficult to NOT conclude that Broyles sees the fetishization of music as performance art as the direction in which we might be heading.    I don't know whether anything should be made of the fact that the dust jacket has postage-stamp-sized photos of Ives, Ornstein, Cage, Zappa, Partch and Monk. Each in his (or her) way was a maverick in terms of setting out on a new path. Ultimately, history will record which of these paths were dead ends and which were not. My money is on Ives as the principal survivor, with an honorable mention to Partch for his integrity and singlemindedness of purpose against daunting odds (even though performances of his works largely died with him).    Fascinating reading! Even if Broyles seems, in his choices, to have emphasized personality over substance, and, in the process, made little if any mention of a host of composers who were (and are) equal to this maverick definition.

(sung to the melody of \\"If I were a rich man...\\") <br /> <br />Why, I'd be reading him this splendid illustrated children's book! <br /> <br />What on earth is an heirless geezer like me doing, reviewing a children's book? Well, that's a reasonable question. The only sensible answer that I can come up with is that I'm simply somewhere in the middle of my second childhood, \\"up to my eyeballs in Ives.\\" <br /> <br />Mordicai Gerstein prefaces this enjoyable children's book with the statement \\"Everything I know about Charles Ives I learned from listening to his music, and from my dear friend, Jan Swafford, whose epic biography, 'Charles Ives: A Life with Music,' was the main source and inspiration for this book.\\" And so it is that Jan Swafford has also been the main source and inspiration for my own second childhood with Charlie Ives. I can actually date my \\"second childhood\\"  study of the life and music of Charlie to the time I was reading a borrowed copy of his Ives biography while awaiting my own copy. <br /> <br />The narrative text of \\"What Charlie Heard\\" (all accurate, and admirably complete, by the way) is quite brief; probably not much more than a few hundred words in total. (While no expert on the matter, I believe that the narrative can be read by a child of 7 or 8. In fact, I provided a copy of this book to a friend's son for his 8th birthday. But I wouldn't consider him \\"average\\" by any definition; very precocious would be more like it. Hopefully he didn't find it to be boring.) <br /> <br />Is it possible that a book so brief in its narrative text can actually \\"tell\\" the story about Charlie Ives and his life with music, with all of its \\"ups\\" and \\"downs\\"? Sure it can! All one needs to do is to pay heed to the remarkable illustrations, and to take the time necessary for pulling out all of the clues hidden in these illustrations. And, while it isn't necessarily possible to figure out from the narrative and the illustrations just what Charlie Ives's music sounds like, the youthful reader should certainly come away with the expectation that the music sounds \\"different,\\" given how it was that pretty much everything in Charlie's life and environment found its way into his music in one form or another. And that may be \\"half the battle,\\" as they say, toward an early appreciation of America's greatest composer. <br /> <br />I know-rather directly-that Jan Swafford admires Mordicai Gerstein's book on Ives as much as Gerstein admires Swafford's. So I just had to take a look at it. (I never did have an opportunity to see the earlier copy that had been a birthday present; it was a \\"drop ship.\\") Now I've got my own copy, I've seen and read it, and I'm impressed. But what next? <br /> <br />Well, given the circumstances, perhaps I'll just read this really neat book to my cat. He's about the right age in \\"human years\\": between 7 and 8 as I write this. And he's listened to Charlie's music along with me, without raising a noticeable fuss. <br /> <br />And his name happens to be Charlie. And, no, it's no accident. :-) <br /> <br />Bob Zeidler	2004-08-23
US	50455427	R2ZMFC4TXVJZRH	0785818707	371834706	The Complete Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Pretty good. But could use some better editing.	This book is one that you might expect to find buried in the books section of a discount club superstore, along with picture books on dogs and cats, plants, flowers and birds, World War II, Corvettes and Ferraris and other assorted planes, trains and automobiles, and what-have-you. And that is precisely where I happened to stumble across it while recently \\"weekend shopping.\\" However, I don't think it particularly likely that the typical Amazon.com shopper looking for such a book will trip over it here, except by accident. So perhaps my thoughts on the book will bring it some additional customer exposure. It is not bad for what it is, it is lavishly illustrated (although not of \\"coffee table book\\" size), and it is certainly inexpensive enough.      \\"The Complete Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments,\\" subtitled \\"A comprehensive guide to music instruments from around the world,\\" is written by two Dutch authors (Bert Oling and Heinz Wallisch) who clearly know their stuff. Described and depicted (mostly with high-quality color photographs) is a wide variety of musical instruments from antiquity to modern times and from all corners of the globe, in chronological order by instrument family (percussion, strings, woodwinds, brass, keyboards, electronic), showing how the families of instruments developed over time. And many of them obscure in present-day times, although they may have seen use in the past. There is even, near the back of the book, a list of internet resources where additional information may be found. (One of these, contrabass.com, is a website that I have had bookmarked for some years now. It is a treasure trove of \\"instrumental arcana\\" that describes in even fuller detail a number of instruments, such as ophicleides and serpents, heckelphones and sarrusophones, that see little use today but which were the forerunners and/or alternatives to more commonly used instruments of modern times. This contrabass.com website even includes a discography of recordings that actually use these arcane instruments.)      This book will be of greatest interest to those of an inquisitive musical instrument bent, looking for a place to start in terms of identifying and cataloging instruments of antiquity and pre-modern times, as well as those of non-Western origin. In particular, those who follow the \\"HIP\\" (historically informed performance) practices of modern instrumentalists and ensembles, or who are world music fans, will find the book to be quite valuable for describing the instruments in actual use in such musical performances.      Considering the comprehensiveness of the book, however, there are some minor but nonetheless surprising oversights. Here are a few omissions that I managed to catch:      * The tragat, a Hungarian clarinet-like woodwind having saxophone-like \\"overblowing.\\"      * The Irish Uilleann (\\"elbow\\") bagpipes.      * Frame drums (other than tambourines and bodhrans), such as those from North Africa.      * Instruments of the Balinese gamelan orchestra.      * \\"One-off\\" but nonetheless important instruments, such as those invented and used by Harry Partch.      A few of the photos have erroneous captions. (For example, the German bandoneon, made popular by its use in Argentinean tangos, is actually illustrated using the photo of a more conventional concert accordion.) And some of the descriptions seem to suffer from a language gap of sorts. (For instance, the thumb piano, from Zimbabwe, known nearly everywhere, from what I can determine, as the mbira, here gets a different and unfamiliar name.)      Much of the above \\"carping\\" can be chalked up to my personal interest in completeness and accuracy, and the typical reader will probably not even catch such points. But, to go back to my brief description at the outset, this effort could probably have used a qualified editor; proper names are also occasionally misspelled. As far as I can determine, the authors took it upon themselves to do the entire book without proper editorial help. And more power to them; English is, after all, their second language. I should do so well writing a book in Dutch!      Summary: Not perfect or complete, but an excellent bargain and a good starting point for someone needing such information and willing to read further.    Bob Zeidler	2004-07-28

How better to observe the month of the 50th anniversary of Charles Ives's death (May 19, 1954) than with some comments on a 30-year-old book that celebrated the 100th anniversary of his birth? Well, I can't think of a better way for this special month.    The year 1974 saw a flurry of Ivesian activity, in performances and recordings of Ives's music, and in symposia and publications. This book-\\"An Ives Celebration\\"-while not published until 1977, captures a series of symposia and concerts held during the Charles Ives Centennial Festival-Conference of 17 - 21 October, 1974. It is, to my way of thinking, the best Ives centennial book, and as such is a true collector's item. (In stark contrast, unquestionably the *worst* book to come out of the Ives centennial year was David Wooldridge's \\"From the Steeples and Mountains,\\" a work I previously reviewed in some depth at its Amazon.com product page.)    While this book is edited by H. Wiley Hitchcock and Vivian Perlis, two Ives scholars who are still very much with us today, I think that they would forgive me for saying that the book-and the Festival-Conference as well-might never have happened had it not been for the two decades' worth of groundbreaking scholarly work that John Kirkpatrick did, beginning at Ives's death. It was during these two fertile decades of scholarly work that much of the \\"unknown Ives\\"-who had been not much more than a curious footnote to musical history at the time of his death-became the \\"known Ives.\\" And, in large measure, \\"by this book, ye shall know Ives.\\"    The proceedings (papers and panel discussions) are divided into five main sections. In addition, there are three appendices, one of which lists all of the concert performances, with fully-detailed programs, that were held in conjunction with the Festival-Conference. These performances are literally a \\"Who's Who\\" of Ivesians of that time: Kirkpatrick, William Masselos, Gregg Smith, the Orpheus Chamber Ensemble, James Sinclair, Jonathan Elkus, Robert Shaw, John Mauceri, Helen Boatwright and Phyllis Curtin, to mention just some of the artists. It is a shame that no recordings of those concerts appear to have survived.    The first section, \\"Ives and American Culture,\\" endeavors, in three presentations, to put Ives into a proper social context and cultural milieu. It is, in my estimation, the portion that has worn the least well over the years. Robert M. Crunden endeavors to include Ives among the great progressivists of the era, including Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and John Dewey, inter alia. Frank R. Rossiter-the first Ives scholar to submit Ives's life and works to psychological analysis-argues (largely) that Ives's self-imposed isolation, the narrowness of his cultural experiences, his emphasis on \\"masculinity\\" and his absolutist moral positions were largely the outgrowth of his upbringing, the early death of his father (whom he clearly  both idolized and idealized), and the failure of America and the world to conform to his ideals (particularly in the years following the end of WW I). Neely Bruce compares Ives to his earlier American predecessors, including the \\"Second New England School\\" that included Horatio Parker, his Yale mentor, but, to my way of thinking, with too much emphasis on Stephen Foster as an \\"Ivesian precursor/paradigm.\\" Much of this \\"1974 thinking\\" represents, in retrospect, examples of blind men endeavoring to explain the elephant. A far better and much more complete picture of the complexities of Ives emerges in Jan Swafford's \\"Charles Ives: A Life With Music.\\"    The real meat of these proceedings, and the reason why this book is especially worth tracking down, lies in the latter three sections. \\"On Editing Ives\\" (Section III) illuminates the challenges scholars have had to deal with, in coming to grips with a lifetime's worth of stored manuscripts exceeding 700 works, and the range of creative solutions they have devised for realizing many of these works. \\"On Conducting and Performing Ives\\" (Section IV) relates the conductorial experiences of Lehman Engel, John Mauceri, Gunther Schuller, Nicolas Slonimsky, Gregg Smith and others in dealing with the technical difficulties inherent in Ives's orchestral and choral compositions. Much closer to home, on a personal note, is a splendid symposium by Nancy and Alan Mandel in performing Ives's violin sonatas, vastly underappreciated works now more dear to me than ever with the recent gift of the scores for these from a friend.    The concluding section (\\"Ives and Present-Day Musical Thought\\") contains two of the best presentations of the Festival-Conference. \\"Spatial Form in Ives,\\" by Robert P. Morgan (who was to write, four years later, \\"Ives and Mahler: Mutual Responses at the End of an Era,\\" a seminal essay that ties together large areas of compositional-aesthetics common ground between these otherwise dramatically different composers), sets out in splendid detail the highly-specific dynamic and spatial indications that Ives wrote into many of his works, how such demands were unique (owing largely to Ives's commitment to \\"write for himself rather than for performance\\"), and how observance of these indications results in music that continues to sound so fresh a century later. And Allen Forte, a leading expert on atonality theory and its description in terms of \\"sets\\" (of notes), in \\"Ives and Atonality,\\" provides a rather exhaustive analysis of the atonality found in Ives's works, comparing aspects of atonality in Ives's compositions in depth to those of Schoenberg, Stravinsky and Berg that were written years later.    As noted earlier, Ives has been the elephant to more than a few blind men. It seems to me-perhaps as a consequence of totally immersing myself in the widest possible range of his music-that he is best appreciated and understood by embracing him in his Whitmanesque totality. This collector's item of a book goes a long way toward a fuller, richer understanding of his uniqueness.Highly-even urgently-recommended to every Ivesian.    Bob Zeidler	2004-05-27

Igor Stravinsky, late in life, and in an unusually rare moment of candor for him, conceded that Charles Ives had been \\"The Great Anticipator.\\" Unfortunately for Ives, this bout of candor came eight years after he died. And, upon Arnold Schoenberg's death In 1953 (six months before Ives did), his widow  came upon a remarkable statement by her husband, written nearly a decade earlier: [quote]     There is a great Man living in this Country - a composer.   He has solved the problem of how to preserve one's self-esteem.   He responds to negligence by contempt.   He is not forced to accept praise or blame.   His name is Ives. [unquote]    That these two composers, contemporaries of Ives, took so long to pay proper tribute is as much a result of Ives having chosen to be a \\"private\\" composer over the two important decades of his composing life (1902 - 1922) as it was their own agendas and efforts. Before 1922, nothing of significance that Ives had written saw public performance subsequent to his 1902 cantata, \\"The Celestial Country.\\" And nothing of significance came from his pen after those two decades; he spent the balance of his life editing his works and supporting the efforts of other American composers.    However, beginning in the 1930s, Ives's works slowly began to see public performance, and the pace of performance did pick up in the years remaining to him. And what concert-goers, and fellow composers, began to hear was a bewildering variety of musics, at least some of which reminded them of works not only by Schoenberg and Stravinsky but by Debussy, Bartk, Scriabin, Copland and a host of other \\"moderns.\\" And on his death in 1954, at which time Harmony Ives placed his works in public trust, with John Kirkpatrick as the executor, the floodgates began to open on what it was that Ives had accomplished, not least of which was to anticipate virtually every significant stylistic movement in 20th-century music.    With the 50th anniversary of Ives's death just days away(May 19, 2004) as I write this, we now have a much better picture of \\"Ives the anticipator.\\" And, as well, \\"Ives the protean American extender of the classical tradition.\\" And this book, edited by two of the most knowledgeable Ives scholars, is as fine an effort as I've seen at putting Ives in proper historical perspective. It is the benchmark for the comparative study of Ives's compositional aesthetic, and I don't expect that it will be soon surpassed in this respect.    The book is in two unequal parts (following an introduction by J. Peter Burkholder). The first third of the book, entitled \\"Predecessors,\\" describes Ives's early musical education, by both his father and Horatio Parker. The three essays in this section cover his background in, and familiarity with, the music of Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Franck, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky and Reger, as well as those who, like Parker, made up the preceding \\"New England School\\": George Chadwick, Frederick Shepherd Converse, Daniel Gregory Mason and John Knowles Paine. Sandwiched between the European and New England School essays is a superb one by Geoffrey Block (co-editor along with Burkholder) entitled \\"The 'Sounds That Beethoven Didn't Have',\\" showing how Ives both borrowed from and built upon Beethoven in writing his culminating keyboard masterpiece, the \\"Concord\\" Sonata. This essay cannot but help those who are befuddled by this thorny work.    The balance of the book is given over to comparisons of Ives with his European contemporaries. The first is a reprint of Robert P. Morgan's groundbreaking 1978 essay, \\"Ives and Mahler: Mutual Responses at the End of an Era.\\" While this essay is available on the internet in Adobe pdf form, its inclusion here is most welcome and appropriate. There is so much commonality in the compositional aesthetics of these two (incorporation of \\"vernacular\\" music, use of polyrhythms, providing for \\"near\\" and \\"far\\" sound fields) that it is surprising that matters took as long as they did to reachthis stage (although Elliott Carter, some years earlier, had pointed the way, seemingly the first to do so).    \\"Ives, Schoenberg, and the Musical Ideal\\" sets out not only the similarities between Ives's usage of the terms \\"manner and substance\\" and Schoenberg's of \\"style and idea\\" (and their commonality in philosophical thought traceable back to Kant), but also their shared admiration of Brahms. That Ives wrote atonally and experimented with tone rows in advance of Schoenberg is an interesting aside, but the \\"substance\\" (or \\"idea\\"), if you will, is that both developed new aesthetics of some similarity in expression and much commonality in background.    \\"Ives and Stravinsky: Two Angles on 'the German Stem'\\" is, for me, the most fascinating essay in the book. Ives wrote in bitonality some years before \\"Petroushka\\" and had been accused of \\"borrowing\\" ideas from \\"The Rite of Spring\\" well before the true facts emerged. But ultimately more interesting are the parallels between the two in terms of their musical educations and usage of source materials, and their inveterate editing of existing works. Of course, their motivations for doing so differed: While Ives was editing largely to achieve performance, Stravinsky was forever \\"scrubbing his works clean\\" of earlier influences.    When study began on Ives's manuscripts (now complete, thanks to James Sinclair's \\"A Descriptive Catalog of the Music of Charles Ives\\"), a treasure trove of \\"anticipations\\" - atonality, tone rows, bitonality, polyrhythms, collage, impressionism, minimalism, aleatorism and virtually every other \\"ism\\" - was found. While this book does not cover everything, the essays on Ives and Schoenberg and Ives and Stravinsky are worth the price of admission. But I do wish that the editors had included contributions on Ives and Debussy and Ives and Bartk (despite Burkholder's apology for not having done so in the Introduction). A very minor cavil for an otherwise remarkable collection of essays.    Bob Zeidler	2004-05-11

Mark Helprin once offered this advice to an aspiring writer on how best to construct a work, to grab the attention of the reader (and here I can only paraphrase, as I have misplaced the source document): \\"Treat your story as if a stone thrown into a still pool, coming to rest at the bottom. Then dive in after it.\\" The paraphrase is accurate enough for my purposes, and the message is clear: Know well the end of your journey before you begin it. <br />  <br /> Little did I know then, when I had meandered across Helprin's advice, that it would be central to my ability to write my thoughts on \\"A Soldier of the Great War.\\" For about the same length of time as that advice had been imprinted somewhere in my brain, I had also been faced with the daunting prospect of commenting on a thrice-read book, now bulging with scores of page markers as reminders to me of phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and even full pages, all worthy of comment. And, it seemed, the longer I put this task off, the more daunting it became.  <br />  <br /> Fortunately, this block was broken in the recent past, when I needed to give careful thought to a birthday gift for a friend. The gift couldn't appear to be too lavish, except in the riches of its contents. It needed to be something that would be new to this friend (and here I was at some risk), and at the same time something that would not soon - if ever - be forgotten. In the end, I decided to chance it with \\"A Soldier of the Great War,\\" enclosing a brief note regarding what was in store. And the working through of that note was the curative that I needed for providing my comments on this Helprin work. So I threw my own stone into the pool and dove in after it. <br />  <br /> \\"A Soldier of the Great War\\" flows over with great themes, the long arc of which is the relating of its protagonist's - Alessandro Giuliani's - life story, told in retrospect from Alessandro's memories of that life to a youth who accompanies him on a seemingly short journey fromRome to a near-distant village. And, following his own advice regarding the stone thrown in the pool, Helprin's lyrical, singing prose begins with the story's first paragraph, drawing the reader, too, to dive in, and doesn't let up until the very last page (where it then lingers for a very long while). <br />  <br /> The overarching themes are classic: love and war; of love discovered, then lost, then found once again; of the blunt impersonality and the lunacy of war. They - and others - are all juxtaposed with typical Helprinian brilliance. There are maniacally funny set-pieces, interwoven so seamlessly into the narrative that one is not aware at first of Helprin's skill with the set-piece device as one is drawn in. (These include an excursion to the plains of Eastern Hungary that is one of the most remarkable of such pieces ever written.) There are passages of heartrending grief quite beyond one's ability to deal with them. And the story teems with characters both bigger than life and smaller and meaner than dirt. <br />  <br /> But, at its core, \\"A Soldier of the Great War\\" is a story about love and beauty and the permutations one can make of those two words. And it is for this reason that I chose it. If you're like me, it will take you forever and a day to read it, as you find yourself re-reading - often several times, and on occasion out-loud just to hear what Helprin's words sound like - passage after passage after soaring passage. <br />  <br /> This book is, also, everything that has already been written about it. Like Helprin's other major works, it has autobiographical content of both experience and opinion interspersed throughout. (One need not be aware of this before the fact; it is inessential to the story.) The story is indeed a classic Bildungsroman - a \\"novel of formation\\" that traces Alessandro Giuliani's growth in spirit over his life - and one of the very best of its genre. There is a certain convenience that, at least alphabetically, Helprin fits comfortably between Heller and Hemingway. But use this convenience wisely, as when browsing under \\"Helprin\\" in a bookstore: This story is every bit the equal of \\"Catch 22\\" in its often manic depiction of the lunacy of war, but is far more lyrical; a love song where Heller's work clearly is not. And, if \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" captured the Great War from Hemingway's uniquely American perspective, Helprin, by opting for an Italian protagonist, finds a universality that eludes Hemingway, and with prose that a century hence will continue to sing, unlike Hemingway's, which already seems stilted by comparison. <br />  <br /> Finally, I am unsure as to whether I envy those who, like my friend, are experiencing this work for the first time (but I think that I do). Newcomers likely will be torn between lingering on each page and turning to the next, as the story races to its astonishing, yet in hindsight, perfectly-crafted and satisfying end: Helprin's stone indeed has landed in the deepest part of his pool. For re-readers like me, it matters not that one knows in advance how the story ends; there is a distinct pleasure to be derived from a lingering journey that is its own reward. <br />  <br /> So, at long last, and not without solemnity, I can carefully remove those scores of page markers, needing them no longer. And thus I begin my fourth traversal of this work, this time with a sixth sense that a guiding force will keep my friend and me on the same page. While there are factors which make it an uncertain thing that we will read these pages aloud, perhaps in my meanderings I will find evidence elsewhere that this gift, like Helprin's stone, has come to rest at the right place. <br /> <br />Bob Zeidler	2004-02-23

Two hundred years ago this week, Louis-Hector Berlioz was born. This, then, is a time for me to comment on a few of his works, some of them \\"favorites by acclamation\\" and others simply those in which I find special merit.    When Berlioz died, in April, 1869, an obituary in the Musical Times read, in part, \\"...there can be little doubt that he will be remembered by his able and acute contributions to musical criticism than by any of the compositions with which he hoped to revolutionize the world.\\"    These words by the Musical Times were addressed to Berlioz's feuilletons (musical criticisms in a largely satirical style). Berlioz captured many of his best feuilletons in his anthology Soires de l'Orchestre (\\"Evenings in the Orchestra\\"), and his trenchant wit is also evident in his Memoirs.    But Berlioz did leave behind one work for which musical education for generations of composers to come had been the purpose: his \\"Treatise on Instrumentation,\\" or, if one likes, \\"the art of writing for musical instruments of the orchestra to achieve maximum effect.\\" The Treatise was the very first serious effort to fully describe these matters of instrumentation and orchestration, instrument-by-instrument and orchestral-choir-by-orchestral-choir. Paraphrasing a portion of a recent Berlioz Bicentennial article by none less than Norman Lebrecht, the Treatise was closely studied by Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss (who themselves were masterly orchestrators), Modest Mussorgsky had died with a copy of the Treatise on his bed, and, as a result of wildly successful concerts led by Berlioz in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov was motivated to write his own equivalent, \\"Principles of Orchestration,\\" which would serve as a model for his Russian school of composers.    In point of fact, the revolutionary uses to which Berlioz put orchestral instruments in his compositions cannot be gainsayed, and his compositions, as well has the Treatise, served to redefine orchestralpossibilities - and serve as a learning tool for subsequent composers - for the remainder of the 19th century and well into the 20th century. He was an inveterate \\"tinkerer,\\" in terms of constantly assessing and writing for newly-invented instruments of his era, and, as well, he \\"borrowed\\" instruments freely from military bands of his time, to create orchestral \\"sound worlds\\" that were new and novel.    As the Treatise demonstrates, Berlioz was no mere dilletante, experimenting in willy-nilly ways, but was in fact thoroughly \\"grounded\\" in his understanding of such basic principles as acoustics and the creation of sound. In its original French form (virtually all of which, in translation, survives in this revised edition), the Treatise clearly set out all of these principles, applied to the instruments of his time by means of examples drawn from a wide range of musical compositions, and the French-language original seemed not to have been a problem for all the German, Russian, Italian, English and what-have-you composers who learned from it.    A half-century later, in 1904, Richard Strauss was requested to review and \\"revise and update\\" the Treatise by the publisher. It is in this form, with emendations by Strauss and translated ably into English, that the Treatise currently exists. Needless to say, familiarity with musical notation is important if one is to fully appreciate the value of the Treatise. But the narrative, including descriptions-in-words of musical examples of individual instruments and instruments used in various combinations, is clear enough that even those not knowledgeable in musical notation can bypass the notated examples and simply read the narrative with benefit. Berlioz was an exceedingly gifted writer, blessed with clarity in all that he wrote.    Strauss's emendations are rather clearly set out separately from Berlioz's original effort, so that the two do not get confused. By and large, Strauss doesn't trample too much on Berlioz's efforts,but deals with instruments not available to Berlioz, with many of his own examples drawn from the works of Richard Wagner. But Strauss's comparative measures of - and prejudices regarding - Berlioz and Wagner as composers are quite well established in his own separate Foreword.    The most recent instrument invention included in Strauss's emendations is the heckelphone (baritone oboe), which invention Strauss commissioned Wilhelm Heckel for Strauss's use in his \\"Symphonia Domestica.\\" Obviously, then, the Treatise is not the reference to which to turn for descriptions and applications of instruments that are of 20th century invention, nor, for that matter, instruments in use elsewhere than in Europe that subsequently found application in 20th century \\"Western\\" music (such as the Indonesian gamelan).    A side benefit of the Treatise is in its historical value as a repository of capabilities, sonorities, techniques and usages of instruments long deemed obsolete, but in current use during Berlioz's careers as composer and conductor. Where else can one find such a wealth of detail on instrumental esoterica and arcana like the ophicleide, bombardon and serpent (all forerunners of the tuba), as well as various instruments invented by the highly-creative Adophe Sax, inventor of the saxophone but also the various saxhorns, saxtrombas and saxtubas now obsolete? In fact, I could find only one oversight on Berlioz's part, that of the sarrusophone, invented by Auguste Sarrus, a contemporary \\"competitor\\" to Adophe Sax.    It's a small oversight. Unless, of course, one takes a personal interest in the sarrusophone and its musical possibilities. I happen to, but that's just me.    Anyone interested in the course of musical instrument usage and history should have this inexpensive Treatise in his or her library. If you can't read the musical notation and examples, you'll nonetheless come away with an excellent understanding of Berlioz's contributions to the field.    Bon anniversaire, M. Berlioz!

Two hundred years ago this week, Louis-Hector Berlioz was born. This, then, is a time for me to comment on a few of his works, some of them \\"favorites by acclamation\\" and others simply those in which I find special merit.<br /><br />When Berlioz died, in April, 1869, an obituary in the Musical Times read, in part, \\"...there can be little doubt that he will be remembered by his able and acute contributions to musical criticism than by any of the compositions with which he hoped to revolutionize the world.\\"<br /><br />Anyone familiar with Berlioz's \\"Memoirs\\" already knows that he could write with flair, and often with a trenchant sense of humor as well. And, while no one these days takes that Musical Times obituary notice seriously, in terms of evaluating his compositional vs. his critical contributions to music, it is true that Berlioz was a significant contributor to the art of musical criticism. He lived and wrote during a time when the feuilleton (an essay often bathed in scathing wit) was the main in-print vehicle for criticism in the arts, and he was one of its most able and knowledgeable practitioners, using the medium for rendering his critical judgements on the musical matters of the day. (As a side note, credit for the feuilleton is often - but mistakenly - given to Heinrich Heine, the German poet, who wrote many such essays when in Vienna. But Heine had earlier been a friend of Berlioz's while in Paris, and it seems clear - at least to this writer - that the feuilleton migrated from Paris to Vienna, with Heine as its means of transport.)<br /><br />\\"Soir&eacute;es de l'Orchestre\\" (the original French title of these works) can be variously translated as \\"Evenings with the Orchestra\\" or \\"Evenings in the Orchestra.\\" The latter seems more accurate and appropriate, notwithstanding the expertise of Jacques Barzun, one of a handful of true Berlioz experts working today: Berlioz - in the form of an alter ego for purposes of commenting on concert and opera performances - places himself IN the orchestra, as a participating musician in the evenings' events. He utilizes this \\"second party\\" vehicle, with some connective narrative, to tie together a number of his most famous feuilletons that \\"reached print\\" in the arts journals and newspapers of his day.<br /><br />Never one to mince words, Berlioz makes clear his personal preferences of composers he knew, and either admired or despised. Of the former (including, inter alia, Beethoven, Gluck, Mozart, Spontini and Weber), his feuilletons would invariably speak to the strengths of these composers. On the other hand, of the latter (including, inter alia, Bellini, Cherubini, Donizetti and Rossini), an evening in the orchestra while performing such works provided him the opportunity to take imaginative flights of fancy as a means for writing about anything BUT the music (which he personally abhorred).<br /><br />It is in these latter feuilletons that Berlioz hits his stride. And what an imaginative stride it is! Edgar Allen Poe and H. G. Wells (to name just two), had they been aware of Berlioz's writings, would well know that they had a worthy competitor in terms of his ability to write tales about the bizarre and the fantastic and, even, science fiction. But with a \\"gallows\\" humor that neither Poe nor Wells possessed. And this gallows humor, it turns out, is - at its best - screamingly hilarious. Two examples will have to suffice, lest I run over my allotted space.<br /><br />Consider the Eighteenth Evening, during which a German opera (likely one by Meyerbeer) for which the pit musicians have little interest, so that a series of tales is spun amongst them, concluding with \\"The Piano Possessed,\\" a sly and barely disguised dig at Felix Mendelssohn. The piano takes on a life - and even an afterlife - of its own while thirty-one pianists in a competition are required to play the Mendelssohn work, one after the other.<br /><br />Better yet, consider the Twenty-Fifth Evening, arguably Berlioz's crowning achievement in the genre and titled \\"Euphonia, or the Musical City.\\" This might well be called \\"Hector's Revenge,\\" as he uses the feuilleton to settle a few scores with Camille Moke, a lady - and musician - to whom he had once been engaged and who had betrayed that engagement with the able assistance of her mother. The three characters, so barely disguised that Berlioz might well have used their proper names, are interwoven in a tale of intrigue and betrayal that is beyond fantastic and bordering on the morbid. Berlioz's alter ego exacts his revenge on the two women in a most poetic, if equally grotesque, way. And you'll laugh your way right through to the final word.<br /><br />There is much about these Soir&eacute;es that is autobiographical, and those familiar with Berlioz's life and times will likely not have much difficulty finding the autobiographical needles in the various haystacks that make up these Evenings. At the same time, the genre of the feuilleton permits Berlioz the luxury of commenting on matters musical (and otherwise) in a wholly unique way and style. And he had no shortage of style.<br /><br />This is truly a \\"lost art\\"; no one seems to have been successful in duplicating Berlioz's ability to combine trenchant humor with critical commentary since his time. In modern times, only the name of Norman Lebrecht comes to mind, and he is far too buttoned down to challenge Berlioz in the genre. And more's the pity, now that we live in the time of Andrea Bocelli, Charlotte Church, Sarah Brightman, Russell Watson and - sakes alive! - Britney and JLo.

It is in fact the same book, photolithographed in the U.K. from the U.S. plates, with all claims (and errors) intact. The 1974 U.S. printing is of higher quality; it is recommended over this one for those who MUST have a copy of this book. A slighly-revised review of that 1974 U.S. edition appears below.    -----------------------------------------------------------     No, gentle reader; this is not Dickens. But it might be about giving someone the dickens for taking excessive liberties with an interesting subject. Nor is it about \\"...the best of times and the worst of times.\\" But it might be said that this book once had its \\"best of times,\\" and that its \\"Use By\\" date is long gone, making six-day-old cod a rather more appealing olfactory experience.    Consider two readers, separated by three decades.    Reader No. 1, an Ivesian flush with the excitement of the 1974 Ives centennial, looking for biographical material on Ives beyond the 1955 book by Henry and Sidney Cowell, acquires this book when released. He struggles with the unusual prose style, a nearly indecipherable mix of \\"original Wooldridge\\" narrative, quotations from Ives's \\"Memos\\" and other documents,  and parenthetical \\"asides\\" by Wooldridge that tease but do not satisfy. Nonetheless, he perseveres and comes away with an Ives \\"psychobiography\\" that to him seems \\"about right\\"; nothing of importance appears to have been overlooked, and if Wooldridge's insights into Ives come across as idiosyncratic, well, Ives WAS idiosyncratic.    In the process, Reader No. 1 doesn't pay heed to a Wooldridge account, on pp. 150-151, about Gustav Mahler performing Ives's 3rd Symphony in Munich in the summer of 1910, nor does he rise to a tantalizing follow-up tothis event, described on p. 206. He is, after all, interested in Ives, not Mahler.     Reader No. 2, a Mahlerite as well as an Ivesian with a different set of priorities, finally - nearly three decades after its publication - acquires this book. He knows it by reputation only, one based on references to it made by writers on Ives and Mahler. (These references are too numerous to elucidate, and, in any event, it is perhaps best that these writers NOT be named. A minority of them openly question the Wooldridge account; in fairness to those who did not, it's best not to mention even the doubters.)    He is well aware that Ives knew Mahler by virtue of attending Mahler-led performances by the New York Philharmonic-Society Orchestra. (Ives mentions Mahler not only in his 1931 \\"Memos\\" but in his much earlier \\"Essays Before a Sonata\\" as well.) Perhaps on factual grounds, or simply as an \\"article of faith,\\" he accepts that Mahler visited Ives's copyist, leaving the establishment with an inked copy of the full score to the Ives 3rd Symphony. He is not entirely satisfied with Ives's dating of this event as being in 1911; it would have had to have been in the early months of 1911 for this transaction to be possible. As for Mahler performing it in 1911, he knows this is impossible; Mahler's failing health - beginning in late February and ending with his death in May - ensured that it didn't happen in 1911. But did it perhaps happen in 1910, per Wooldridge?    Having his newly-acquired copy of Wooldridge, he turns to pp. 150-151 and reads about the \\"Munich account.\\" It is - let him not mince words - fantastical. Alarms go off, sending him back to the beginning of the book, to gain a better sense of context.    His struggle with Wooldridge's stylistic idiosyncrasies matches that of Reader No. 1. With the benefit of three additional decades of Ives scholarship, he recognizes that Wooldridge's \\"psychobiography\\" is premature, incomplete, and full of solecisms too numerous to detail; the book is \\"damaged goods.\\" Most remarkable of all is that there IS no context surrounding the \\"Munich account\\"; it is a total stylistic anomaly, seemingly dropped in gratuitously. And, while it answers no questions to anyone's satisfaction, it raises many, including:    * Did Walter Damrosch do a \\"reading\\" of Ives's 3rd Symphony, against indications to the contrary?    * If this reading led to Mahler's telephoning Harmony Ives, did she record it in \\"Our Book\\" (the diary that the Iveses kept)?    * Who was the American conductor who, in 1954, conducted the Ives 3rd in the Munich Deutsches Museum performance attended by Wooldridge?    * Has anyone done a handwriting analysis of a note, allegedly left by Mahler at the Deutsches Museum in 1910, referencing the copying of parts that might have been for the Ives 3rd?    * Does the Mahler note in fact even exist?    Yes, gentle reader, you have me correctly figured as Reader No. 2. And that I have some research yet to do.    In fairness to Wooldridge, he provides a helpful overview of Ives's songs and their background. For this, I give him one additional star above the bare minimum.    As for the rest, well, you were amply warned, weren't you?    Those wishing to know about the life of Ives are recommended to read Jan Swafford's \\"Charles Ives: A Life with Music\\" or Stuart Feder's \\"The Life of Charles Ives\\". The aesthetics of his compositional process are well set out in his own \\"Essays Before a Sonata\\" and in J. Peter Burkholder's \\"Charles Ives and His World.\\" Recollections by people who knew him are splendidly captured in Vivian Perlis's \\"Charles Ives Remembered.\\"    And, finally, if you have your heart set on reading about Mahler's Munich performance of the work, you owe it to yourself to read Carter Scholz's title story in his \\"The Amount to Carry.\\" It is hardly more fantastical than Wooldridge's account, and much better written besides.

US	50455427	RLKPW4X630G9Z	1401083889	109275934	Lost to the World	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Once lost; now found. Not yet in its rightful owner's hands	Guido Adler, famed Viennese musicologist (and, for that matter, the original developer of the science of musicology) and Gustav Mahler were friends for 30 years, beginning with their early-adult years at the Vienna Conservatory. (They might well have been friends for 45 years or more. Adler - 5 years Mahler's senior - spent his early years in the same Bohemian village, Iglau, that Mahler did, but then Adler's family relocated to Vienna.)    Adler celebrated his 50th birthday on November 1, 1905. As a very personal gift from one close friend to another, Mahler presented Adler with the autograph score to his famous song, \\"Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen\\" (\\"I am lost to the world\\"), part of his Rckert-Lieder song cycle. The score, Mahler's original manuscript, contained his inscription, \\"To my faithful friend Guido Adler (may he never become lost to me), on his fiftieth birthday.\\" While a personal gift, it had not been a secret. Some seventy-odd years later, Edward Reilly, in his book \\"Gustav Mahler and Guido Adler: Records of a Friendship,\\" mentioned the gift. But as recently as 1999, Henry-Louis de La Grange, Mahler's famous biographer, continued to note, in the English version of Volume III of his Mahler biography, that \\"The manuscript which was probably the draft orchestral score, has disappeared.\\"    The very next year, 2000, nearly 95 years after Adler's 50th birthday, the manuscript surfaced in the Vienna office of Sotheby's. The story of the score and its history, and as well the history of the Adler family and their efforts to save Guido Adler's voluminous musical library - not to mention their lives - from the Nazis beginning with the Anschluss of Austria by Germany on March 13, 1938 begins here, with the Sotheby's discovery. The story is told - in a flashback from Sotheby's in 2000 to the early history of the Adler family and from there back to the present day - by Tom Adler, the grandson of Guido Adler and his nearest surviving direct descendant.    This is a story that is gripping, full of duplicity, betrayals and treachery by those in Vienna and the German Third Reich before and during the war, and in a \\"liberated\\" Austria after the war, to whom members of the Adler family turned for help time and again, without success, often with frustration and always with delay and foot-dragging. In the case of Adler's paternal aunt (Guido Adler's daughter, Melanie), these actions and inactions were to have their fatal consequences; she eventually became a Holocaust victim.    Tom Adler tells his family's story in a straightforward chronological way that only heighten its chilling reality. There is an opening chapter setting out the friendship between Guido Adler and Mahler, as well as a relating of the esteem in which Adler had been held in Vienna music circles. The rest of the narrative is given over to the Adlers' efforts - successful in the case of Tom Adler, his parents and his sister - to escape from Austria after the Anschluss while preserving what they could of Guido Adler's property  from confiscation by the Nazis.    Guido Adler chose to remain behind. He died of natural causes (at age 86) three years later, in 1941. Melanie Adler also chose to remain behind, at least for the time being, thinking that she had the resources and the connections that would enable her to emigrate if necessary. A large part of the center of the story is about this enigmatic and rather naive woman and her attempts to salvage what she could of both her father's estate and her own safety. In the end, she lost both.    The story is populated with many villains and few heroes. The provenance of how it was that the Mahler score ended up at Sotheby's, given up for auction by a Viennese lawyer, himself the son of the duplicitous lawyer who had ostensibly been working in Melanie's interests but in reality lining his own pockets with Guido Adler's library treasure, is well-documented by Tom Adler.    Along the way, Adler paints a very graphic picture of the utter baseness of the Third Reich; while this is \\"old news,\\" it serves as yet another reminder of a time in history we should never be permitted to forget. More chilling, perhaps, is the post-war behavior of Austria in the whole affair. For people not familiar with this aspect of post-war denazification, rehabilitation and reparations, Austria considered itself \\"first victim\\" of the Anschluss and thus not responsible for reparations to Third Reich victims. Only over time, and with persistent international pressure, did Austria, in 1998, concede that its comportment during the post-war years was something far less than honorable, and take additional steps to redress crimes against its victims.    Lest one think that this was sufficient progress on the part of the Austrian government for Adler to be awarded the Mahler score that had been a gift from Mahler to his grandfather in 1905, the case he brought against the Viennese lawyer who \\"inherited\\" it from his father, who had stolen it from Adler's library safe, is still pending.    There needs to be an epilogue - a final chapter not yet written - to this story. Tom Adler is, without question in normal jurisprudence terms, the rightful heir to the Mahler score. As yet, he is not. But his book shines a very public light on a rather dark and not very pretty place - post-war Austrian jurisprudence as it relates to Holocaust victim compensation. The fact that nearly 60 years have passed since the end of the war, yet the Austrian government has not yet seen fit to relinquish this family treasure to its rightful owner, can only be characterized as shameful.    \\"Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen\\" always did have a very special resonance with me. Now, when I listen to it, I think of Tom Adler and his as-yet unfinished quest.    Bob Zeidler	2003-09-24
US	50455427	R3TT881WOK0KCP	0571146929	150246962	Mahler Remembered	Books	5	21	21	N	N	Not curmudgeonly. Not in the slightest.	Norman Lebrecht, for those unfamiliar with him, is an institution in the field of music commentary and criticism, and culture in general. He has his own BBC radio show (\\"Lebrecht Live\\") , as well as a weekly syndicated newspaper column (now in the London Evening Standard, formerly in the London Daily Telegraph), and is the author of a number of books besides this one. More often than not, Lebrecht can be a curmudgeon with the best of them (but always with the thought in mind of provoking one to think more deeply than usual), and seems to be one of the surviving few these days who can write in the style of the feuilleton (a humorous, often sarcastic, style of arts essay once common in Paris during Berlioz's time, and then brought to even higher heights in fin-de-sicle Vienna when Heinrich Heine \\"imported\\" the genre from Paris).    But there is nothing curmudgeonly about \\"Mahler Remembered,\\" Lebrecht's anthologizing of reminiscences by people who knew Gustav Mahler. Instead, this is a chronological capturing of these reminiscences - many of them appearing in print for the first time - to provide a portrait of Mahler hard to find elsewhere, at least not in any single volume such as this. (The closest book, in terms of recording of reminiscences, is likely \\"Mahler: His Life, Work and World\\" by Kurt and Herta Blaukopf. There is some overlap, but Lebrecht's quotations seem fuller, and several in Lebrecht do not appear in Blaukopf.)    Among the highlights are an extended essay by Alfred Roller (Mahler's stage director at the Vienna Court Opera), describing Mahler's physical attributes from an artist's perspective (and giving the lie to any thought that Mahler was less than a fine physical specimen), a humorous tribute by Leo Slezak (a fine Wagnerian tenor in Mahler's troupe) who was not always highly motivated but who, in retrospect, realized that Mahler brought out the best in him, and tributes by his many acolytes, most particularly Arnold Schoenberg, Otto Klemperer and Bruno Walter, as well as famous musicians still remembered today, including Sergei Rachmaninoff, Ferrucio Busoni and Fritz Kreisler. Of these, Busoni's is perhaps the most moving: It was at Mahler's very last concert, in New York, that he had premiered Busoni's \\"Berceuse lgaique,\\" and it was Busoni who traveled in the company of Mahler on his final journey home from New York to Vienna by way of Cherbourg.    But the book goes well beyond these few names, and these brief highlights. Lebrecht seems to have found something from everyone of significance whose life or career intersected Mahler's, and quite a few from people of no particular historical significance at all save that they knew him and wrote something that is now part of posterity. What emerges is as full a personal portrait of Mahler as one is likely to find without collating bits and pieces from multiple sources and volumes.    I could manage to find only two unfavorable reminiscences, both of them \\"expected\\" (and quite well-known) from my earlier readings of writings on Mahler. One is by Franz Schmidt, a near-contemporary composer who was also the principal cellist in Mahler's Vienna orchestra, and the other is by Henry Krehbiel, the very influential music critic of the New York Tribune during the years Mahler spent in America. In Schmidt's case, one can easily read past the professional jealousy that generated his rant; he was after all not nearly as well-known a composer, and was an instrumentalist who chafed under Mahler's directorship. A little bit of historical perspective (not provided by Lebrecht) serves as well to explain Krehbiel's antagonism toward Mahler (a composer whose works he wasn't able to fathom): By the time that Mahler had arrived in New York, in the fall of 1907, Richard Strauss - both \\"friend and rival\\" and self-promoter without equal - had already established himself as the paragon of Germanic composers of the day.    A final somewhat off-topic comment. I thought, perhaps, thatin Lebrecht's book I had found another small clue in the matter of what I've come to call \\"the Mahler-Ives connection\\" (the story, seemingly true, that Mahler had acquired a fair copy of the score to Ives's Third Symphony during his final year in New York, but didn't live long enough to perform it). Two persons who wrote reminiscences included by Lebrecht were Ossip Gabrilowitsch (a well-known pianist of the time), and his wife, Clara Clemens (daughter of Mark Twain and a concertizing singer). Twain was a close friend of Ives's father-in-law, Reverend Joseph Twichell, who married not only Charles and Harmony Twichell Ives but also Ossip and Clara Clemens Gabrilowitsch. But it seems that a possible Mahler-Ives connection by way of Gabrilowitsch and Clemens is pretty much a dead-end: Harmony, despite being president of the Mark Twain Society, didn't think highly of Clara Clemens. And Ives thought so little of Gabrilowitsch that it doesn't even bear mentioning in the context of Lebrecht's book.    If you are one who thinks of Mahler in terms of his being autocratic and domineering, too tough on his musicians, and someone who was \\"a curiosity in his time,\\" not to mention harboring thoughts of his being less than a first-rate composer, best that you stay away from this book; too many people who knew him felt differently, as Lebrecht's anthology makes clear. For everyone else, I consider Lebrecht's book a \\"must read.\\"    Bob Zeidler	2003-07-04
US	50455427	R8AW24LHHNES	1586481738	98096282	All The Stops: The Glorious Pipe Organ And Its American Masters	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Two remarkable sagas in one book. And then some.	Craig R. Whitney, a superb writer (his \\"day job\\" with the N.Y. Times has included assignments as correspondent, foreign editor and now assistant managing editor) and an enthusiastic pipe organ expert (and, one would expect, performer as well) has written what I believe to be the authoritative book on the history of organs and organists in America. And he's written it so well that it can't fail to interest both pipe organ aficianados and the general public as well.    There are two stories interwoven together here, set against the cultural milieu that gave rise to the popularity of pipe organs in America in the first third of the 20th century, then a slow decline in interest with the advent of alternative forms of entertainment (\\"talkies,\\" the phonograph, and radio and television), and, quite recently, a renewed interest in the design and installation of new instruments and the preservation and restoration of older ones.    The first story is that of the instrument itself, and of the people \\"who made it happen\\": the organ designers/builders who were central to the development of the pipe organ in America. Whitney singles out the three most influential 20th century practitioners - Edward M. Skinner, G. Donald Harrison and Charles B. Fisk - without ignoring the influences of either their domestic predecessors (George H. Ryder, E. & G.G. Hook) or their international competitors (Cavaill-Coll, Casavant Frres, Flentrop, Ruffati). The efforts by these three, affecting the sounds of pipe organs in all sorts of installations (places of worship [obviously], but also concert halls, museums, theaters, and even retail stores and private residences), can be summarized as the search for \\"eclectic\\" organs, i.e., organs of sufficient versatility that they are \\"at home\\" playing music written for the instrument from virtually any historical period (and certainly from the baroque period of Bach, through the French romantic period, and on to the current repertoire).    The organ partof the story leaves out nothing of importance, including changes in musical taste over time, and how that taste was affected by the instrument's practitioners and composers, as well as bankruptcies and mergers and acquisitions (the most famous of which was the joining of the E. M. Skinner Company with the Aeolian Company to form Aeolian-Skinner, perhaps the largest 20th century force in the industry). Whitney leaves us at a point in history - now - where eclectic organs utilizing both baroque-era tracker mechanisms and modern-day electropneumatic actions are largely the \\"norm\\" and where new instruments incorporating such hybrid features are finding their way back into the concert hall.    The second story is that of the two instrumentalists who, over a period exceeding three decades, defined organ performance for most of us and who most directly affected organ design and performance style: E. Power Biggs and Virgil Fox.    It is hard to imagine two people more different than Biggs and Fox, and their differences were only exaggerated wtih the passage of time, with Biggs becoming more and more the \\"purist\\" (with his interest in historical instruments and performance practices) and Fox becoming more and more the \\"showman\\" (to the point where he became a self-promotional caricature of himself).    Was one better than the other? Was one \\"right\\" and the other \\"wrong\\"? Whitney writes about Biggs and Fox in a non-judgemental way, using overlapping chapters to tell the story of each, leaving us to decide for ourselves how to assess their contributions. Personally, I think we'd be the poorer if the efforts of either man were lost. Without Biggs, we might not have heard Charles Ives's \\"Variations on America,\\" sent at his request for \\"something by Ives\\" by Mrs. Ives in 1948, with a note from her that Ives hadn't composed anything for the organ in over 40 years. And without Fox, we'd have never heard his organ transcription of Bach's \\"Komm Ssser Tod\\" (\\"Come, Sweet Death\\"), performed on the John Wanamaker organ in Philadelphia. Although Fox evenually went \\"over the top\\" in his \\"Fillmore East electric organ\\" phase, his very last recording, made not long before he died, on the then-new Ruffati organ at the Garden Grove Community Church, remains as testimony to his staggering technique.    Whitney writes with infectious enthusiasm for his subject. One hardly needs to be an unrepentent pipe organ nut, as I happen to be, in order to enjoy this book. I think that anyone with an interest in music - and especially music in America - will find the book to be a delight.    I'd be remiss if I failed to mention two small points that reached me directly (perhaps more directly than they would most readers). The first is that Whitney, because of his origins, is very familiar with pipe organs in my geographical area, particularly in Worcester, MA, where there are two fine instruments. One of them - an 1864 E. & G.G. Hook organ in Mechanics Hall - is of historic importance because it was the first \\"grand civic\\" organ in the country. I've admired its (now-restored) appearance for many years (as a concert-goer), but have yet to hear the instrument. Perhaps one of these days someone will perform a recital on it.    The second point is that it pleases me to see Joe Vitacco's name in the context of commenting on this book. Joe is an expert on the instrument in his own right, in both his expertise regarding pipe organs and his endeavors as a recording specialist of pipe organs. His JAV Records label is one of the few labels that specialize in organ recordings, and, several years back, he co-produced a 4-CD album - one of my all-time favorites - of historic NYC pipe organs, with the whimsical acronym \\"GOONY\\" (Great Organs Of New York), now sadly out-of-print and a true collectible. I should think that many pipe organ fans have and treasure this album. If you don't, it is well worth the search.    Bob Zeidler	2003-07-03
US	50455427	R2A7J1RFR7S2YW	0691092443	601086054	Mahler and His World (The Bard Music Festival)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Mahler reconsidered. With a fine sense of balance.	Published last year (2002) were two significant resources on Gustav Mahler. One of these - a paperback edition of Donald Mitchell's \\"The Mahler Companion\\" - has already been appraised by me, and found to be a superb \\"companion.\\" The other is this Festschrift volume, edited by Karen Painter, the \\"published\\" part of the 2002 Bard Music Festival celebrating Mahler.    The Mitchell and Painter books are similar in some respects, in that both contain essays by expert Mahlerians incorporating good historical/musicological research. But there are also differences, making the books complementary. Where the Mitchell book is broad, with chapters covering all of Mahler's works, the Painter book is more tightly focused, with fewer essays on a narrower range of topics. Part of the appeal of this Painter book is the inclusion of reprints of a vast array of historic criticism that provides an understanding of how Mahler was perceived and received during his lifetime.    Painter's book is worth having for Leon Botstein's lead-off essay (\\"Whose Gustav Mahler?\\") alone. A virtuosic work, it earns separate commentary later. But first, briefer comments about some of the book's other strong points.    The first section (CONTEXT AND IDEOLOGIES) contains two fascinating essays that are closely related: Charles S. Maier's \\"Mahler's Theater: The Performative and the Political in Central Europe, 1890-1910\\" and Karen Painter's \\"The Aesthetics of Mass Culture: Mahler's Eighth Symphony and Its Legacy.\\" The thrust of the Maier essay leads naturally into the Painter one.    Working backwards, there are two well-known facts regarding Mahler's Eighth Symphony. The first is that his Eighth Symphony doesn't fit into any convenient scheme for allocating his symphonies by style and content; the Eighth Symphony is a \\"sui generis\\" work, powerful in its effect but somewhat baffling in terms of its rightful place in his symphonic canon. The second is that the premiere of the work, in Munich in 1910, was a highly-promoted event, one of the most significant and certainly one of the best documented musical events of the 20th century.    Maier sets the cultural stage that made such a work not only possible but perhaps inevitable as well. It is a fact that music and drama became stages for the \\"politicization of culture\\" in the late Habsburg Empire of Mahler's time. This was an empire on the imminent verge of collapse; a manifestation of this imminency was that political parties of every stripe seized upon culture (including music) for their individualistic ends.    Mahler was, inevitably, swept up into this politico-cultural maelstrom, both as conductor and as composer. What he performed at the Vienna Court Opera, and when and why, helps to understand both his political leanings (mildly leftist-Socialist) and, at least in part, his possible motivations for composing hia Eighth Symphony: As a gift to the Austrian people so that they could participate, to his way of thinking, in this \\"political elevation\\" of \\"music as mass culture.\\" And participate they did: Not only was the Munich premiere a cultural phenomenon for its (or any) time, but the work, as political culture, was, for a period, co-opted by both the left and the right. Had Mahler not been Jewish, one can only shudder at how National Socialists might have co-opted the work for their own political ends, a fearsome thought left dangling in Painter's essay.    The final section (MAHLER'S GERMAN-LANGUAGE CRITICS) contains many gems translated into English for the first time. Covering his career as composer and conductor, from sources both friendly and hostile, we get a fuller glimpse of how Mahler was assessed in his own time. The reviews (and obituaries as well) come from all four points of the critical compass: favorable and informed, uncritically favorable and thus critically useless, hostile and critically off-target, and hostile but with an informed understanding. This is as evenly balanced as such an anthology could be.    The fourth category brings us full circle, to Botstein's bravura (but challenging) essay. He posits that hostile but informed commentary was the \\"jumping-off\\" point for Theodor Adorno's writings on Mahler. To borrow from Botstein, Mahler might best be understood through the lens of his most dedicated critics; \\"informed hostility can reveal more acutely than deferential praise the character and virtues of the music.\\"    Botstein's own jumping-off point is a search for an explanation for the enduring interest in Mahler's music. The initial upsurge in interest that began, largely, with Leonard Bernstein very publically championing Mahler, today, nearly a half-century later, shows no sign of slowing, and is in fact increasing, with no obvious end in sight. How, then, to explain the phenomenon?    A key Botstein point is that the 1960s brought us more than Bernstein and a renaissance of performances and and a flood of recordings; it also marked the emergence of Adorno's contributions to \\"Mahlerology\\" with the publication of his \\"Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy.\\" By using \\"negation\\" (his cramped \\"negative dialectics\\") to \\"invert\\" the arguments of Mahler's harshest critics, Adorno found not only \\"fault lines\\" in their analyses but totally fresh, if idiosyncratic, insights into characterizing Mahler's music.    A uniquely Adorno insight (in fact, a chapter in his book) was that Mahler was to composing what Flaubert was to writing, with \\"Madame Bovary\\" as an exemplary case. Botstein takes this further by suggesting that the novel as perfected by Flaubert served as a written vessel into which the reader could pour himself proactively, as if a protagonist, and that there are clear parallels to this proactivity when listening to Mahler's music.    This is a provocative thought: The listener as active participant. But in a way it was preordained when Mahler eschewed descriptive programs while writing music of some \\"vernacularity\\" and ambiguity about that vernacularity.This leaves open the door to our \\"individuating\\" our responses to Mahler's music (something which, as Botstein makes clear, is not possible for the programmatic music of Richard Strauss, an obvious counterexample).    A thoughtful and challenging essay, and a very worthwhile book.    Bob Zeidler	2003-06-15
US	50455427	R3QRNTSL27M0WH	0312269013	879785321	The Amount to Carry: Stories	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Kafkaesque? Absolutely! But also Ivesian.	First, let me thank J Scott Morrison, fellow Amazon.com reviewer, for bringing this collection of short stories by Carter Scholz to my attention. The title story, \\"The Amount to Carry,\\" resonates with me to a degree to which Scott is fully aware. And, since this title story is not only one to which I can personally relate, but also the best story in an anthology of excellent stories overall, I'll save a good portion of my commentary for an in-depth discussion of this story, for the end.    Scholz's stories are both genre-bending and mind-bending. The \\"credits\\" page states that a number of them had previously been published in various science fiction magazines and anthologies. Since these are publications that I don't routinely read, Scholz arrives at my reading desk as a brand new (to me) author. And he is a fascinating writer; make no mistake about it.    One is hard-pressed to describe the type of writer that Scholz is, other than, perhaps, post-modernist experimental. No one story in this book could ever serve to pin him down; they cover too much ground for that to happen. Suffice it to say that Scholz has an imagination that runs wild. Further, it should be said that he is a tremendously gifted writer, even in those stories that do not resonate strongly with the reader.    If there is an overarching theme to his writings here - and I have my doubts about this - it is his use of irony, combined with his ability to play games with the nuances of time and the physics of the real world, in the sense of what these attributes mean in reality. (The results are often more surreal than real, needless to say.) But each story is so different from the others, and each is such a unique standalone setpiece, that it is an ill-begotten attempt on my part to categorize the uncategorizable through oversimplification.    Some stories remind one of what was so great about Rod Serling's \\"Twilight Zone\\" series of tales. \\"Altomira,\\" for example, places the current-day narrator, one Bernard Vogel, an art historian struggling to make his academic bones, in the time frame and world of Jan van Eyck. Vogel's labors to understand the identities and placement of two background subjects in one of Eyck's most famous paintings has a nice, but unpredictable, twist of an ending. Similarly, \\"Mengele's Jew\\" is a rather manic take-off on the famous \\"Schroedinger's cat\\" paradox. (This is the famous \\"gedanken\\" [\\"thought\\"] experiment of Erwin Schroedinger regarding whether a cat, placed inside a box with a radioactive pellet which, when it decays, will kill the cat, is at any given moment \\"dead or alive\\" in the absence of observing the cat's state directly. The paradox lies in the meaning of the terms \\"observation\\" and \\"measurement\\" as they relate to quantum physics.) Suffice it to say that Mengele, in this revisionist approach to history, is treated rather poetically in the final analysis. Those readers having some quantum physics knowledge are sure to have their own wavefunctions collapse in roars of laughter at the twist Scholz gives this \\"paradox.\\"    The stories not particularly amenable to the \\"Twilight Zone\\" setting can be equally mind-stretching. In \\"Travels,\\" we meet up with the spirit of Marco Polo, as the spirit's thoughts travel outward in the galaxy, carrying on a conversation with a sentient computer lodged on a small planet in orbit about a dead star. The computer's gain is Polo's loss all the while the colloquy carries on. In \\"The Nine Billion Names of God,\\" Scholz places himself at the crossroads of science fiction history, having a dialog with his editor over whether or not his retelling of the famous Asimov story is \\"original\\" work.    Scholz has chosen to save the best until last, as have I: the title story, \\"The Amount to Carry.\\" This is as fine a flight of fancy as I think I've ever read, and the extent to which it resonated with me is incalculable. I can only consider Scholz as a \\"kindred spirit\\" in the matter of Charles Ives for having both the imagination and the knowledge of biographical detail that makes the story \\"work\\" for me the way it does.    The story finds Ives, Franz Kafka and Wallace Stevens in Berlin in 1921, for a convention of insurance executives. It is a matter of fact that all three - composer, writer and poet - \\"put food on the table\\" by working in the insurance industry. (In point of fact, Ives became very wealthy in his day job as insurance executive, and his pamphlet \\"The Amount to Carry\\" was the origin of what we call \\"estate planning,\\" using whole life insurance as the means for building annuities.)    But this insurance convention is merely a plot device for Scholz to take an ultimate flight of fancy into the realm of sheer conjecture regarding Ives's fortunes as a composer during his active composing life. Kafka is there for the purpose of bringing to Ives's attention the Munich performance, ten years earlier, of Ives's Third Symphony, conducted by Gustav Mahler. (Stevens's role in the story is less essential, but nonetheless wry in its own way.)    Only someone deeply interested in the full story of this particular \\"twist of fate\\" would have the audacity to fold it into a story. And only one with an intimate knowledge of all the facts - about both Ives and the Mahler connection, and about Ives's personal life - could fold into the story such a wealth (and warmth) of detail that Scholz has. (There are only one or two very minor solecisms. Given Scholz's research, even this small number comes as a mild surprise.) The story succeeds on every level, and leaves me with the thought that Scholz and I somehow inhabit parallel universes. Or perhaps the same universe, save for the fact that we have yet to meet.

I have my days when I feel as if I've known Charlie Ives all my life. Of course, this is physically impossible: when Charlie died, in 1954, I was only fifteen, and I didn't hear any of his music at least until a few years later, in college. And even then, there wasn't all that much of it available on LP. But, over a period now approaching a half-century, my knowledge of, and admiration for, the man and his music grew steadily, if at first slowly.    With this steady accumulation of knowledge now at the point where I feel at ease (\\"comfortable in my skin,\\" one might say) with providing some informed commentary, I suggest to readers interested in learning about Charlie, and his life and music, two recommendations. The first recommendation is that they read Jan Swafford's \\"Charles Ives: A Life with Music,\\" one of the most superb books of its kind, totally sympathetic to the man but at the same time not close-minded to his \\"warts\\" and their possible causes.    The second is of course this book by Vivian Perlis, one of the most remarkable of its kind. It is one of the most frequently quoted resources by Ives scholars and writers, and obviously so.    The reason for its very existence is almost as fascinating as its contents. Perlis, in 1968, had been working with the Ives Collection, and, to quote her (in the Preface), \\"I became aware that there were [...] people still living who had known and worked with [Ives], and that an effort [...] be made to [...] preserve their memories of him.\\"    Ives died in 1954, in his eighthieth year. At the time of the start of Perlis's project, then, those of his contemporaries still alive who knew him were already well in their nineties. Mrs. Ives (Harmony Twichel Ives) was still alive, but too ill to be interviewed. (She died on Good Friday, April 4, 1969.) Ives's business partner, Julian Myrick, was able to be interviewed, but he passed on in the course of the project. Charlie's piano tuner died on the day he was to be scheduled to beintereviewed. There were only three Yale classmates who survived long enough to be interviewd. Facts such as these explain the need on Perlis's part to \\"work against time\\" in her plan to capture as many direct recollections as possible in putting together this oral history.    Perlis's subjects included, of course, family members, as well as friends and neighbors, most of them from succeeding generations. (Charlie's brother, Moss Ives, had six children [five nephews of Charlie and Harmony, and one niece]; three of the nephews provide some of the best recollections. Sadly, Charlie's niece, Sarane [Sally], as well as his own daughter, Edith [Edie], died in 1956, only two years after him.) Perlis even interviewed Charlie's personal secretary, his barber, and the architect who was responsible for remodeling his West Redding, CT home. Each provides his or her glimpse of the man. That these glimpses are often reminiscent of blind men describing an elephant speaks to the complexities of an outwardly simple-appearing man.    A large portion of the book covers recollections of musicians who knew and worked with Charlie. While all were of the succeeding younger generation, they can lay claim to being the closest to Charles Ives the composer and musician. The list reads like a \\"Who's Who\\" of mid-20th century American music: Elliott Carter, Aaron Copland, Lehman Engel, Lou Harrison, Bernard Herrmann, John Kirkpatrick, Goddard Lieberson, Carl Ruggles and Nicolas Slonimsky among others.    Each of these musical friends achieved fame for his own contributions to the art. Each remembered Charlie in the greatest of detail and anecdote, often in terms that bordered on \\"reverential\\" and with individual insights which added substantially to a better understanding of his musical psyche.    With one exception: Elliott Carter. Carter, still alive and kicking (and composing) at age 94, was one of the very earliest beneficiaries of Charlie's intellectual and personal largesse. As a teen-agehigh schooler, he was often invited to Charlie's W. 74th Street townhouse, a comfortably short distance from Carnegie Hall, where they would take in concerts and then talk about what they heard. Given that these were Carter's \\"formative years,\\" one might think (and some do) that Carter was the logical successor to Charlie. In my judgement, he wasn't; there are simply too many differences between the two, in terms of compositional aesthetic, for the relationship to be valid. And, of all the musical associates interviewed, only Carter, in what I feel to be mean-spirited commentary, was negative about Charlie's contributions to American music. (It is more than a little interesting that Perlis, in her Preface, found it necessary to state that of all the interviews, only Carter's, as published, differed substantially from the raw interview material. One can only wonder at just what was expurgated!)    I am indebted to J Scott Morrison, fellow music lover and Amazon.com reviewer, for bringing to my attention that, in addition to Elliott Carter, there is one other survivor to this day who can claim direct contact with Charlie. That other person is Paul Moor, who interviewed Charlie for the September 1948 edition of Harper's. Moor (now in his late 70s) was in Europe between about 1953 and 1979, and therefore \\"out of reach\\" (and likely off the radar screen) of Perlis. It is too bad that this understandable omission is nonetheless an omisson. Perhaps Moor's judgement would offset Carter's; perhaps not.    In searching for a comparable book about another composer, the closest I can come to Perlis's unquestioned masterpiece is Elizabeth Wilson's \\"Shostakovich: A Life Remembered.\\" But, whereas reading first-hand accounts about Shostakovich's life can often be an exercise in pain, given the circumstances of that life, reading about Charlie's life only seems to bring me joy. I hope it does for you as well.    Bob Zeidler	2003-05-09
US	50455427	RAK2BI8M48M6Y	069101163X	971337479	Charles Ives and His World	Books	5	13	13	N	N	"[...] only an inventor knows how to borrow."	Beginning in 1990, Bard College (Annandale-on-Hudson, NY) has held an annual music festival celebrating the music and related cultural/aesthetic background of composers, with the festival \\"proceedings\\" published as a Festschrift volume. The consideration for a composer being celebrated would seem to be that the composer's works represent a measurable break with \\"the past,\\" in terms of musical aesthetic. Only one of these composers has been American. It is fitting that this American should be Charles Ives. This volume is from the 1996 festival for the music and life of Ives. It nicely summarizes why it is that Ives was important to the development of a uniquely American musical aesthetic, and how that aesthetic was closely tied with the man's life in other respects.    The volume is in four unequal parts: Part I, ESSAYS (five in-depth pieces covering key aspects of Ives the composer, philospher and businessman and ethicist, filling nearly half the book), and briefer Parts II, III and IV, providing, respectively, LETTERS (to and from Ives), REVIEWS (of music and performances), and PROFILES (of Ives during his lifetime).    The essays cover distinct aspects but have some overarching themes:    [1.] Consistently (and persistently), Ives composed in four styles: American popular music, Protestant church music, \\"art\\" music in the European classical sense, and experimental music, frequently combining two or more of these styles in a work. Ives did not \\"progress\\" from the simple to the complex (as had earlier been put forth, before musicologists and critics could achieve perspective on his output), but always had each of these in his \\"composers' toolbox\\"; even at the end of his composing career, he remained grounded in European \\"art\\" music, and continued to call upon the vernacular music of his childhood while at the same time his music grew in depth and profundity of expression.    [2.] Ives's use of vernacular music, as nostalgia and as \\"writing music about music,\\" and his creating a naturalistic sound stage by adding aural perspective to his scoring, were unique for their time, although they found application in the contemporaneous works of Gustav Mahler, quite by accident.    [3.] We cannot separate the composer from the philospher and/or the businessman without risk of arriving at an incomplete picture and failing to understand the music that is the principal surviving entity of his life's work. The fullest, most accurate picture emerges only when it becomes clear by what route his philosophical leanings reached their fullest flower, affecting both his musical and business lives, and how the fullest flower didn't really arrive until he redirected his business efforts and ethics, and married, with his wife providing the \\"quiet space\\" and the gentle encouragement for this fulfillment.    [4.] Ives developed a new musical aesthetic that was revolutionary in its break from the past, as represented by the example of Beethoven. It was his connection with the philosophy of Emerson, and resonances with Emerson's writings, that led him to this aesthetic, which reached its zenith in his monumental Concord Sonata.    Another theme, not an essay but clear from a complete read of the book, is that Ives - because he was a \\"private, spare-time\\" composer - was significantly ahead of his time and not really \\"discovered\\" and understood until years after his composing ceased. Most of his works were substantially completed prior to 1915, but performances and recognition were to wait another fifteen years or more, until the rest of the music world caught up to him, and early assessments of his works were badly flawed.    There is no better example of the initial misunderstanding of Ives's music and the time lag \\"until appreciation\\" than his Concord Sonata for solo piano, now properly considered one of the greatest 20th century keyboard works and the topic of both a major essay and a large portion of the critical reviews in this bood. A few paragraphsabout the breadth and depth of commentary on this work can serve to represent the overall quality of the book.    Completed in 1915, the Concord didn't receive its premiere until a quarter-century later, in a landmark 1939 Town Hall/NY performance. In the meantime (in 1920), Ives self-published the sonata, as well as a companion volume, \\"Essays Before a Sonata,\\" rationalizing his aesthetic for the work.    David Michael Hertz's essay (\\"Ives's Concord Sonata and the Texture of Music\\") makes clear that this was a revolutionary - and difficult - work because of the new ground it broke. Despite \\"borrowing\\" identifiable themes from Beethoven and vernacular music, and stylistic devices from Liszt, Chopin, Scriabin and Debussy (leading to my review title), the Concord represented a departure from the past not because it used and subsumed these materials but because of how the materials are organized and developed from the fragmentary to the complete (an aesthetic that Hertz calls \\"cumulative form\\"): it is only at the end of each movement of the work that a full statement of the thematic materials emerges, a reversal of the ordinary course of events in composing.    The reviews covering the period from Ives's publication of the Concord up to the work's premiere, performed by John Kirkpatrick, are almost universally dismissive; the score was incomprehensible to critics and fellow composers). It was only with Kirkpatrick's successful premiere of the Concord (an effort that took twelve years of study on his part) that composers and critics began to accept this work for the masterpiece that it is.    The rest of the volume is \\"of a piece\\" with this Concord Sonata example. This is a splendid critical overview of Ives, a fresh view, if you like, of \\"Ives reconsidered, after the dust has settled.\\"    Those interested in a more \\"linear\\" biographical account of the life and works of Ives are recommended to read Jan Swafford's splendid \\"Charles Ives: A Life with Music\\" (also 1996).Bob Zeidler	2003-04-30

I might well have called this \\"While I Slept\\" (with apologies to Art Buchwald). For, despite the facts that [a] Nicolas Slonimsky lived for more than 101 years (from 27 April 1894 to 25 December 1995), [b] because of this longevity, my life overlapped his by some 55 years, and [c] Slonimsky played a major role in a good part of the music I love (that of Charles Ives), he is a quite \\"new\\" discovery for me.    Born a Jew in St. Petersburg but baptized in the Orthodox church, Slonimsky was just one of many overachievers in his family. (As one example, his maternal aunt, Isabelle Vengerova, who - like him - was to emigrate to the United States, taught piano not only to Slonimsky but to Dmitri Tiomkin, the famous Hollywood composer, while both were still in Russia, and then to the likes of Samuel Barber, Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland, Lukas Foss and Gary Graffman, when she lived in New York and served for many years on the faculty of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.)    The 1917 Revolution led to Slonimsky's 1918 emigration from the Soviet Union, but not before he became known to a number of St. Petersburg composers and musicians of fame, not the least of whom was Alexander Glazunov, the director of the music conservatory there. His migratoy path while wending his way eventually to the U.S. is a story all in itself, with \\"pit stops\\" in Kiev, Karkhov, Yalta, Constantinople, Sofia, and, eventually, Paris, where he met Koussevitsky, Stravinsky and Prokofiev, assisting all three of them in various (and humorous) ways.    Arriving first in the U.S. at Rochester (NY), where he had been invited to coach the newly-instituted American Opera Company at the Eastman School of Music, Slonimsky had his initial conducting experiences (not a total success, but one which nonetheless demonstrated that he had a unique ability to \\"decouple\\" his two arms, permitting him to conduct in two different meters at the same time [something that would stand him in good stead when he later conducted the music of Ives]). From there, he went to Boston, as Koussevitsky's assistant (also not without its humor). It was in Boston that he met his wife-to-be, Dorothy Adlow (another Russian Jewish immigrant who became famous in her own right as the only Jewish editor on the staff of the Christian Science Monitor), and formed his own small chamber orchestra - made up largely of musicians from the Boston Symphony - for the performance of \\"new, modern\\" music. It was here, in 1928, that he first met Henry Cowell, which was to factor importantly in his early championing of Charles Ives and his music.    Skipping (temporarily) the Ives - Slonimsky connection, in 1933 Slonimsky was invited to be the conductor of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, an assignment that ended in disaster when he programmed too much modern music for the tastes of the audience, not the least of which was Edgar Varse's \\"Ionisation.\\"    Later in life - in fact, largely for the balance of what was to turn out to be an exceedingly long and rich life - Slonimsky turned his attention and activities toward writing on musical matters, mostly as a musical biographer and lexicographer for various music encyclopedias such as Theodore Baker's \\"Biographical Dictionary of Musicians.\\" His bulldog determination for \\"accuracy at whatever cost\\" knew no bounds, even going so far as to check historical newspaper accounts of the weather on the date of Mozart's funeral, to put the lie to claims that friends did not attend Mozart's funeral because of snow: the snow, not the funeral, was in fact canceled.    Among Slonimsky's other writings were treatises on music theory, including some rather abstruse writings on the theory of harmony that represented true inventions on his part. In one of the strangest juxtapositions - and truly one of the most hilarious chapters of the book - Slonimsky crossed paths, in 1981, with none other than Frank Zappa, who took a personal interest in Slonimsky's theories and actually applied portions of them to his compositions.    But it was the Ives connection which brought my attention to Slonimsky in the first place, on account of the anecdotes that Jan Swafford, in his \\"Charles Ives: A Life With Music,\\" related regarding Slonimsky's early championing of Ives's music, decades before others (incuding Bernstein) did. In what for me is the \\"gravitational center\\" of the book, a chapter entitled \\"Three Places in New England,\\" Slonimsky, with the greatest of warmth and a wealth of detail, describes his initial meeting of Ives (through the auspices of Cowell) and his concertizing in both the U.S. and Europe, including Ives works on the programs. Certainly a highlight largely lost to history was Slonimsky conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, on 5 March 1932, in a program of works by Ives, Ruggles and Varse, to both critical and popular acclaim, as well as enthusiastic acceptance by the Berlin orchestra musicians for whom this music would have been impossibly difficult had it not been for Slonimsky's conducting expertise. Ives and Slonimsky were to remain lifelong friends, and Ives, despite his infirmaties later in life, and often with the greatest of physical difficulties, would correspond with Slonimsky. One can only wish that some recording or another of a Slonimsky performance of an Ives work would have survived, but apparently - and regrettably - this is an idle wish.    There is a sequel - of sorts - to this autobiography, called (with Slonimksy's tongue placed firmly in his cheek) \\"The First Hundred Years.\\" Not an update that adds another five years to \\"Perfect Pitch,\\" this one is a compendium of excerpts of some of his best writings (including excerpts from \\"Perfect Pitch\\"). There is no better way to gauge the length, breadth and depth of Slonimsky's interests and expertise on matters musical than this \\"sequel.\\" But do read \\"Perfect Pitch\\" first.

I thought for a long time regarding how best to describe this book in one sentence. In this, I felt as if I had been put in the predicament experienced by a New York Times book reviewer who, two decades ago, in describing a favorite work of literature, wrote \\"...I find myself nervous, to a degree I don't recall in my past as a reviewer, about failing the work, inadequately describing its brilliance.\\" And, with apologies to another author whose title words I paraphrase above, this is how I choose to describe this powerful new novel.      The overarching theme of the story is race, and what it is like to be black in America (even if that \\"blackness\\" is barely apparent and issues of class and culture are largely absent). It is the story of three siblings - two brothers of nearly the same age and a younger sister - flung apart repeatedly by the centripetal force of race and its effect on family and career in the latter half of the 20th century, only to be brought back together time and again by the pressure of events, both familial and racial. Powers uses the subthemes of classical music and contemporary physics to compelling effect in weaving together both the narrative of the siblings (and their family) and the greater story of \\"being black in America.\\" In the process, he cuts across time, flashing backwards and forwards in the narrative while telling both the story of the siblings and the history of race relations from their parents' generation to the near-present. The latter is dealt with in a series of brilliant set pieces covering every race-relations event of significance over this period, from Marian Anderson's Lincoln Memorial concert of 1939, in defiance of the D.A.R., to the Million Man March more than half-century later; in the process, the story's protagonists appear, \\"Zelig-like,\\" at the periphery of these events.      Told more \\"linearly\\" than Powers's style of cutting back and forth in time, the story is about an interracial couple (he, a German Jewish emigre physicist recently escaped from Nazi Germany, she, a talented black singer without opportunity for a professional career due to color) who choose to rear these siblings \\"colorless\\" and home-schooled in their formative years (including intensive attention to music and singing). The choice - largely that of the father - can be read as a well-intentioned but ultimately failing effort to increase racial \\"entropy,\\" a term from physics that Powers doesn't use explicitely but nonetheless seems to suggest.      The subtheme of music propels the narrative forward. Jonah - the older son - is destined for great things as a singer; he has a voice of such beauty and purity that one like it comes along, at best, once per generation. Joseph - the younger son (by a year), and the story's narrator - is not the talent that Jonah is, but he is the main support backbone - an \\"enabler\\" - for Jonah, as well as his accompanist, over much of the tale. Ruth - the sister, younger by a few years - might well have been the greatest of the three in terms of talent, but an early tragic event takes her in an entirely different direction.      Powers uses the physics subtheme to entirely different effect. The nature of time (in the context of the role it plays in Einstein's Theory of Relativity) is brought to into question on the discontinuities in the narrative and the near-repetition of specific events, as if time has the ability to fold back on itself, even repeat itself from an \\"event standpoint.\\" In one of the better set pieces in the book, Powers places the father and the two boys in The Cloisters (at the northern tip of Manhattan) when they are quite young. This is their first experience at hearing medieval music, and the experience will eventually fold back on itself - decades later - in a way that I found astonishing yet logical.      It needs to be said, too, that that this is not just the story of Jonah, Joseph and Ruth. Or simply the story of \\"being black in America.\\" As Powers's story unfolds, we see that events have a way of taking their toll on the extended family at whose core are these siblings. Late in the book, there is a passage regarding the maternal grandparents, the male figure of whom had long been estranged from his grandsons due to a severe falling out between himself and their father. When notice of the grandfather's death is passed on to Joseph from his uncle, we find that this estrangement had taken its toll on the grandparents' relationship as well; only at death is a tragic secret revealed.      In a supreme irony, the folding back of time, at the end, finds the gansta rap son of Ruth, grandson of the physicist whose \\"experiment in racial entropy\\" gives the story its initial impetus, repeating the path that his grandfather had a half-century before. He listens to Louis Farrakhan, and concludes - with a wisdom far beyond his years, and totally contrary to his demeanor - that Farrakhan's message is all wrong: The arrow of time really flows in only one direction, and that direction is measured by the increase in entropy.      Powers - a polymath for sure - throws an awful lot at the reader, leaving it up to him to sort it all out. But at its best - and the \\"best\\" is there page after page - Powers's prose simply leaps off the page. Nowhere is this better than when he describes music and the effect that a perfect voice can have on the human heart and sensibilities. He writes so beautifully about music and the power of the human voice that the pages themselves literally sing.      This is not a book that can be adequately summarized in so few words. It is a great and IMPORTANT book.    Bob Zeidler	2003-03-12

Thirty years ago - in an earlier life, to be sure - I played a small role in helping see this book find its way into print, when, at the request of the author (a personal friend and professional colleague), I had the pleasure of discussing with him its approach and contents, and proof-reading various drafts and galleys. (I well remember, in those times long before personal computers and word processing software, the personal pride Sol Wieder took in having \\"key modifiers\\" for his electric typewriter that enabled him to provide clean drafts without having to handwrite all the symbology. My, how times have changed!)    Written for an advanced undergraduate course in Quantum Mechanics, this text was unique in its time for its early introduction and use of \\"canonical\\" formalism as represented by the Dirac approach, following classical-mechanics Hamiltonian formalism, rather than the more standard wave mechanics approach. A useful prerequisite course for understanding of the approach would have been a mechanics course based on a text such as Herbert Goldstein's \\"Classical Mechanics\\"; in all other respects, \\"The Foundations of Quantum Theory\\" is self-contained.    Divided into three parts (One-Particle Systems, Many-Particle Systems, and Relativistic Quantum Mechanics and Field Theory), the text is adventurous for an undergraduate course (obviously of full-year duration). Each part begins with its classical analogue, then leading directly into the equivalent quantum mechanical formalism. (The third part differes slightly, in that relativiistic quantum mechanics, and the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, are treated first, followed by an introductory section on the classical theory of fields before encountering quantized fields.) Especially valuable - and somewhat unique - are the in-depth coverage of scattering theory and the emphasis throughout on perturbation theory and methods as a means for understanding and solving \\"real world\\" problems.    The end-of-chapter problems are well thought out and sufficiently challenging. The enterprising student who undertakes completion of all of the problems will be assured of having achieved a full understanding of the subject matter.    It is a very personal pleasure to be able to write these few words, so many years after the fact, regarding a rather small role I played in the genesis of this excellent textbook.

US	50455427	RKAQASOTGNH4R	0156343207	354157030	Galina: A Russian Story	Books	5	38	41	N	N	"Everything was backwards..."	\\"...We were actors in real life and human beings on the stage.\\"    Thus spake Galina Vishnevskaya, in interviews she and her husband, Mstislav (\\"Slava\\") Rostropovich, gave in Paris in 1983, captured in a companion book (\\"Russia, Music, and Liberty: Conversations with Claude Samuel.\\") to this one. The quotation barely begins to suggest the Kafkaesque world in which they lived, when they were musical artists of the highest order in the Soviet Union.    Vishnevskaya was a \\"prima donna assoluta\\" at the Bolshoi Opera during her prime, arguably the finest Russian soprano of all time. And, as her prime overlapped those of Maria Callas and Renata Tebaldi, one can only wonder what her international reputation might have been had her career been entirely in the west; the first two-thirds (and best) part of it was largely away from the gaze of the international music community.    This is, as she subtitles it, her \\"Russian story\\" covering her life up to the final hours in 1976 when she left the Soviet Union, eventually (two years later) as an exile. And it almost ended before it ever started.    Born in poverty to parents who abandoned her to her grandmother, she possessed an incredible voice as a child. Largely self-taught, and then - at age sixteen - improperly taught - she didn't learn proper voice technique until after she had established a beginning career in operetta. Then she contracted TB, and the doctor caring for her offered that the only cure - which she refused - was to collapse the infected lung. It was only by mortgaging her future singing fees for black-market purchase of scarce antibiotics that she recovered.    In 1952, in her mid-twenties, she auditioned for the youth group of the Bolshoi Opera Theater, was instantly accepted, underwent a meteoric rise through the Bolshoi ranks on her voice and talent, and soon became the prima diva of the troupe. In 1955, she met Rostropovich, whose courting of her is one of the few lighthearted sections of an otherwise chilling tale of intrigue, deception and lies in the intelligentsia circles in which the pair of them existed and performed.    The next two decades (1955 - 1975) of this journal focus largely on one person, and the special relationship that they had with him: Dmitri Shostakovich. As artists, it was only natural that their paths would cross and thereafter, for the rest of Shostakovich's life, intertwine. But this was more than acquaintanceship; it was friendship based on trust during Shostakovich's years when it was virtually impossible for him to trust anyone. And Vishnevskaya defended that trust with the ferocity of a tiger. One anecdote of her ferocity will suffice as an example.    In the early 1960's, the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko was well-published in \\"accepted\\" Soviet literature journals despite his \\"rebelliousness.\\" His famous poem, \\"Babi Yar\\" (1961) about the German slaughter of Ukranian Jews during WW II, gained overnight success, and Shostakovich, moved by the poem's message, placed it at the core of his Thirteenth Symphony with Yevtushenko's warm agreement. The work received its Russian premiere \\"as is\\" on December 18, 1962, and was tumultuously received by the audience but not by officials of the state, who read into it a message of Russian complicity in the matter of anti-Semitism, a subtext of Yevtushenko's that was undoubtedly accurate, as he revised the text shortly after the premiere without consulting Shostakovich. Some years later, in London where Vishnevskaya and Rostropovich met up with Yevtushenko, Vishnevskaya gave Yevtushenko a tongue-lashing over his \\"revisionism\\" that runs several pages.    In an act of supreme political courage involving another Russian writer, Rostropovich provided refuge, for four years in the early '70's, to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose writings on conditions in the Soviet Union were officially banned. Solzhenitsyn subsequently went into political exile, but this act of courage was to have its effect on the careers of Vishnevskaya and Rostropovich, particularly the latter, who for all intents and purposes had his abilities to perform and conduct stripped away from him. Only by \\"pulling in markers\\" were the two of them able to secure permission from Brezhnev to go abroad on a two-year \\"artistic leave.\\"    \\"Galina\\" ends on a note of uncertainty and apprehension, as Vishnevskaya, in 1976, boards a plane with her two daughters to join Rostropovich in the West, eventually (1978) in exile when their citizenship was revoked for the Solzhenitsyn matter. But this is merely the end of her \\"first\\" Russian life and the beginning of another, more international, one. Her own career as a diva continued for nearly another decade; Rostropovich went on to become an internationally-known conductor while continuing his career as a preeminent cellist; with \\"perestroika,\\" they made an historic return to Moscow in 1990 (after Gorbachev restored their citizenship), at which Rostropovich conducted what is to me the finest performance of Tchaikovsky's \\"Pathetique\\" Symphony (immortalized on a Sony CD that also included Sousa's \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" and William Schuman's orchestral arrangement of Charles Ives's \\"Variations on America\\").    Nowadays Vishnevskaya loves to brag about her six thoroughly-Americanized grandchildren. They oversee the Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation, a charity for immunizing Russian children against disease. She recently founded the Galina Vishnevskaya School of Opera in Moscow, for providing master classes to promising young artists. All in all, a rather remarkable \\"follow-up\\" for this peripatetic pair of seemingly perpetually-young 75-year-olds.    But the clock cannot be turned back. \\"Galina\\" serves as a gripping reminder of how things were over the fifty years that the two of them spent in the Soviet Union. And, at least as important for me, it serves as one of the most honest and accurate appraisals of Dmitri Shostakovich the person as one is likely to find, from one who knew and loved him as a true friend.    Even in a totalitarian society, supreme artistry can sometimes carry clout. For Vishnevskaya (and Rostropovich), there was enough clout - barely - to get out and \\"live to tell about it.\\" Thankfully.    Bob Zeidler	2002-08-04
US	50455427	R3KVSWM9WKEV17	0198163762	325637560	The Mahler Companion	Books	5	35	35	N	N	A near-perfect Mahler resource.	This collection of essays, by a wide range of contributors, adds considerably to our collective knowledge of Gustav Mahler, his life and times and the cultural milieu in which he worked as composer and conductor, and of course his music.    The editors, as they note in the Introduction, provided very loose guidelines to the contributing essayists: Beyond refereeing the broad topics for inclusion, the editors largely gave carte blanche to the contributors regarding style and content. This \\"looseness of control\\" has resulted in a volume of both very considerable strengths (some of which I highlight here) and a few perplexing weaknesses and oversights which I allude to at the end of my comments.    The \\"logical bookends\\" of this volume are an opening essay by Leon Botstein, titled \\"Gustav Mahler's Vienna,\\" and a closing essay by Wilfrid Mellers, titled \\"Mahler and the Great Tradition: Then and Now.\\" The former sets the cultural, socio-political and philosophical stage of fin-de-sicle Vienna onto which Mahler entered, and the latter nicely summarizes how Mahler might fit into a continuum of musical composition and practice that preceded and succeeded him. (This new paperback edition also includes. at the end, two new essays, not present in the hardback edition, covering recollections of his daughter, Anna, and recently discovered Mahler \\"juvenilia\\" in the form early chamber music and songs.) In between these bookends, all of Mahler's music, and much about his life and times, and how he and his music were accepted (or not accepted) inside and outside Vienna, are covered.    The essays regarding Mahler's music are largely - and splendidly - informative, and provide alternative insights into the music not necessarily covered by the well-known analyses of Theodor Adorno, Constantin Floros and Henry-Louis de La Grange. (Interestingly, many of the music-analysis contributors reference Adorno's \\"Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy.\\" Perhaps Adorno's time has come as well, some 40 years after his writing this difficult-but-epiphanic work.) But at least three of them are (to me, anyway) frustratingly idiosyncratic. Peter Franklin's essay on the Third Symphony (\\"A Stranger's Story: Programmes, Politics, and Mahler's Third Symphony\\") is heavy on largely-irrelevant minutiae and very light on certain matters of true import, such as the significance of the final Adagio of the work. David Matthews' \\"The Sixth Symphony,\\" by his choice, largely limits his comments to the two well-known areas of conjecture/dispute: the ordering of the two inner (Scherzo, Andante) movements and the matter of whether the final movement should have two hammer blows or three. (I am personally in agreement with both of his choices, but that is largely beside the point.) And Colin Matthews' \\"The Tenth Symphony\\" is largely a technical analysis of the available raw materials of the work left by Mahler for realization by others but very little about what interests most Mahlerites regarding this final work: A detailed comparison of the various \\"performing versions\\" or \\"realizations\\" that exist.    Among the many personal \\"resonances\\" for me are the following: A finely-crafted analysis of Mahler's \\"Opus 1,\\" his \\"Das klagende Lied\\" (but absent the fact that a splendid recording of the 1997-discovered Ur-text score has been made by Kent Nagano); (finally) a musicological connection between Mahler and Hector Berlioz, by way of how the widely-separated octaves (of trombone pedal tones and high flutes) in the \\"Hostias\\" of the Berlioz Requiem might have influenced Mahler when he was composing the first \\"Nachtmusik\\" movement of his Seventh Symphony; and a fascinating footnote to the analysis of the final Adagio of the Ninth Symphony, where some apparently reliable documentation is provided for Mahler's awareness of the famous hymn, \\"Abide with Me,\\" the tune that always comes to mind every time I listen to this gorgeous hymn-like passage.    Elsewhere (and scattered throughout various essays) are frequent allusions to certain parallels between Mahler and Charles Ives. (They both wrote \\"music about music,\\" incorporated \\"vernacular\\" music in their works, were almost-simultaneous \\"polytonalists\\" and of course contemporaries. The matter of whether Mahler had been aware of the music of Ives is put more in the affirmative than I've seen heretofore; hopefully this is the result of recent research about which there is more to follow.) Similarly, there are frequent parallels drawn between Mahler and Dmitri Shostakovich; the case for Shostakovich being the logical (and most significant by far) successor to Mahler is well-drawn without overlooking the obvious differences between them.    There is an intriguing chapter on some not-so-obvious parallels between Mahler and Debussy (although the overt pentatonicism of \\"late\\" Mahler is made elsewhere, most obviously in the essay on \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\"). And, for me, one of the best contributions is by Edward R. Reilly, in his essay on \\"Mahler in America.\\"    The volume is exceedingly well-annotated, with liberal footnotes (many, such as the \\"Abide with Me\\" one, of considerable length), and, at the back, a full bibliography of source materials, a detailed index of works, and a general index as well. Clearly, a lot of work (both scholarship and \\"routine editorial\\") has gone into the preparation of this valuable resource.    The book is not perfect in all respects, at least from my own personal point of view. Biographical details are not its strength, but there are the volumes by La Grange and Blaukopf & Blaukopf to compensate. (Nonetheless, I would have liked to have seen a contribution by Herta Blaukopf, who is as knowledgeable about Mahler's Vienna Conservatory period as any.) But, as I noted at the outset, its very considerable strengths greatly outweigh its relatively minor weaknesses. If you consider yourself a Mahlerite, this book belongs in your library, alongside your copies of Adorno, Blaukopf, Floros andLa Grange.    Bob Zeidler	2002-08-03

In a nutshell, this book is a collection of excerpts from reviews, commentary and correspondence regarding the music of forty-three composers over a 150-year span, beginning with Beethoven and ending (approximately) with Bartk, Schoenberg, Shostakovich and Stravinsky. While most of the composers are well-known, some (Henry Cowell, Roy Harris, Wallingford Riegger, Carl Ruggles, Edgar Varse) are hardly household names. For the most part, the commentary closely follows, in time, the premieres of the works described. (In some cases, this may be years after their original premieres. It often took, in times past, years for the works to get from \\"the country of origin\\" to the venues that were the domains of the reviewers and critics. History - and this book - have shown that this extra time was not necessarily an asset in evaluating the works more accurately.)    A quick page count by composer shows that Wagner (at 27 pages), Schoenberg (at 20 pages), Stravinsky (at 19 pages), Strauss (at 16 pages), and Debussy (at 15 pages) come under the greatest critical scrutiny, or, in retrospect, the greatest \\"fear of the unknown.\\" Surprisingly, other \\"true revolutionaries\\" come off somewhat better: Berlioz (at 5 pages), Mahler (at 4 pages), to name two. Even \\"universally-loved\\" composers who wrote music which these days is commonly considered accessible don't escape the critics' wrath: Bizet, Brahms, Puccini, Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky are some who didn't exactly become accepted overnight.    It's not as if these music critics \\"who blew it\\" didn't know their field appropriately. More than a few (Csar Cui, George Templeton Strong, Virgil Thomson, to name three) were themselves composers, writing about the new music of their contemporaries. Others (Olin Downes, long-time music critic of the New York Times, Henry E. Krehbiel, similarly of the New York Tribune, and Philip Hale, similarly of the Boston Herald) were highly-respected music critics of their time, not normally given to \\"blowing it\\" as far as making a bad call against a new piece of music was concerned.    But that is what this book is about: \\"Blowing it, major-league big-time,\\" usually with style and panache to spare, as well as all the buzzwords and \\"tricks of the trade\\" that suggest expertise. Then, along comes the unsuspecting reader of \\"the next morning's dailies.\\" He (or she) reads the critique, and the die is cast: Wagner (or Strauss or Stravinsky or Debussy; enter a name of your choice) has just composed music that is: cacophonous; caterwauling; noise, non-music; not fit for human consumption (pick one). The reader has fallen victim to this \\"expert opinion.\\" It is hard to shake this initial \\"expert\\" impression. It may take years. It may never happen. And it might have been the fault of the critic in the first instance.    There is one significant omission, perhaps curious only to those who are unfamiliar with some of the other \\"alter egos\\" which Slonimsky had: Charles Ives. Now, Ives was America's first \\"modern\\" (or, in terms that I think fit him best, our \\"first-and-only romantic pre-post-modern\\"), and his music just barely found acceptance within his lifetime, even if this acceptance came many years after he stopped composing and was quite infirm due to a variety of ailments. Slonimsky had been a friend and champion of Ives well before Ives's music caught on with the concert-going public, and I like to think that omission of Ives as a subject of such invective was a conscious decision on the part of Slonimsky, perhaps as a gift from a friend. But it is also true that much of Ives's music went unperformed during his lifetime, thereby escaping the invective it might otherwise have garnered.    I almost thought that there might be a second significant omission, that of Hector Berlioz as music critic (something which he did for the better part of forty years). But the index at the back of the book did turn up one comment of Berlioz's (in a letter [dated 1861]), brief but to the point: \\"Wagner is evidently mad.\\" By 1861, Berlioz and Wagner had already known each other quite well for some six years or more. Berlioz - despite trying hard - couldn't fathom the chromaticism in Wagner's \\"Tristan und Isolde,\\" this despite the fact that Wagner wasn't at all bashful about borrowing some of Berlioz's better ideas in his \\"Romeo et Juliette\\" for \\"Tristan und Isolde.\\"    Also curiously absent is any mention of twentieth-century British composers (Vaughan Williams, Holst, Britten, Brian, Bax and so forth). Neither Slonimsky nor Peter Schickele (of P. D. Q. Bach fame, and the writer of a fresh Foreword to this edition) posits why this might be so. There is no shortage of criticism by British critics; they have plenty to say about the musics of composers of other countries. And sheer accessibility cannot be the explanation; the Fourth Symphony of Ralph Vaughan Williams hardly fits the mold of \\"instant acceptance and accessibility.\\" Curious.    It wouldn't surprise me if every working composer already has a copy of Slonimsky's little masterpiece tucked away for \\"rainy day\\" encouragement. And if they don't, they ought to. Music lovers would do well to read how initial critical thinking can affect acceptance of new music, and how critical opinion can change \\"once the dust settles.\\"    But those who stand to benefit the most from reading this book, as a cautionary tale, perhaps, are the working music reviewers and critics. They (or at least their predecessors) are the ones whose flawed judgements at the time have not withstood history's judgement, resulting in these screamingly funny \\"critiques.\\"    Good for much more than just a laugh or two! Pick your favorite composer. He's probably been picked apart by someone anthologized in Slonimsky's screamer.    Bob Zeidler	2002-05-26

Anyone familiar with the works of Oscar Wilde will of course know where the \\"take-off\\" above comes from. And how trenchantly - even scathingly - funny that particular work is, even to the point where some folks have fun citing extended passages at will, out loud, just for the \\"yuks\\" it contains. Well, add \\"The Memoirs of Hector Berlioz\\" to that short list.    I am now barely 100 pages into this screamer, after having recently concluded reading the magisterial and sympathetic two-volume biography of Berlioz by David Cairns (who also provides the perfect translation of these Memoirs). Frankly, I wasn't sure that I could handle \\"yet more Berlioz\\" so soon after finishing the Cairns volumes (although Cairns provided plenty of justification, in terms of his ability to pinpoint Berlioz's scathing wit).    I shouldn't have worried.    Berlioz is certainly famous among music lovers, and musicians and composers, for a long list of \\"firsts\\": The first to take the proto-Romantic beginnings started so auspiciously by Beethoven to new heights, the first to expand the size (and instruments) of the classical orchestra to something closely resembling today's symphony orchestra, the first to write a detailed study on the uses of the instruments in the orchestra, including the effects of venue acoustics on the orchestra's sound... It's a long list, and this is just a part of it.    But Berlioz was also a brilliant writer. Inter alia, his \\"feuilletons\\" (music & arts criticism for the cultural journals of his time) and his \\"Evenings in the Orchestra\\" (including several of his better feuilletons) showed both his brilliance as a writer on the arts and his scathing wit. And that wit comes across as well in his Memoirs, as can be evidenced by this example on his very first page:    \\"Needless to say, I was brought up in the Catholic and Apostolic Church of Rome. This charming religion (so attractive since it gave up burning people) was for seven whole years the joy of my life, and although we have long since fallen out I have always kept most tender memories of it. Indeed, such is its appeal for me that had I the misfortune to be born into the bosom of one of those schisms ponderously hatched by Luther or Calvin I should undoubtedly abjured it the moment I was able...\\"    It gets even better later on, and the Memoirs are very well served by Cairns's idiomatic translation that so perfectly captures the trenchantly ascerbic writing qualities of which Berlioz was so capable. (Apparently, earlier translations, whether due to \\"bowdlerization\\" or simple lack of supporting documents, did not succeed to the same degree in capturing all of these qualities.)    Berlioz started these Memoirs while in his mid-40's and while in London for performances of his works and finding himself with some spare time. From then until the end of his life two decades later, he would add to them, with the express requirement that they be published posthumously. There is no need to \\"wonder why\\" at this requirement: He had something to say about nearly everything and everybody in the world of music and culture of his time, and wasn't afraid to \\"name names.\\" And good for him!    I hope to have more (but not too much more) to say about these alternately hilarious and moving Memoirs once I've finished them. In the meantime, I hope that these brief comments serve to whet your appetite for one of the best books ever written about music by a musician. And a suitably famous one at that. This hardcover version is inexpensive and beautifully bound; a worthwhile addition to every music lover's library.    Bob Zeidler	2002-05-03

I approached this book with some trepidation, not quite \\"fear and loathing\\" perhaps, but close enough. My reason? Simple enough. My fondness for Gustav Mahler's music - irrespective of what warts the man may or may not have had - made me think twice before reading a fictionalized version of \\"the wild brat's story\\" and how it might have distorted my own version of reality concerning my favorite composer. I shouldn't have worried.    Some thirty-odd years ago, I had the opportunity to read an English translation of Alma Mahler Werfel's \\"Ein Leben mit Gustav Mahler\\" (\\"My Life with Gustav Mahler\\"). The book was not mine, and I regret not having my own copy to this day, if for no other reason than that Alma edited these reminiscences with a rather heavy hand, lest the reader get the idea that she was less than devoted to Mahler. Of course, even then, her legend preceded her. Those of a certain age (and I am one of them) well remember Tom Lehrer's send-up of her, sung to the melody of \\"Alma Mater.\\" A tune as trenchant commentary, deservedly so.    Well, if there's nothing new under the sun from Tom Lehrer (and others) from then till now, why in the world should one read this \\"autobiographical\\" novel? For the simple reason that Max Phillips has fashioned an excellent tale about a fascinating woman whose greatest adventures occurred during a time when her fin-de-sicle Vienna and Hapsburg world was simultaneously both filled with intriguing characters and at the brink of chaos and collapse.    Despite her own heavy hand at personal \\"damage control,\\" there is plenty of historical corroborating information (including those parts of her diaries and memoirs that she did indeed approve for publication) to state that Alma was clearly all of these: Self-absorbed, wilful, modestly talented, unafraid of her own sexuality, a flame to the moths of creative genius of the times, a sometime muse to these geniuses, and self-appointed - or perhaps self-anointed - champion and guardian of the arts of her times, with her \\"Sundays\\" (salons at which all the rich and famous of the arts of the period grovelled for her invitations and attention). She was also beautiful by the day's standards, and suffered from both deafness and alcoholism. Nevertheless, she outlived all but one of her husbands and lovers, living to the ripe old age of 84, by that time a barely-subdued doyenne. (Of her paramours, only Oskar Kokoschka outlived her, finally expiring at the very ripe old age of 94 in 1980.)    In an endnote, Phillips begins by stating \\"To put it mildly, this is not a work of scholarship.\\" While perhaps true - because Phillips does take minor liberties with the timings and juxtaposition of events and (probably) major liberties with words placed in the mouths of his panoply of characters - he is being entirely too modest (perhaps with tongue implanted firmly in cheek) regarding these liberties. For, at the end of it all, one does come away with a clear sense of \\"what Alma was all about,\\" and of an epoch and its end. The latter is detailed better in \\"Wittgenstein's Vienna\\"by  Allan Janik and Stephen Toulmin, a true work of scholarship available elsewhere at Amazon.com. But, where Janik and Toulmin are factual - almost, but not quite, to the point of pedanticism - Phillips is downright trenchant in his observations on the epoch and in the words he puts in his characters' mouths.    At the end, the tale turned out to be both a hoot and a valuable backward glance at an artistic period and place which we in America regrettably understand not well at all. As I said at the outset, \\"I shouldn't have worried.\\"    Bob Zeidler	2001-10-17
US	50455427	R2IE8KQFB8DZQ7	0393317196	932853582	Charles Ives: A Life with Music	Books	5	28	29	N	N	A high-water mark in musical biographies.	Quite recently, I had the privilege of reading a copy of this book that was the personal copy of a musician who had been involved, in a rather unique way, in the centennial observation of Charlie Ives's birthday back in 1974. For reasons of geography, then musical interest, he \\"got to know\\" Charlie quite well, even if only 20 years after Charlie's death. I immediately ordered my own copy, while continuing to read the heavily-annotated copy of my musician friend. (It was rather vicarious pleasure, \\"looking over the shoulder\\" of this musician, to see what it was about the music, life and times of Charlie that fascinated him.)    In his early years, Ives was a one-man dynamo. Learning much of his music theory and practice from his father George Ives, who had been a very young (perhaps the youngest) Civil War band leader, and then from Horatio Parker at Yale University, he had more than a \\"thorough grounding\\" in the basics. However, unlike most American composers, particularly those of his and the following generation, he did not go to Europe for a post-grad internship with any known European composer, but simply set out on his own after matriculating from Yale. He went to New York City, employed as an insurance clerk for one full-time job, wrote music constantly for another full-time job, and had yet another career, had he wanted it, as organist and choir director for the Central Presbyterian Church in New York. During this period - leading up to his marriage in 1908 - he literally burned the candle at both ends. (Swafford goes on, later in the book, to posit why Charlie had this incredible burst of energy for the first 15 or 20 years of his adult life, but it's best that his reasons for this - and for Ives's shortened composing career - be left to you, the potential reader.)    Most anyone who knows anything about Ives knows that he became comfortably wealthy in the insurance industry, that during his active composing days little of his music was played by anyone, andthat he was - literally and figuratively - burned out by the time he was only 40. For the remaining half of his life, much of it was spent editing, publishing and promoting his music and the music of others, including many friends, using the proceeds from his insurance success to underwrite projects for many composers who would have gone unnoted had it not been for him. Musical success - unlike business success - came too late in life for him to truly enjoy at least its artistic, if not financial, rewards. He was in his last years when Leonard Bernstein premiered his Second Symphony, and never lived to hear his masterpiece - his Fourth Symphony - premiered by Leopold Stokowski in 1965. Despite this, he was far from an unhappy man in his later years; philosophically resigned yet optimistic that his day might yet come would be the more accurate description.    Swafford's writing is simply wonderful. It tells the story of a true American iconoclast; an \\"original.\\" The narrative flows beautifully without omitting anything of significance in Ives's life or about his music. (The book contains nearly 80 pages of endnotes, in which the musical marginalia are explained in exhaustive, but emminently readable, detail, to preserve the flow of the main narrative.) In parts, it is incredibly moving. I particularly enjoyed the extended \\"mating dance\\"of his courting of Harmony Twichell, who was to become his life-long helpmate (and who did live long enough to attend the Stokowski premiere of his masterpiece, as the guest of honor). Ives, ever the Victorian man if something else as a composer, would always refer to her, to third parties, as \\"Mrs. Ives.\\" Yet their fifty years together could be a model for today's dysfunctional families. A beautiful chapter; one of the best in the book.    There's a curiously cryptic endnote that suggests a \\"what might have been.\\" It is a fact that very little of Ives's music saw public performance before the early 30's, when Nicholas Slonimsky championed Ives and other \\"moderns.\\" Yet another two decades were to pass until Bernstein premiered the Second Symphony. Yet, in 1910, while shopping in a music store in preparation for his final return to Vienna, where he would die in less than a year's time, Gustav Mahler purchased a fair copy - one of only two or three in existence - of Ives's Third Symphony. Swafford doesn't make that big a deal about this, but I do. I've always thought that Ives and Mahler, aside from being near-contemporaries, had more in common than they did in opposition. It is just conjecture - but truly fascinating conjecture - to think what might have happened had Mahler premiered Ives's Third Symphony at a time in the life of Ives when it really might have made a difference.    Just what was Ives, as a composer? Bernstein did him no favors by calling him \\"a primitive; a Grandma Moses of music\\" while at the same time championing his music. Back in those days, there were no labels like \\"atonalist,\\" \\"serialist,\\" \\"avant-gardist,\\" \\"post-modernist,\\" what-have-you, that we tend to use today to compartmentalize a composer. To me, Ives was, well... an iconoclast, an \\"original,\\" and, if a label must be applied, our first \\"pre-post-modern.\\" He was never imitated, at least not successfully, not only because he didn't have his own students as did other composers, but because by the time his music enjoyed sufficient - if not plentiful - performances, composers' agendas were different.    Fortunately audiences think differently, and do enjoy Charlie's music. And you will enjoy this book.    Bob Zeidler	2001-07-16

This authorized biography by Joseph Mussulman, a one-time Shaw chorister, covers Shaw's life and career up to 1979 in detail, with a Foreword added in 1996 which briefly covers those later years. But a revised edition, with full detail in the period 1979 to Shaw's death in January, 1999, would fill in a lot of blanks for those who know him best through his Telarc recordings with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and his Chamber Singers and Festival Singers, or through his Carnegie Hall Choral Workshops and Tanglewood appearances in the later years of his career.    I came by my appreciation of Shaw relatively late in life, and by a somewhat unusual means. When he founded his Collegiate Chorale in 1941, I was all of two years old. I was still way too young to latch on to him seven years later, when he had disbanded the Collegiate Chorale and founded the Robert Shaw Chorale. For three decades after that, I had a somewhat different musical agenda, and he was a musical \\"ship passing in the night\\" for too many years.    The signal event which brought Shaw to the forefront of my musical consciousness was the launching of Telarc's digitally-mastered LP's by Bob Woods and Jack Renner, in 1977. The second of these LP's was a performance of Stravinsky's Firebird Suite and Borodin's Polovtsian Dances by Shaw and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. Shaw had earlier assumed the directorship of the ASO in 1968, and Woods and Renner had been associated with Shaw during the period when he was assistant conductor and choral director for George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra. In a very real sense, Woods and Renner were, by bringing this new technology to Shaw, thanking him for past friendships and associations. And the history of his role in leading the ASO, and bringing it to prominence with its recorded repertoire, was dramatically changed by this event. But much of this later history, and whatfollowed Shaw's \\"retirement\\" as active music director of the ASO, has unfortunately been compressed into the all-too-brief Foreword, and the last three years of his life are not documented at all.    It is fair to say that the Telarc \\"gift\\" which Woods and Renner presented to Shaw made the difference between a career which would have been insufficiently documented by recordings (except for a handful of earlier RCA Victor recordings of the Robert Shaw Chorale) and one which will now stand the test of time. The ASO, good as it became under Shaw's leadership, served as much during his tenure as the recording instrument which would provide support for the \\"ultimate\\" Robert Shaw Chorale, the remarkable, and totally amateur (in the best sense) Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus, as it would as the civic orchestra for the greater Atlanta area.    I could wax eloquent about the dozens of recordings this orchestra and chorus produced over a 20-year period of Telarc support. But there is one recording which stands out above all, of a work which was the closest thing to a cornerstone for Shaw's career: Bach's B Minor Mass. His professional life with this work is well-documented in Joe Mussulman's book. There is a wealth of anecdotes about how his performances of this work could reduce folks to tears, from Alaskan Aleuts to college kids everywhere to Soviet apparatchiks at the height of the Cold War.    One anecdote stands out above all others regarding his mastery, as well as his unassuming modesty in the face of it all, regarding the B Minor Mass. It occurred after a performance that must have really come together in a very special way. Following the concluding \\"Dona Nobis Pacem\\" of the Mass, Shaw left the podium and darted behind the curtain, awaiting the applause. He waited, and waited some more. Finally, not understanding why it was that the applause never arrived, he poked his head out from behind the curtain, only to find both the audience and the musicians facing each other and bawling their eyes out from what must have been a rendering of the final \\"Dona Nobis Pacem\\" of the Mass for the ages. Those who were at that performance carry a very special event around in their memories.    This single, simple paragraph of an anecdote says volumes about Shaw's largely underrated mastery. When you read this book, you too will cry. And you will laugh. And you will likely do both simultaneously. For all the right reasons.    Now, if only someone would fill in the final missing 20 years or so of \\"Dear People,\\" we'd have it all.    Bob Zeidler	2000-10-30

I hope I'm able to  explain why in this review, and to further explain how it is that a book on  Mahler can be a \\"page turner.\\" <br /> <br />The music of Gustav Mahler has been the  centerpiece of my musical listening for virtually all of my adult life, in  excess of 40 years now. It's fair to say that it started for me, as it did  for others of my generation, with the recordings of Bruno Walter in the  late '50's and Leonard Bernstein and others throughout the '60's. It's also  fair to say that Mahler's music engenders intense personalization on the  part of a listener who is drawn in, to the extent that there is a   never-ending desire to know more about the man, his creative processes, his  quite obvious contradictions, and the bipolar way in which his  contemporaries, his critics, his musicians, and audiences and critics ever  since his death, have characterized the man and the music. <br /> <br />I have yet to  read a Mahler biography or critique that is not in one way or another  colored by the thoughts and opinions of the biographer, starting with the  first Mahler biography I read about 30 years ago, by his widow, Alma  Werfel-Mahler. Each has had a \\"pitch,\\" an agenda, which has left rather an  incomplete, and often judgemental, picture of this complex human being.  Perhaps, had I read all of them in an attempt to weigh matters in the  balance, I would have been satisfied in having reached a reasonably  accurate overview. <br /> <br />Kurt and Herta Blaukopf, in their \\"Mahler: His Life,  Work & World,\\" have done something quite different and remarkable. As a  result of reviewing what must have been millions of words by and about the  man and his music, incorporating the most up-to-date research on the  availability of these materials, and selecting and incorporating those  pieces that illuminate the man, his music, his life, and the times in which  he lived, a gripping yet balanced portrait of Mahler, from birth to the  first posthumous performance of his \\"Das Lied von der Erde,\\" conducted by  Bruno Walter on November 20, 1911 (six months after his death). <br /> <br />Along the  way, we follow him through success and failure, appointments gained and  appointments lost or surrendered, works that came relatively easily and  works that resulted only from Herculean struggle, through his own words and  the words of friends, associates, subordinates, superiors, acquaintances,  rivals, and critics (who, it is clear to see from the selections chosen for  this volume, were clearly on one side or the other in the matter of the  worth of his music). In several instances, the juxtaposition of critical  reviews by admirers and detractors, published the same day but in different  papers, lead one to ask \\"Were these two critics at the same concert?\\" <br /> <br />The  pages literally fly by. When, in the last year of his life he experienced  his greatest triumph (the first performances of hs Eighth Symphony) in the  face of mortality, the narrative becomes absolutley gripping, despite its  being comprised of nothing more than what is in the written record. The  last dozen or so entries are simply heartbreaking in their poignance as the  end approaches, a fellow composer places a valuation on his estate as  testator, and, six months after Mahler's death, Anton von Webern  corresponds to Alban Berg about the text to the final poem in \\"Das Lied von  der Erde\\" and how, in planning for the two of them to travel to Munich to  hear this as-yet-unplayed music, in the premiere conducted by Walter, he  knows that they will \\"...expect to hear the most wonderful music that there  is. Something of such magnificence as has never yet existed.\\" And of course  Webern was absolutely correct in his assessment. <br /> <br />The Blaukopfs note in  their Preface that \\"The biographer who seeks to portray an artist is unable  to resist colouring the picture with his own ideas. Documentation, on the  other hand, is more disciplined: it provides the reader with the factual  components of Mahler's life and identifies their sources. Each individual  can then fit these pieces together to form their own Mahler portrait.\\" At  barely 250 pages, this book is a treasure for the Mahlerite. It could have  been twice or three times as long and still have been the page-turner that  the Blaukopfs have created from the private papers and public records of  Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br />Every Mahlerite should have this volume in his or her  collection. <br /> <br />Bob Zeidler	2000-08-21

The symphonies of Gustav Mahler can be listened to on more than one level. As complex and forward-looking as they are, they nonetheless can connect at  an elemental, \\"visceral\\" level for many listeners.    However, for a fuller  appreciation of both the details and the profundity which are in these  works, as well as for insight into Mahler's creative processes, some  outside help is required, and this help is usually not forthcoming from the  liner or booklet notes that accompany recordings, or from the program notes  that accompany performances. This is precisely where this excellent book by  Constantin Floros fits in.    First, a few words on what this book is not,  and does not purport to be. It is not a comparative discography of  available performances; in fact, it neither lists nor recommends  recordings. Second, it is not a critical biography of Mahler; the  interested reader is referred to the outstanding (but much more expensive)  volumes by Henry-Louis de la Grange, available elsewhere at Amazon.com.  Third, it is not a psychological study of Mahler, relating, as such a study  might, such connections between the man and the music; an excellent small  volume by Theodor Adorno, \\"Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy\\" covers that  territory very well, and is also available elsewhere at Amazon.com. Fourth,  and finally, it is not a set of musical scores of the symphonies; those as  well, published by Dover in inexpensive paperback editions, can be found at  Amazon.com    So, just what is this Floros book? It is the perfect companion  for the serious Mahlerite in understanding the genesis and the thematic,  harmonic and interpretational details of each of Mahler's ten symphonies,  and the interrelationships and comparisons among them. It has just enough  of the material covered in the references noted above, along with detailed  analyses of the symphonies, for each of them to be better understood and  placed in historical and musical context by the listener. Its greatest  insight into these symphonies comes largely from Floros' remarkable  scholarship in tracking down all of the score notes that Mahler provided in  his sketches, short scores and long scores, his correspondences with his  wife, friends and interpreters, and their comments and observations as  well. By piecing all of this research together, relying particularly  heavily on Mahler's own notes, Floros has come up with a near-definitive  look into Mahler's creative and interpretational processes (a term for such  a look based on scholarship that Floros describes as \\"hermeneutics\\").    The  book's publication date (1985 in the original German) means that it is the  beneficiary of a series of events in the 1960's that opened the door to  greatly improved accuracy in the study of this complex man and his equally  complex music. First was the passage into the public domain of much of  Mahler's own private writings, on the 100th anniversary of his birth.  Second was the agreement on the part of his widow, Alma Mahler-Werfel, to  release other materials, particularly related to his unfinished 10th  Symphony, for public scrutiny. Third was the availability of this material  to the Englishman Deryck Cooke, and others, who provided performing  versions of this final 10th Symphony so that the public at large could  better judge the direction in which Mahler had been heading when his work  was cut short by premature death. Floros pays great respect to, and  provides excellent insight into, the work of Cooke in his (Floros') plan to  describe the full symphonic output of Mahler.    This book is very liberally  annotated, with briefly-scored examples as reference marks for  understanding the interrelationships among the various musical themes, as  well as end notes for each symphony and a detailed bibliography for further  reading. While it helps to be able to read these brief bars of music, even  those who cannot will benefit immensely from Floros' scholarship and fine,  but nonetheless dense, writing in providing extramusical background and  values for a better understanding of these remarkable symphonies which  moves so many of us.    Without question, the single most valuable reference  source for a fuller understanding of the Mahler symphonies. And a compact  and inexpensive companion for the Mahlerite.    Bob Zeidler	2000-08-14

This is a simple, heartwarming and thoroughly uplifting story, narrated by Robert J. Lurtsema with incidental music provided by Paul Winter and his Consort. It tells of the overwhelmingly empowering effect that a single  human being can have, through sheer dint of commitment.<br />The story, by  Jean Giono, is simplicity itself. Over a period of three decades, Elzéard  Bouffier, a Frenchman finding himself widowed and alone in a barren and  desolate region of France, began to transform the area through the simple  act of collecting and sorting acorns, and then planting one hundred of the  most propitious-appearing acorns each day. It was a task of solitude and  almost religious solemnity, taking place totally outside the view of  others. Over time, Bouffier transformed the region, making it once again a  hospitable place. Many years after the start of Bouffier's work, people -  including foresters - marveled at what they \\"had missed,\\" totally unaware  that this was the life's work of a single human being.<br />Almost anyone  could have narrated this simple tale of regeneration with effectiveness.  That the task fell to Robert J. Lurtsema is pleasurable beyond measure to  one who made it a habit, when he could, to listen to Lurtsema's  PBS-syndicated program, \\"Morning Pro Musica.\\" Robert J. was a polyglot in  the best sense of the term, able to talk with authority on a wide range of  topics. And now, in retrospect, I cannot picture anyone else telling this  story with equal effect.<br />This Sunday past (June 18, 2000), my wife and I  were nearing the end of a five-hour car journey, and I played this album  for her, since she had yet to hear it. She was transformed by the simple  beauty of the tale, and by Robert J.'s incomparable narrative skills. As  matters would have it, the timing of this event was eerily perfect yet  totally unplanned: Elsewhere, at precisely the same hour, a memorial  remembrance to Robert J. was in process. And his collaborator and long-timefriend Paul Winter was there.<br />Robert J., this review's for you.	2000-06-24

As a one-time practicing physicist (now just an \\"arm-chair physicist\\") and lifetime music lover, I have found this beautifully-written little book irresistible over the 17 years it has been in my library. In 1983, when the original hardcover edition came out, this book was given to me as a gift by  someone knowing my musical tastes, figuring that it would be the perfect  gift. It turned out to be, but for reasons that are largely  non-musical.<br /><br />As an arm-chair scientist, I've read and enjoyed more than a  few popularizations by well-known scientists over the years. These include  Richard Feynman with his wry humor in virtually everything he wrote (I  number myself among those physicists who \\"cut their eye teeth\\" on the  Feynman Lectures in Physics), Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene, Carl Sagan,  and even Brian Swimme. (The Swimme of \\"A Walk Through Time\\" goes down  easily, and covers much of the same ground that Thomas does, but in a quite  different way; the Swimme of \\"The Universe is a Green Dragon\\" is a much  harder sell for me due to its hard-pressed attempt to oversimplify.) But  for sheer elegance and poetry and breadth of scope, and for essays that  provoke thought on the part of the reader, none can hold a candle to  Thomas.<br /><br />Everyone who reads this little masterpiece will have his or her  favorites. Here are a few of mine:<br /><br />In \\"Things Unflattened by Science\\" (an  essay on unaddressed and/or incomplete challenges that future scientists  might well undertake), a paragraph on how biologists might endeavor to  better understand what music is, and how it affects the human condition,  starting with a rather small-scale assignment to explain the effect of  Bach's \\"The Art of Fugue\\" on the human mind.<br /><br />In \\"Altruism\\" (an essay on  the symbiotic interrelationships among species), how it is that such a  condition actually exists, and a challenge to future scientists to better  understand how our own species might become more altruistic (and adult)  than it presently is.<br /><br />In \\"The Attic of the Brain\\" (a cautionary essay on  the risks of psychiatry, most importantly psychoanalysis, in terms of  performing \\"total brain dumps\\"), the need for all of us to carry around a  little clutter in our lives, as insurance against the chance that we might  inadvertently lose our ability to retrieve something truly important.<br /><br />In  the title (and final) essay, another cautionary tale, this time on  thermonuclear weaponry, the most lucid description I've ever read regarding  the true meaning of this music as envisioned by Gustav Mahler. In a few  brief but sublime paragraphs, Thomas has captured the essence of this  remarkable opus in a way that no musician (and that includes such  Mahlerites as Bernstein, Karajan, Klemperer, Rattle and Walter) ever had.  Until very recently, that is, with the release a few months back of a  staggering performance by Benjamin Zander, conductng the Philharmonia  Orchestra. But that is another topic, and another review.<br /><br />In the  seventeen years since the initial publication of this book, quite a bit has  changed in our worldview, in some aspects of society and science. But not  enough! The observations and challenges that Thomas lays out will endure  for centuries, provided only that we endure as well.<br /><br />Bob Zeidlertly is.
