Books	3	3	7	N	N	Let's be honest here	This book was basically an early script for \\"Fahrenheit 9/11,\\" and Moore's rants tend to be more easily digested in 90 minute cinematic form. But when you sit down and read them, Moore frequently becomes strident and shrill.<br /><br />Problem is, I probably agree with 90% of the book. So if you can read beyond the sophomoric poop throwing and dig into the meat, you'll get some insightful incitement. Moore clearly loves this country, even as he preaches socialist doctrines (like universal healthcare...but this is bad, why?). And now that we have Georgie Boy doing more flip flops than a full squadron of Olympic Gymnasts (\\"I'll fire anyone connected with the CIA leak...oh I mean anyone CONVICTED of being connected to that pesky news article, it's OK Karl, you're safe...\\" Is is just me or was that a greater act of treason than anything the repugnant Ann Coulter defines as such?), it makes Moore's theories on why the current administration only loves the fat cats all the more convincing.<br /><br />And why hasn't anyone at Enron gone to trial yet? And how come Osama isn't in Git'mo? And why aren't those 9/11 Commission blacked out Saudi Documents available? These are all questions that need to be asked, and bless Moore for keeping the irresponsible parties' feet to the fire.<br /><br />Recommended for a more nuanced read, would be Al Franken's \\"Lies.\\" Also more convincing than \\"Dude\\" is Moore's collection of soldiers' letters, \\"Will They Ever Trust Us Again.\\" In that book, you hear from the men on the front line who have become jaded as they realize what duplicity has booked them into the Baghdad Hotel for extended stays, and does so without the vitriol.	2005-08-24

After that, anything goes. While it certainly makes an interesting idea, it also makes the stories disparate reads. The ones that stay more focused on relationships and family (\\"Winter Count\\" and \\"Erasing Sonny\\") fare the best. Also a kick is the fantastical \\"The Angelick Book.\\"<br /><br />Something else that is noteworthy about \\"Skin and Ink\\" is that the locales for more than a few of the pieces veer off the usual gay Mecca to other places. Philadelphia and Arkansas (in another of this book's highlights, the cheater's downfall of \\"Alibis\\") make for two of the diverse settings for some of the key tales. It makes for a pleasant change from the typical San Francisco or New York settings that are standard issue for most gay writing.	2005-08-22

Jim DeRogatis has written some pretty neat articles. He's also written some self-indulgent hogswill. That's all part of the fun in being paid to write about stuff that you truly love. And believe me, as a former paid rock writer and radio programmer, it's easy to get thoroughly wrapped up in the waves of emotion that feed the profit machine...and the profit machine wants you emotional, because that keeps you from expecting much for compensation. It is what makes the best rock writers so hilariously dramatic (like DeRogatis' hero, Lester Bangs) and often makes their writing pointlessly dorky (like DeRogatis bashing of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame).<br /><br />\\"Milk It\\" (the title copped from Nirvana) is a collection of JD's columns for numerous papers and magazines he's contributed to, and attempts to expound of what was great about music in the 90's. Which is centered mostly into pre and post Kurt Cobain, sometimes maddeningly so. There is WAY too much here that focuses on Cobain, Courtney and the general notion that Nirvana was the focus of all things in the decade. Which may be true, but a little pruning would have been to \\"Milk It's\\" benefit, or even a little updating/rewriting of some of the columns. But you do get one of the finest of the Nirvana articles to focus on the aftermath, the great Spin story of \\"The Nirvana Wars\\" in which all parties get to rip at each other with abandon.<br /><br />The other good moments are when DeRogatis takes on the R.E.M. hype machine around the time of \\"New Adventures In High-Fi,\\" verbally spars with Third Eye Blind's Stephen Jenkins, and exposes the hypocrisy surrounding many writers' defense of N.W.A.'s hate-for-cash scum-scam. But his venom is also his weakness, as too much ink is wasted on his feud with Steve Albini, and upon a typical rock crit's downfall, thinking your favorite obscurities are godhead. In addition, we need to face it up to the fact that trashing Brittany Spears is like shooting fish in a barrel.<br /><br />Had someone taken the time to winnow this book from its bloated near 400 pages down to a more concise 250, \\"Milk It\\" might have been the kind of the decade defining volume that DeRogatis intended it to be. And his hilarious tale of his brief tenure at Rolling Stone not withstanding, there's too much Jim and not enough rock here. I found myself racing to the end of the book, not because I wanted to find out where the DeRogatis was headed, but because I was getting bored. In rock writing, that's cardinal sin.r /> <br />Had someone taken the time to winnow this book from its bloated near 400 pages down to a more concise 250, \\"Milk It\\" might have been the kind of the decade defining volume that DeRogatis intended it to be.

It's hard to categorize this book as a \\"sex book,\\" because these gathered writings are way more psycho than sexo. The collection of stories in \\"Roughed Up\\" is relentlessly dark, with characters more apt to act on revenge, hatred (\\"Bashing\\"), self-loathing (\\"Johnny Was\\"), and good old-fashioned mental breakdowns (\\"Devoted\\"). In fact, when even a glimmer of humor rears up (the comedy of submission errors \\"The Fall Of Troy\\"), it's enough to throw you further off balance than the danger and menace that is \\"Roughed Up's\\" strongest currency.<br /><br />That's not to say these stories aren't extremely well done. In fact, B.J. Barrios' cat and mouse game \\"Destroying Master Michael\\" is one of the wildest kinky reads I've ever come across. But be warned...\\"Rough Stuff\\" isn't your basic rope and grope. Power is more front and center, and each story will pry open spaces you thought you might have carefully covered over. And just because these stories plunge headlong into the abyss of our darkest sexual mores, there's no reason to believe that some of these tales won't raise the pressure in your lower brain.	2005-07-12

Or at least longer than most would have imagined. Which makes Laura Anoniou's \\"The Catalyst\\" an interesting, often enjoyable and at times frustrating read. The items vary from kinky but funny (the lesbian Jewish vampire tale, \\"Shayna Maidel\\"), some personal stories about self discovery, a reprint of an early work in the book's titular story, and her infamous persnickety hedonist rant (\\"Unsafe at Any Speed\\"). While I find many of the stories themselves hot and they are all well written, those expecting more of \\"The Marketplace\\" should best be warned. This collection flings itself all over the bed sheets. While at times tawdry (which is what I like the best about Ms. Antoniou's work), it also jumps from wild story to moody reflection. It kept the book from being an \\"I couldn't put it down\\" page burner to something I had to think about wanting to finish.<br /><br />Best stories (in my humble opinion):<br /><br />\\"The New Brand,\\" \\"Shayna Maidel,\\" \\"Succession of Honor,\\" and the title collection that ends the book. Recommended to lovers of her novels, but just keep in mind, this is one bumpy ride.<br /><br />PS: also as much fun as anything in the book is Fetish Diva Midori's giddy introduction.	2005-07-02

Probably the most important is that, in this edition, Dr. Fritscher's notorious interview with the late Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey is published in full. LaVey is said to have thought this was his favorite published interview, and it is easy to see why. Dr. Fritscher allowed LaVey free range on a number of topics without condescending to the topic or gunning for the sensationalist angle. LaVey, relaxed by the situation, expounds on topics ranging from Governmental manipulation of minorities throughout history to why he thought Tuesday Weld was the perfect woman.<br /><br />Then, towards the end of the book. Dr Fritscher prints out the text of interviews he'd conducted with other witches during the course of researching \\"Popular Witchcraft.\\" These offer the most insight, as each of the interview subjects touch on topics most pertinent to them (and their thoughts on other witches, who, in LaVey's terms, are almost like rock stars). Out of the remaining interviews, the most interesting is Sabaean Pontifex Maximus Frederic De Arechaga. (Who, in Firstcher's terms, is a 'handful.')<br /><br />In the book's meaty midsection, the topic of how witchcraft and all things mystic have infiltrated the modern world is laid out with a dizzying array of interconnecting pop cultural circumstances and historical facts. The main interlocking premise of which seems to state that gays and witches are primarily in the same boat. As oppressed minorities, both groups find themselves banished, censored and otherwise oppressed and scapegoated. Be they new agers, Satanists, Old Religion or QueerEvil eyes for the straight guys, you can always count on the eventual fear factor to come in with the censor scissors.<br /><br />To that end, \\"Popular Witchcraft\\" is both important historically and seriously fun. After all, where else are you going to read about how witchcraft touches everyone from Andy Warhol to William Shatner?ere else are you going to read about how witchcraft touches everyone from Andy Warhol to William Shatner?	2005-06-17

One of them was Monte A Melnick. He became the band's road warrior first class and managed the band through their lives. When reading his history of the band, told in both first person and a gathering of quotes and comments from other notables over time, you discover that the band that sang \\"We're A Happy Family\\" was anything but.<br /><br />In fact, along with the telling it like it really was documentary, \\"End Of The Century,\\" \\"On The Road With The Ramones\\" shines an often uncomplimentary light on the principles. Reading through quote after recount of Johnny's almost sadistic militarist disciplines, Joey's obsessive/compulsive disorder (he once distressed himself in a European airport that he absolutely had to return to New York and touch a door he'd missed) and as Dee Dee's addictive personality become increasingly unstable, you marvel that The Ramones carved out a 22 year career that yielded only marginal success.<br /><br />Yet that is what Melnick lays out in this book. You watch as the three core band members take the job of being the Ramones and affect all they come into contact with. All who do, come out changed. Band members splinter off, sometimes only nominally damaged (Tommy) or severely (Ritchie Ramone cut himself off so completely his royalties lay uncollected for three years). There was no way a tornado of rock like these men could strike you and not throw you.<br /><br />What ultimately mattered to everyone involved was the music. You can gather through the book that, even at their most acrimonious, Johnny and Joey were blood brothers at the level of rock and roll as savior to what would have otherwise been anonymous lives. In the case of Joey or Dee Dee, you may even wonder what other life they would have had if not as musicians. It makes \\"On The Road With The Ramones\\" as much a confirmation of these legends of Punk Rock as it does a destroyer of their mythology. Absolutely essential.irmation of these legends of Punk Rock as it does a destroyer of their mythology. Absolutely essential.	2005-06-09

The key factor in this book is that Townsend has created settings for each story to different historical locales and then allowed his kinky imagination to roam the period. Populating \\"The Hounds Of Hell\\" are Egyptian Princes, England's elite in the early 1900's, World War II soldiers, Viet Nam War covert-operatives, and in one of the book's best pieces, an erotic re-imagining of the tale of Aladdin and his Lamp.<br /><br />What sets Townsend's work apart from many other writers in the SM field is his attention to detail and his command of the language. In \\"Prisoner Of War,\\" his description of the German farmhouse is so perfect that you feel the dank of the abandoned basement. He also has an emotional feel for the characters in his stories. You often gain insight into what attracts these men to their fetishes and their actions, more so than most writers in the genre.<br /><br />Don't think for a moment, however, that there isn't plenty of leatheresque heat spread across \\"The Hounds Of Hell.\\" If you are at all familiar with Townsend's body of work, than you will find exactly what you are looking for. This collection, covering over a quarter-century of work, is among the best of its kind.	2005-04-21

The second volume in the DemLab series is \\"Flogging: The Basics and Beyond.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Bean is an expert presenter and more than an expert when it comes to flogging. Having already written a book on the topic (\\"Flogging\\" published in 2000 and also locatable on Amazon), standing in front of an audience and a trio of cameramen is an obvious (and for Mr. Bean, casual) progression. His two attractive subjects allow him to demonstrate the fine art of wailing on your friends. The DVD itself is better than an hour in length, and the book is well apportioned with color pictures. In addition to the transcript of the demonstration itself, there are additional notations.<br /><br />Where this DemLab volume really stands out is the DVD presentation. The final 15 minutes during the flogging of Adam show that, when the chemistry is right, even \\"The Basics\\" can go farther and into deeper territory that you plan on. Suffice to say that things between Mr. Bean and Adam get intense, and the crowd certainly got more than it came for.<br /><br />With a Volume One utilizing Mr. Bean's skills in the mummification arena already available and future releases promising ropeplay, fireplay, spanking and more, the DemLab series already looks like an essential series in the making. All in all, Volumes One and Two are a great way to introduce yourself to some spicier aspects of interpersonal play, and good for the adult entertainment value.	2005-04-20

His vision of men echoes that of the late Tom Of Finland, in that enormously exaggerated physiques with outrageously proportioned genitalia threaten or face peril on every page. Fluids spew, sweat flies, lips leer. This is danger in pen and ink.<br /><br />But there is something else at work here. Collected among the more than 100 images are perilous situations and the men are frequently at the edge in their playing, but The Hun's work often carries a wickedly subversive sense of humor. If you read the captions on the \\"walls\\" of some of these drawings, you'll find a delightfully (and I mean this in the most complimentary of fashions) sick mind at work, with a host of bad puns and backwoods humor. It makes for some strange juxtapositions in a book filled with so many images of terror and pain.<br /><br />Probably one of the most exciting things about The Hun's work is that it runs right up against taboo items and slams into them with no holds barred. There are scenes here that will cause you to question exactly why these images stimulate you, because they are most certainly NOT politically correct. If The Hun can keep you at the edge of your seat now, as he has through four decades, then you know exactly why \\"Fetishes And Fetters\\" is such an essential, must have book.	2005-01-30

This book gives vent to the deepest and darkest of fantasies, hard men in exaggerated bodies that act in ways that are both thrilling and dangerous. The Hun prefers his work brutal and fluid spewing, hardly what one would call safe. But it can make one safely hard. Throughout this book, you are never more than a couple of pages away from men in peril, a face in agonized sweaty fear or sadistic tormentive glee.<br /><br />Even the non-sexual pages of The Hun's art carries the most threatening of images. There are two separate images of heavily muscled and masked executioners to taunt you if your fantasies run in that direction. Depictions of prisoners (be they in a war camp or the old west) abound.

The brief opener, \\"Mahu On Front Street,\\" is barely even a sex story as much as it is an eight page exposition detailing outsiders and insiders, and how we view each other. From there, the stories progress from the splendor of a chance meeting to the evocative tale of a gay father who satisfies his curiosity as pertaining to his own son's fascination with dominance and submission.<br /><br />But those three brief themes are just the prelude to \\"Trouble In Paradise's\\" thunderous main event, \\"Aloha Rusty.\\" Returning to the early theme of insiders and outsiders, Barry, a California Lawyer travels to Hawaii and confronts long repressed desires and his own fear of a past that he could never exorcise. At the same time, the lust over the ranch owner, Rusty, has clung to him for so long that all of his drives since childhood have been in service of bringing Barry to his paradise. Barry finds himself all but consumed by Rusty's slaves/employees, while Rusty struggles with the fears that Barry will reject decades of carefully constructed memories and wants. Not to mention that the sexual situations are incredibly torrid and steamy (after all, this book is a series of leather-sex stories).<br /><br />Both Barry and Russell skirt the separation of fantasy and reality as they dive headfirst into a Master-Rancher and his ranch hands' fantasy sequence that will certainly stiffen your imagination, but Mr. Bean also infuses his heat with emotion. Through all the stories in \\"Trouble In Paradise,\\" you'll feel the real emotions invested in the main characters, and the visual details of cruising gay (and kinky) Hawaii. This will be a book that you'll be able to travel back to.y (and kinky) Hawaii. This will be a book that you'll be able to travel back to.	2005-01-09

In \\"Excerpts From The Ring Cycle,\\" Tim Barela's third collection from his \\"Leonard and Larry\\" strips, he proves that he has the wit and natural humor that can carry strong stories and the positive gay images in his characters. Unlike the usual m4m stereotypes, we see our heroes tackling the day to day life of real men.<br /><br />But more that in any other of the four Leonard and Larry books, \\"Ring Cycle\\" goes into flights of fancy that make me wish some adventurous animator would get on board and take a stab at shining some of these stories to the silver screen. I want to see the ghosts of Brahms and Tchaikovsky haunt cowboy soap opera star Merle, and watch the saga of classical musical stalker Fiona Birkenstock as she pursues violinist Robert Mendez in a relentless effort to make him her boyfriend.<br /><br />And the finale could be just like in the book, as poor Larry suffers through the mental morass of being in the hospital the night his ex-wife AND lesbian-friend-impregnated-by-his-son are both on the verge of giving birth. It would be any middle aged man's nightmare and a screenwriter's wet dream. Best of all, for the reader that has a copy of \\"Excerpts From The Ring Cycle,\\" he or she will already have had ample opportunity to laugh numerous times through these convoluted comic tales.<br /><br />Tim Barela has four anthologies of Leonard and Larry comics on the stands.

Not just for gay men, but for members of your family. I have given so many copies of \\"Domesticity Isn't Pretty\\" to friends and family members that I have lost count. It deals with the reality of gay couples, with humor and a realistic touch, so lacking in many gay author's work. Besides, once you give them \\"Domesticity Isn't Pretty,\\" you can bet they'll seek out Tim Barela's three other Leonard and Larry books, as well!<br /><br />Leonard Goldman is an architect. Larry Evans runs a Leather Store on Santa Monica Boulevard. Together, they deal with marriage, divorce, children, childbirth of grandchildren, the fact that a son may be gay, and who stole the cookies. Well, maybe the cookies aren't the most typical dilemma in anyone's family, but these men feel real, like neighbors.<br /><br />When Larry's son David makes a very public coming out at his local high school prom, it completely unsettles his fatherhood expectations. Given that Larry, a gay man, is as rattled by the discovery that his offspring is gay makes him just like the rest of us. He's not a Super Human, he's just an Every Dad. Larry must suddenly face a reality that he takes for granted in his everyday life, and it's revelatory to come from a gay book.<br /><br />One of the other fun things about this volume is that you get to watch the evolution of Leonard and Larry from being side characters in Barela's other strips to the heroes of their own. The introduction by Andy Mangles chronicles Tim's early strips for biker magazines, and how Tim came to terms then eventually came out through his art. Reading about Barela's growth and self realization parallels the growths of Leonard and Larry, making the stories all the more essential and commonplace to gays and lesbians everywhere. Maybe \\"Domesticity Isn't Pretty,\\" but it sure is realistic. Funny, too. Get this! Get two. Spread the Leonard and Larry world.	2004-12-07

Then again, any person who followed Leonard Goldman and Larry Evans through their decade long run in Frontiers magazine could have told you that. Yet, if you had to show a gay comic to any members of your straight family, how many do you think would \\"get it\\"? Leonard and Larry often make their point without being so \\"out\\" as to miss their target, and that is what marks Barela's true strength as a humorist/artist. Where most gay comics tend to be overtly clever excuses for all things pink and triangular, Leonard and Larry could be a humor story about any pair of American Marrieds. These two characters have more depth than most TV sitcoms, and indeed, it is Barela's infusion of dimensionality and warmth into all his characters that makes this series so memorable.<br /><br />In \\"Kurt Cobain and Mozart Are Both Dead,\\" the humor has as much grounding in real life as any TV script; Leonard and Larry have an near marriage breakup, Jim and Merle have a spat over the too zealous female, and in this book's best sequence, Larry's near death experience during the birth of his daughter in-law Debbie's second child. The morphing of the angel should be required reading for every 700 Club viewer who threw money at their TV screen every time Pat Robertson spewed an (anti) family values rant at them.<br /><br />That Barela has his characters make their points about gay life without having to toss in the bubble butt tight jeans clone or the limp wristed disco bunny is testimony to the ongoing brilliance of the Leonard and Larry story boards. These two gents are men behaving normally, they just happen to be gay. Can you name any gay entertainment medium that utilizes more stable monogamous relationships?

As their lives continue, Larry Evans and Leonard Goldman face day to day situations like most middle aged marrieds. The kitchen needs remodeling. The grandkids need a bedtime story. The son needs a new apartment. The neighbors are getting nosy. The crucial difference is that Leonard and Larry are a happily committed gay couple in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The typical nature of Barela's storylines is part of the brilliance of all his books. Borrowing liberally from 50's and 60's sitcom humor but remaining stunningly of the day, Leonard and Larry could be the American any-couple next door. They have friends that kvetch over the relatives, fight midlife flab and try to do right by their families. At the same time, they also have to deal with what many gay couples in America go through every day; homophobia, job discrimination and trying to protect their children (be they adopted or from previous marriages) from a world that eyes them with suspicion or hatred. Every so often, a panel with poignancy will leap from the page and strike you, as does the one single strip that mentions 9/11.<br /><br />That is not to say that Barela's terrific sense of humor isn't splashed liberally throughout \\"How Real Men Do It.\\" The travails of soap opera star Merle Oberon and his quest to save his failing TV show, and Larry's obsession with Bruce, the house repairman, are probably the funniest series in \\"How Real Men Do It.\\" Leonard and Larry remaining a refreshing alternative to the twinky obsessed standard gay literary fare. \\"How Real Men Do it\\" shows you who the real men are -- real men have beards and may just be celebrating 50. It makes each of Tim Barela's four books national treasures.	2004-12-03

That Davolt's a sharp wit with as much affection as bite, and you'll find plenty to like.<br /><br />In \\"Painfully Obvious,\\" Davolt gathers 40 essays and runs the topical gamut from why leather matters to how to be a better citizen while still wearing cowhide. While Davolt's credentials are obvious (he turned the lights out at the legendary Drummer Magazine), it is his knowledge of history and literature outside the leather world that make this a better than average read. In fact, one of the best columns of the book is Davolt articulating his thoughts on the demise of Drummer, with thoughtfulness and nary a trace of bitterness.<br /><br />A couple words of warning. If you're looking for hard handed reading, this is NOT a book of fiction. \\"Painfully Obvious\\" certainly is preaching to the perverted, and I suspect some of the essays may be tough going for the uninitiated. The number of Davolt's essays on contests is a little top-heavy, but for good reason: his background in the contest world, putting them on and competing in a couple for the better part of a decade. If you already know a little about the community and its participants (or way too much for your own good), \\"Painfully Obvious\\" will achieve one of Davolt's stated goals: it will make you smile.<br /><br />Sadly, we lost Robert to Cancer in the Spring of 2005.	2004-11-17

Just when you think things can't get any more disgusting, gross or tragic, the Generation Swine that is Motley Crue finds something more outrageous and depraved. \\"The Dirt\\" is rock history with fungus unscraped. From their beginnings as basically a teenage rock band as street thugs, the four members of Motley Crue describe in distinct detail how they drugged themselves to the top of the 80's glam metal heap.<br /><br />What keeps \\"The Dirt\\" from turning into rock, dope, record, repeat is that Neil Strauss has the good sense to get quips from managers, record execs, producers and others that passed through the Motley Crue mangler. It helps provide alternate voices to the self absorbed shenanigans that the band parades through on page after page. It sometimes gets hard to believe that these guys didn't catch something really dirty. (Robbin Crosby of Ratt is frequently mentioned in \\"The Dirt\\" as a Crue party pal. He succumbed to AIDS in 2002, likely catching it from the needles he used to shoot up Heroin.)<br /><br />Lest you think that \\"The Dirt\\" is a totally egocentric slimeglide, you also get to catch glimpses of humanity in the human wreckage inside the band. Vince Neil gives the book an emotional grounding when he describes the agony of watching his 4 year old daughter, Skylar, succumb to cancer. You begin to understand why Nikki was just rebelling against everything as a response to his childhood abandonment. It hardly excuses their rampant antisocial behavior, but it does make for a page turner of a rock book.<br /><br />Just don't pick this up if you're in the least bit prudish. You'll never think of 80's Hair Bands the same way again.	2004-11-02

Some hack writer grabs a stack of promotional blurble and interview pull-quotes together, then rushes a volume out. Often without even nominal assistance of the artist involved, these books are the equivalent of pulp junk food, aimed squarely at the fan for whom even a tiny scrap of information is like sugar. They are also usually dumped into the market place long after the band has become successful, so the quotes are practiced and edited as to present their topics in the best light (or not, depending on the author's agenda). We will also not discuss the fact that most of these books are thrown together by people that simply can't write to save their word processing arses.<br /><br />Not so with \\"Amp'd.\\" Dr. Gary Fincke is a Professor of English at a college in central Pennsylvania, a published poet, and story teller. He also loves rock with the passion of most adolescents. So when his guitarist son Aaron began playing guitar and being serious about it, Dad began writing about his kid the musician. As it turns out, Aaron is one of the lucky talents. His band, \\"Strangers With Candy,\\" won a nationally televised MTV contest, morphed into Lifer and released [[ASIN:B00005N8YP Lifer]]. Like most bands in the music business world, they discover that getting a record out is not the key to the kingdom, but then Aaron joins Breaking Benjamin, and lightning struck twice. Breaking Benjamin got signed to Hollywood Records and now have three great rock albums out, \\"[[ASIN:B00006GF9L Saturate]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B0002A2VS2 We Are Not Alone]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000G6BL7E Phobia]].\\"<br /><br />Like most bands and musicians, Aaron finds himself being first a local star, then trying to climb the ladder to bigger things. The difference between \\"Amp'd\\" and other books about rock bands is there is a minimum of hyperbole involved. Dr Fincke watches from the sidelines as his son plays dive clubs, weird local festivals where I'm sure shouts of \\"Freebird!\\" were more to the norm than a bunch of young and aggressive year 2000 rockers would be, and venues that, as Senior Fincke describes them, have fewer sinks and toilets than his house. It's that kind of attention to detail that makes you really (and I know it's an overused phrase) feel like you're right their with him and the bands Aaron becomes involved in.<br /><br />Perhaps the freshest thing about \\"Amp'd\\" is that it isn't an \\"insiders\\" view of the music industry, where people that have been working the same deals and scams for years on end try to act like they haven't already been there and done that. Nor is it a disconnected outsider doing emotionless research. It is obvious that Aaron loves making music and Dr. Fincke is equally fascinated by the process. Some of the book's best moments are when Dr Fincke tries to persuade his University colleagues to listen or watch some of Aaron's work, then describes their reactions. These range from mild enthusiasm to utter disdain.<br /><br />There is also a strong message here in the amount of support that Dr. Fincke and his family invests in Aaron. Where most parents are probably yelling down to the basement to \\"turn it down,\\" you'll discover that Aaron's family kicked in with money for T-shirts and early CD demos. \\"Amp'd\\" is a great read, a fine journal of the creative process and a testament to a family's willingness to let their children explore their creativity. Even if you don't like hard rock, you should be reading \\"Amp'd.\\"d!\\" were more to the norm than a bunch of young and aggressive year 2000 rockers would be, and venues that, as Senior Fincke describes them, have fewer sinks and toilets than his house.

Nope...I see this book more an indictment of ego than of liberalism. You see, Goldberg was right up there with those elitists that he is now so quick to skewer, and played the same games they did. There is more than a whiff of vindictive jealousy in \\"Arrogence,\\" which is ultimately what makes it a non-essential volume.

This is the kind of book that makes hash out of the self aggrandizing clods that Franken so obviously relishes lampooning. \\"Lies...\\" is at it's best when Al and \\"Team Franken\\" research blatant indiscretions and calls the baddies (Fox News, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, \\"The O'Reilly Factor,\\" etc) to the carpet for playing off such obvious distortions. When the book stays on that course, it's nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />On the other hand, I guess there's that little leftover smug humor streak from \\"Saturday Night Live\\" that forces you to sit through such wretchedly unfunny chapters like \\"Supply Side Jesus\\" or \\"Operation Chicken Hawk,\\" where Franken envisions George Bush as a trigger happy coward and Rush Limbaugh as a loose boweled wuss. It distracts from the core argument that these men trash Kerry's war service without having as much as stood in combat situations by tipping to the deeply offensive (much like Coulter's hideous column about the \\"Women of the Democratic Convention,\\" which got her kicked off the coverage bench by USA Today).<br /><br />Even with a couple of mis-fires, Franken is at his best here. For instance, Chapter 17, \\"Our National Dialogue on Terrorism\\" is barely a page long but cuts to the core as well as any other chapter in the book. Had the satirical bits in \\"Lies...\\" held that tone, this would be a five star rating. And just as I call this a 4 star book, this is an important read. Knowing that there are people in the current regime who gleefully plot the undermining of genuine hardworking Government officials like Max Cleland or knowingly savage the reputations of the late Paul Wellstone and his colleagues for personal gain deserve to be ridiculed in the manner that Franken unleashes on them here. Most important, the fact checking is something that makes you wonder why our major networks can't uncover even the simple lies that spew forth nightly, when Franken and a bunch of college kids could.<br /><br />There are other things to be noted here, like Franken's fun trip to Bob Jones University, the personal emotion vested in the chapters concerning the late Paul Wellstone, and the short but slicing chapter about Barbara Bush. \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them\\" may not always be on the right track, but it has two things over almost every other book on the current Political shelf. \\"Lies..\\" gets its facts straight and its heart is in the right place.s fun trip to Bob Jones University, the personal emotion vested in the chapters concerning the late Paul Wellstone, and the short but slicing chapter about Barbara Bush. \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them\\" may not always be on the right track, but it has two things over almost every other book on the current Political shelf. \\"Lies..\\" gets its facts straight and its heart is in the right place.	2004-09-01

Vlengles' Revenge (A Boner Book)	Books	5	8	10	N	Y	Tales from the Darker Side	The second anthology from gay fetish author Tim Brough follows the same format as his first, \\"Black Gloves, White Magic.\\" \\"Sgt. Vlengles' Revenge\\" contains a dozen stories written for various magazines and websites over a ten year period, and cover a great deal of topics. But the difference is in that, this time, the stories are frequently darker and lengthier. The subtitle \\"And Other Abuses of Power\\" is not mere hyperbole.<br />The title story, for instance, twists and turns as Sgt. Vlengles meets up with a cadet whom, 18 years ago, managed to get him dismissed from his post as a State Police Academy superintendent. In a session that goes horribly wrong, the participants each discover that revenge may not be so sweet. This kind of psychological bending goes on through the Truth or Dare challenge of \\"I Remember The Air Raid Sirens.\\" The characters are more inclined to be authority figures than before, and the power exchanges described lean toward the way men exercise that kind of authority.<br />Not like everything in \\"Sgt. Vlengles' Revenge\\" is enveloped in darkness. As the author describes in a brief explanation before one the pieces, a satirical article written for the Sandmutopian Guardian magazine, that \\"the best leather jackets are carved from the sacred cow.\\" The following piece, \\"There's No Such Thing As A Pushy Bottom,\\" takes the wind out some of the biggest sails in the community and -- again as Tim puts it -- makes the story a \\"true abuse of power.\\"<br />There are also two stories that get at many of the deeper issues involved in relationships, they are \\"The Butch God Trilogy\\" and \\"To Explode In Beauty,\\" where the characters explore what exactly draws them to these encounters and, most importantly, what makes them feel complete about being there. For both \\"Black Gloves, White Magic\\" and \\"Sgt. Vlengles' Revenge,\\" it is the author's understanding of those who participate that make many of his stories such satisfying reads.	2004-07-04

The centerpiece of the weekend is the International Mister Leather contest, in which men from around the world compete for the chance to promote the Leather Lifestyle (among other activities).<br />But it wasn't always like this. In a book that is destined to take a place next to Mark Thompson's \\"LeatherFolk\\" and Geoff Mains' \\"Urban Aboriginals,\\" \\"25 Years Of Champions\\" chronicles the humble beginnings of IML in 1979 (12 contestants from 6 states) to the extravagant pageant that it is today. In 2003, over a dozen men from countries other than the United States flew to Chicago for the chance to represent their nations. So as you would expect, this is the kind of book that is laden with imagery of Homomasculinity at its hottest, with pictures documenting every year of International Mr. Leather.<br />But once again, I have to repeat. \\"25 Years Of Champions\\" is much more than a tableaux of hot men in leather. Each year is given a historical -- and gay slanted -- perspective, with everything from Jack Fritscher's coining the term \\"Homomasculine\\" for an article in Drummer Magazine while reporting on the 1979 IML contest, to the rise of AIDS and its effect on the gay community, to world and American politics. Prominent gay figures give their reflections of IML's they attended, competed in or contributed to, with everyone from International Mr. Leather founder Chuck Renslow commenting on how the contests evolved -- to Bootblack Marc Peurye's prideful reminiscence on getting the Mr. Bootblack Competition to arise from a \\"service to IML package holders\\" to a recognized and organized part of the weekend experience.<br />There are also a few surprises to be found. The Village People once performed (unannounced) as the contest's featured act. Comedian Judy Tenuta has been a frequent MC (once having to cancel to appear on David Lettermen!) The Reverend Troy Perry, founder of the Metropolitan Community Churches has frequently been an IML judge (and contributes one of the book's memorable segments).<br />Compiler Joseph Bean and a host of contributors have created a grand history of this culture of leather in this magnificent, 200 plus page book.

Conventional books in the lifestyle usually end up in treachery or deceit, with some shadowy figure from the protagonist's past showing up to commit mayhem or creating dangerous and life threatening situations. But \\"The Wings Of Icarus\\" shatters those stereotypes. At its heart of hearts, it is, shockingly, a romantic novel. Not only that, a romantic novel where aspects of the heart come ahead of the kink and the bondage.<br />A family of men take in a fourth, a wandering stranger named Andy O'Shaunsey, and teach him about caring and commitment. On its original release, I considered \\"The Wings Of Icarus\\" a benchmark book, a mainstream gay novel that incorporated Leathersex just as lovingly as most other genres would scandalize it. It's a turnover of every foundation for SM Novels of the last few decades (save David Stein's \\"Swept Away\\"), tossing out the rule that states that men discover the magic of Leather Lifestyle only through brutality or some other sinister contrivance.<br />What Daddy Bob has arrived at is something must other Leathermen don't have the guts to write about, and that is love. Four men who depend on each other for spiritual protection as opposed to protection from evil. These men must struggle psychically to maintain a level headed acceptance of the doors open before them. To that end, one can barely call \\"The Wings Of Icarus\\" an SM novel. At its core, it's a romantic novel. A romance where bondage is just part of the trust, the sight of a cross means a vision of what is holy and not just a thing to be restrained to. \\"The Wings Of Icarus\\" is a book that will help many understand the warmth and humanity that many of us in the lifestyle honestly feel.	2003-12-02

I was never a fan of John Preston's \\"classic\\" work because I thought the characters were broad and unrealistic, the situations silly and the stereotypes contemptible. Like most fantasy books about D/s relationships, the main characters seem completely removed from life as we know it. What about the usual day to day, like jobs and family? Cleaning the catbox? Laundry? Cooking? The kind of things that real Dominant and submissives do in real time?<br />Enter Master Terry Andrews and submissive/potential slave Matt Stone. One night, after a very hot encounter, these two men begin a courtship by collar. Terry begins to look at a bottom he considered a gadabout player in a whole new light, and Matt begins a journey in which he has to understand what his urges mean and if they are true to him. Where in most stories, these issues would resolve inside a chapter or two, for \\"Carried Away\\" the characters each have to probe what their instincts demand. What will this kind of relationship do to their lives, and not just a fast lane romp, but for a long-term future?<br />For those reasons alone, \\"Carried Away\\" would set itself apart from the pack. Yet there's more. Author david stein infuses the novel with rich detail of the New York scene and the social activities that the city entertains. You get a well fleshed out background for the how and whys of Matt and Terry's actions and emotions. This is a novel in the old fashioned sense; a lengthy story with a well plotted sequence of events. And make sure you remember that this isn't a sex novel as much it's a heavily romantic novel which incorporates sex. Lots of sex. To the point that it becomes one of \\"Carried Away's\\" foreground characters instead of a background activity. After all, this is a leather love story.<br />The backgrounds themselves are described in the matter a masculine bottom would see them and not like an interior decorator. The words daub the spaces with color and detail without distracting from the plot, something usually missing in homomasculine writing. Mr. stein obviously loves these words. Everything from the steaming heat to the emotional tumult is given equal ebb and flow in \\"Carried Away.\\" Not a phrase is wasted or situation shorted. Threads woven into the story come to realistic conclusions. And it's very important to note that in \\"Carried Away\\" nothing seems implausible. Not the sex, the kink, or the emotions of the main characters. I'll grant you that this kind of attention to detail makes for a hefty volume (this is no quickie read or any sort of flick-through book), but when was the last time you had a modern leather story that could satisfy both your lower gonads, frontal lobes and central heart in equal parts?<br />David Stein has gifted us with the most realistic, imaginative, and thoughtful Gay Erotic Leather novel that I have ever read.

I'll grant you that this kind of attention to detail makes for a hefty volume (this is no quickie read or any sort of flick-through book), but when was the last time you had a modern leather story that could satisfy both your lower gonads, frontal lobes and central heart in equal parts? <br />David Stein has gifted us with the most realistic, imaginative, and thoughtful Gay Erotic Leather novel that I have ever read. It may have taken him ten years to complete, but the literary bar has been \\"Carried\\" to a higher level.	2003-10-31
US	34639163	R3L6LCOLWDVXZW	1562013475	115720769	Sacred Exchange	Books	4	10	13	N	N	Worth your time and money	Despite the review ahead of this, \\"Sacred Exchange\\" is a thoughtful collection of stories that deal with both the transcendental and the sexy. While there may be those that are looking for random gropes in the dark and hackneyed descriptions of body parts grinding against each other, the 22 stories of \\"Sacred Exchange\\" are in it for more than just the flesh.<br />The book's opener, \\"Come For Me, Dark Man,\\" invokes not just a carnal image, but one of deep southern blues. A bored housewife/widow encounters a mysterious guitar playing minstrel and falls under his powerful spell. \\"Living In Hell\\" tales the sad story of a space traveler who discovers his soul mate is an alien, who (to both their dismays) can't be a complete being without the human. \\"F*wise\\" follows a pair of cybernauts as they fumble their way into a real life encounter. And \\"The Most Important Right Now\\" features a dungeon master as he works his way through the frustration of no longer being able to relate to the journey he takes his companions on.<br />This may not be everybody's cup of tea, but it does have more than the usual \\"And then s/he\\" mindless bump and grinds. Keep in mind that the subtitle is \\"Stories of Spirituality and Transcendence in Dominance and Submission\\" and be prepared for a much deeper experience.	2003-10-29

Perspectives into the Erotic Care & Training of the Human Dog (Boner Books)	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Bow wow...WOW	Like many men in the world of..., you never, quite realize what you're missing until someone lays it out in front of your nose. Michael Daniels has achieved that in \\"WOOF!\\" - allowing for some serious insights into a scene that many may have glimpsed only from the periphery, thinking there was little else to it than costumes and juvenile role paying. He gives the dog play world a fully fleshed out manifesto filled with depth and heart, as well as thoroughly documented detail. (Also some wonderful bits of artwork and a bonus short story at the...ahem...tail end the the book.) If you have ever wondered what it would take to unleash your inner species, then \\"WOOF!\\" will open the doors in a way none other before it could.	2003-09-14

Let's get all the cliches out of the way first. \\"The Family Jewels\\" is a gem. It is precise, finely cut to spec and invaluable. In fact, the first time I laid eyes on it, my first thought was, why didn't anyone think of this before?<br />Hardy Haberman has filled a void in the SM literary canon that not only give tips to the experienced edge player, but to beginners as well. There are also a few chunks of anecdotal scene evidence to add the touch of hard-on reading that any book of this nature needs to keep the entertainment value at a maximum.<br /><br />You may not be familiar with Mr. Haberman, who considers himself a \\"Pain Technologist.\\" He specializes in CBT and has an unusual fondness for clips, clamps and clothespins, as well as more exotic SM play. I recommend this book to anyone with even a passing interest in learning about esoteric genital play.	2003-04-10
US	34639163	R3O1AKAFCZH6UF	1890834300	661943720	Titanic: Forbidden Stories Hollywood Forgot and Other Gay Canon Stories of Gay History, Queer Culture, Leather, Bearotica, and Gay Studies, with an Erotic Screenplay	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Float This!	\\"Love And Slumming.\\" Okay, that about wraps this one up. Or how's about: \\"Now I know why handguns should be outlawed.\\"<br />This is the fourth collection of Jack Fritscher's short stories, collected from three decades of sensual erotica. But perhaps this time, more than in any other of the collections, \\"Titanic\\" displays his razor sharp wit. The temptation to just list line after memorable line in this batch of stories is tough to resist.<br /><br />Tied loosely together by a Hollywood concept, \\"Titanic\\" is also something else that many never expect from a collection of Fritscher's magazine work. There is very little leathersex involved here. Plenty of man on man horseplay, more than a few uncircumcised folks (the book could just as easily been subtitled Memories Of Headcheese) and lots of hypermasculine images, but the ropes and the dungeons are pretty much kept locked in the projection booth. That doesn't make the pieces any less wild, in fact, it enhances the craziness of a story like \\"CBGB 1977\\" and reminds you that the 70's in New York weren't all boogie nights at Studio 54.<br />Yes, the sex is fast and dirty, and often, funny. Funny in a way that suggests whimsy, which is pretty much a lost art in American humor, where a fart joke is easier to insert than a set up for a pattern of good belly laughs. To have a starlet so shamelessly exploit her he-she sexiness (in \\"Aqua-Nymph\\") will make many squirm in the fact that they're becoming more than a little female icon worshipping suckler, all while looking for Fritscher's usual cask of rough players. Think Bette Davis. Or even Cher. Not leather. Glitter. ...<br />OKAY! You want the nasty? Read \\"Buck's Bunkhouse Discipline: The Screenplay.\\" (You thought no-one concerned themselves about porn film plotting!) \\"Three Bears In A Tub,\\" which attempts to answer the question of how much sex can you fit into a single sentence. It's a gasping run-on of he-men in the wild for reel men in the big screen world. There's not a story here among \\"Titanic's\\" dozen that won't leave you with a 16cc smile. I'll indulge myself with one more Jack Fritscher quote to close this review: \\"Most people prefer masculine men...masculine in the best sense, not macho in the worst.\\"tory here among \\"Titanic's\\" dozen that won't leave you with a 16cc smile.

US	34639163	R1RVM9ROT0C45O	1890834289	440622999	Rainbow County and Other Stories	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A Five Star Bedside Read	You could read through all 12 of the selections and never guess they were written by the same man. The going is rough and rugged in \\"Rainbow County,\\" one of the many anthologies of Jack Fritscher's work. I will pay a very high compliment to \\"RoughNight@sodom.com.\\" This story shocked me so much that I had to put the book down and catch my breath. I won't give the details, but you'll never again think of [certain phrases] in the same light after reading this story.<br />At the same time, the over the top brutality of \\"RoughNight\\" rests in such a sharp comparison to the book's titular story, that Frtischer's genius as an erotic writer is stunning. On one hand, you have a William Gibson/James Cameron sadistic future gone berserk, on the other, a slow, brutal, circling of wolves. It's sadistic without a single blow being struck, frightening without a single threat uttered, and tensely sexual in a manner that echoes \\"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?.\\" Two men locked in a dance around the other, a barber from the old days of San Francisco and a rough young buck on his mission to find the face of God. There are no razors, but each cuts the other, penetration but no rape. Just long slow sexual burn.<br />That story, like this book, encapsulates masculine writing in a timeless form. A far cry from most hard core SM writing that loses itself in meaningless genital tossing and faceless back alley crotch mauling. Allow yourself the time to read, absorb and savor each of these stories. From the startling wartime cruelty that opens the book with a torturous breaking of \\"The Shadow Soldiers,\\" to the final Eros of \\"Sleep In Heavenly Peace,\\" this is too fine a vintage to pilfer away quickly.	2003-02-26
