So, keeping that in mind, I was waiting for the author to start in with the talk about God's will and the Christian Empire, etc.  Instead, this book self-consciously tells a story from the American Revolution not from the point of view of \\"patriots,\\" per se, but a specific point of view of refugee families.  My daughter sat rivetted to her seat while I read aloud from this book.  From the standpoint of a literary critic, yes, it is silly how the characters face catastrophe after catastrophe, but considering the book's audience, I do not think it was ridiculous for the book's author to show some of the many real catastrophes that did befall these refugees in Pennsylvania who were driven into the swamp and the mountains without adequate food or supplies by invading armies. <br /> <br />This book is great for trying to put yourself in the shoes of the people who are displaced by war.  Bonnie Pryor did a good job, I think, of evoking the terror of the people in the fort whose fate seemed to be entirely in the hands of the invading army, who might kill them or not.  This is a great story for discussing contemporary white perceptions of Native Americans, who are portrayed as \\"savages\\" in keeping with the telling of the story from a 18th century white perspective.  Thomas and his family are terrorized by thoughts of their murder at the hands of the Indians, understandably so.  Pryor does not fall back on telling us this was a necessary war, as in, \\"but in the end, it was all worth it.\\"  Halfway through the story, the character of the mother is shown having abandoned her attachment to any political ideology in her attempts to create a plan to saves the lives of her children.  When she tells Thomas that they will seek refuge with her sister in Philadelphia, Thomas declares, \\"I won't live with Tories.\\"  His mother replies, \\"We have noplace else to go.\\"	2005-02-19

To me, as an adult, I find her story difficult to read because her storytelling style is so dry.  I also had a hard time figuring out what was going on at points, even though I am familiar with the geography and time period.    Dr. Drake, one of the most prominent adult characters in the story, is based on a real historical figure... I guess that's why they call it \\"historic fiction,\\" eh?  This book may be of interest to kids who live in the Ohio Valley (like I do) and find themselves in the 21st century subject to the whims of the river.  Reference to familiar geography, like the mounds and street names, may also create interest for young local history buffs, especially those who are interested in geneology.    I  recommend this story for Christian families.  I found the emphasis on church and Christian values to be in keeping with the time period of the story, but the speeches that Dr. Drake and others make on \\"American\\" values, as in \\"We live in the greatest country in the world because we are free (pg 60)\\" are not.  Is Ms. Jones suffering from such deep cultural amnesia that she fails to recognize that in 1832, Cincinnati was directly across the river from Kentucky- a SLAVE state?  Certainly, that fact was not lost on the people of the time, and so in that sense, I find these references to \\"freedom\\" deeply troubling.  I expect that they are profoundly offensive to the decendents of slaves. Even if you are just talking about religious freedom, early America was rife with religious discrimination.  Why not ask a Catholic or a Jew?  Blacks were frequently persecuted for attempting to have any public worship AT ALL, but especially in the South, since Black Christian ministers tended to emphasis Exodus (can you guess why).  Native American peoples were even executed by U.S. government officials for ignoring laws that were passed to prohibit them from performing religious rituals.  Freedom of religion, although it is an ideal espoused in the First Amendment, was not a reality for many, many Americans in the 19th Century.    Furthermore, citizens of Cincinnati did not go around talking about their \\"American\\" identity in 1832.  At that time, people were much more likely to identify with their state than with an overarching \\"American\\" identity.  That idea will not come until much later, after the Civil War, and so here, too, the author fails to provide a historically accurate picture of what people were thinking way back when.      If you are a kid and are interested in reading historical stories from this time period in this part of the country, allow me to recommend you read Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe first.	2005-02-07

Now is 2005, so this book is four years old.

Obviously, it doesn't include anything that's been published in the last four years, so in that sense, it's utility can be limiting, but most of the books that are reviewed are still in print.  One of the book's features that I appreciated the most was that it includes a bibliography of wordless books, and unlike other such lists I have found, most of the books are actually in print and I don't have to try to order a copy from some small press overseas.   <br /> <br />Another thing I've used this book for is for suggestions for birthday presents for my nieces.

The layouts in this volume are very poor compared to those in the regular Trading Spaces books that correspond to the adult show. <br /> <br />The text is unreadable...\\"Garrett's current room is way out of bounds.  Definitely lacking the alley-oop to make a slam dunk of his digs (pg 30).\\" <br /> <br />The other major problem I have with this book is that it's simply not useful to kids who have a serious interest in interior design.  Page 2 says that \\"Stuff you will not need\\" to do the projects in the book are \\"lots of time, lots of money, lots of professionals,\\" yet most of the major design elements in the book require the use of power tools and serious carpentry.

This woman plagues me. <br /> <br />This history is so horrible, I don't even know if I can tell you how bad it is.  One of the things that bothers me about it is that this is an American perspective on history, that is, Schonberg presents the events that she thinks are relevant to Americans, as opposed to Ohioans.  The book mostly reads like a really poorly done book on American History with a photograph of the &$%#*! bicentennial barns thrown in.  The high point of the book is perhaps the section called \\"Growth of Industry, 1850-1900,\\" which is all about inventors and millionaire industrialists.

On page 6, we read, \\"U.S. forces destroyed many Iraqi tanks.\\"  No mention of what happened to the people who were inside the tanks when they were \\"destroyed.\\"  Page 9 tells us, \\"Army members perform many duties,\\" but it does not tell us that one of the \\"duties\\" that the Army performs is killing people.  I guess I can add to that that the book is also written from a pro-genocide perspective since page 12 tells us that \\"...the Army helped protect settlers from American Indian attacks.\\" <br /> <br />Probably what is more relevant is what this book doesn't say.  Chapter 3 discusses the Army's role in Iraq and Somalia in the 1990s, yet fails to mention what miserable failures these wars were for the United States.

(\\"1621 Pilgrims celebrate first Thanksgiving with Indians at Plymouth, Massachusetts, 1991: Movie Dances With Wolves engages millions of Americans in the historical plight of the Indians' treatment by US government\\").  Are these the events that Indians would put on a timeline of their own history?    I am surprised that SLJ calls this book fair and objective.  The term \\"squaw\\" is used throughout the history whenever the author is referring to a woman, and men are \\"braves.\\"  Throughout the book, Indians are blamed for their own deaths, and whites are portrayed as their wise protectors.  Indians died because they were stupid or greedy.  To me, it was a little like Jerry Falwell or whoever it was saying that gay people got AIDS because they were sinners.

The prize-winning pumpkin at the Circleville Pumpkin Festival weighed 935 pounds!  Golly! <br /> <br />At the end of the book, right before we are subjected to a truly horrible map, we get to learn the history of the USS Ohio, a Trident nuclear submarine.  This vessel, I learn, \\"has been equipped with the most modern weapons and will help protect the United States,\\" as it patrols the OCEANS.  For those of you who didn't do so well in geography class, Ohio is smack dab in the middle of the North American continent.  There are no oceans here.  Tell me why libraries continue to purchase these horrendous books for their collections.	2005-02-02

This book gravely insults Ireland's Celtic heritage.  The author and editor present the festivals of Ireland like they are Catholics talking to other Catholics. What about the rest of us may not actually believe that St. Patrick \\"performed...even a few miracles (pg 17)!\\"  Really, now. Paganism, while mentioned, seems to exist only in the pre-Christian era.  Samhain is described as a holiday largely created by Pope Gregory IV.  Fundamentalist Christians will probably take umbrage with the fact that pagan festivals are even mentioned.  I smell a book burning!    If nothing else, the book provides on pages 6 and 7 a list of holidays that students may then research elsewhere.    The map on page 5 is excellent.	2005-01-30

For example, the legend of the shamrock is not very meaningful if you are not already acquainted with the trinity or Jesus or the Holy Spirit, etc.  This would definitely not be a book to use to teach anything about the Catholic faith to non-Catholic, non-Christian children, which is what I was hoping to use it for. <br /> <br />I like how dePaola has a section at the end for the legends of St. Patrick, separating these from the biography.  I was raised an Irish Catholic and I was hoping to be able to share some of that heritage with my own children through this book, but in the end, all of the miracles and mumbo jumbo are too hard to swallow.  My daughter was confused about which parts of the story were \\"real\\" and which were \\"for pretend.\\"  I think it was a little too much for her to choke down.  I had to try to explain to her what baptism is, but she just stared at me blankly.   <br /> <br />The illustrations are quite lovely, and I would recommend this book highly for all Catholic school libraries.	2005-01-30

She likes the repetition and the familiarity; however, the ending left a lot to be desired.  She was like, \\"Well, if you're not supposed to talk to strangers, then what about the woodcutter?  Did she know him from before, or is he a stranger, too?\\"  Then she asked me a million questions about why the grandmother wasn't covered with blood when the woodcutter chopped open the wolf. <br /> <br />I think that the illustrations in this book are only mediocre.

What shocks me is that she is actually interested in the storylines, since the text is like \\"Oh, Spot! Funny, funny Spot!\\"  It's the illustrations.  She loves the illustrations, and she is dying to find out what kind of hijinxs that Sally is going to get herself into next. <br /> <br />One of the major criticisms of the Dick and Jane series, beyond the phonics issue (which I could care less about...if she's reading, I'm happy), is that all the stories are geared toward white middle class kids in the \\"nuclear\\" family.  For some of the stories, I would definitely say that I can see how they would be alienating if you are not part of that very narrow slice of America where Father wears a suit to work everyday (if there even is a guy named \\"Father\\" living in your house who goes to work).  The fact that I am of European ancestry makes it difficult for me to know if my daughter wouldn't like these stories as much if we were Athabascan or Maori or Black, but, in general, the stories that only feature the children and the animal characters will probably be appealing to children of all classes, races and ethnic backgrounds. <br /> <br />I know that there are Dick and Jane stories from the later years of the series that do introduce nonwhite characters, but I haven't read any of those, and they are not featured in this volume.	2005-01-15

It's a good example of a seemingly \\"neutral\\" book about math is actually a powerful piece of propaganda.  If you look at the storyline critically, it's absurd.<br /><br />The family consists of a girl, her brother, mom and dad, and grandma.  The girl is trying to determine where they should go on vacation, and she uses charts to organize data about the family members' destination preferences.  There is no discussion beyond that of the actual decision-making process.  It is left for you to assume that the vacation was determined by the vote of a simple majority.<br /><br />Okay, let's examine that.  How do you decide in YOUR family about where to take a vacation?  I imagine that the first constraint would be either time or money: how much time you can get off work, when the kids have a vacation from school, and what you can afford to do in that period of time.  Murphy presents vacations as an entitlement, claiming \\"...cats need vacations, too.\\"  A cat needs a vacation?  Get real.<br /><br />I am bringing this up because by presenting the taking of vacations as \\"normal,\\"  we must ask how children whose families can little afford the rent, let alone a vacation, would interpret this message.  If these white peoples' cat deserves a vacation, yet they do not, does that mean that this society values them as being less than an animal?  Some more affluent family's pet?<br /><br />Sounds about right in a nation that spends billions of dollars every year on pet food while children go hungry, in a country where, in most states, child abuse carries a lighter criminal penalty than maligning a dog.<br /><br />Furthermore, are we to believe that household decisions involving the allocation of resources are put to a simple vote whereby all family members' wishes are given equal weight?  If things operated like that in our household, we would have bubble gum and cotton candy for dinner every night.  But if you are able to swallow this idea as a \\"normal\\" democracy, than you are more likely to buy into the huge lie that every vote is equally counted when it comes to, let's say, the presidential election in Ohio in 2004.  Or Florida in 2000.  The majority wins, and that's fair.  So we have an almost totally white Congress, and almost totally male Senate... you see how this works.  It's \\"democracy.\\"  But we know that's not how it really works.  Mom and Dad have all the money, therefore Mom and Dad make the decisions.  The children obey.ea as a \\"normal\\" democracy, than you are more likely to buy into the huge lie that every vote is equally counted when it comes to, let's say, the presidential election in Ohio in 2004.

It's good for me for teaching reading (even though the font is rather small) because she wants to read it over and over again.    My mother-in-law bought my daughter more books from this Barbie series for Christmas.  I think what is so attractive about these stories to little girls is that they role-play that they are Barbie, but they get to be Kelly, too.  Kelly is about preschool age, so  girls can imagine that they have this great imaginary older sister named Barbie, and what they would have Barbie say.      In these stories, Barbie is always patient and kind with Kelly.  For example, one of my daughter's favorite parts of this story is when Kelly asks Barbie if she can eat one of the Halloween cookies.  Barbie says, \\"You may take one.  But just one.\\"  The cookies are supposed to be for the party guests, but Barbie loves her little sister so much, that she lets her eat one of the cookies before the guests arrive.	2005-01-15

If you know a twelve-year-old kid who is a hardcore fan of The O'Reilly Factor, well, then I think this would make a good birthday present.  Otherwise, I have to say that this book is SERIOUSLY lacking in substance, not to mention boring.

Furthermore, this whole literary concept of reducing the world into us-against-them is not only childish, it teaches you to block out of peoples' points-of-view.  It also encourages creating a straw-man approach to everyone who does not agree with you, rather than finding out what they ACTUALLY think.	2005-01-12

Blevins did a great job introducing ME to teaching phonics.      As a homeschooling parent, I feel like I am bombarded with kits and programs that guarantee to teach reading through phonics, but it seems like a lot of these are not very useful stuff marketed by people who seem a lot more attached to political ideologies rather than the mechanics of what works.  By contrast, Blevins writes from the standpoint of an educator rather than an ideologue, which I appreciated.    I must admit, however, that I haven't come even close to following Blevins advice on teaching.  It's much too obtuse for our purposes, which is learning to read, simply put.	2005-01-12

Contains such gems of wisdom as, \\"Many individuals stay in poverty because they don't know there is a choice (p79).\\"  Payne contends that the poor \\"do without\\" when it comes to \\"believing in divine purpose and guidance (p 16),\\" as this is one of the defining characteristics of poverty. Poor people don't believe in God? And that's why they're poor? How very Protestant of you. It shocks me that these kind of \\"cultural\\" explanations for poverty, essentially blaming the victims, persist in the professional education literature years after they have ceased to be seriously considered within the social sciences.  I mean, come on!    It comes as no surprise to me that Payne's professional experience and case studies are in the context of the Houston Public Schools, from whence sprang Rod Paige, the Secretary of Education who told us that the Nea is a \\"terrorist organization.\\" Payne describes the spurious distinction between \\"situational\\" poverty and the so-called \\"generationally\\" poor, for whom poverty is just another depraved life \\"choice,\\" like living in \\"common law\\" relationships or going to jail, which we learn is \\"simply...a part of life\\" and \\"not necessarily always bad\\" for the poor (p36).    Ready to throw up yet?  But wait! I haven't even gotten to the parts about how to apply this philosophy to managing your elementary school classroom yet!

I am totally disgusted by this book for at least two reasons.<br /><br />By page 32, the authors have referred to pregnancy as a disease, a \\"pathology,\\" and \\"a medical emergency\\" several times.  It is cited as evidence of poor performance of the public schools.  First of all, pregnancy is not a disease.  It is the way by which we reproduce ourselves.  Many consider it to be desired for the continuation of our species.  Secondly, of course female sexuality would be blamed for the failures of the state.  Whenever the men in power fail us, they have to drag some teenage girl out into the street and shave her head, right?  \\"If my magic did not protect you in battle, it was because my wife was menstruating.\\"<br /><br />They keep insisting that public schools are necessary for the function of democracy.  Because they seem not to want to admit that democracy is not the modus operandi of the United States (remember slavery, the draft, the election of 2000?), the public schools just being another cog in the machine that oppresses working people, they postulate that if only the public schools were reformed, democracy would somehow thrive here.  Their interpretation of the evidence that the public schools are prisons at best, sometimes torture chambers, is interpreted to mean that public schools are the balm that will heal the ills of the other \\"pillars of support\\" : families, culture, religion, community.<br /><br />On page 31, the authors give us in support of their theory a story about a public school teacher beating a child with a wooden board.  The doors to the classrooms in this school are padlocked, so without a key, they can be opened neither from within or without.  Clearly, the children are regarded as slaves, locked in cages, with no concern for their human rights, or even if they survive in the event of a fire.  Yet the authors continue to extoll the virtues of our public schools.  They are the bedrock of democracy.	2004-12-09

Some of the stuff is what I would consider to be way-out-there, like \\"The Energetic Starvation of Children\\" by Alan J. Schwartz, which describes schooling from the point of view of Reichianism or neo-Reichianism (I had never even heard of this philosophy before reading this book).  Others, like \\"Alternative Schools in Early America\\" by Ron Miller, operated more from my comfort-level, with conservative analysis of undisputed facts, as in \\"In 1850 the Fugitive Slave Law would be passed.  In this atmosphere, Brook Farm seemed hopelessly romantic and it finally closed in 1847.\\" <br /> <br />This book is best for someone who is interested in case histories of alternative schools, specifically in the United States in the '70s and '80s.  It is also a good read for someone who is interested in alternative education and wonders what it looks like. <br /> <br />I gave it three stars because of last of attention to editing and printing.  The text is very difficult to read as it lacks uniformity with respect to fonts and line spacing.  Parts of the book look like they were generated on a typewriter.  Headings are crooked. The black-and-white photos are also poorly reproduced. The content is 4 stars, but the presentation is not what I consider to be acceptable for publication.	2004-12-03

In my opinion, the fill-ins are a bit too challenging.  I even had trouble with them.  The only thing in this book really \\"worth it\\" that I couldn't make as well myself, are the mini-books.  The mini-books each contain several different sight words, so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them.	2004-12-02

Notable in their attention to setting are \\"What You Pawn I Will Redeem\\" (Seattle from the point of view of a homeless man), \\"Grace\\" (anomie in New York City), \\"A Rich Man\\" (poverty in Washington, D.C.), \\"Limestone Diner\\" (small town Missouri), \\"Gallatin Canyon\\" and \\"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?\\" (the New West), \\"Docent\\" (a DAR who gives tours at Washington and Lee University) and \\"All Saints Day\\" (evangelical eastern Kentucky).  Not all of the stories take place in the USA, however.  \\"Runaway\\" is set in rural Canada, and \\"The Tutor\\" describes the inner life of two young people in India living in a sort of self-imposed diaspora, one dreaming about his years at  Harvard, the other of a hardly-remembered childhood in San Francisco.	2004-11-30

Real women birthing real babies.  Listening to their stories can help prepare you for birth whether this is your first child or your tenth.      One of the things I appreciate most about this book is that it discusses in detail aspects of childbirth that no medically-oriented, mainstream childbirth manual will touch, e.g. what it's like when your baby dies.  Play-by-play descriptions.  Children with birth defects.  These are things I want to know about.    If you are one of those women who doesn't want to hear about any pain, plans on checking yourself into the hospital at the first contraction, and putting your doctor in charge, then you REALLY need to read this book!  I especially recommend this book to women who don't know many other women who have birthed a child naturally, because you're not going to get this information anywhere else.  If you only hear stories from the point of view of women who are drugged, you're not getting the whole story.	2004-11-26

She is so proud about being able to read these books \\"all by herself.\\"  I would give this book 5 stars, but as a breastfeeding mother, I was disappointed that this book, like most of the books we have gotten about \\"big sisters\\" teaches that bottle feeding is the norm.	2004-11-26

Reading this book breathed fresh air into my pregnancy.    Parts of this book are interesting in a \\"huh. i don't know that\\" kind of way.  Others are real paradigm shifters.  For example, before I read this book, one of the only reasons I could think of for not having an ultrasound was the expense.  Kitzinger talked about how ultrasounds and other prenatal testing have changed the culture of chldbirth around the world (creating an atmosphere of pressure to abort girls where male children are preferred, one example). What was more directly relevant to me personally was how, in America, prenatal testing is changing the mother-child relationship from one that is exclusive to one where the mother ignores her child's direct communication in favor of allowing her child to speak to her only through 3rd parties, such as a doctor or technician.  In this manner, the \\"authorities\\" can wrest even more control over women, because you \\"need\\" them to perform the tests in order to have a relationship with your own child.    The book would be worth it even without the text.  The photography is beautiful.	2004-11-26

Bookchin & Schumacher succeed not only in piecing the history of SV40 research together to create a coherent narrative, but I had no trouble following their abstracts of the scientific research. <br /> <br />The only thing that bugs me about their approach was how they consistently fell back on stereotypes to characterize the players involved.  Sabin and Salk are both characterized as \\"bad guys,\\" which can get pretty old after several chapters.  The book would have been better to leave the reader to discern the characters of the men and women by their actions.  Equally annoying was the presentation of Michele Carbone as an Italian racial stereotype.  It did not improve my read of the book to be subjected to such nuggets as how Carbone has a capuccino every day at 10:30.  It really detracts.	2004-09-28

The idea of an alphabet book is to connect a letter to something concrete the child can relate to, like their own name or their dog, not \\"Suffragettes!\\"  The book is confusing as a history for children who are beginning to read because it is in alphabetical rather than chronological order.  There is no narrative here, no \\"story\\" in the history.<br /><br />Much of the history that this book attempts to whitewash over is not, in my opinion, really appropriate for serious discussion until children have begun to develop concepts of society outside of their family, neighborhood, and immediate town in the present day.  I mean, my daughter is four years old.  I can tell her the REAL story of the first Thanksgiving, but, it's kind of like, well, maybe she should first probably learn where North America IS, or that we live in a place called North America before we go into Metacom's Rebellion.<br /><br />This is not to say that it is then okay for Cheney to pretend like this history isn't real, that it isn't really impacting our lives today.  Her presentation of \\"the facts\\" is appalling.  Over and over again, we hear about how great America is. No mention of course of that great Vietnam war, what a great idea that was. No \\"H is for Hiroshima\\" page. How about \\"I is for Imperialism.\\" Or \\"Internment Camps.\\"  It is really quite sick, quite pathological, to use the imagery of Iwo Jima on the front cover to hide the atrocities of war and present it instead as FUN!  It wasn't any fun for anybody at Iwo Jima, and I have no intention of lying to my children about the realities of war.	2004-06-27

I do not feel like it is particularly appropriate for Kindergarten, since implicit in the exercises is that the child already knows how to read.  The bright colors distract and detract from the actual study of Reading & Writing.  I got this book as part of a set that my daughter now uses as \\"coloring books.\\"  There is very little educational value here.	2004-06-24

This book is way over her head.  She is trying to learn the alphabet, for which purpose this book is ill-suited.  The first three pages instruct the child to trace the letters of the alphabet.  From there, the child is expected to do a number of exercises requiring mastery of the alphabet.  The directions make little sense if one doesn't already know how to read, which is unreasonable for anyone to expect as background knowledge for the Pre-K level.  Often, it is not even obvious to me what the creators of the curriculum intend by some of the exercises.      Furthermore, the colorful cats, etcetera are distracting.  I ripped out the \\"reward\\" stickers and gave those to her right away, after I noticed that she was rushing through the page in order to hurry up and get the sticker.  I think they are damaging to my attempts to instill in her the intrinsic value of learning.       This book may be useful for children who already know how to read somewhat as a review of the alphabet and numbers, but I do not recommend it for even the most advanced 4-year-olds.	2004-06-24
