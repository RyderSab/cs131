History is written and re-written on a daily basis to fit the government's propaganda needs.  Words are slowly taken away as the government seeks to stifle creativity and speech.  Children are indoctrinated from very early on and every one is a member of some pro-government committee.<br /><br />One man seeks to defy the government by thinking for himself thereby committing \\"thought-crimes\\".  He also keeps a journal and seeks out a lover.<br /><br />This book is too hard to adequately explain.  It is well written and is a must read for everyone.  Whether you are liberal or conservative, democrat or republican I am sure you have heard quotes used from this book attacking either side of the fence.  From the Patriot act to Hillary Care opponents have vocally cited this book to justify their fears.  I suggest you read it for yourself and draw your own conclusions as to which more closely portrays Big Brother.  My feeling is that they all portray this book very well in one way or another.	2005-08-30

He proposes to turn a blimp into a giant claymore mine.  Anyone ever having seen the damage a very small mine like a claymore can do can only imagine what destruction a larger version could do on an unknowing crowd. <br /> <br />This book gives lots of depth to the characters.  Fully develops the madman's desire for a massive bloodbath on National TV.  In light of the events of 9/11 one realizes just how possible this would have been. <br />	2005-08-23

This is a collection of one author's views of what constitutes the accumulated knowledge of world history.  A monumental task that is not really possible to cover in one book of moderate length. <br /> <br />The author has advanced degrees in literature and mathematics but no real historical credentials.  He does a decent job of putting into simple terms history as we know it from a western perspective.  If he were a more informed historian I would think he definitely held biases but it isn't bias.  It is actually an ignorance of certain historical realities.   <br /> <br />His insights into the causes of war are really, really poor.  One example of this is the two theories he purports for the cause of WWI.  One is Freud's explanation that man needs war so it is inevitable; the other is that the world was simply bored.  There is very little dedicated to the Franco-Prussian war and nothing on the Schlieffen plan.  The Schieffen plan is what is directly responsible for WWI; there are no other theories that even come close. <br /> <br />When he starts getting into the future of mankind and computers taking over it starts getting too flaky.  Also his guess on the progression of war is way off as we are witnessing in the age of terrorism. <br />	2005-08-23

It has none of the qualities that the other two books offered. <br /> <br />Basically it tries to explain Hannibal's background while being chased by a former patient/victim that wants to see him eaten by pigs.  Yes, that's right pigs.  Apparently sharks with laser beams, winged monkeys, or killer clowns from outer space were already taken so he had to improvise.   <br /> <br />Clarice goes from being a bright prospect with the FBI to eventually turning into Hannibal's sick cannibal mate tromping around the world.  Nothing in this book is even remotely suspenseful.  Instead Harris, with a deadline and major money at risk, whips out this pathetic piece.  He replaces intelligently written suspense with needless, over the top gore. <br /> <br />One of the few books that was worse than the movie.  The movie was awful too but at least trimmed out some of this nonsense.  No wonder Foster would have nothing to do with this. <br />	2005-08-23

There is no high style writing of any sort.  It will either speak to you or it won't.  You will either love it or think it is worthless. <br /> <br />I read this whenever I am in a glut and sick of my current lifestyle.

They construct their utopian society and make sure the rules are fair to all.  Eventually there are compromises and social classes emerge.  A force is developed to protect the upper classes from the lower classes.  Eventually conditions match what they had replaced and then get even worse.<br /><br />It is so sad that a book of this length and simplicity in story line completely dispels the myths of communism and all those that follow it.  This allegory does just that.  It shows how for the very briefest of time revolutionary zeal for this cause can give good results.  Then reality sets in.  Life under communism is awful, it is ripe with abuse, corruption and ultimately doomed to failure.  History has proven this over and over again.<br /><br />Communism to me is similar to the people in America that were suckered out west to farm bad soil.  They cut the sod and had a great year or two of farming.  They were deluded into thinking life would always be like this.  After the first 2 seasons nothing would grow and the people's lives were decidedly worse than the lives they had left.  Lives they could no longer return to and so they were left suffering year in and year out.  That is communism in a nutshell.	2005-08-21

We often here the term trench warfare and think nothing of it.  After reading this it will bring on a whole new vivid and horrible meaning.  This book is from the point of Erich Maria Remarque, a german soldier.  His story, or one nearly similar, could have been told by just about everyone who fought in the trenches in this war.<br /><br />WWI was a horrible war.  It was was fought with 19th century doctrine and 20th century weaponry, this was a combination that mixed with gruesome results.  WWI redefined Europe and the rest of the world.  Its conclusion is what is believed to be directly responsible for the conditions that lead to WWII.  The worst part of all is it was a war wholly unnecessary to be fought.	2005-08-21

It gives a lot of information without being too comprehensive.   <br /> <br />I have been living in Thailand for 6 months now and have referenced this often.  Its descriptions are right on the money.  It gives you all the pertinent information that you will need.  The places it recommends are accurate to their description. <br /> <br />THe only thing I wish this would list is the Thai script for the places it recommends.  You will pronounce everything wrong because it is written in English the way a Thai person would read it and not the way a native English speaker would. <br /> <br />I can speak Thai and try to say where I want to go according to the spelling in this book and the people have no idea where I want to go.  I have to rethink how Thai people would read the English and try pronouncing it that way.   I can't imagine how difficult it would be to travel with this if I didn't speak Thai.	2005-08-20

Our guide a retired Colonel, military writer, and WWII expert actually asked the Brigade Commander why a lowly Specialist knew more about this battle than any of his staff officers.    This book give you the nuts and bolts of the planning and execution of Operation Market Garden.  It is an excellent companion to the movie A Bridge Too Far which does an astounding job of portraying the operation on screen.    Operation Market Garden was Montey's grand assault into Arnhem, Holland (The Netherlands).  It was a grand Ground and Airborne campaign that was only trumped by its massive failure.  After reading this book and studying a little bit about the overall operation you will come to understand how ineffective airborne troops are as a main offensive weapon.    Another lesson to be learned from this assault by both military leaders and business leaders is that all the planning in the world can not make a bad idea work.	2005-08-19

On the surface it is the story of a man that fixes amusement park rides and feels he has made no contribution to the world around him.  Beneath the surface it shows how the meaning of life is often found not in what we do but in how we affect those around us.  Even the most casual circumstances can lead to profound changes in other people's lives.    This book is not meant to be overly critical or in-depth in anyway.  It is a nice simple read that should take no more than a few hours.  Despite the title, it is not even specific to a religion.  It is just a way to relate that it is an after life experience.

This book is neither good nor bad it is average.  If you purchased Mega Memory from Kevin Trudeau in the 90's then you will be upset because the same material they covered for hundreds of dollars is available here for a fraction. <br /> <br />It is told in a strange format of two people asking and answering each others questions to lay out the material they want to present.  The questions are annoying and unrealistic but necessary for this type of narrative. <br /> <br />I was looking for something new in this book. The techniques do work.  Their success is only limited by how much you dedicate yourself to them.

This book is not intended to give a full grasp of the entire Pacific campaign.  It is also not about the strategies involved for the taking of the islands.<br /><br />It is a book told from the perspective of the Marines and Soldiers that had to endure impossible conditions and hellish experiences.  This book is not for the faint-hearted.  It is graphic and gruesome, so the reader should be prepared for that.<br /><br />I first read this book while doing training maneuvers in my infantry company.  It made me laugh at the futility of what we were doing.  Nothing we trained for would have prepared us for the conditions these men endured.<br /><br />I also think that this is a good book for people wanting to understand the rationale used for the grave decision to employ atomic weaponry and end this war hastily.  This is not advocation per se of this form of warfare.  It is just a way to get into the minds of the people responsible for preventing more U.S. fatalities.	2005-08-17

Most of them were fresh out of high school and had never really been taught about the subject.  I was considered the expert for two reasons.  One, I had a business degree and knew a good deal about the subject.  Second, and most important, I traveled and went out with them a lot but always managed to have money at the end of the month. <br /> <br />The first thing I would do is make any one interested in finance read this book.  I either loaned them my copy or had them purchase it.  It is a worthy investment.  The main reason I did this was to break the myths of wealth and lifestyles.  This book is an excellent way of doing that. <br /> <br />Once they understood what the typical millionaire was really like and how they lived they knew they could do it too.  This book is not about getting rich overnight or living so poorly that you only enjoy your life when you are ready to die.  It is a guide for how to live a little below your means and being able to save for the future. <br /> <br />With the aid of this book I helped numerous soldiers set up separate accounts and research possible investments.  Every once in awhile I get an e-mail from one of these guys thanking me for putting them on the right path and it makes me feel really good..  If you, or anyone you know, live beyond your means and live form paycheck to paycheck then get this book.  If you follow it you will be better off. <br />	2005-08-13

Do not expect an in depth look at any of these.  This would most likely be useful for someone just starting to study philosophy with no significant prior knowledge. <br /> <br />The actual best place for this would be as a bathroom book.  It is very easy to read and is broken down into numerous categories concerning Nietzsche's teachings.  It also uses numerous illustrations with major historical people and how they viewed these teachings or how they helped to contribute to Nietzsche's belief system.  It also goes far in setting straight a lot of misconceptions and falsehood regarding this philosopher. <br />	2005-08-13

In fact if you try some of his \\"tactics\\" in a normal hotel you might get stuck with a hefty bill.  I read this book to see how scammers might try to take advantage of my staff.  None of my staff ever fell for any of what he suggests and many have tried.    Someone tried the double reservation game with us when we were fully booked.  It ended up costing him two nights for both reservations.  He tried to not pay and called his credit card to complain about it.  Surprisingly the credit card company sided with us on that one.  Hotels, as everyone else in the tourism industry, are onto the little scams this guy tries to put out as tips.  Also reservations are a form of contract and depending on the state can be hard to break.    His advice on airlines was remedial at best even before 9/11.  Now it is completely useless.  I read a one page article on airline tips in a Reader's Digest and it had more practical advice.    You can be pretty sure that if you try any of these tactics you will not get an upgrade of any sort.  More likely the staff will be onto you and look at you distrustfully for the duration of your travels with that company.  If you want to insure bad seats, bad rooms, and bad everything else then try these tactics.  Sometimes a bad customer is not worth having. On several occasions I \\"fired\\" guests.  This is a good guide to making that happen. If you are a true frequent traveler then you should be getting perks already as a valued customer.  You won't need this.    This author tries to paint travel industry professionals as some sort of enemy.  It is this guy and his tricks that make travelers look bad and eventually cost the industry so much that they end reward programs for honest travelers.  The people in this industry work exceptionally hard.  They have bad hours, work holidays, and receive poor pay.  The worstpart of it is dealing with jerks like this and people that take out unrelated travel frustrations that people encounter.  They put up with all this and are expected to say thank you and smile.    This is their job and they know it, but people like this author and his \\"advice\\" are not acceptable.    Here are a few tips on hotels that I hope you will find useful:    1. Your best general rate is going to be available via internet reservations.  2.  Online discounters get a good mark up on the rooms they book for you.  The hotel gets a very low rate and will give you a \\"run of house room\\"  this means they will give you whatever is available.  Even if you call and get a confirmed reservation for a certain type of room the hotel can change it at will as that is in the agreement with the discount broker.  The discount broker is actually the contracted guest, not you.  3.  Check the local area out on the web and find out what businesses frequent the area.  If you have ever purchased a product of theirs you can justifiably claim you are a buyer and do business with them, the hotel may book you at their negotiated rates.  I would leave out the fact that you purchase relatively small quantities.  4. Hotel room rates fluctuate on expected vacancy.  The more filled the hotel the more likely they are to charge you their \\"rack\\" rate.  This is their full price, every other rate is a discount off of this rate.  5.  If the hotel is charging rack rate because they are expected to be fully booked then go to your travel agent.  Your travel agent will be able to get you a better rate for this instance only.  Otherwise avoid your travel agent at all costs.  6. Always always get confirmation numbers and if absolutely necessary get a faxed or e-mailed confirmation letter and check the dates thoroughly.  A lot of people find out they were booked for the wrong days.  7.  The more you call the more likely someone will screw up your reservation.  Know what you want in advance and put your requests in all at one time.  If you start to annoy the reservationist they may screw up your reservation.  The reservationist likely won't be at the hotel when you show up and things are screwed up.  8. Requests for adjoining rooms can be exceptionally difficult.  Most hotels will try to accomodate requests like this but will rarely guarantee them.  9. Most business-class rooms have special lounges or amenities available during business days only. On the weekends these services may not be offered.  10.  Hotels offer a room to stay in.  Unless you are paying sky high rates don't expect a palace.  More likely you are paying for the location.  If you are booking a downtown hotel in any medium sized city or larger expect to pay seperately for parking.  Almost no hotel can afford a parking structure in a city.  The property taxes alone would force you to pay an unimaginable rate.  Ask how much parking will cost.  Remember the hotel will most likely have no control over this so don't complain to them about it.  In big cities this can be a daily rate of $20-$30.  Not a good surprise.	2005-08-13

This is a dreadful system that has caused so many Thai people troubles when trying to read and pronounce English words.  It was not designed by native speakers of English and actually is confusing and difficult to adapt to. <br /> <br />This new book assumes you have learned everything from the basic level.  It is a hard second step but it is a necessary step.  All of the lessons are written in Thai.  At the end of the book the English translation is provided.  There is absolutely no Thai phonetic in this book.  The vocabulary provided is good except at the end when they give transliteration for English names.  They also give transliteration of English words where there is actually a Thai equivalent.  Why would I want to now how a Thai person says the English word for Bank when there is a Thai word for that?  To me that is just promoting laziness and avoiding Thai fluency. <br /> <br />Once again you will need to buy the tapes or CD's separately.  You may not necessarily need them for this level but I did.  If nothing else it is a way to reassure yourself that you are pronouncing things correctly. <br />	2005-08-10

He taught that there are 4 noble truths to Buddhism.  These are: There is suffering; The source of suffering is desire; There is cessation to suffering, And that cessation is achieved through an adherence to the Eightfold Path. The Eightfold Path is a path of virtue, mental cultivation, and wisdom.      I quoted the above from my Let's Go guidebook.  Nowhere within this set will you learn about Buddha's life or his teachings.  That includes the foundation of Buddhism that I included above. The Sutra's are correct however the interpretations stray from most of Buddha's teachings.    If you want to get the author's view of Buddhism here it is:  Stare at Buddha images and let your mind go blank.  Buddhism is meditation and anyone can become a Buddha.      That has got to be the most flawed and simplistic view of a such a great religion/philosophy that I have ever heard.      I was highly disappointed after purchasing this set.  I wanted to learn about the Buddhist beliefs because that is what life is centered around in Thailand, my home for the next 2 years.  As I just demonstrated my guidebook does a much better job of accurately explaining Buddhist beliefs.    This set preaches a very hateful message that has nothing to do with the Buddhism that I have learned about.  It is very critical of any religious beliefs outside of Buddhism.  True Buddhism is very inclusive and allows people of all faiths to incorporate the teachings of the Buddha.    Going from my experiences living in Thailand so far I have found virtually no value to what is taught in this set.  We have had Buddhist Monks come and speak to us on Buddhism and what they said differed from this set greatly.  Also readings of other texts and discussions with devout and less than devout Buddhists shared nothing with what this author presents.	2005-08-09

Although no work of this type could possibly be complete in one volume, Davies does a very good job in hitting almost everything you could want.<br /><br />This is essentially a reference book.  It gives you a good starting point on almost any subject or period you are interested in.  I would suggest a basic knowledge of European history before trying to read this cover to cover like I did.<br /><br />Even though it is rather bulky I took it with me on all of my travels.  Every city I went to I used this to maximize my travel so that I could focus on what I thought would be most interesting.  Lets face it a normal guidebook will bring you to the places a tourist would find interesting and not what is necessarily historically significant.<br /><br />Although there are a lot of books that are more specific than this work in any given area none are as complete a compendium as this work is.

I first got this book when my professor (a highly succesful multi-millionaire) recommended it to me.  He said it was as good as any Marketing degree.  Well I have my Marketing degree and would have to agree with him.  The best promotional campaign is the one that costs the least but gets the most results.  That is what you have here.  This is especially helpful for small niche businesses.  Those types of businesses can really take advantage of this book. <br /> <br />It is admittedly weak on the web side of things but I have never really found that to be a very useful avenue for anyone but the major players that can afford to buy costly advertising.  No this is for small businesses that do most of their deals face to face.	2005-08-05

I have since read it several more times despite its length.  I do this because it is a very good book and because its vivid scenery reminds me of one of the most majestic places I have ever visited.    If you are not familiar with Michener's style he tells the tale of a particular area from its geologic formation up to modern times.  In this he starts his tale and weaves it through the lives of subsequent and remotely related characters.    With Alaska, Michener starts with some Mastodans and then works it through the first migrants coming over the ice bridge.  From there he covers Russian colonization, the gold rush, and onto modern times.    Each generation has its own intricacies and its own stories.  All of these stories are highly interesting and blend well together.    My only problem with Michener is that he is more interested in the story than the history.  With this he takes too many liberties in adapting actual events to fit his circumstances.  It is fun to read but it ends there.  Do not feel you have gained any great historical insights from his readings.	2005-08-04

Since it is indeed so much like a novel I won't add anything here that would spoil the story for you.    The two stories are about Daniel Hudson Burnham, the brilliant architect that designed and developed the World's fair in 1893 in only 2 years.  The other story is about H.H. Holmes, a brilliant man as well but also a pure psychopath and serial killer.  As one worked his magic in an impossible situation to top the last world fair held in Paris the other man worked his deviousness to take advantage of it in a most gruesome way.    This book is so interesting and so unbelievable you truly will check to see if it actually happened.  Guess what? it did and that is what makes this so good.  I have loaned my copy to many people and each one returned it in just a few days saying it was one of the best books they ever read.  If you want America's second city to come to life and then sink into death then get this book, you won't regret it.	2005-08-04

After the first week I could ask basic questions and understand the answers.  By the end of this program I could make basic conversation and understand the responses of the people I was talking to. <br /> <br />Pimsleur's method is largely hailed as language learning magic.  Essentially 1/2 an hour a day spent listening and repeating the lesson will give you a strong grasp of the language.  There are now 4 levels to German so you can go a long way.  I only needed the first two levels because I lived in Germany and was able to speak with people daily. <br /> <br />This program will teach you how to speak and understand your language.  It will not teach you grammar rules or anything dreadful like that.  I was able to talk to my friend's 5 year old daughter in German. She did not have a clue as to any of the rules of grammar what she did know was how to speak German.  Think about it.  In English if someone says something incorrectly do you think: hmm that violates this rule or do you just know it sounds wrong?  That is how it will work with Pimsleur.  Things will just sound right or wrong.  Also you will remember what the program presents.  It worked for everyone in my barracks that borrowed it from me.  Some were smart but most had talents that lied elsewhere. <br /> <br />I would suggest trying to get this used or from a library because of the price.  If you have no other option get this program new, it is better than paying half the price for a different program that won't work.	2005-08-03

The book did an adequate commentary on the build up of the social and political structure but did not deliver on the economic side too much.  It also gave the consequences of the crash in much the same way.  In short the book is good to read if you want to see how the general population lived both before and after crash.  If you want an in-depth critical look at the Thai economy and the underlying reasons for the crash as well as the economic ramifications afterwards then this book is not for you.	2005-08-03

I have read a lot on the subject and nothing comes as close as these for their relevance as well as their entertainment value. <br /> <br />Jeff Shaara and his father have put together possibly the best historical fiction epic that has ever been written.  Jeff mimics and surpasses his father's style in bringing the 1st and 3rd parts of this series to life.  It takes you from the precursors of the war to just past its ending.  Although they are technically classified as novels they may as well be considered non fiction because of the accuracy of the research.   <br /> <br />It was wise to package all three of these together as I don't think too many people would be satisfied with just reading one. <br /> <br />Although I thought the movies based on two of these books were historically interesting they did seem to drag on in places.  None of these books do that.  If you want to add to an already great series get Gone For Soldiers by Jeff Shaara and read it first.  All of the major players in this series are introduced in that work.  You also see their relationships and backgrounds more fully developed.	2005-08-02

The main reason for this is his writing style is as close as one can get to being non fiction and still being a novel.  Rise to Rebellion starts by giving the backdrop to the American Revolution and the beginning battles of the war itself. <br /> <br />You will be able to see the personalities that were at workin this drama versus just the boring names and places that you learned about in school.  Shaara does this for both sides of the revolution and is in no way pro America / anti British propoganda.  This is history as it should be, well researched and vivid. <br /> <br />It is also a 2-part series.  The second part is called The Glorious Cause.  I would highly recommend purchasing that book as well because once you finish with this one you will want to dive right into the other.	2005-08-02

In this book Shaara does a great job of illustrating an often overlooked war in our nation's history, the Mexican war. <br />If, like me, you had the \\"benefits\\" of a public school education you will undoubtedly have a few gaps in some of the \\"not so important\\" areas like History.  Shaara goes a long way to fill those gaps. <br /> <br />What is actually the best thing about this novel is how it brings into play the relationships the U.S. and Confederate officers had with one another prior to the Civil war.  Anyone wanting to read the Civil War trilogy written by Shaara and his father should read this first, it makes it so much better.	2005-08-02

Being fair though it is still an outstanding book compared to others that cover the same era. <br /> <br />The theme of this book was two fold.  First he wanted to present the history of WWI in his same outstanding method.  Also he really wanted to illustrate how warfare changed.  This is often shown with new technologies going head to head with old tactics causing disastrous results.   <br /> <br />Shaara works his magic this time with a different cast of characters.  Instead of all the people made famous from history, Shaara puts us in the role of a common Marine along with some more well known names. <br /> <br />It is true that WWI was mostly trench warfare and that is where a lot of other authors choose to concentrate.  Shaara breaks from this to speed up the \\"war by inches\\" pace of WWI as well as to illustrate where warfare was heading. <br /> <br />All of this is accomplished through 4 primary characters: The Famous Red Baron; an American counterpart aviator, Raoul Lufbery; General Black Jack Pershing; and an ordinary Marine, PVT Roscoe Temple. <br /> <br />Once again Shaara bridges the gap from literature to history to give another masterful accomplishment in historical fiction.	2005-08-02

Thaiglish <br /> <br />This is a mixture of new material and material available in other programs by Poomsan Becker.  It was a great idea and a very tough task to go after.  It falls short of my expectations.  First the material seems a little skimpy and at times goes too fast.  There could have been more exercises.  Also sometimes it is hard to follow along with the reading material.  You have the English, the Thai phonetic and then the written Thai.  It is very easy to lose your place and then the audio beats you to the punch.   <br /> <br />I have mixed feelings about recommending this product or telling people to stay away.

His style is technically fiction but in all reality it is well researched and about as close to reality as one can get without strictly adhering to the facts. <br /> <br />Shaara gives his characters dimension by expanding on their writings, as well as known facts of the events the characters take part in.  <br /> <br />One good thing this book does is it dispels the myths many have learned about the Revolutionary War.  Some of these include the U.S. won because the British wore red uniforms.  The U.S. won because they turned the war into a stalemate that cost the British Empire too much politically and economically.  The British could have easily kept sending more and more Hessians to fight.  The British seemed to be the most powerful force on Earth for many years later while still wearing red uniforms.  Also the fact that more Colonials fought for the British side than the Rebel side is often overlooked.  This was a war that benefited the rich land owning white males of the colonies.  Although in the end I believe everyone in the U.S. benefited even if the end waited a couple hundred years for some. <br /> <br />Pretty much everything we have ever been taught on the Revolutionary War is a fallacy and this book along with its counterpart clears a lot of it up in a clear and interesting way. <br /> <br />I can't wait until he does something on the War of 1812, our so called \\"second revolution.\\"  From a historical perspective I think that we in the U.S. get the most inaccurate education on this event.  We did not win and we did not lose.  The main gist of the treaty we signed was \\"everything is the way it was before the war.\\"	2005-07-28

I have a degree in Marketing and found this to be a good summary of what I have learned at the very basic level.  if you have little to no business background then this is a good place to start. <br /> <br />I have been reviewing it at site and think I can make even further use of it.  I think if translated it could make a good tool for villagers to use on their own with little to no explanation.

It really gets back to the basics of marketing.  I mean stuff that was assumed we knew when we signed up for our first marketing class in college or high school even.  These are the basics that developing countries may not have ever heard of.  This helps to teach the concepts and get them started.	2005-07-27

Obviously most of the critics and some of the supporters have never read this work.  One need not approve of communism to give the Communist Manifesto a high rating but it is certainly a must read.    Ayn Rand's philosophy is known as objectivism.  It is essentially having a objective reason and purpose for every action you commit.    Atlas Shrugged is one of two major novels that outlines her entire philosophy while trying to show how it would be applied.  That is why this book deserves a 5 star rating.  Any philosopher can give generic ideas with no application.  Rand puts it all on the line to show exactly how she means her philosophy to be interpreted.      The student of philosophy will be able to understand her philosophy quite clearly after reading this.  If you agree with her philosophy you should encourage others to read this book.  If this book is so clearly wrong then you should encourage others to read it so they will see how clearly wrong it is.  Those that want it burned or object to others reading it know that she offers some very strong arguments for a position they clearly do not want to be true.    This book takes place probably around the 1950s.  It is centered around the industrial sector of the U.S., the only government that has not become a People's State.  The main character in this book is Dagny Taggart.  She is a no-nonsense VP of Operations for the largest railroad in the world.  She is intelligent and is solely driven to keeping her RR as the best.      The times are dim and getting dimmer.  In the beginning the country is in a recession of sorts and it is up to Taggart and others like her to save the country.  There are two problems that are preventing her from doing this.  One, the government seeks more and more control when it should be stepping away.  Second, the men of industry are disappearing one by one just when they are criticallyneeded.  No one knows where they go off to.    In the sense of a novel this is a good one.  It is suspenseful and intriguing.  Everyone can identify with the characters in this book.  Most of the antagonists have been left rather shallow.  That is on purpose.  They are supposed to represent certain elements of society.  This book can get dry at times.  One man has a 60 page speech that can seem a little preachy at times but is wholly necessary within the context of the novel.    Ayn Rand is perhaps the best known and widest read philosopher of the 20th century.  If you have any interest in philosophy or economics then this is a must read.  Don't fear her teachings.  An open mind is a dangerous thing to some people.    The most important thing to remember is not to take everything you read here as dogma.  Think for yourself and apply whatever ideas make sense to you and ignore that which you don't like.  Think for yourself.  I think Rand would object to anyone blindly following her philosophy without actually believing in it.  No one says you can't be charitable to others.  Just make sure you do it of your own volition and not because it is expected of you or because you feel guilty.	2005-07-27

It is true that you will get a wide range of answers and generalizations from volunteers and recruiters.

This book traces the history of Rum from its discovery in the 1600's (I wonder if that is what actually lifted Europe out of the dark ages) until present day.     Rum has played such a significant role on the history of the world.  It is doubtful that any other beverage save tea or coffee could boast as much.  The main role it played was in the Triangle trade between Europe, Africa, and the Americas.  This is also the initial focus of the book but goes into its role in militaries, prohibition, and more.    Rum has also played a significant part in shaping religious practices and other world events.  If you want a solid but smooth ride through history then this is the book for you.  I guarantee you will learn something new about the world as well as have a new appreciation for the power of a simple sugar derived spirit.    Added bonus are all of the recipes included at the end of each chapter.  I suggest you start this book with your favorite rum concoction because you will soon be thirsty.	2005-07-25

It is clear and to the point.  It lists many examples for each subject that it presents.  I have been trying unsuccessfully to get Thai people to explain to me what I have found clearly laid out in this book.    I was both happy and disappointed when I discovered this book.  Happy that my confusion is now over.  Disappointed that Peace Corps did not distribute this to its volunteers in training.    These are the chapter listings of what this book has to offer:     1. Fundamentals; basic word order, to be, addressing people etc   2. Referring to things; it, possessive, number of things etc   3. Referring to people; Numbers, who, myself/yourself, etc   4.

How Long?; period of time, spending time, etc  18. Frequency; Times/occasions, sometimes, usually, etc    I gave just a sampling of each chapter but there is a whole lot more than what I have listed.  My only problem with this book is that it could list some of the instructions in Thai.  That limits the book to being a self study book instead of a book a Thai instructor would be able to use to help teach with.  That being said it is a truly wonderful tool.  If you are planning on studying Thai seriously then you need to get this book.PC Volunteers:  This book is available in Bangkok for half the price listed here.

Either a slant to the right or to the left hurts anyone's attempt to portray facts.  Facts are afterall what anyone should be looking for when reading history. <br /> <br />If someone wants to view an event in a certain way than they can find all the evidence they deem useful and ignore or belittle anything that counters their opinion. <br /> <br />This author is so slanted that it is hard to tell what is history and what is merely the author's perspective of history.  This author chooses events that have indeed played little to no effect on the course of world history or US history for that matter. <br /> <br />The research methods are also flawed.  The author chose 12 outdated textbooks used by some of the poorest regions in the deep south.  Anyone under the age of 40 would have never learned what the author claims was taught in error. <br /> <br />The obscurities in history the author presents are somewhat interesting.  They are details overlooked by most history classes.  Perhaps the title should be Things You Were Never Taught.  I don't understand the current title.  It implies a gigantic conspiracy on the part of our education system.  Somehow they got the most liberal of labor unions, the teachers union, to go along with this conspiracy. <br /> <br />An example of of the slanted way the author writes is how he compares a plague that whiped out Native Americans to the Black Death.  He plays with statistics to try to dwarf the Black Death.  I am sorry, the Black Death whiped out 30 - 50 percent of the European continent.  Its impact touched the lives of almost every people of the known world.  It changed lines on borders and redefined the world as it was known. <br /> <br />No conspiracy could have blocked out knowledge of these events.  If the plague affecting this obscure portion of the Native American population was so much more monumental then surely we would have heard about it.  We certainly have heard how Native Americans were whiped out every where else in the Americas. <br /> <br />Basically said this author is not a historian.  A true historian, either liberal, or conservative, enters into their work with at least a veil of objectivity.  This author does not. <br />	2005-06-26

I purchased this book because I have little background in teaching.  I had hoped this book would give me meaningful guidance.  It fell far short of this.    This book was designed with a very ethno-centric point of view.  The pictures are of things most Americans would be familiar with but when I tried reviewing the pictures with some of the Thai people in my community they had no idea what the objects were in either language.    Most of the pictures are crude and get worse if you try to reproduce them.  The entire idea of a book like this is to provide reproduceable study material, otherwise what is the point?    If you are in my situation, teaching to people outside of the U.S., Then this book is not for you.	2005-06-24

This book had an awful beginning.  It was as if the author did not know how to begin so he came up with a lame 1st person narrative that eventually faded away.  It reappeared for no reason at the end other than to tell you that the book was over.  Apparently he knew you would not know this otherwise.    The book was a decent read and kept pulling you further and further into the Victorian world.  Problem with the book is it eventually had to end and that is where the story crumbled.    The main character, Sugar, is not your normal prostitute.  In fact she is supergirl gone wrong.  The only thing missing is her cape and tight spandex suit.  Problem with the story is if you are going to build someone up so strongly you need to give them an equally strong or stronger foe.  Even Superman had Lex Luther.  If not for him it would have been a person going around doing whatever he wanted unopposed.  That is what you have with Sugar.    There is nothing in this book to oppose her rise.  The end of this book is absolutely awful.  Sugar manages to make a man's wife and daughter disappear without a single hitch.  The man, one of the wealthiest in London, does next to nothing to get either of them back.  Even though, with his resources, it would have been extremely easy to do so.    This book could have been so much better if only the ending wasn't such a bust.    I think it is entirely pretentious to print a book club list of questions at the end of this book.  One question tries to compare Faber to Dickens.  Writing a book about Victorian England gives one as much right to compare themselves with a great as I would deserve being compared to Twain if I wrote a book about the Mississippi.  Both claims are garbage.	2005-06-24

There are quality exercises as well as tests.    My major issue with this book as well as anything by Becker is the way they write the Thai Phonetic.  I found it easier to learn how to read Thai than to try to decipher the way they write the vowels.  No one would make sense of this system when they use ii as ee.  Dan would be pronounced as Don according to their system.  These are examples for the easy vowels, the complex ones are indecipherable.    The book is set up in 10 chapters.  Each getting progressively harder.  They introduce relevant vocabulary in each chapter.      I am a Peace Corps volunteer and have found this invaluable.  If Peace Corps used this book as its teaching foundation I would have been much better served.  I am moving on to the intermediate level and can read any word in the basic level.    PC Volunteers: If you want to get started early start with this one.  Make sure you get the CD or tapes to accompany it.  Practice all four skills; listening, speaking, reading, writing.  It is not that hard once you get started and you will be ahead of everyone else.  Start also by memorizing the different kinds of foods (that is a key to Thai culture).	2005-06-17

I am a Peace Corps volunteer living in Thailand for the next two years.  I wanted a book that was up to dat and would give me the political background of the region.  This book does exactly that.  It explains ASEAN and other treaty organizations roles in the area.  It also shows the roles that outside Players like China and the USA play in the area. <br /> <br />Best of all the book seemed very balanced.  I did not get any sense that the author was pushing any certain side when presenting the material.  Although it was quite dry at times overall it was interesting and helped me to understand the region much better.	2005-05-25

The meat of it can be condensed to a few pages.  The rest is basically the summary of the author's love of languages and his inflated ego. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong he does offer some sound strategies and a way to direct your language efforts.  I will give you what I found useful and you can decide to waste $10 if you want to. <br /> <br />First, realize there is no magic way to learn a language.  You have to work at it and dedicate yourself.  The author recommends a multi-prong approach to learning the language.  Some of the materials he recommends you purchase are a introductory book to your target language, an audio program for target language, a two-way dictionary in the target language, a phrase book, and a magazine or newspaper in the target language. <br /> <br />He suggests doing the first 5 lessons in the introductory book to familiarize yourself in the language.  Then start trying to read an article in the target language.  Write down the words you don't understand and make flash cards.  Use the audio tapes to listen to correct pronunciation and make flash cards of words.  Also use the phrasebook to give vocabulary and make flash cards. <br /> <br />He does recommend using Pimsleur programs for the audio portion.  I gave myself a crash course with Pimsleur German 1 and was able to make basic conversations within a few days. <br /> <br />He emphasizes practice of your language with whomever you can find speaks it.   <br /> <br />Ok the book doesn't live up to the title.  He does not address how to apply his memory techniques and self learning style to tonal languages like Thai.  His close enough approach does not cut it with Thai.  I live here and unless you say the word exactly you will just confuse whomever you are talking to.  Also can't really dive into the reading and writing portions with anything but a roman alphabet. <br /> <br />One of his great bragging points is how he ordered food in Chinese and the Chinese waitress was so impressed that she ended up messing up his whole order.  What most likely happened is that he spoke what he thought was Chinese but what was most likely jibberish.  I don't know about anyone else but if someone speaks to me clearly in my native language I will not get flustered I will be very comfortable and would easily be able to respond.   <br /> <br />The rest of the book reads like this.  Little scenarios were it shows it is nice to know another language.  Anyone that picked up this book would already realize this.  We want substance not nostalgia. <br />	2005-05-25

In order to understand Thailand one needs to be familiar with the whole region. <br /> <br />I consider myslef educated as far as history is concerned but am very weak in this region.  This book serves as a very good introduction to the entire area.  The author covers early times rather quickly and moves through to modern times at a decent pace. <br /> <br />The book left me with a lot more questions than answers.  These questions are at least somewhat informed.  The author sparked my interests in a lot of different periods for the various countries.  The whole point of an introduction is to raise intelligent questions rather than going in depth.  The author does this very well. <br /> <br />Speed readers will like the intro and summary for each chapter.  The book is highly readable and the author is ready to admit areas where he does not have an expertise. <br /> <br />The 1/2 star minus is for the very brief mention of the 1997 economic crisis and its results.  By now he can at least lend his opinion on the newly emerging history of that significant period. <br /> <br />Author also gives a good listing of suggested reading.  This was not updated in the most recent addition and he does not give any good sources to further explore the most recent events	2005-05-13

All the other 5 stars point out the merits for this book.  In short it gives modern insights to a very important book on strategy.  Shows that true wisdom rings true for thousands of years. <br /> <br />The criticisms that I have read on this book are true but are not really fair.  This book is not designed to be a play by play guide for managers that have no insights of their own.  If this book doesn't generate ideas for you without spoon-feeding examples and how to's then you will never lead a winning organization.  You are a sheep not a shepherd. <br /> <br />If one understands Sun Tzu, if not a master as no one really is, they would realize that any example given automatically is rendered useless.  A widely publicized tactic lacks the element of surprise, rule #19. <br /> <br />My criticism of it is that he doesn't understand history that well, at least the Revolutionary War.  He cites things that are common misperceptions about that war to support his arguments.  The rebels always employed unconventional tactics not just towards the end.  Also almost all of the battles were fought conventionally and on open fields.  This is contrary to what the author writes.  Stick to business examples. <br /> <br />Also citing Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski does little to advance his point.  Who could have known and I'm sure any future editions will strike this reference. <br /> <br />This book isn't perfect but if you are a shepherd and can generate ideas on your own then this book is for you.  It will help give fire to the sparks you already have.  Quit wasting time and order it.  Assume your competitor has already read it and is using its insights against you.	2005-05-13

Best you will find but flawed	This dictionary is probably the best one that the beginner Thai student will find.  I am currently a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand and am the only Farang in my community.  This has proven to be very helpful and often very frustrating.  Thankfully I am learning how to read Thai and will be moving on to better options.    The good points:  1. Written in English and Thai alphabets.  You will mispronounce whatever word you are looking up so it helps when the Thai's can read what you are pointing at.  2. Lists a lot of rules for the Thai language to give beginners a better understanding.  3. Alphabet key at the bottom of pages allows for quicker referencing.  4. Size is nice. Maybe a little too big for pockets but compact enough.    The bad points:  1. The middle section, Thai phonetic, is useless and takes up space.  2. Thai print is tiny.  Thai's have difficulty reading and often have to go looking for glasses.  If phonetic section was eliminated this print could have been made larger.  3. The system that they use for translating the vowels is difficult and frustrating.  Example: ii is equal to ee.  I don't understand why they don't just use ee then.  I had to make a vowel key on a notecard to make sense of the system.    Bottom line.  Buy this dictionary, there are none better in a compact size.  Expect to be frustrated with it quite a bit.  Once you start learning to read Thai you will want to move on to a dictionary that eliminates the Thai phonetic.    Potential PCVs, through our diligent lobbying efforts you will be provided with this dictionary during training.  Save your money for Soam Tom.	2005-05-11
US	49095994	R2DUUG0UV3ZQ8G	0451191153	594264062	The Fountainhead	Books	5	4	7	N	Y	One of the Best	Many pseudo-intellectuals think they are geniuses for being able to read a book of this length.  I am no intellectual by far but have read many books on philosophy.  I believe this book to be one of the most important pieces for people of any age.  This book puts life in perspective.  It shows, quite cleverly, that there are rewards beyond materialistic ones.  It also shows that greatness is not necessarily what others believe it to be but what the creator gets out of it.  I first read Atlas Shrugged at the suggestion of my brother.  I read it in about 3 days, seldom putting it down.  I went on to read every novel written by Rand.  I think that she is a very important author of our time and whether you believe in her philosophies or not you must read it.	2000-10-19
