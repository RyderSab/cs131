I really enjoyed the characters and the realm in which they dwell. If anything, the world itelf is the star. Taking nothing away from the variety of folks in the pages (some nice, some grizzly, some evil, etc), the story sells the book. Well thought out and beautifully written, Chris did a great job on this one. Even unto the end, Heath makes oen give a dang about his characters and their lives.    <br />The beautiful map (included with the book) was stunning and so well thought out, it rivals many realms I've seen. The cover by V. Shave is a looker and conveys the notion of the book.  <br /> <br />Production wise, the novel was top notch. Even the packaging was crisp and sealed to perfection.	2004-12-16

At last a volume of Conan tales untainted by overlording editors and PC sensitivity. For pulp realism and ripping ytarns, these are great. TOWER OF THE ELEPHANT and DEVIL IN IRON...so many good ones here, plus outlines and extras....a great read!	2004-02-26

Twenty stories that make one keep turning the pages. These are stories that get in your face and make you shake your head at times. I really liked them all, but a few more than most. &quot;Damnation Angels&quot; rocked. The aging porn star as a bio weapon--Jesus! How did he think of that?<br />That said, the idea of the loner agent, Dack Shannon, is a good one. He works well as a diseffected, cold angel of death in these stories. I loved Nocturnal Vacas, and this is a super follow up. <BR>The book itself is well made and I liked the anarchy symbol embedded on the back cover. 2 thumbs up!	2004-01-25

I really never read anything quite like it before. It surprised me and let my jaw drop a few times. Good. Looking forward to another story about this character. Dack Shannon is an excellent anti-hero for a new century.	2003-08-01

Oft told of in passing (that young Conan was at the Sack of Venarium) turtledove uses his usual forumla....telling the tale from opposing sides of a conflict, here from Aquilonian invaders + settlers (akin to British Imperialism) and the Cimmerian barbarians....rude and clannish. His knowledge of Conan mythos is good (down the the Asura religion &amp; boats references) and I enjoyed this tale a great deal.<BR>It was at least a bit original.<BR>Conan's mother slowly dying was almost too close to home, ala Howards aling mother....etc. Great touch	2003-07-17

The concept was fine: The selected stories could have been better. Were they memorable? The one with pirates and voodoo was good, and the story about the English channel read different and catty, but seemed not to belong here.	2003-05-25

Alek is a terrific character and I look forward to reading more of him in time to come. Excellent in places, murky in others, but still a good read.
