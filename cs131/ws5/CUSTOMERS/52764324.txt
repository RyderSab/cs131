I  really liked the characters although betsy was annoying at times.  Well Eric is yummy.  I love it when I discover an authur that is great the first time I read he or her work.  I cannot wait for the sequel.  I heard it is a trilogy, don't stop there keep writing, I loved it.	2004-03-09
US	52764324	R2GWJ5A3KY82J0	0553584189	551558047	Night Fires	Books	1	3	8	N	N	Horrible story	First why write a vampire story when you want the vampire to become human at the end and not only does she become human the explanation is so silly.   Then what is the point.  The authur puts a vampire in the story to sell it, since vampires are in.  There is really no point in Simone been a vampire.  I mean her other identity is more interesting.  Every time she does something bad she goes to church to confess her sins.  Michael really did not need her to complete his mission.  Come on he is an accomplished assasin and all of a sudden he needs help to accomplish a mission.  After they accomplish the mission SHE BECOMES HUMAN what a waste of time.  I wanted to put this book down so many times.  I took forever to finish it.  Also the description is very misleading.  Since I did not like this book at all, if I read the second book Dark Enchatment.  I will buy it used for .99cents.	2003-12-28

Unfortunately this book was not my cup of tea.  This book was the scarletti curse part 2.  It did not feel a carpathanian book at all.  I had a hard time finishing this book.  It was boring.  Byron the most boring carpathanian of all.  Antonietta was a nynpho. Byron gets shot and is out for three days in a healing sleep.  Which was corny in previous books the healing was for more damage done and by a vampire of massive power.  Which this book was lacking.  The only thing good was more background information on the species.  It is good to be different but this book was so different from the others, that I did not like it.  I could just say if it was your first book you could enjoy it,  but if you are reading the series from the beginning, this book was a huge dissapointment.	2003-03-07

He could be very cruel with Marya at times.  He is very intriging with a fascinating past.  I could not stop reading this book.  &quot;I want some more&quot;.  I cannot wait for the rest of the books.  The love between Marya and Drago was very passionate.  Very realistic the vampire world potrayed in these stories.  This are the most realistic vampires I have encounter.  Vampires that feel real.  I dont like when authors write vampire romances and then the hero turns human, with a rediculous explanation, what is the point of writing the story then.  That is why Jaye's Vampires are the best.	2002-06-18

Dallas was very interesting as a hero.  A killer at that.  But he did not love Tia is was just lust in my opinion. Tia begs him to stay with her. Besides the story happens in five days of action and suspense.  Tia was good heroine who fell head over heels in love with Dallas.  Looking forward in reading more from this authur.  In fact I am reading after Image as I right this review.<br />\\"Death Sucks!\\"	2002-06-15

There was a point were I thought Sarah and Julien were never going to get together. During the first 200 pages the authur never gave any indication that they had and attraction towards each other.  They sleep together one night almost towards the end of the book, and they realize oh we love each other.  Also the book had about three parts that should of been identify.  It was like three stories, with the same characters.  I got to say I was not happy with this read.  I can say Sarah character was well developed, her character matures through out the story.  Corina was a real psycho for a villain. Julien was a boring hero.	2002-03-29

US	52764324	R1L26PHVF49MLQ	0821766929	943742057	When Darkness Falls	Books	4	1	4	N	N	A Very Good Read	This was a great read.  Lucian stood powerfull from the begining until the end of the story.  Lucian's character was simply great.  I cannot say the samething about Jade, as a heroine she was weak character in other words no match for Lucian Power and grace.  Lucian evethough you find things out about his past he still remained very mysterious until the end.  I think jade did not love him enough that is why I was glad when she asked him to be human again he told her no that he was not going to give up what he has become.  I thought the story was good eventhough I have to admit that it was confusing at times, but I have to disagree with the person who said it was a waste of money, to me it was worth buying.  I liked this story better than Beaneath a blood Red  Moon.  I gave it four stars because Jade was weak as a heroine and because the endind did not satisfy me.  It kind of left things hanging.	2001-12-09
