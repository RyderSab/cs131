I've read other erotica/memoirs, but this was very disappointing and not particularly enlightening. In my mind memoirs should offer some insight to a person's life and/or the lives of others that in some way moves the reader from point A to point B. However, The Surrender was boring and evidently written by a person who doesn't realize that millions of men and women around the world happily participate and enjoy anal sex. Bentley simply has issues. Her experiences just were not that deep (no pun intended)--instead it showed how provincial her promiscuous sex life really was/is.	2005-09-07

However, the Hard Truth, though compeling, was very disturbing. I was not expecting such harsh and painful subject matter that by the end did not leave me (the reader) feeling that the character's issues were fully resolved. I was saddened throughout the novel once I discovered the truth about the little girls and the protagonist. This story is not for the faint of heart or the compassionate.

As the previous novels, The Forbidden continues to develop the stories of Damali, Carlos, and the Guardians. Old characters return bringing a fresh look to the story, as well as some interesting surprises.

Minion wasn't my favorite but in a 12+ series everything won't be as good as your favorite (book 4). Banks is now deceased, but was a wonder person. There really isn't anything like this out here.

HiLo was as abusive as anyone could imagine and then some to his wife Della, and his children Kenzie and Malcolm. The entire family lived in fear and denial for years, and suffered with all the pain and psychosis that develops living a life of turmoil. But through it all, I the reader, learned a little bit about what made each character tick. HiLo and Della, both suffered from demons that they were not able to discard from their lives. HiLo, the worst of all, let his pain eat away at his soul. His daily, but slow attempts to kill himself with alcohal was the lesson that his children learned and had to unlearn. How many of us could do that? How many of us could accept that our parents make mistakes, some seemingly unforgiveable. But the simple fact is that if you don't forgive and let go you pick up where your parents left off. That is the lesson in the wonderful novel--more real than fiction.	2002-08-01

Ms. Thomas did an excellent job in developing the characters and the story line, and did it all in less than 150 pages. The main character, Sasha, had all kinds of drama in her life with men, her job, and family. Clearly she, like many people, is addicted to chaos. Even the ending reflected that Sasha still has some issues that she needs to work on.

I listened to the unabridged version and fell asleep on parts of the story without feeling like I missed anything. It took quite a while to get into and understand what was happening with the mysterious blue light, which is never truly explained. Chance, who tells the story of the blue light, is not a character that you come to care about, he's one of many people with a confusing story connecting him with the blue light. The other protaganists did very little to help push the story along, and I could not figure out the reason for the antaganist, Greyman (who by the way was corny). Though parts of the book was interesting, the ending left me highly annoyed. It was over 9 hours of wasted time.	2002-04-06

As always the sensuousness of the characters and of life shines through on every page without disappointment. However, there were times when I felt that pieces of the story were not developed enough. One moment Colin's talking about love and life and without transition he's discussing how to reconcile spiritual disconnectedness and/or beliefs.

I didn't give as much thought as I should have about growing up without a father or reliable father figure. Yet while reading this book, I saw many of my realities on the pages. Regardless of a societies cultural practices, every adult and child has a role to play and when it is compromised or ignored, the social structure falters. That's what Barras was talking about. Every fatherless woman won't have the same experiences, but most must admit that their view of the world is markedly different from women who grew up with positive influences from both parents regardless of their marital status. Clearly some of us adapt better than others, but Barras's theory has merrit.	2002-03-10

I loved how well Eric developed the three central characters. The main character, a male narrator, wears his heart on his sleeve after Nicole, his girlfriend for seven years, stands him up at the alter to be with her lover Ayanna. The Narrator cannot get over his love for Nicole and embarks on an unhealthy relationship with his ex-fiance and later with her girlfriend. Throughout the story, each person learns what he or she will and should do for love. The novel is complete with secrets, passion (enough to make you wave your hand &amp; call up a friend), and pain. It also makes evident where love and obsession may lead, though undoubtedly in the extreme. More significantly, the story demonstrates how important it is not to lose your identity in another person, thereby giving up your power to learn, love, and grow. Ladies and Gentlemen, if the \\"love of your life\\" leaves you, then let them go--your future will only be better, brighter, and healthier. No one should go through the drama that the Narrator, Nicole, or Ayanna go through.	2001-09-25

Unlike now, black and brown children/adults were not commonly seen in the average German neigborhood.  Yet, Hans managed to make it to manhood without physical harm amidst Nazi descrimination and the wartime bombings that set his life mentaly and physically on fire. Someone above must have been watching this man, and kept a guiding hand on his back.  Nothing about his position in life prevented him from becoming a casualty of war. But Hans managed to survive and leave Germany, reunite with his estranged African family, and obtain his &quot;American Dream.&quot; What I appreciated the most with this bio was that Hans was able to laugh in the midsts of horrible circumstances and remain resourceful.  Though things were hard, he never gave up hope that something else would come along to do the trick.  He perservered, and that gives me hope and understanding that if I perservere then I too will be where I am suppossed to be. Based on Hans's accounts, most if not all of us can make a pleasent life for ourselves. No one is dropping bombs on us.	2001-06-21

The original characters, Jessica, Dawit, and Alex are back along with some new faces that make the novel both thrilling and mysterious to read.  The novel opens with the birth of Jessica and Dawit's daughter Fana.  We had a hint of what Fana was like in My Soul to Keep, but we find there's much more to who and what Fana is and will become.  What's more, it is Jessica's responsibility to care for Fana while trying to put the past and her past love for Dawit behind her even after the three of them are finally reunited.  Due does an excellent job in taking the reader through a series of twist and turns without being confusing or neglectful of character development. I enjoyed this exploration of the unknown and what ifs, and recommend this to all readers. <br />P.S.: For the faint of heart, the novel is not scary.	2001-05-23

However, the women, except Desiree, were mean, stupid, and/or unrealistic. We all know women that exhibit negative traits, but that's because no one is perfect. What's more, no one seemed able have a decent relationship with a Black man (unless the Black man was with a White woman). Instead the only positive relationships were made up of interracial couples. In fact the only Black male relationship explored was with a Black gay male who was involved with a man of mixed heritage. Not even he could have a relationship with an African American person, male or female. In my opinion, the author has major issues with Black women, and she may be a little color struck as well.	2001-01-18

Ms. Roberts did an excellent job in detailing the racism behind reproduction and family planning as it pertains to Black women.  I heard of unauthorized sterilizations, but had no idea of how wide-spread such  policies went nor that they are present in today's society.  It seems that  women, especially Black women can't get a fair break.  I'll never  understand how someone else can tell someone what to do with their body.  Yet these same people refuse to put the same energy and money in education  and real healthcare. We have to take this knowledge and educate our  brothers and sisters so that it can stop.	2000-06-15

It also tells what happens when one hides from the truth.  But when the characters finally get love right, love for self and their love for others,  the passion of the characters explode onto the pages of this novel. All of  the characters have a rythm of their own, similar to the joy and pain felt  in something like a good sounding blues song.  Some characters put limits  on their love, some used the love that others had for them to cower behind  life's hardships.  I think that this is the best book by Whetstone thus  far. It was such a sweet, passionate, slow, blues-jazzy read that I didn't  want the music to stop.	2000-05-26
