Patton into America's most famous general of World War II.  Blumenson paints an authentic, if not an all together flattering, picture of the man he obviously admires giving this work even more credibility.  His primary source is impeccable:  Patton's own correspondence composes most of the text.    The key events are all discussed:  Patton's early upbringing which placed him near, but not at the apex of class conscious American society at the turn of the century.  His obsession to reach the summit would forever be a driving force in his life.  Next was is military education at The Virginia Military Institute and West Point followed by his marriage to Beatrice Ayres which greatly aided his standing socially and economically.  This was followed by service with his mentor, General of the Armies, John, J. \\"Blackjack,\\" Pershing in Mexico and again in France in WWI where he served as chief architect of American tank forces.  The men he trained here would ultimately make this old horse cavalryman, a legend.    Patton was both a shameless social climber, and a most serious student of his profession.  He seemed equally motivated by the relentless drive to succeed and his abject fear of failure.  Vain, pompous, profane, well read, and militarily proficient, he would go on to become, arguably, the greatest General on either side in WWII.    This book is more than the history of a man; it is the history of the U.S. Army from the turn of the century until the countdown to WWII.  Easily read and understood, it is an outstanding addition to the library of any serious student of our nation's military history.  A great read.  5 Stars!!     Harold Y. Grooms	2005-09-09

It's Origins and Development	Rudolf Hoess oversaw the construction and operations of Auschwitz for almost three years.  This account, taken from a hand written text prepared while he awaited trial differs little from the one published in, Death Dealer:  The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz.  (Prometheus Books Buffalo, New York, 1992)  A review of that work shown below.  After this, my second reading of his memoirs, several thoughts come to mind:     Hoess joined the SS for the right reason:  to do his patriotic duty.     Himmler himself involuntarily assigned him to concentration camp duty.     Refusing an order in combat is said to be a death sentence in all armies, including ours.  In the SS, it was enforced.     Hoess himself said he was worthy of a death sentence.  Was he?    A Baptist minister once said, \\"You folks think the Devil is gonna jump up outta the ground in a red suit and a pitchfork and say, \\"Hi!  I'm the devil and I'm here to do a job on ya!\\"  He's smarter than that!\\"  The Nazi's presented themselves as good, God-fearing, patriotic citizens whose only goal was to restore their countries' lost honor.  Only at the last did they show their true colors.  Hoess, and millions of other Germans were victims of this, the greatest mass deception in history.    Review of Death Dealer:  The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz.    On April 16, 1947, Rudolf Hoess, the infamous Kommandant of Auschwitz was hanged in his former concentration camp for, \\"crimes against the Polish people.\\" While awaiting trial, Hoess, who knew he would pay for his crimes with his life, sought to renew the spiritual connection he had eschewed as a youth. Accordingly, he recounted his time in the SS for his captors. His story is also that of the darkest side of the Third Reich.     The book begins with a discussion of the, \\"final solution,\\" of the Jewish Question. He tells how he was ordered to establish a camp at Auschwitz for the purpose of eliminating, \\"enemies of the state.\\" Details of camp construction and experiments to find the appropriate gas he describes without emotion. Yet he relates questions asked by young SS soldiers and inmates as to how small children could be an \\"enemy.\\" His \\"party line\\" response fooled some, but never himself.     Hoess also describes the victims he tried to destroy. Jews had \\"strong family ties;\\" gypsies were, \\"childlike;\\" the Jehovah's Witnesses were worthy of emulation. The SS was challenged to have the same devotion to the Fuhrer as they had to Jehovah. In chapter 22 he describes the gassing process as only he could do. His primary concern was to dispatch his victims quickly and efficiently without displaying emotion that would affect young guards. Here, he admits, he hid behind an iron mask. Particularly interesting is the story of a young, extremely attractive, Jewish girl who fought back even as she was undressing for the gas chamber. Resistance was rare but in this case, effective, deadly effective!     The book describes his early life and the events that caused him and many others to blindly follow the SS motto: \\"Fuhrer, you order. We obey!\\" Hoess gives a detailed description of the hierarchy of the SS. Men, who had been portrayed as super-human, are shown to have been far short of that ideal. Alcoholism and suicide rates were high; competence was low! Still, operations continued despite all difficulties because, \\"Orders were orders!\\"     Death Dealer is a first person account of the operations of the most infamous death camp in history. After sending an estimated 2.5 million people to their deaths, the Kommandant, ended his life by doing one decent thing: he left his memoirs so no one could deny this ever happened. For that, the world owes Rudof Hoess, the Kommandant of Auschwitz, a debt of gratitude.	2005-06-30

On August 6th, 1945 Hiroshima, Japan became the first city to be destroyed by an atomic weapon.  Three days later, Nagasaki suffered a second atomic attack.  On August 14th, Japanese Emperor Hirohito announced he was planning to surrender.  A Japanese delegation signed the instrument of surrender on the deck of the battleship Missouri September 2nd, 1945.  These facts are known to almost every school child. What is not known is what happened to the survivors.  Author Robert Jay Lifton attempts to explain both the physical and psychological effects in this work.    He begins with a description of the physical effects.  Survivors, called \\"hibakusha\\" meaning, \\"explosion affected person(s) vividly describe the blast, heat, and radiation effects on themselves and others.  However psychologist, Lifton, devotes the majority of this work to the psychological effects that received little attention.  Hibakusha, developed several theories to cope with their experience:    1. Why us?  We were a small city of limited military importance.  2. We were guinea pigs.  The Americans wanted to test their new bomb.  We were their lab rats.  3. Racial bias.  They only use weapons like that on the colored races.  4. The people responsible will suffer divine retribution for their actions.  5. We, the survivors, have a mission to explain the horrors of nuclear war to the entire world!      Once militaristic Japan turned totally pacifistic after the war.  However, Japan has never come to terms with its own misdeeds in World War II, which explains the reactions of the survivors.  The author also fails to acknowledge Japan has been able to divest itself of military expenditures only due to America's nuclear umbrella.    While reading I was struck by the similarity between hibakusha and Vietnam veterans.  Both were traumatized by their experience.  Both were ostracized by their countrymen after the war.  Hibakusha were deemed incapable or unwilling to work due to \\"A-Bomb Disease.\\"  Viet vets were similarly shunned as being \\"walking time bombs\\" that might \\"flash back\\" at any moment.  Pity them both, but hide the women and kids when they are around was/is the theory, thus adding to their difficulties.    This work is the first to explore the psychological and sociological aspects of the attack.  In a world that is seemingly losing its horror of \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" since World War I, it is important to review as terrorists now strive openly to acquire chemical and nuclear weapons.  My last criticism is, toward the end, Lifton, is seemingly writing to fellow psychologists, instead of laymen such as myself.  Still, it is an important and very informative work. Highly recommended!    Harold Y. Grooms	2005-06-15

Lifton chronicles the Holocaust from a unique perspective:  the role played by Nazi medical doctors.  In doing so he explains the Nazi philosophy that formed the basis for mass murder:  the necessity to heal the ills of German society by eliminating all its corrupting influences.  Healing was and is the raison d'etre for the medical profession.  Doctors were thus compelled to become killers in the application of this all encompassing \\"cure.\\"<br /><br />Lifton traces the evolution of the Holocaust beginning with the \\"euthanasia\\" projects of the 30's.  Anyone incapable of being a productive member of society was consided, \\"life unworthy of life\\" and euthanized.  Initially this was confined to the mentally challenged and the old/infirmed.  Later even severely wounded German soldiers were not spared.  Execution technology perfected here formed the basis for the mass executions conducted later.<br /><br />Lifton interviews many physicians in this work including some former Nazi's and many Jewish doctors forced to work at Auschwitz.  Here, the inner conflicts of persons trained to heal but actively involved in killing reached its apex.  Reactions varied from the cold, view of inmates as \\"laboratory rats\\" and nothing more by Josef Mengele, to the tortured acceptance of the necessity of doing his duty of Eduard Wirths.  Coping mechanisms included sending others to do the \\"dirty work\\" when possible, excessive use of alcohol, and in some cases, suicide.  Still, the work went on, despite any internal contradictions.<br /><br />This is the first work I have seen that explained the Nazi philosophy and its impact on the Holocaust.  Because it was the stated goal of National Socialism to cleanse German society of all its ills, the participation of healers was essential.  The Nazi's never wavered in this twisted belief.  Would the Holocaust have occurred without the doctor's participation?  Undoubtedly, yes!  However doe's this excuse their participation?  You the reader must decide.  A great read.

In 1946, trial was held for 24 of the highest-ranking Nazi's, in Nuremberg, Germany.  Arraigned on four counts including, conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, 12 were sentenced to death by hanging, two others, to death in absentia, three to life imprisonment, two to twenty years, one to fifteen years, and one to ten years.  Three were found not guilty.  While awaiting trail, American psychiatrist, Leon Goldensohn, interviewed each of the defendants and key witnesses.  This is their story.<br /><br />Goldensohn lets each man describe his role in the Third Reich, in his own words.  Readers get an insight into the demented thought processes of Hitler's Deputy, Rudolf Hess, and that of the vain and pompous Reich Marshal, Hermann Goering et. al.  How and why 2.5 million people were gassed at Auschwitz it told without emotion by it's notorious Commandant, Rudolph Hoess.  Common reasons were:<br /><br /> \\"I knew nothing!\\"<br /> \\"I was given only enough information to do my job.\\"<br /> \\"The Holocaust was the work of Hitler, Himmler, and Borman.\\"<br /> \\"I was only following orders!\\"<br /><br />Goldensohn allows the reader to determine each interviewee's degree of guilt or innocence.  What is amazing is the candor of the men who tell exactly what they did and why without reservation.  Almost all deny any wrongdoing!  \\"I was only following orders,\\" seemed an adequate defense to men raised under Nazi tutelage throughout their lives.<br /><br />Nuremberg firmly established the principle of individual responsibility for crimes committed even during time of war.  While the first, it was, by no means, the \\"final\\" solution to crimes against peace or humanity.  The Nuremberg Interviews explains the motivations of the men most directly responsible for the deaths of an estimated 6 million people.  This work is therefore a must read for anyone interested in the history of the Third Reich or the Holocaust.  5 stars!!	2005-04-11

He theorizes the folkways they brought with them explain how and why different regions in America developed as they did.  He believes they are still having an impact today. <br /> <br />The first migration was the Puritans.  They emanated from Southeast England from 1629 until 1641 and settled in the Massachusetts area.  Strict, pious, and extremely frugal, they fled religious persecution in England only to deny religious liberty to all but their own in New England. <br /> <br />The second were the, \\"Distressed Cavaliers and Indentured Servants,\\" who left Southwest England between 1642 and 1675 settling principally in Virginia.  The ruling elite, primarily the second sons of noblemen, brought with them the sense of pride and honor of which so many Southern legends are told. <br /> <br />Third were the, \\"Friends,\\" commonly called, \\"Quakers,\\" who settled in Pennsylvania from 1675-1725.  Emanating from the northern midlands, they were tolerant, hard working men and women who eschewed violence as they followed the, \\"inner light,\\" they believed indwelled all mankind. <br /> <br />Last were the Scotch-Irish who settled what was called, \\"the back country.\\"  Coming from the northern borderlands of England, these people brought a fierce pride and a warrior ethic that translated into many blood feuds in what is now Appalachia.   <br /> <br />Fischer theorizes this pattern of regionalism persists to this day.  He cites as evidence the fact that political candidates must seek to appeal to more than one region if they hope to be elected nationally.  George Bush's and Jimmy Carter's elections are two examples.     <br /> <br />This work first came to my attention when it was used as a reference in upper level history classes.  While it is long, (898 pages plus the index with numerous footnotes), it is a valuable asset to anyone seriously studying how and why things have developed as they have in this nation.  I strongly recommend it to any serious student of the history or sociology of this nation.  Five Stars!! <br />	2005-03-23

Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, and sometimes, President Lyndon B. Johnson would then explain the necessity of holding this remote, landing strip on the Laotian border.  None of this made any difference to the Marines.  They were preoccupied with one thing:  staying alive!  The place was called, Khe Sanh.  Author John Corbett was a Marine Private there.  This short book tells his story.  It's the story of  6000 other Marines as well.     Corbett was a young man looking for adventure.  He more than found it at Khe Sanh!  During his time there, he was subjected to shellings of up to 1500 rounds per day fired by, \\"Mister Charlie,\\" the North Vietnamese Regular (NVA) Army troops assigned to make Khe Sanh, Americas' Dien Bien Phu.  Completely isolated and surrounded by the NVA who outnumbered them 7 to 1, their grim determination made the NVA pay a heavy price trying to take this extinct volcano overlooking the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  To the Marines credit, they never did!    Corbett describes the daily life of the troops on the ground:  the daily rituals of eating C Rations, burning waste, the elation of \\"mail call,\\" filling and carrying water containers, and `humping\\" ammunition to the guns, all done while walking in a low crouch called the \\"Khe Sanh shuffle.\\"   He tells how he learned to listen for telltale signs of enemy \\"incoming\\" rounds.  Once detected, you had only seconds to find a hole, or die.  He talks about his fellow Marines, where they were from, their hopes, dreams etc. and shows how a strong bond was forged between them.  He vividly describes the relentless shelling they endured daily.  His story has that authentic ring that only comes from someone who has, \\"been there.\\"    West Dickens Avenue gives the reader a foxholes eye view of one of the most significant battles in Vietnam.  Short and easilyunderstood, it should be read by everyone going into combat and by the men who contemplate sending them there.  His story verifies General Robert E. Lee's famous statement, \\"War seldom avails anything to those unfortunate enough to have to fight it.\\"	2005-01-23

Wade:  Victory or Holocaust	This short, highly readable book outlines the steps that led to the passage of Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in America.  Few cases have had the impact on society this one has had.  Proponents hail its passage as a \\"victory for women's rights.\\"  Opponents say it has ushered in a Holocaust that dwarfs anything done Nazi death camps.  Almost everyone has a strong opinion.  No one is neutral. <br /> <br />Stevens begins by ridiculing the crusade led by Anthony Comstock of Connecticut and the Roman Catholic Church to rid America of vice in the late 18 and 1900's, which included information on birth control.  He then praises early women's rights advocate Margaret Sanger's efforts in fighting them.  He then reviews Texas Attorney Sarah Weddington's efforts in preparing her case for legalizing abortion to the Supreme Court.  Particularly interesting is her search for a typical victim to use in her class action suit that led her to Norma McCorvey aka, Jane Roe.  He then spends a great deal of time enumerating the, sometimes violent, efforts of pro-life supporters to end abortion and hails the punitive damages awarded \\"victims\\" of their protests.  He ends by proposing a truce between reasonable people on both sides of the issue to work together to make abortion rare while protecting the legal sanctity of \\"a woman's right to choose.\\" <br /> <br />Only 175 short pages in length, this book should be read by people on both sides of the issue.  Stevens is a gifted writer who presents the issues well.  Readers will be much better informed after spending two hours or so reading this work. <br /> <br />Few people are neutral on abortion.  The author is not; neither is this reviewer.  The fact remains; every time an abortion is performed a child dies.  Dehumanizing terms such as, \\"fetus,\\" \\"product of conception,\\" \\"fetal tissue,\\" etc. doesn't change that.  As a pro-lifer, I totally reject the proposed compromise the author suggests designed to make abortion safe, legal and rare.  Forty-three to forty-five million abortions have been performed since Roe v. Wade.  Abortion is therefore, safe, and, thanks to Roe v. Wade, legal.  But it is anything but rare.  I pledge to use the information in this work in my efforts to eliminate this scourge on our nation's history and honor.  Interestingly enough, Norma McCorvey, aka, Jane Roe, now supports our efforts as well. <br /> <br />	2005-01-16

Josef Stalin	In this brief narrative, author William H. Vatcher chronicles deliberations leading to the armistice that ended the Korean War July 27, 1953.  It was at Panmunjom we first encountered communist tactics of using peace talks as a propaganda weapon.  Months were wasted investigating trumped up charges of \\"germ warfare\\" and other \\"war crimes\\" committed against the North Koreans and their Chinese allies allowing them to portray themselves as victims of \\"aggression.\\"  Communist tactics endured at Panmunjom would be seen again by U.S. negotiators in Paris, attempting to end the Vietnamese stalemate.  North Vietnamese Politboro Member, Le Duc Tho would subject Henry Kissinger to virtually the same diatribe endured by Admiral Charles Turner Joy and Lieutenant General William K. Harrison Jr. twenty years earlier.  (See White House Years, by Henry Kissinger)  Soviet Premier Josef Stalin said it best:<br /><br /> \\"A diplomats words must have no relation to actions-otherwise what kind of diplomacy is it?  Words are one thing, actions another.  Good words are a concealment of bad deeds.  Sincere diplomacy is no more possible than dry water or iron wood.\\"<br /><br />For once Stalin was telling the truth!  Vatcher's work is an encapsulated prophesy of what free-world diplomats would endure until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  It includes a copy of the Text of the Armistice Agreement and a Chronology of the Military Armistice Conference, which makes this work a valuable addition to the library of any military historian.  Reading this account of an almost forgotten chapter in what has been called, \\"the forgotten war,\\" provides valuable insights on how and why the Cold War was fought.  It also provides a blueprint for dealing with our current adversaries in the Middle East.  Clear, concise, easily read, and very informative, I highly recommend this work	2004-12-06

David Halberstam's, \\"The Best and the Brightest,\\" provides an inside look at the political situation and the sociological background of our national leaders that made going to Vietnam seem a necessity.    He shows how they deluded themselves on some issues and ignored others in drawing up a plan for victory that would have won against any industrialized nation in the world.  It simply did not work in a small, underdeveloped country called Vietnam. <br /> <br />Halberstam lists the impressive educational credentials of each of the key players who led us into Vietnam.  These exceptionally gifted men all agreed on the following assumptions: <br /> <br />1. Communism was evil. <br />2. The only thing the Soviets respected was force. <br />3. Fighting the Red threat was the right thing to do morally. <br />4. Failing to stand up to the Soviets would only invite more aggression.  No one wanted to be another Neville Chamberlain. <br />5. Failing to stop the Communists in Vietnam would start the dominos falling.  Where they would stop could not be predicted. <br /> <br />Halberstam severely indicts the military system that consistently reported, \\"All is well,\\" when it was apparent that Saigon teetered on the brink of defeat.  The Diem/Ngo regime had no legitimacy.  No amount of American firepower could provide it.  Such reports were sent because the military and political establishments in Washington demanded them.  In effect, LBJ and Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara were kept blissfully ignorant of the real situation because they demanded to be.  Messengers, such as John Paul Vann et al., who delivered realistic reports, were shot professionally, clearly, a recipe for disaster.   <br /> <br />Another contributing factor was the national trauma inflicted upon America by the fall of China leading to Senator Joe McCarthy's purge of the State Department.  Virtually the entire Far East Directorate was exiled or emasculated by security investigations.  This left only thosewith conventional European backgrounds unscathed politically to formulate a strategy for a highly unconventional war in Asia.  The combination of refusing to hear bad news, and applying a conventional, military strategy in an unconventional, political, war led to the quagmire that was Vietnam.   <br /> <br />Halberstam's work provides a clear view of the thought processes of the men in the decision-making arena.  By hearing only optimistic reports, they deluded themselves into thinking real progress was being made.  Thus, \\"The Best and the Brightest,\\" became, \\"The Emperors Who Had No Clothes.\\"  His research is impressive however his anti-war, anti-military bias clearly shows through.  Readers should note this work was completed in 1972, at the height of the anti-war movement, in which he boasts he was a prominent member.  On page 250 he calls McNamara a, \\"fool,\\" and in the Author's Notes (page 671) he apologizes for not, \\"having been better.\\"  Thus, his title, \\"The Best and the Brightest,\\" reeks of sarcasm.

How this man, who rose from humble beginnings to become the equivalent of a major general, railed helplessly against the system that constantly proclaimed victory was eminent when the Viet-Cong were making gains daily, indicts American military and political leaders for deluding themselves on what was happening.  His gloom-and-doom prophesies made many enemies up and down the chain of command.  Unfortunately, he was proven correct.<br />The story of Vann's childhood shows how this illegitimate son of an alcoholic prostitute became determined to succeed against all odds.  It also showed how the seeds of destruction that ultimately ended his military career and his marriage, were sewn.  Readers interested only in Vietnam can skip this part.<br />As a divisional advisor, Vann observed that the South Vietnamese usually avoided contact and always left the Viet Cong with an escape route.  Their deficiencies were graphically displayed at the Battle of Ap Bac in 1963.  The Army of the Republic of South Vietnam's (ARVN) defeat and America's whitewash of it established the pattern that was followed throughout our time there.  Clearly, we were headed for trouble.<br />Vann was later forced to leave the Army due to a private vice that would haunt him throughout his life.  This section shows how child abuse can affect an individual.  If you skipped the part on his early life, go back and read it.  <br />As a military and later civilian advisor through AID, Vann never ceased attempting to sell his plan to power-brokers who could change America's tactics and give us a realistic chance to win.  His advice was ignored until it was too late.  The reader is left to ponder the question, what if this \\"voice crying in the wilderness\\" had been heeded?  Where would South Vietnam be today?<br />John Vann's tragedy is America's tragedy as well.  Confronted by a political/military establishment that was convinced of its own invincibility after World Wars I and II, he worked tirelessly to show his leaders we could and would lose if radical changes were not made.  His futile efforts at preventing that loss is an indictment of the system that failed to heed the warnings of those on the ground who actually saw what was happening.

Clark, Commander of United Nations Forces in Korea, narrates the difficulty of negotiating with the Communists at Panmunjom while simultaneously dealing with Washington and South Korean President Syngman Rhee.  In doing so, he paints a prophetic picture of cold war political relations that would last for the next forty years.<br />Clark came to Korea after a successful campaign in Italy in World War II.  He soon found Korea was a different story.  The enemy was granted sanctuaries from which he could strike without fear of retaliation due to political restrictions, violating every principle of war.  Future wars waged under the same restrictions would produce similarly results.  Military and diplomatic planners for Vietnam would have profited by reading this work.<br />Washington wanted the war ended as soon as possible.  South Korean President Syngman Rhee's answer to an armistice that would leave his country divided was, \\"Never!!\\"  Clark agreed with Rhee but knew America had selected a no win strategy.  An armistice that preserved half of Korea was the best he could do.  Today, Korea remains a divided country with armed forces facing each other over battle lines drawn in 1953.  Hopefully, Rhee's dream of a free, united Korea will eventually be realized to the benefit of people North and South of the 38th Parallel.<br />This short book, written only a few months after the armistice was signed, showed exactly how the Communists would conduct themselves in the future.  William Westmoreland, Creighton Abrams and Henry Kissinger would be subjected to the same tactics in the field and at the negotiating table later.  We owe much to men such as Clark who fought an inhuman foe on the battlefield and at the peace table to preserve freedom for as many as possible.<br />Today, it is common practice to denounce the \\"cold war\\" mentality that, some say, led us into Vietnam.  This book effectively shows that cold war fears had a very real basis in fact.  Young readers who have not and will not grow up under the threat of a nuclear holocaust and are looking for an answer to why we spent billions to defend against the reds should read this work.  The threat was both significant and real.  This and other incidents proved it.shows that cold war fears had a very real basis in fact.

When, where and how to employ them against the enemy and take the load off the U.S.S.R. were overwhelming concerns.  Time, distance, shipping shortages and politics all played a role.  Book one chronicles the Japanese onslaught in the Pacific.  This seemingly invincible armada went from victory to victory capturing strongholds that had been British possessions for centuries.  Preoccupied with operations in the Mediterranean and North Africa the British and Americans could do almost nothing.  Meanwhile German U-Boats supported by the Luftwaffe continued to interdict Allied convoys attempting to supply both Britain and Russia who was bearing the brunt of the Nazi ground attack.  Ignoring the realities of the U-Boat menace and of the complexities of conducting an amphibious assault large enough to draw German troops away from the Russian front Stalin continued to press for more and more supplies and the establishment of a Second Front “NOW!”  Book Two discusses in detail the British campaign in North Africa.  Great Britain who had battled the Nazi’s virtually alone in the west since 1939 was desperately hungry for a victory.  Their prayers answered with General Montgomery’s defeat of Rommel’s vaunted Africa Corp at the Battle of el Alamein October 23 through November 5, 1942 followed by Operation Torch, the joint U.S. and British invasion of French Morocco and Algeria November 8 through 16 that same year.  With North Africa secure the Allies turned their attention to Sicily and Italy, thus ending this volume.  Churchill’s memoirs provide keen insights to both the battle strategies employed by the commanders and to the political considerations of each.  Throughout Churchill and FDR seemed to be in almost complete agreement, their contentious allies Josef Stalin, Charles de Gaulle and Madam Chang Kai-shek less so.  Still they managed to hold “The Grand Alliance” together long enough to defeat Hitler, the great battle upon which the fate of the world hinged. Five Stars!!	2004-02-28

Fall chronicles America's ever deepening involvement in Vietnam drawing parallels to his native France's involvement earlier.    Published from notes and tape recordings recovered after his death in 1967 from a Vietcong booby trap, he shows the triumph and tragedy of that conflict for both sides.  A clear warning emerged:  America was headed down the same, \\"Street Without Joy,\\" traveled by France a few years earlier.<br />Fall begins with a short history of the country.  Vietnam has been dominated, through the ages, by a host of foreign powers:  first, China, then France, then, during World War II, Japan, and finally the U.S.  The reader sympathizes with nationalist leaders like Ho Chi Minh after reviewing Fall's indictment of the French colonial administration.  Feelings change after reading how Franklin Roosevelt allowed the slaughter of his allies, the Free-French forces fighting against his bitter enemies, the Japanese, in order to insure France would never return to Indo-China as a colonial power.<br />In the post World War II period, America's preoccupation with the U.S.S.R.and the PRC and its vacillating foreign policy regarding Indo-China provided the Communists with numerous opportunities to entrench themselves north and south of the 17th parallel.  After France's humiliation at Dien Bien Phu America was left to \\"contain communism\\" in Southeast Asia alone.  To do this we had to support the repressive dictatorship of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem whose police state tactics had thoroughly alienated the populace.  His chapter on, \\"Viet-Nam's Twelve Elections,\\" is particularly enlightening; call it \\"democracy\\" at its absolute worst!<br />He then examines numerous successful and unsuccessful insurgencies worldwide and shows how conditions were similar or dissimilar in Viet Nam.  By simply enumerating the number of South Vietnamese provinces not paying taxes and counting the number of Saigon appointed village chiefs assassinated annually, he predicted the regime would fall.  The South Vietnamese government simply did not have the popular support necessary to survive even with massive U.S. support.  Sadly, his predictions would be proven true a few years after his death.<br />Fall's work is a first hand account of the shortcomings of French and America policy that led to a Communist victory.  Inspired by the plight of North and South Vietnamese, and later, French and American soldiers in the field, men who bore the brunt of the ill-conceived policies of their leader's, Last Reflections stands as a tribute to the fallen of both sides.  Hopefully the spirit of freedom that has motivated the Vietnamese peasant to struggle against domination through the ages is still alive today, even under the repressive, Communist dictatorship currently in power in Vietnam.  If so, the present leaders of Vietnam should beware!	2004-01-15

He then reviews Jerusalem's pivotal role in international events, and ends with prophesies for the future supported by scripture.  The result is a scathing indictment and warning against anti-Semitism.<br />Hagee begins with a review of well-documented crimes against Jews perpetrated, through the ages, by people claiming to be Christians.  The perverted gospel they preached and practiced was, persecute a Jew and God will reward you for avenging the murder of his son.  His next chapter is entitled, \\"Who Really Killed Christ.\\"  Readers will gain many scriptural and historical insights from these short passages.<br />Next, he narrates Jerusalem's crucial role in international events, past, present and future.  He describes the elation of battle hardened, Israeli soldiers who became the first Jews to pray at the Wailing Wall in 2000 years after recapturing their ancient capital in 1948.   He then mentions the four wars that have followed it.  In each case, Israel triumphed over militarily superior Arab forces, proving God has never and will never abandon his chosen people.  <br />Hagee closes with predictions for the future.  He states plainly no \\"roadmap\\" or any other  \\"peace settlement\\" that takes land away from ancient Israel will stand.  God himself established the boundaries of Israel and personally bequeathed it to the Jews.  No manmade treaty can change this.<br />The only thing missing is a plea for the Jews to finally recognize Jesus as the Messiah.  Certainly, they are the chosen people of God and are directly responsible for the spread of Christianity worldwide.  Had this been done, I would have given it five stars instead of four.  Still, Hagee does a masterful job of explaining historical events in light of biblical prophecy.  Well done!!	2004-01-01

In this second-of-six volume series on Great Britain's role in World War II (WWII) British Prime Minister Winston Churchill details his nation's involvement in the conflict beginning with France's unexpected capitulation in May, 1940, to the defeat of Italian forces at Sidi Barrani in Africa in January, 1941.  At a time when Britain stood alone, only an iron will to persevere and the English Channel prevented a Nazi takeover.  In Churchill's words, this may very well have been, \\"Their Finest Hour.\\"<br />Churchill narrates an almost daily account of activities worldwide that affected Great Britain and the British Empire.  He recounts the Battle of Britain and analyzes the reasons for Germany's defeat.  It was here, he made his famous statement regarding the Royal Air Force, \\"Never has so much, been owed by so many, to so few.\\"  He also goes into great detail on his on-going negotiations with Franklin D. Roosevelt for American aid.  This early correspondence would develop into the alliance that ultimately proved fatal to the Nazis.  <br />This first-person account of some of the most momentous events of the 20th century is essential reading for any serious student of the war.  Churchill provides numerous insights, that are largely unknown to American readers schooled only in the, \\"we hit the beach at D-Day and Germany surrendered,\\" mentality.  Written in simple, yet elegant prose, Churchill explains exactly what happened and why from the British perspective.  , Detailed, readable and authoritative, \\"Their Finest Hour,\\" has inspired me to read all six volumes of this important work. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking insights into this tragic and exciting period of world history.	2003-08-15

Shirer's, \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is the definitive history of that regime.  He takes the reader from Hitler's early years as a waif in Vienna, to his service in the trenches of France in WWI, to the beginnings of the Nazi movement in post WWI Germany, through his ultimate rise to power, and finally to his downfall.  Written by a journalist who witnessed firsthand the events he describes and had unrestricted access to volumes of Nazi government documents, Shirer produced the most complete work on that subject ever.  His work is as important today as it was when it was first published, perhaps more so.<br />Hitler and his entourage produced a blueprint for dictators that is still being followed.  The plan is simple:  seize power by any means necessary, then use state assets to effectively control the population.  In Germany, the Hitler Youth replaced hearth and home.  Schools taught only the Nazi philosophy.  The media broadcast the \\"Party\\" line exclusively.  Churches?  \\"They will preach what we want them to preach,\\" stated Hitler.  Bound by these constraints an entire generation did the bidding of their Nazi masters without question.  It can happen again, anywhere, including the U.S.A.  It's a warning worth heeding.  Adolph Hitler is alive and well today!<br />Hitler alive?  Yes!  He showed up as Josef Stalin in the U.S.S.R., and again as Mao Tse Tung and his \\"Cultural Revolution\\" in China.  He appeared as Idi Amin in Uganda, thoughtfully providing his executioners with an unlimited supply of marijuana after dispatching their victims with iron bars.  He turned up again as Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, his \\"Concentration Camps\\" now being called, \\"New Economic Zones\\" and \\"Reeducation Centers,\\" and subsequently as Pol Pot in the \\"Killing Fields\\" of Cambodia.  He surfaced in the Mid-East as Saddam and his acid baths in Iraq and appears regularly as Hezbollah/ Hammas suicide bombers in Israel.  Air travelers constantly fear he will reappear as an Al Quida terrorist working for Osama bin Laden.  And let us not forget, almost 50 million people have died in abortion clinics here in the U.S., far more than died at Auschwitz, Treblinka etc.  The dictators named simply follow Adolph's plan. And like the democracies of the Nazi Era, we stand idly by while they conduct their nefarious activities.  We have no right to criticize the British, the French or even the Germans.  We are as guilty as they!<br />Edmund Burk said, \\"The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\\"  Shirer has shown the world how dictators operate.  Armed with this knowledge, we should be able to prevent despots from rising to power.  Clearly, this we have not done.  The Allies did nothing until it was almost too late.

Author, Jeff Shaara, shows their values, and emotions in order to explain why they acted as they did. Going beyond the simple facts of most history texts, he shows the human side of the war experience, complete with the fear, elation, pride, love, and hate that characterized the conflict. <br />The book begins by giving the backgrounds of all four men. Lee the southern aristocrat; Jackson, the devoutly religious military instructor, Hancock, the supply officer serving in an obscure post; Chamberlain, the college professor-turned-soldier. Shaara depicts each as a self-less individual who placed devotion to duty above personal gain. America has never produced finer men!<br />Chinese War Philosopher, Sun Tzu, once said, \\"A herd of deer led by a lion is more to be feared than a herd of lions led by a deer.\\" Shaara shows how the \\"Lions\\" of the Confederacy, Lee and Jackson, outmaneuvered their Union counterparts at Manassas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville overcoming Union material superiority with daring and an indomitable will to succeed. Maps accompany word pictures making the maneuvers of Lee and Jackson most clear. Early on the South was truly led by \\"lions;\\" Union soldiers by \\"deer,\\" with disastrous results. <br />Napoleon said, \\"In war, the moral is to the physical as three is to one.\\" Good leadership by Confederate officers produced a moral bond between officers and men that raised the morale of the Army of Northern Virginia to heights that more than overcame its lack of material resources. Shaara shows well supplied, but poorly led, Union soldiers died more from inadequate leadership than from Confederate bullets. Sun Tzu and Napoleon were both proven right in this the early stages of the war.<br />The book ends with the death of Jackson, and Lee's subsequent plan to invade the north in order to strike a decisive blow that would cause Union forces to sue for peace. That episode is a story for another book, \\"The Killer Angels,\\" by the author's father. I can hardly wait to read it!! <br />This book was made into a movie by the same name. No matter which side you favored, Gods and Generals, lets you see why and how these men of honor fought so hard and so long. Read it! Then go see the movie and be transported back to battlefields where, \\"uncommon valor was a common virtue,\\" and honor was more important than life itself. I cannot recommend it highly enough!!	2003-04-16

From \\"Jennies\\" to B-29's, from a Second Lieutenant to Five Stars, General of the Army Henry H. Arnold chronicles the history of military aviation in this autobiographical account of his 42-year career. \\"Hap\\" begins with the earliest days of aviation starting with the Wright Brothers. He then describes the role played by aviators in two world wars, and ends with the first stirrings of the Cold War. In simple terms you hear learn how it really was from a key leader in the greatest conflicts of the 20th Century.<br />World War I ended before America could bring its full weight to bear. When the Armistice was signed, the U.S. was still struggling to create an Army. America was reduced to begging and borrowing equipment, including planes, for her pilots to fly. As a result, U.S. military aviators never had a chance to demonstrate their true potential. Germany and Japan recognized aviation's potential. The U.S did not! America would pay a high price for her shortsightedness a short time later.<br />He then details the struggles of aviation pioneers, such as Billy Mitchell, who fought against a military mentality that saw airplanes as little more than an extension of the Civil-War era balloon corps. One can almost feel Mitchell's frustration! He ultimately chose martyrdom, virtually forcing the military to court-martial him to publicize his cause. Were his tactics appropriate? You decide!<br />Pearl Harbor brought isolationist America to her senses! Gen. Arnold details the difficulties of putting the nation's economy on a war footing. Unfortunately, the same lessons had had to be learned in WWI. American servicemen would again pay a high price, in blood, for our unpreparedness when World War II began only a few decades after, \\"The War to End War's,\\" ended. \\"Haps\\" job was allocating air assets around the world. Telling political leaders such as Winston Churchill, Chiang Kai Shek, and Joe Stalin, as well as military commanders including Eisenhower, Macarthur, Nimitz and Stillwell who were watching their charges die every day, someone else needed planes worse than they did, was not a job for the faint-hearted. Arnold did this unenviable task for four long years. At last, exhausted and in ill health, he retired to his ranch in Sonoma, and wrote this valuable contribution to history.<br />The Military Classics series allowed key military leaders to tell their stories in their own words. Immensely popular after WWII, they seem to have been forgotten by generations that now consider WWII ancient history. This is a shame! Their stories still shape the world we live in and will for decades to come. This book, and other's like it, needs to be rediscovered in order to fully comprehend history thereby enabling us to understand our current role in world events.	2002-11-15

In doing so they assembled a distinguished team of twenty-one scholars, each an acknowledged expert in his field.  The results were then compiled and published in this work.  The conclusions reached included, but were not limited to the following:<br /> Vietnam was a small \\"hot-spot\\" in a global \\"cold war\\" It was important because the great powers of the day chose to contest it, if for no other reason.<br /> Ho Chi Minh was a dedicated agent of international Communism, not a Vietnamese Nationalist fighting for his people. <br />While the \\"Peace Movement\\" greatly aided the Communist efforts, they did not lose the war.  Our flawed, \\"no-win\\" strategy did.<br /> American forces were not given a free license to rape, kill, pillage and burn at will.  Soldiers and Marines were indicted and vigorously prosecuted for war crimes in Vietnam.<br /> Our involvement in Vietnam WAS necessary.  Had we meekly capitulated when the Russian bear growled, we could not have remained credible as an ally.<br /> The war was NOT unwinnable.  In effect we DID win.  Only Congress' refusal to provide the support promised our allies caused South Vietnam's capitulation and the subsequent blood bath that left millions dead.<br />The authors authenticate their findings with well-researched data.  These facts will be contested by some and ridiculed by others.  However, mere hype cannot refute their research.  Facts are facts.  The carefully prepared and skillfully perpetuated myths by some in government and many in the media cannot change them although they can be fully expected to try.<br />In the preface, editors Moore and Turner say that, \\"Obviously, this small volume is not intended to be the final word on the Vietnam War.\\"  Inevitably, more facts will emerge from such diverse places as Hanoi, Washington, Moscow and/or Beijing.  However, until more facts emerge, this work is the most complete review of the conflict available.  It deserves a place on the bookshelf of every serious student of the war for that reason.  <br />Since Vietnam the world situation has changed completely.  State sponsored terrorism has replaced Communism as our major threat.  Knowing when and how to use force are more critical today than ever.  Being too eager and too reluctant to use force when necessary are equal evils.  This work provides valuable insights on the when and how of using force.  It is an invaluable tool for today's national security planners for that reason.<br />I was privileged to attend the Conference that inspired this work and eagerly awaited publication of this book for two years.  It was well worth the wait.  I am much better informed for having read it.  You will be as well.	2002-08-27

Mahan presents what he considers the six key elements of sea power and shows the impact their application or misapplication has had on history.  Citing numerous historical examples, he shows how nations have prospered or suffered through use or misuse of their naval assets.  His book is rightfully considered essential reading for any historian of naval warfare.  However, its impact does not stop there.<br />Mahan shows how nations thrived or declined during the 17th and 18th centuries through prudent or imprudent application of naval power.  He contends France, Holland, Spain, et al. prospered until they allowed their naval power to dissipate.  Meanwhile, Britain became mistress of the seas.  British colonies provided raw materials for her industries, while her armed fleet insured uninterrupted commerce.  He equates Britain's loss of her American colonies with inappropriate deployment of her fleet, contrasted with France's skilled strategic use of her own.  This section will interest readers of American history schooled only on Washington's land campaign at Yorktown.<br />Mahan's book has had a tremendous impact on history.  It unquestionably shaped the imperialistic policies of pre-World War I and pre-World War II Germany and Japan respectively.  Students trying to ascertain why leaders of those nations acted as they did should read this work.<br />The elements of sea power are the same today as in 1900 when this book was first published.  With a world economy as interdependent as today's, Mahan's principles are as valid as they were in the 1600's and 1700's, perhaps even more so.  German war philosopher, Carl von Clausewitz's classic treatise, \\"On War,\\" is considered a must read for every Army officer.  Mahan's work is to the sea-battle as von Clausewitz's is to the land.

She describes the events, personalities, and personal and professional shortcomings of the key participants that caused the world to slide into our first global conflict.  The result was a tragedy almost beyond comprehension.  <br />Tuchman describes the series on treaties and alliances that were designed to prevent war.  Unfortunately, no one foresaw the impact intense nationalism and inept diplomacy would have on Germany after the Franco-Prussian War.  This was matched by France's obsession with recovering the Alsace and Lorraine provinces leading to her unlikely alliance with Russia.  Likewise, Britain could not endure Germany's development of a naval fleet.  Pleas to stop or limit the build-up were ignored.  German diplomacy had succeeded in alienating the two largest powers on the European continent and the largest sea power in the world.  Peaceful, prosperous Europe was a power-keg waiting to explode.  Austria's invasion of Serbia sparked the inferno.  WWI was on!<br />Tuchman then narrates the first month of the conflict.  Factors such as war plans, poor communications, unexpected resistance, leadership failures in both the military and political arenas, mistrust between allies, events Clausewitz would call collectively, \\"frictions,\\" would all come into play.  The result was an end to the possibility of the short war both sides envisioned.  WWI would drag on for four long years costing millions of lives and billions of dollars.  \\"Paradise\\" was indeed \\"Lost\\" in August of 1914.  <br />President John F. Kennedy read this book when he saw his nation sliding into Vietnam and became determined not to let the same thing happen.  He died before he could prevent it.  Today's political leaders could benefit from Tuchman's analysis.  Could it happen again?  Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and Professor James G. Blight think so.  In, \\"Wilson's Ghost:  Reducing The Risk of Conflict, Killing and Catastrophe in the 21st Century,\\" they outline a plan to preclude a future nuclear holocaust.  Reading and understanding the events described here are essential to preventing another such tragedy.  The \\"Paradise Lost\\" this time could be all life on this planet.	2002-05-07

In this short book, former Defense Secretary, Robert S. McNamara, and Brown University Professor James G. Blight provide a blueprint for future American foreign policy designed to avoid the carnage of the 20th century that left an estimated 160 million people dead. Using the metaphor of America being haunted by the ghost of President Woodrow Wilson, whose warnings were ignored after World War I (WWI), they, like Wilson, warn that the failure to insure harmonious international relations will cause a war of apocalyptic proportions. They propose a five-step program that includes:<br /> Only multinational interventions by the U.S.<br /> Full reconciliation with Russia and China<br /> Restructuring the U.N.<br /> Defining, deterring and punishing war crimes<br /> The total elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide<br />What can a long dead president from a bygone era, the architect of America's failed policy in Vietnam, and/or a professor from academia contribute to real-world decision makers today? The Holy Bible says in the book of Proverbs, Chapter 20, Verse 29, \\"The glory of young men is their strength; of old men, their experience.\\" The strong, young men of Wilson's day did not listen to him. As he predicted, a second world war, more deadly and destructive than the first, was the result. Wilson's warnings are more poignant today than after WWI. In 1919, the world had the capability of destroying continents. We now have the capability to destroy all life on this planet. McNamara and Blight, offer a plan to reduce the chance of genocide and nuclear holocaust. Given the explosive nature of international conflicts today, the proposals of these wise, old, men deserve serious consideration if mankind is to survive.	2002-04-15

He ends with the story of the rescue itself and the prisoners \\"life march\\" back from the \\"valley of the shadow of death.\\" Keep some Kleenex handy!<br /><br />He also describes the key personalities involved:<br /><br />The mercurial Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci, 6th Ranger Battalion Commander whose charismatic, theatrical style contrasted sharply with that of the studious, detail oriented, Captain Robert Prince, the assault element commander who meticulously planned every aspect of the raid. They were a formidable team.<br /><br />Then there were the Filipino guerilla leaders Captains Juan Pajota and Eduardo Joson, without whom the raid would have been impossible. For them the war was personal. A foreign enemy had invaded their home. They fought with the weapons of the guerilla: bolo knives, an odd collection of rifles, and an intimate knowledge of every aspect of the terrain. Quiet, competent, and ruthless, when they issued a command every Filipino in their areas complied immediately.<br /><br />Last was Clair Phillips a.k.a. secret agent \\"High Pockets,\\" the voluptuous cabaret owner who fought the Japanese with the only weapons available to her: feminine charm and good whiskey! Her exploits saved the lives of many in the camp. She was also responsible for the deaths of more Japanese than most infantry divisions!<br /><br />In the big scheme of things what did the raid mean? In a conflict that measured casualties in millions of lives and trillions of dollars what were 500 lives? The Holy Bible says in the Gospel according to John, Chapter 15, Verse 13, \\"Greater love hath no man than this, to lay down his life for his friends.\\" It is worth remembering that on January 28th, 1945, 121 Americans assisted by approximately 300 Filipino guerillas risked everything for no greater reward than to end the suffering of their fellow soldiers. They lived John 15:13 that day! The world is a better place because of it!	2002-04-10

Author John Keegan narrates every significant battle in each theatre, complete with an analysis of the tactics employed and the strengths and weaknesses of the commanders involved. The result is a thorough review of one of the greatest conflicts of all time.<br />Keegan provides both a macro and a micro view of the war. National level war plans and stories of wounded soldiers slowly drowning in shell craters are recounted with equal emphasis, showing how the decisions made by politicians and generals affected soldiers on the ground. One can almost feel the elation of young men hurrying off to war amidst bands playing and the adulation of adoring female populaces. This enthusiasm became a distant memory as days in the trenches turned to weeks, then months, and then years. Keegan describes artillery bombardments lasting for weeks, followed by hoards of infantrymen charging into still uncut barbed wire. Defenders then emerged from muddy trenches to pour murderous machine-gun fire into the attacker's ranks, turning battles into carnage on an unprecedented scale. Mere yards of real estate were bought and paid for by the blood of thousands. These attacks would then be repeated in reverse by the opposing side a few short weeks later. <br />He then describes attempts made to end the stalemate. Keegan graphically portrays the horror of French troops at Ypres, as they became the first soldiers in history to experience the hell of poison gas. Later, tanks were introduced to break the deadlock. General officers and their staffs, not at all insensitive to the suffering of their troops, studied tactics manuals and the possibilities inherent in new technologies. Human beings were not supposed to be able to survive the attacks they so meticulously planned. Yet they did survive! Soldiers inevitably emerged from their trenches to inflict massive casualties on their attackers. The result was near mutiny in the ranks by French, and later British, soldiers who had endured the misery for longer than human beings could stand. Finally, exhausted both at home and on the battlefield, the German Army capitulated; the ensuing peace and the technologies developed in WWI sewing the seeds that would grow into an even more destructive war a few decades later.<br />Keegan's work is not light reading. His descriptions challenge the powers of visualization of the average reader. Still, it is a detailed scholarly review of one of the most significant conflicts in history. Vietnam has Harold Moore's, \\"We Were Soldiers Once and Young.\\" Korea has S.L.A. Marshall's, \\"Pork Chop Hill.\\" World War II has Shirer's, \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\\" Keegans, \\"The First World War,\\" ranks up there with all of them.	2002-02-21

Published in 1896, this little pamphlet ignited age-old passions among Jews the world over and began the drive for the establishment of the first Jewish State in 2000 years. By doing so, Herzl set in motion events that monopolize the world's attention today.<br />In \\"The Jewish State,\\" Herzl outlines the plan for establishing his state. In a logical, step-by-step process he defines how the land would be colonized, financed, and administered. Palestine and Argentina are suggested as possible sites. However, Palestine emerges clearly as the desired locale for spiritual and emotional reasons. Anyone trying to establish a state could use this pamphlet as a guide. Yasser Arafat should be given a copy!<br />Emerson said that American colonists fired, \\"the shot heard 'round the world,\\" at Lexington and Concord. Herzl fired a similar shot by publishing \\"The Jewish State.\\" He, no less than the colonists, started a revolution by his actions. Both ultimately achieved their goals of establishing a state for their peoples. However, America did not have to endure a Holocaust to facilitate an exodus to our shores; unfortunately, Israel did.<br />Today, the Jewish State exists in the form of modern Israel. Born out of controversy, this state exists as a prosperous, democratic entity, in the midst of numerically superior and extremely hostile Arab states. Jews have their home, but they have to fight daily to keep them. Is this what Herzl envisioned? Did he do the world a favor by establishing his state? The verdict is still out. One thing is clear. The roots of the current controversy that has American soldiers fighting in Afghanistan can be traced back to Israel, and Israel's roots can be traced to Herzl's pamphlet. Reading, \\"The Jewish State,\\" is therefore essential to understanding current events. I strongly recommend it to any serious student of Middle Eastern affairs.	2002-01-14

Long on substance and short on detail, this work highlights the trials and tribulations of a man whose life is synonymous with the rebirth of modern Israel.<br />The text begins with a description of Ben-Gurion's early life, his immigration to Israel at age 20, and the hardships of the early pioneers.  Next, he describes the struggles to establish a Jewish state.  His difficulties included convincing fellow Jews that statehood was both achievable and desirable in a land inhabited by hostile Arabs and governed by the British who were both openly and sometimes violently opposed to the idea.  <br />Next, he describes the campaign against Britain in Palestine/Israel followed by the Israeli War of Independence ending with the proclamation of the Jewish State May 14, 1948.  Surrounded by hostile, numerically superior Arab armies and fending off challenges from within, Ben-Gurion ignored all odds and advice.  His willingness to take risks, including the risk of civil war, earned him the title of \\"dictator\\" by his opponents.  Readers should compare his account of the tragic Altalena affair with the one advanced by Menachem Begin in, The Revolt. Clearly, all was not peace and harmony within Israel.<br />The book then describes Israel's role in the 1956 war with Nasser's Egypt in concert with France and Britain.  Despite international repercussions, Israel demonstrated its military superiority and put teeth into Ben-Gurion's statement, \\"Israel depends not on what gentiles think, but on what Jews do.\\"  It concludes by enumerating Ben-Gurion's diplomatic initiatives conducted as part of his never ending attempts to provide peace, prosperity, and, most importantly, security, for his beloved Israel.<br />Readers looking for a short, version of the events leading to the establishment of the Jewish state should read The Armed Prophet.  It presents the significant events in chronological order and describes the key leaders involved.  Clear, concise, and highly readable, it provides background for events that monopolize the world's attention today.	2002-01-07

Author Alan Hart paints an almost heart-rending portrait of Arafat, whom he describes as a selfless leader who has devoted his life to his people and his cause.  Hart's central thesis is that Israel is well aware that the P.L.O. is willing, and has been for some time, to establish peace on the basis of UN Resolutions 242 and 338.  Israel has rejected this initiative because it will require them to withdraw to the borders it occupied before 1967 and allow the establishment of a Palestinian mini-state.  In Arafat's own words:<br /> \\". . . when it (Zionism) is destroyed, . . . our two peoples (Jews and Palestinians) can live together in real peace.  That is the day our dream of a Democratic State of Palestine will come true.\\"<br />Quite a statement from a man who once boasted that he would, \\"drive the Jews into the sea!\\"  Has he changed?  Hart says he has.  Israel, understandably, is not so sure.<br />Hart provides insight to the inner workings of both the P.L.O. and Arab regimes, who give lip-service to the Palestinian cause, but have sought to \\"play the Palestinian card\\" for their own, ignoble purposes.  His analysis of their reasons for doing so provides interesting reading.  He also says Arab regimes, the Mossad, and the CIA have used dissident P.L.O. factions to wreck Arafat inspired peace initiatives.  The analysis is intriguing but not totally convincing.<br />While reading I was struck by the similarity between Arafat and Israeli terrorist turned politician, Menachem Begin.  Both are/were dedicated nationalists who stop/stopped at nothing to achieve their goal.  Ironically, the goal is/was the same:  establish a homeland for their displaced, disenfranchised peoples on the same real estate.  Both have committed immoral acts in the name of ahigher morality.  Both have blood on their hands!<br />Hart's work is obviously biased toward Arafat and the P.L.O.  Readers should compare it with Begin's book, \\"The Revolt:  Story of the Irgun,\\" to learn how successful terrorists play first the terrorism and then the political card to achieve their ends.  Is the P.L.O. sincere in its stated desire for peace? If so, can Arafat control dissident Palestinian elements that are currently conducting suicide attacks throughout Israel?  We can only hope so.  Only when this problem is solved will the people of the world feel safe boarding commercial airliners again and will Americans be able to resume feeding instead of bombing the Afghanistans of the world.	2002-01-02

Jews, who had endured centuries of discrimination in Europe culminating with the Holocaust, saw their chance. They would not be denied.<br />It was perhaps the strangest war in history: death camp survivors pitted in a life-and-death struggle against the British, who were liberating Nazi concentration camps in Europe while simultaneously keeping the gates to \\"Palestine\\" closed. Begin justifies his murderous actions by citing the struggles of the Jewish people through the centuries punctuated by Auschwitz and Treblinka. Certainly, any government who stood between Jews and their, \\"Promised Land,\\" was evil and had to be dispensed with accordingly. Begin details the Irgun's most famous actions: the raid at Acre Prison, and the destruction of British Headquarters at the King David Hotel, to name a couple. He consistently describes his Irgun, \\"freedom fighters,\\" in the most glowing terms. The book details how battles were fought and won both in Palestine and in the Court of Public Opinion in Britain. Ultimately, the British left. The, \\"freedom fighter's\\" had won, or have they?<br />In the over 50 years that have elapsed since the struggle, Israel has \\"won\\" four major wars with her Arab neighbors. However, recognition of Israel has never been granted. The goal of real peace has proved more elusive than guerilla and later conventional military victory. Was there another way to establish a Jewish state? Begin says emphatically, \\"No!\\" Interestingly enough many Zionist leaders, including David Ben-Gurion, disagreed with him. Arab terrorists such as Yasser Arafat have copied Begin's tactics and are now spreading mayhem throughout Israel. Question? If the goal of establishing a homeland for displaced, disenfranchised people was valid for Begin and the Irgun, can the same not be said for the Palestinians? The key question remains to this day: What does Israel do with over a million hostile, Palestinian refugees? <br />President Ronald Reagan said, \\"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.\\" What is the distinction? An American military instructor answered this question rhetorically: \\"Victory or defeat! If a revolutionary succeeds in overthrowing the established government, he is a, patriot, a, visionary, a, hero. If he fails, he is a, criminal, an anarchist, and/or a terrorist.\\" Given this definition, Begin is a patriot, Arafat, a terrorist. Note both have blood on their hands!<br />Revolt is a text on how to conduct a guerilla campaign. The question it does not answer is how to deal with the after effects of a guerilla campaign. How does one build bridges to defeated and humiliated foes? When that question is answered perhaps there can be real peace in the Mid-East.	2001-12-05

Bowyer Bell's last work, \\"Terror Out of Zion,\\" leaves off.  It begins with the founding of the State of Israel in 1948 and ends with the, \\"Six Day War, of 1967.\\"  Throughout, the author shows how Israel has persevered despite facing long odds, including military inferiority and diplomatic isolation.<br />Bell describes the fight for Israeli independence in 1948 against the \\"united\\" Arab armies of Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq.  His description of the political intrigues of the Arab states makes interesting reading.  Arab infighting is the only reason Israel exists today.<br />Next, he describes the Suez Crisis of 1956 and the roles played by Israel, Britain, France and the United States.  Despite the political bungling of the west, Israel reaffirmed its military superiority by humiliating its Arab opponents.  Incapable of beating their most despised foe, the Arabs were reduced to rhetoric, diplomatic initiatives, backbiting and terrorism.  <br />Last was the Six-Day War of 1967.  Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt gambled on a joint attack with Syria on Israel, and lost the entire Sinai, despite Soviet diplomatic and military support.  Israel now had real security, but no Arab recognition, and therefore no real peace.  Serious questions remained:<br /> What to do with over 1 million Palestinian refugees?<br /> How to prevent terrorist raids on Israeli settlements.<br />How to beat an Arab boycott of Israeli products and of nations who did business with Israel.<br />These questions remain to this day!<br />The Long War deals with one key segment of the longest war in history.  The events described are directly related to what is happening today.  For years, the world's attention was captivated by the Cold War.  The Mid-East was largely a sideshow.  Issues raised in this book now occupy the center of the world stage.  Only now are we devoting all of our diplomatic and military energies to resolving this conflict.  Is there a solution to twointractable foes that both claim God's blessing in their quests to rid the same area of the other as they have for over 2000 bloodstained years?  Unfortunately, we are no closer to a solution now than in the `50's. <br />Long War is essential to understanding the events of today.  I highly recommend it to anyone seeking an answer to why terrorists hijacked four fully loaded passenger liners and flew them into three occupied buildings on September 11, 2001.	2001-11-06

Arson. Riots. Murder. Fear. Euphoria. Hope. Despair. Religious fanaticism. Sounds like the Mid-east at the turn of the century, right? The only question is, which century? Author, J. Bowyer Bells' book, \\"Terror Out of Zion,\\" chronicles the chaos in Palestine/Israel from the late 1800's to the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. The story is one of unparalleled violence. Recent events show, little has changed.<br />Bell shows how Anti-Semitism in Europe from the late 1800's onward fueled the Zionist Movement making Jews determined to establish a national homeland. Nazism caused the movement to gain strength. As Hitler gained power Jews had two choices: immigrate illegally into Palestine, or Auschwitz! Palestinian Arabs, who had lived in the Holy Land for 2000 years, greeted their new, Jewish neighbors with pogrom like activities including riots, looting, arson, and murder. <br />Through it all, the British attempted to maintain order throughout the \\"Mandate.\\" Both Arabs and Jews were confident the authorities would ultimately see the rightness of their position. However when the British kept the door closed to, \\"The Promised Land,\\" even to the survivors of the Holocaust, Vladimir Jabotinski, Avraham Stern, Menachem Begin etc. took up arms. Bells account of their ruthless, but highly successful terror tactics makes interesting reading. They are a blueprint for what's happening today.<br />We have come a long since Britain attempted to police the \\"Mandate\\" with, \\"constables,\\" armed only with, \\"staves.\\" Caught between two groups who both claimed God's blessings, Britain tried to ignore the problem and hoped it would go away. When it did not, they left the problem to the U.N. <br />The U.S. has assumed Britain's role as arbiter in the mid-east. Little has changed. Both sides are still convinced of the rightness of their cause. Both still hate with an intensity borne of decades of bloodshed. Only the weapons are different. Biological/chemical weapons, suicide bombings, and most recently, commercial airliners have replaced revolvers and homemade bombs for the terrorists. America now responds with strategic bombers and cruise missiles. While the level of violence has increased dramatically, we are no closer to a solution.<br />Americans who mistakenly think the conflict began on Sept. 11, 2001 should read Terror Out Of Zion. What Bell does not answer is who is right? When is an individual or a group justified in taking up arms? What level of violence is justified? Do the ends justify the means? What is the distinction between a terrorist and a freedom fighter? <br />Terror out of Zion is a historical expose on events that are directly related to what's happening in the world today. Enlightening, detailed and informative I highly recommend it to anyone seeking an answer to why the world stands on the brink of World War III today.	2001-10-17

Nixon narrates his career from its earliest beginning in Yorba Linda, Ca. thru his election and ultimate resignation as President in 1974. In a literary format reminiscent of Franklin D. Roosevelt's' &quot;Fireside Chats,&quot; the author narrates the behind the scenes actions in some of this nations' most critical decisions.<br />Key sections include his coming to national prominence during the trial of Alger Hiss, and the elections of 1952, 1960, 1968 and 1972. The most critical period is his six year stint as President between '68 and '74 when he and National Security Advisor, later Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, successfully exploited the Sino-Soviet rift making an end to the war in Vietnam possible, the 1973 Arab-Israeli War ending with Americas' brokering a peace treaty between the seemingly intractable foes, and the success of d&eacute;tente over the objections of liberal and conservative critics. Despite these monumental successes in foreign policy a malignant cancer was steadily growing on the Nixon presidency; it was called, &quot;Watergate.&quot;<br />The author chronicles the events surrounding Watergate in painstaking detail. Throughout he contends that he never authorized the break-in at Democratic Headquarters and had no knowledge of it in advance. He states flatly his principal accuser, John Dean, was lying when he stated otherwise. He also says he was effectively tried by a hostile press based on leaks of &quot;secret&quot; material from &quot;informed sources&quot; whose objectivity and integrity was highly suspect. Is his story true? This is the only format in which his story is told completely, devoid of the hype that surrounded the first ever resignation of a U.S. President. You owe it to yourself to read his account before you make up your mind.<br />This book is a first-person account from a key player in some of the most momentous events in the history of thisnation. As is true of any autobiography, it is somewhat suspect. No author can be completely free of bias. However the tragic and untimely end of his career cannot and does not negate his undeniable successes. I strongly recommend this book to any serious student of history, political science, and/or international relations. I am much better informed for having read it. You will be as well.	2001-09-05

He feels this war will be between Russia and her Arab allies, and Israel, stemming from Arab hatred of Israel and Russia's never ending quest for a warm water sea-port and her desire to return to a position of world prominence. He ends with a discussion of the rise of the Anti-Christ and his proclamation of himself as &quot;God&quot; in a rebuilt Jewish Temple.<BR><BR>In only 254 pages, Dr. Hagee explains events, past and present, in light of Bible prophesy.

In this autobiographical account of his time as an infantry officer in, \\"the `Nam,\\" he describes the experience in authoritative terms enhanced by collegiate English studies and time spent as a combat journalist.  The result is the most well written account of life in an infantry platoon in Vietnam that I have ever read.<br />Phil Caputo could have been virtually anyone in America in the early `60's.  A young, idealistic, all-American boy who joined the Marines in search of adventure, and out of a patriotic desire to answer John Kennedy's challenge to, \\"Ask not what your country can do for you. . .\\"  He and his platoon marched off to war to find glory and honor.  What they found was, \\"death, death, death.\\"<br />Caputo takes you into the muddy foxhole with him, making you feel the heat and annoyance of the ever-present insects, and the sniper shots that all united to deprive you of the precious commodity of sleep.  He takes you on patrol with them down, \\"Purple Heart Trail,\\" where the main enemies were the heat, the insects, and endless mines and booby traps.  The reader can feel the rage of the infantrymen who fought endless battles with an enemy that was everywhere, yet nowhere.  Gradually enthusiasm turned to pessimism; pessimism to despair; and despair to rage; rage that ultimately vented itself in mindless violence against anything Vietnamese.  They were then left with the heat, the insects, and guilt borne of actions taken that they would never have dreamed of a few short months before.<br />Caputo and his enthusiastic, young, Marines could have been anyone who has ever fought:  the patriots at Lexington and Concord, who later found themselves half starved and freezing at Valley Forge; or any number of Union or Confederate soldiers from Bull Run to Appomattox.  They could have been \\"Doughboys\\" who went, \\"Over There,\\" to \\"Make the World Safe for Democracy,\\" only to find themselves \\"fighting\\" immersion foot and mustard gas in the trenches of France; or perhaps even soldiers serving under, \\"Ol' Blood and Guts\\" himself, George S. Patton;  \\"Our blood, his guts,\\" as the GI's said.  Their stories all verify Gen. Robert E.

Over 94,500 gallant, French soldiers died in this vain, yet valiant attempt to contain communism in Southeast Asia.  What could and should we have learned from this tragedy?<br />Lessons learned included the folly of employing heavy, road-bound, mechanized/armored forces that were highly vulnerable to Viet-Cong (VC) ambushes, effective use of the jungle as a sanctuary by the VC, underestimating the stamina of the VC, and the ultimate war-weariness that caused the French public to rebel at fighting a seemingly endless conflict for no tangible gain.  Add to this, the close coordination of political and military objectives that caused the Viet-Cong to sacrifice people, places and things to achieve a single objective:  A Vietnam united under Communism.  Does this sound familiar?  This book, published in 1961, was readily available in the U.S.  If it was read, it was ignored.  <br />Fall gives detailed accounts of communist tactics and the results that accrued to French commanders who refused to recognize the fact that, \\"the (tactics) book,\\" they had been schooled under simply did not apply in Vietnam.  Amazingly, the U.S. then deployed our troops to Vietnam, with our own officers schooled by the same, \\"book!\\"  Gallantry, esprit-de-corp, machismo, and/or faith in a righteous cause were no more effective against well-laid ambushes in the `60s and `70s than they were in the `40s and `50s.  The lessons of history were there for the reading.  Why we refused to heed them is a mystery that still calls for an answer.<br />Street Without Joy is not a left-wing condemnation of western \\"imperialism,\\" or, the evils of \\"intervention.\\"  Fall neither condemns nor condones the goal of containing communism.  He merely analyzes reasons for the French defeat.  There was no precedent for fighting a \\"revolutionary war,\\" prior to the French experience.  The same could not be said for the U.S.  If the French defeat was borne of ignorance; America's came seemingly from arrogance.    <br />George Santayana said, \\"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to relive it.\\"  There are two lessons to be learned here:  First, tactical schemes should be derived from the terrain and situation, not from blind adherence to, \\"the book.\\"  Books can be altered.  Terrain, climate, and enemy forces cannot.  Second, never again should U.S. troops be compelled to walk any, \\"street without joy,\\" that is combat, without conducting a thorough review of the mistakes made by our predecessors.  Reinventing the wheel is not only inefficient; in war, it is deadly!  Ninety-four thousand, five hundred eighty-one crosses scattered throughout Indo-china, each bearing the name of a French soldier testifies to the truth of lesson one.  Over 50,000 American names on, \\"The Wall,\\" silently attest to the second.	2001-04-30

Henry A. Kissinger's book, White House Years is the first of a three-volume trilogy that covers his remarkable career. This initial book begins with his appointment as National Security Advisor to Richard M. Nixon January 1969, and ends with the initialing of the Paris Peace Accords in 1973. Kissinger lets the reader know early on, they were under no illusions their journey would be easy or joyous.<br><br>He paints a vivid picture of Lyndon Johnson at Nixon's inauguration. If a political heavyweight like L.B.J. could be humbled by (sic) \\"Veetnam\\" no one could expect an easy time. Nixon, who had made a career of exhorting political opponents to, \\"Get tough with the Communists,\\" now had his turn. He would either succeed where his predecessors had failed, or share L.B.J.s fate.<br><br>A series of opportunities to \\"get tough\\" with the Communists soon followed. The Soviets continued to harass Berlin; the Strateg!ic Arms Limitation (SALT) Talks provided critics from the right and left; West German leader Willie Brandt's Ostpolitik threatened the cohesion of the Atlantic Alliance and the Soviets' establishment of a submarine base at Cienfuegos, Cuba created a situation reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Also, the election of Salvador Allende in Chile threatened to introduce a second, Communist state into the Western Hemisphere. Elsewhere, a crisis was brewing between India and Pakistan, and the powder keg in the Middle East threatened to explode at any time.<br><br>All these things occurred while the bulk of our military forces were mired in a seemingly endless stalemate in Vietnam that was tearing our nation apart and steadily draining both our coffers and our national resolve. Any of them had the potential to bring the two nuclear equipped superpowers into direct confrontation at any time. Kissinger calmly states: \\"Statesmen do not have the right to ask to serve only in simple t!imes.\\" The early '70'swere anything but, \\"simple times.\\"<br><br>White House Years is a first-person account from a key player in each of these crises. Kissinger takes us step-for-step through the decision-making process they undertook before each action. These deliberations led to the most spectacular diplomatic initiative of our time: Nixon's historic trip to The Peoples Republic of China! The diplomatic opportunities made possible by this trip still shape our world today. Among other things it made Hanoi serious about negotiating an end to the War in Vietnam.<br><br>Dr. Kissinger narrates the maddening, secret negotiations with North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho in Paris. The differences between what the Communists were feeding the Western media and what they were saying behind closed doors makes the reader both loathe and admire them for their political skill. Their efforts finally led to the signing of the Paris Peace Accords. Kissinger sincerely believed South Vietnam would surv!ive. Unfortunately, he was wrong.<br><br> White House Years reads like a Greek tragedy. The reader gets excited and then remembers how it all ends. The very secretiveness that produced spectacular successes also sowed the seeds that would lead to Nixon's self-destruction.<br><br> I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the War in Vietnam and/or international relations. The conduct of international diplomacy today is still unquestionably influenced by the events narrated here. I am much better informed for having read it. You will be as well!	2001-01-22

Ford.  In it, he details how they built upon the foreign policy successes of the Nixon Administration and laid the foundation for the resurgence of the American spirit seen during the Reagan Administration.  From a diplomatic standpoint, this may have been America's finest hour.<br />With the possible exception of Lincoln, no U.S. president has inherited a nation as severely divided as Gerald R. Ford.  Immediately after assuming office, he faced one international crisis after another with a hostile, &quot;McGovernite Congress,&quot; and an emasculated intelligence gathering system that made effective response to even the most extreme provocations virtually impossible.  Kissinger says throughout, Ford made decisions solely on what was best for the nation, not on what was politically expedient.  His reward for such selfless service:  defeat in the next election.<br />Like Kissinger's other works, this book can be read either in individual chapters or be taken as a whole.  In each segment he details, what they did, what their options were, the assumptions their actions were based upon, and if unsuccessful, what their fall back plan was to be.  In spite of seemingly insurmountable odds, they were able to hold the Atlantic Alliance together, strengthen our ties to the Peoples Republic of China, and keep the Soviets out of both the Middle East and Africa.<br />The Chinese war philosopher, Sun Tsu said, &quot;In the moment of victory, button your chin strap.&quot;  History has proven the  Soviets should have listened.  Given our national paralysis following Vietnam/Watergate, it seemed they could not be stopped.  In the international chess game--that is diplomacy at the highest levels--they were stopped through the efforts of a few, dedicated statesmen who blocked them at every turn.  The fall of the SovietUnion and Communism was the ultimate result.<br />This book is a textbook on how to conduct foreign policy.  Enlightening and informative, it has inspired me to read Kissinger's other works, &quot;White House Years,&quot; and &quot;Years of Upheaval.&quot;  I highly recommend it to any serious student of the era.	2000-10-03

Kissinger, is a comprehensive review of the theory and practice of statesmanship narrated by the most accomplished diplomat of our time.  From the raison d'etat of Cardinal Richelieu to the glasnost of Mikhail Gorbachev, Kissinger describes each era's key practicioners of the diplomatic arts with a familiarity borne of a lifetime of dedicated research.<br />Modern diplomacy is the result of the efforts of those who developed the art over the centuries.  The great statesmen of Europe: Richelieu, Metternich, Bismarck, et. al. each developed their theories of international relations based on their nation's unique set of historical and geopolitical circumstances.  The striking thing is how little things have changed. Kissinger shows how modern statesmen still make decisions based on the same factors today.<br />Dr. Kissinger begins his review of America's contributions to statesmanship by examining our two foremost foreign policy theorists: Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.  Kissinger depicts these gentlemen as the architects of our foreign policy and shows how succeeding administrations have followed the policies of one or the other.  He also reviews World Wars I and II and the dreams of overly idealistic Americans that motivated those generations to make tremendous sacrifices in order to make the world a better place to live.  In both cases, our hopes of creating a world composed of truly democratic nations was dashed by the realpolitik of our adversaries. Still, despite two world wars, Korea and Vietnam, our idealism is intact enabling us to remain a beacon of freedom for all the world.<br />Dr. Kissinger writes about diplomatic leaders, past and present, with complete familiarity.  It's almost as if he's describing a group of close friends that he meets at the club every week for a game of high-stakes poker.  The difference is Kissinger knows them so well he can accurately predict what they will do and why.  We're fortunate he is onour side!<br />Diplomacy is an important addition to the library of every student and practicioner of the international political process.  Advanced students of World History and International Relations will profit from his conclusions.  Beginning students will be inspired to conduct more dilligent research on the events he describes.  I am personally much better informed for having read this book.  You will be as well!	2000-08-01

In it, he recounts in detail the planning and execution of the battle at all levels. The possibility that a small, preindustrial state like Vietnam could defeat a modern army never entered the minds of the French, until it was too late.<BR><BR>The Communists were adept at waging war at the military and political levels simultaneously. In order for the political, main attack to succeed, Dien Bien Phu had to be in Communist hands prior to the Geneva Convention. The number of casualties the North Viets had to sustain was irrelevant so long as they got what they wanted: a strong bargaining position at Geneva. After France left, if Communism was going to be contained in Indochina, America was going to have to do it.<BR><BR>Communist tactics such as moving artillery pieces and the tons of ammunition to support them down seemingly impassable roads and digging anaconda-like trenches around French positions slowly choking the life out of the garrison would soon be seen again by American soldiers. Western planning books said this could not be done. The books were wrong. They would still be wrong a few years later when the Americans arrived.<BR><BR>On the political front, France was reduced to begging for American air support to save the beleagured garrison and with it, their entire position in Indochina. The question of whether the U.S. could or should intervene and if so, how, was debated at the highest levels for weeks. As the politicians and diplomats bickered, the garrison slowly suffered, bled, and died. <BR><BR>HELL IN A VERY SMALL PLACE is a manual for communist political and military tactics used in Vietnam. Our failure to heed the lessons learned there cost many Americans their lives. We indeed failed to learn from the mistakes of the past. As usual, it was the soldiers on the ground who paid the price for those mistakes with their lives.	2000-06-23

Burkett and Glenna Whitley have done more good for legitimate Viet Vets with this book than most of the the other so-called &quot;veterans programs&quot; combined. In it, they expose the true facts of that conflict and show how real vets have overcome adversity and become assets to their communities and nation. Others unfortunately have not lived up to their standards.<br />Stolen Valor provides pages and pages of examples of bogus vets bilking taxpayers out of billions of dollars in false claims for &quot;injuries,&quot; sustained in Vietnam. In many cases, these &quot;vets&quot; never served in Vietnam and in some cases, never served in the military at all! They explode the myth of Agent Orange and take the Veterans Administration (VA) to task for its failure to check the claims being submitted while exposing its economic incentive for keeping its case load high. They also describe the literature that is readily available on how to submit a claim for veterans benefits. Whether or not the individual is entitled to these benefits is completely irrelevant.<br />The media's role in creating the myth of the dysfunctional vet is given special attention. The authors reveal the hypocracy of a nationally known TV reporter, active in portraying Viet Vets as dysfunctional, walking time-bombs who enhances his credibility by proudly calling himself an, &quot;ex-Marine.&quot; Military records obtained thru the Freedon of Information Act reveal that he washed out in boot camp. If Burkett and Whitley can discover this and other deceptions with the limited assets available to them, why can't the VA?<br />This book should be read by every member of the U.S. Congress and every person charged with stewardship of public funds. While few people have the authors' expertise in detecting fraud, waste, and abuse, one simple rule of thumb should be followed: If the guys story sounds too good to be true, it probably is! Taxpayers would save billions if this was followed. Hats off to Burkett and Whitley for the outstanding service they have rendered to their nation by producing this extremely important work.	2000-05-05

Surely, a military that destroyed Germany and Japan could easily defeat a  pre-industrial state like Vietnam.  The reasons why we could not and did  not are exposed in this work.  These include underestimating the stamina of  the Viet-Cong and our insistence on using conventional tactics while  fighting an unconventinal war.  The physical and psychological impacts of  the militaries' rotation policy and preoccupation with creature comfort is  also examined critically.<br />He also analyzes our South Vietnamese allies  militarily and politically and takes a critical look at the  civilian-military conflict that raged in Washington.  One of the key issues  was mobilization of the reserves.  Would it have made a difference?  In all  areas, he looks at alternative strategies and evaluates their chances for  success.  There is no guarantee these solutions would have worked any  better than the ones employed.<br />Dr. Record applies Omar Bradleys' famous  quote about Korea to Vietnam.  It was, &quot;the wrong war, at the wrong  place, at the wrong time, with the wrong enemy.&quot;  His arguments are  presented clearly and succinctly in a book that takes aim at antagonists on  both sides of the Vietnam debate. While LBJ, McNamara, etc. were often  wrong, there is no evidence that other strategies would have fundamentally  changed the situtation.<br />This is an excellent work that explodes the myths  that we could have &quot;won&quot; in Vietnam using different approaches at  a cost acceptable to the American people morally andpolitically.  In less  than 200 pages, the author examines virtually every aspect of the war.  No  one involved comes out as having the moral or political courage of their  convictions sufficient to do what was in the best interest of the nation.   There is certainly a lesson to be learned here:  Under no circumstance  should we go to war without clearly defining our objectives and carefully  examining  our chances of success.  Today, as we have troops employed all  over the world, this is too important a lesson to overlook.	2000-04-10

For every one who ever looked for a silver lining in the cloud that was America's involvement in Vietnam, Michael Lind's book: \\"Vietnam: The Necessary War,\\" is a breath of fresh air. He contends that our involvement was necessary to preserve America's credibility as an ally world-wide. Had we simply capitulated, Third World nations would have rallied to the U.S.S.R. Sounds like a right-wing propaganda, right? Wrong!<BR><BR>Mr. Lind indeed ridicules New England based noninterventionists for their head-in-the-sand approach to foreign policy that advocated staying out of Vietnam all-together. However he also takes aim at the far right that pressed for removal of all military restrictions. World War III would have almost certainly been the result. Gen. Westmorland and the military also gets the \\"Voltaires (poison) Pen\\" treatment for fighting an unconventional war with conventional tactics, with inevitable results.<BR><BR>Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's theory that \\"missed opportunities\\" prevented a settlement that would have been acceptable to both sides is ridiculed by Mr. Lind. If he is right, McNamara and Company were sold a bill of goods by the Communists in his book, \\"Argument Without End.\\" I would love to hear Lind and McNamara debate the subject!<BR><BR>In the end, Mr. Lind puts the war in perspective. Vietnam was a small, hot-spot in a global cold war. He states we were right to go in to preserve our credibility and also right to leave in order to preserve a concensus to contain communism world-wide; a conflict we clearly won. He ends with the observation that, \\"Americans want \\"real wars\\" like World War II and the Gulf War, not limited wars like Korea and Vietnam.\\" Unfortunately, this is not likely to happen in the future. Lind says, future American soldiers will have to learn to \\"swim in quagmires,\\" like Vietnam in order to maintain the United States' position as a dominant world power.<BR><BR>I admit a certain bias in favor of this work. Lind says many of the things I have felt before and verifys them with well researched and effectively presented data. His work deserves careful consideration by military strategists and students of international relations in order to implement a foreign policy that recognizes the most likely threats to our security and develops a supporting military, that is trained and structured to fight the next war, instead of the last one.	2000-03-18

Professor Robert F. Turner's book, Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development is the complete account of the rise of the Communist Party in Vietnam from an obscure and unpopular political group, to its current status as the ruling elite of Vietnam. In it, he chronicles Ho Chi Minh's career, highlighting his left-wing political activities in France, his appointment as a Comintern agent, and his ruthless tactics in seizing power by eleminating all potential opposition. His ingenious use of French reward money to both eleminate his opposition and finance his communist revolution would have made his heros, Lenin and Stalin proud!<br />Professor Turner also describes Ho Chi Minh's involvement in \\"fighting\\" the Japanese in WWII. The popular misconception that he actively and effectively fought the Japanese is exposed as a myth.<br />Communist tactics are described in detail. In short, they followed the Marxist-Leninist line to make any compromise to gain advantage. Appeal to religion, patriotism, nationalism, or desire for land-reform. The end justifies the means by which it is obtained! Later, if and when these groups have outlived their usefulness, they can, and were, denounced as, \\"enemies of the revolution,\\" and executed. Methods of population control and Communist Party organization sturctures down to villiage level are shown which effectively prevented a counter-revolution.<br />Professor Turner also describes the delicate dance Ho was compelled to perform, flirting with both Moscow and Peking to insure their continued support. It was here that the U.S. missed a golden opportunity to end the war before it assumed the monsterous proportions it finally achieved. Students of international relations should read this section carefully.<br />Finally, he describes the \\"victory\\" won by the Vietnamese over both France and the U.S. For their efforts the people have been given the \\"benefits\\" of collectivized industry and agriculture. Collectivization has produced the same results in Vietnam it has produced elsewhere: inadequate supplies of the most basic needs of society. The ruling class lives well while the masses remain impoverished. <br />German philosopher Carl von Clausewitz stated in his classic treatise, \\"On War,\\" . . .intelligence . . .means every sort of information about the enemy and his country. . .forms the basis of our actions.\\" The type of intelligence provided by Professor Turner was completely lacking during Vietnam. It is no wonder our plans and operations suffered accordingly.<br />Sun Tzu said: \\"War is of vital importance to the state; the province of life or death; the road to survival or ruin. It is mandatory that it be thoroughly studied.\\" It was not studied before we entered Vietnam. 4 million people died needlessly as a result. The lesson to be learned it is, similar works should be consulted before ever commiting U.S. soldiers to war again.	2000-02-25

After that, the only time we thought of Vietnam was  at the movies watching Sylvester Stallone, a.k.a. &quot;Johnny Rambo&quot;  do single handedly in a couple of hours what  500,000+ troops couldn't in  ten years.  For us, walking away was easy.  For the South Vietnamese, it  was impossible.<br />Author Nguyen Van Canh was a South Vietnamese  intellectual who was forced to leave his homeland when the communists took  over.  By interviewing refugees and clandestine contacts, by reading  journalists' articles, and analyzing official reports of the Democratic  Government of Vietnam, he has pieced together a graphic picture of life  under communism.  The picture is not pretty.<br />He concludes that the former  South Vietnam is now nothing more than a conquered province.  For all the  rhetoric by Ho Chi Minh and Company of &quot;reconciliation&quot; and  &quot;brotherhood,&quot; the South is now totally dominated by the North.   Even former communist cadre members are relegated to second class  citizenship because being from the South makes them suspect.<br />The  take-over followed the familiar communist line, only with uniquely  Vietnamese terminology.  Instead of gulags, Vietnam has re-education  centers and new economic zones.  Instead of show trials, we have  self-criticism sessions.  Instead of public executions, suspected persons  simply try to leave the country via small, unseaworthy boats.  It's the  same song, just a different verse.<br />Canh states the usual process of  collectivization of agriculture and industry went on with the usual  results.  After the burgeoise were liquidated, the only people left to plan  a central economy could not plan a daily calendar.  As usual, the resulting  shortages of goods have impoverished the population.  Graft and corruption  at all levels are commonplace as people literally lie, cheat and steal to  survive.<br />Canh's book is an important work.  It effectively compares what  communism promises with what it delivers.  Every person who fought the war  and every person who opposed it should read Canh and ask, &quot;What could  we have done to prevent this tragedy?&quot;  More importantly, &quot;What  can we do now to insure no other nation has to endure this again?&quot;	2000-01-23

H.R. McMasters' book, Dereliction of Duty is a critical look at the decision-makers during the war in Vietnam.  His central thesis is that Lyndon Johnson, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff all worked to keep the truth of Americas' ever-deepening commitment  in Vietnam from reaching the American people in order to protect Johnson's  &quot;Great Society&quot; program.  Using previously classified materials,  he compares what was said in public with what was said behind closed doors,  effectively condemning all concerned.  The research here is excellent;  however, after careful reading, several questions remain:<br />Had LBJ done  away with the &quot;Great Society&quot; altogether, and fully committed  American forces to Vietnam, would we have won?<br />Was Robert McNamara a  criminal for implementing the President's wishes?<br />Were the Joint Chiefs  derelict in their duties for not going public with their criticisms of the  war effort when they saw clearly we were headed for disaster?<br />Dereliction  of Duty provides insight into the behind-the-scenes deliberations during  Vietnam.  It should be purchased and read for that reason.  However,  McMaster ignores the fact America had a commitment to a free, independent  South Vietnam dating back to the Truman Administration.  To ignore that  commitment, it was believed, would encourage Communist inspired, &quot;wars  of national liberation,&quot; worldwide.  Failure to meet this threat could  start the dominos falling, ending who knows where?  There assumptions were  construed as facts in every element of American society.  All decisions  were made with that in mind.  Vietnam was no exception.<br />McMaster has done  a good job of showing that what the men in the arena did was wrong.  He has  made no attempt to show what should have been done differently that would  have enabled America to extricate herself from Vietnam with her credibility  as an ally intact.  John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B.Johnson, and Richard M.  Nixon all waited for that answer as well.  We are all still waiting!  Radio  commentator Paul Harvey ends his program with his trademark comment,  &quot;And now you know the rest of the story.&quot;  Only when that  question is answered conclusively will we be able to say we truly know,  &quot;the rest of the story.&quot;ÿ	2000-01-12

McNamara's book, &quot;In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam,&quot; is a must read. In it, Mr. McNamara details clearly what actions American government leaders took at each phase of the conflict, why they did what they did, the assumptions their actions were based upon, and why, in retrospect, their actions were wrong.  Their intentions were indeed pure: prevent the spread of communism world wide. However, the result of their actions was to uninitentially plunge two nations at opposite ends of the economic spectrum into the hell that was Vietnam.<br />Throughout, Mr. McNamara takes full responsibility for his actions or inactions, something no one else has ever done. He also does an outstanding job of describing the cold war mentatlity that that made South Vietnam seem worth the sacrifice of so many millions of lives and so many billions of dollars. In short, it seemed that the loss of Vietnam would start the fall of nations, like dominos, ending perhaps at the shores of the United States itself. It seemed there was adequate reason to think that given the rape of Eastern Europe by the Soviets after WWII, the stalemate in Korea, the Berlin and Cuban Missile Crises, and Soviet Premier Kruschev's bellicose statement, &quot;We will bury you,!&quot; and the national hysteria caused by McCarthyism. McNamara and Company made their decisions accordingly. The present and future generations that did not and will not grow up under a nuclear shaped cloud called the, &quot;Cold War,&quot; will benefit from reading this account as virtually all decisions were made under these assumptions for over 40 years.<br />Mr. McNamara ends his work with a blueprint for future international relations based on the changing economic and political situations emerging worldwide. His assertions that American ability to shape the world in our own image is now gone and that domestic spending programs are as essential for our security as military spending are deserving of serious study.<br />The Holy Bible says in the book of Proverbs, Chapter 20, Verse 29, &quot;The glory of young men is their strength; of old men, their experience.&quot; Future leaders would do well to heed this &quot;old man's&quot; advise, borne of hard experience. In a world now characterized by weapons of mass destruction in the hands of increasingly radical groups, we can afford to do no less.	2000-01-03

Both sides attempted to turn this remote outpost on the Laotian border into a decisive campaign that would ultimately determine the outcome of the war. Both sides failed in this attempt despite their best efforts.<br /><br />After reading this book I find Khe Sanh to be the war in Vietnam in microcosm. The problems of differing perceptions held by Westmorland, Marine General Walt, the CIA, Special Forces, Marine Force Recon and the Bru tribesmen who occupied Khe Sanh illustrate the violations of the principles of war of objective and unity of command. Hovering above it all was the President of the United States exercising personal control of a battlefield from his office, 10,000 miles away.<br /><br />In retrospect, Khe Sanh was a victory in a sense for the U.S. An isolated U.S. garrison that blew reville and raised a tattered American flag each day despite the inevitable mortar/artillery barrage it drew, told the Bru tribesmen and the North and South Vietnamese that he U.S. was still in control despite being outnumbered significantly. Almost unlimited American artillery and air support helped make the point.<br /><br />Reading this book, one almost feels the fear, frustration, and misery the garrison endured there. Yet the reader senses the fierce pride that only combat soldiers doing a dirty, thankless job can feel. You can also imagine the rage felt when they were told simply that Khe Sanh was no longer important and to simply walk away.<br /><br />Valley is a foxhole level analysis of this campaign that shows how decisions emenating all the way from Washington and Saigon impacted the lives of the men on the ground. They were indeed the bait that lured thousands of North Vietnamese to their deaths. Like elsewhere in Vietnam, they were left with nothing to show for their heroic efforts.	1999-12-26

Between 1995 and 1998 former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara led a series of meetings with our former adversaries in Vietnam designed to discover what caused the war in Vietnam and why the best minds in the world were not able to end it sooner. This book publishes the results of those meetings. Mr. McNamara, in his characteristic, &quot;let the facts speak for themselves&quot; and, &quot;let the chips fall where they may,&quot; style leads a distinguished team of American and Vietnam scholars, government officials, and military men in an analysis of what happened and why.<BR><BR> The misperceptions held by both sides were shocking! Worse still, they could have been solved by simply communicating effectively with each other. The book points out the importance of examining and reexamining long held beliefs concerning your opponent and the desirability of keeping effective lines of communication open even in the midst of war. Because these things did not happen in Vietnam, over 4 million people died fighting a war that neither side wanted. Mr. McNamara did not always come out on the positive side of these analyses. His willingness to submit himself the this scrutiny in order to preclude another Vietnam is commendable. The fact that he and his team effectively led the Vietnamese to do likewise is unprecedented and did much to help heal the wounds of war.<BR><BR>This book should be read by every world leader today. It challenges them to attempt to see their adversaries postition and points out the dangers of failing to do so particularly in an age of nuclear proliferation. Serious students of the War in Vietnam, including historians and military planners will also profit from this work that is destined to become a classic in the field of international relations.	1999-08-20
