As a person interested in philosophy (particularly moral philosophy), my interest was piqued when I saw this book. I am always up for a good criticism of relativism (whether theoretical or pratical). What I got was a far cry from that. Instead, I got a very tired, rambling and oh-so cliche christian-right harrangue against everything not conservative. If that is what you want, go for this book (though Pat Robertson has written better). If that is not what you want, you have been forewarned.  <br /> <br />The biggest problem I have with this book is that the author frankly misunderstands the 'relativism' he rails against. While he rightly states that relativism is the belief that there is no meta-arbiter to decide which beliefs are superior to others, this is not what he laments. He does not lament that society has been rendered incapable of choosing values (because of relativism), but rather that society HAS chosen values, but that they are ONES THE AUTHOR DISAGREES WITH. When he states, as he tirelessly does, that \\"society has no values/standards anymore,\\" he does not mean literally this. Rather, he means only to say, \\"Society has values that I think have moved in the wrong direction.\\" If this is what Mr. Knight means, he should have been honest. Instead of substitling the book, \\"the rise of relativism and the corruption of popular culture,\\" it may have better read, \\"the rise of secularism, leftism and other things I can't stand and the corruption of popular culture.\\" <br /> <br />The next problem is that from a philosophical standpoint, Mr. Knight only asserts that conservative Christian beliefs are better than leftist/secular beliefs but offers precious little argument as to why this is so. The only argument he uses is a (?!) utilitarian one. This, of course, only after he argues against utilitarian thinking! See the humor?  <br /> <br />The third problem I have is that while the book is organized into chapters, the author wanders around so much from sub-rant tosub-rant, that it might as well not be. Most every chapter, whether on secularism, declining standards in TV, or declining standards in architecture (a most unfortunate chapter, by the way), finds our author admonishing against the 'homosexual agenda.'(I am left to assume that the 'heterosexual agenda' is the better agenda, but have no idea why, as Mr. Knight doesn't argue for it.) <br /> <br />I could write more, but I think my point has already been made. The book is sloppy; the book is cliche; the book is poorly thought out and written. Quite simply, it is not worth the time or effort.	2005-10-10

In the late '90's, I considered myself a devoted objectivist. So when i saw a work of fiction focusing on a relationship between a Bircher and and objectivist (assumedly to make fun of both) I had to read it. The result? It was a mildly entertaining, and somewhat disappointing historical novel.  <br /> <br />Woodrow Rainer is a committed young member of the John Birch Society as a result of him having been shot by communists in Hungary. Leonora Goldstein is a young woman entranced by Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism who ends up working for one of objectivists biggest players, Barbara Branden. While the novel centers around Woody and Leonora's budding romance, it is more concerned with chronicling each character's trials and tribulations in the midst of the Cuban missile crisis, the Goldwater presidential campaign, and the burgeoning of the cold war. Gradually we see both Woody and Leonora become disenchanted with each movement and their black and white views of the world.  <br /> <br />The biggest disappointment in this book was the imbalance of attention given to Woody's situation at the expense of Leonora's. The chapters on Woody and the Birchers are quite interesting and detailed. When it comes time to get to Leonora, though, Buckley does little more than rehash the details of Ayn Rand's affair with one of her colleeague's, Nathaniel Branden, and their subsequent schism. Leonora is hardly mentioned at all and while the Rand-Branden affair is fascinating, it is better detailed in both Nathaniel and Barbara Branden's respective autobiographies.  <br /> <br />The second disappointment is that Buckley seems so concerned with detailing historical events and incorporating them into his novel that he forgets trying to develop his characters. WE understand precious little about either Leonora or Woody by way of their motivations and drives. This is particularly disappointing as the novel is about two groups - Bircher's and objectivists - that verge on cult-like and paranoid styles. It would have been interesting, then, for Buckley to try and profile not WHAT Woody and Leonora do, but WHY they do it.  <br /> <br />Otherwise, the book was entertaining, thought-provoking, and a much needed jab at two paranoid idealisms that helped to shape (in good and bad ways) the conservative mind of the 1960's. Despite giving the book only three out of five stars, I would reccomend it to those who are curious about how the conservative landscape was shaped, or are curious about why people do or did join such 'extreme' organizations as the John Birch society of objectivism.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-19

Far from being a radical postmodernist, Polanyi argues that science cannot be passion- or value-free, does not operate by a hard and fast rule-set, and, most importantly, relies on faith as much as reason.  <br /> <br />Of course, much of this is old hat by now. Polanyi wrote SFS before Popper left his significant mark on science saying many of the same things, only louder. Kuhn was a direct contemporary of Polanyi and Feyerabend was still to come. Thus, SFS, consisting of three lectures given to the British Asskociation for the Advancement of Science, has an air of immediacy about it that certain similar works in philosophy of science don't have.  <br /> <br />The first essay is \\"Science and Reality,\\" which discusses why (a) science operates on no a priori rule set, but, at best, a collection of loosely held operational guidelines; and (b) why the act of scientific discovery is every bit as creative an act as artistic creation, and thus, must necessarily be value-imbued. (Popper, anyone?) <br /> <br />The second essay, \\"Authority and Conscience\\" discusses the type(s) of authority involved in science. From the necessarily hierarchal nature of article publishing to the master/apprentice relationship of science education, Polanyi argues that science is necessarily hierarchal, and that this hierarchy, while not ideal, is not per se a bad thing (contra Popper). He also begins his argument that while science is hierarchal, it is not the type of hierarchy that submits to an authority that barks orders. Rather, science is the type of hierarchy that allows all members to be free in exploration, and to challenge the upper tiers of the hierarchy should they feel them wrong. (Polanyi compares the hierarchy of science to the hierarchy of the protestant church; a hierarchy is noticeable, but members are left free tointerpret the bible themselves. This, in contrast to the hierarchy of the catholic church, where the hierarchy involves telling members how the bible is to be interpreted.) <br /> <br />The third essay, \\"Dedication or Servitude\\" is a discussion of why science must be free to survive - that is, why if there needs to be a hierarchy, that hierarchy must not be the type that tells sceintists what to think, but should be one that allows for intellectual freedom, including the freedom to challenge science's conclusions. Polanyi's defense of freedom for science is much the same as Hayek's argument against central planning in society.  <br /> <br />The overarching theme of this book, though, is that sicence is a human enterprise that was invented by and furthered by humans. As such, it cannot be impersonal, value-neutral, or able to attain certitude. Science presupposes a belief shared in common by all scientists - a faith, that is, in the ideals of science and intellectual inquiry that is a faith like any other, to be sure. While I think Polanyi's equation of science as a faith like any others is a bit over the top (science can be self-justified on pragmatic grounds of its past succcesses compared to other methodologies, I think), this book was a treat to read. Far from denigrating science by putting a human face on it, Polanyi's love for, and faith in, science is evident on every page.  <br /> <br />	2005-04-28

At the beggining of \\"It's My Party Too,\\" Christine Todd Whitman throws out a statistic: George W. Bush was reelected in 2004 by the smallest margin ever (3%) of any sitting president to win reelection (let alone a war time president)! This statistic is meant to give more import to her book's thesis: as the republican majority really is razor thin, the party's steady move rightward can only serve to disenchant moderates and, in effect, fracture the party.  <br /> <br />Christie Todd Whitman, of course, has served as a republican governor of New Jersey and EPA adminstrator under George W. Bush. She is also, unfortunately for her, a moderate in a party increasingly dominated by right wingers. In the book, she retells how she (and others like her) has (have) been censored, reprimanded and double crossed by members of her own party for expressing moderate views on things from abortion and environmental protection to stem cell research. (This includes her retelling of an interesting brouhaha she caused in the republican party when she came forward expressing 'moderate' views on abortion as governor). <br /> <br />Part and parcel to Mrs. Whitman's view is an ongoing contrast she makes between the republican party her parents knew and the party she knows. The one her parents knew was a diverse party of diverse viewpoints big enough to hold Phyllis Schlaffley (social conervative), Barry Goldwater (libertarian) and Richard Nixon (by most counts, a moderate). The party she knows today is one which excoriates moderates like Arlen Specter for the mere suggestion that they might support a judge who believes Roe v. Wade should be upheld; a party where the president's reeleciton strategy is to appeal to a righward subsection of its base rather than swing voters, and in so doing, crafting its policy agenda to pander to that subsection. In effect, Mrs. Whitman longs for a day when the republlican party aims not for lockstep ideological purity, but is open about being able to house adiversity of views and stances.  <br /> <br />The biggest problem I have with this book is that while in some senses she is right about the republicans righward tilt, in others she is equally wrong. Just think about some of the new republican superstars: Rudolph Giuliani, George Pataki, Arnold Shwarzenegger, John McCain, etc. All of these are moderates (and all spoke at the well recieved Republican National Convention, presumably at the behest of the Republican party). What befuddles me is that Whitman admits all this in her book (a few paragraphs are devoted to it), but never explains how this does anything but dents her thesis.  <br /> <br />The only other negative about this otherwise decent read is that she meanders quite often into seemingly irrelevant asides. The biggest being a chapter on the republican party's problems with capturing 'the black vote.' Most of this chapter is spent talking about why the republican party truly deserves the black vote. Whether true or false, one is left wondering what this chapter is doing in a book about the rightward move of the republican party (instead of, say, an anthology of essays about \\"Why the Republicans Deserve the Black Vote.\\") Another chapter, recounting her tribulations as head of the EPA, begins with a many page exposition of why Mrs. Whitman loves nature and likes living on a working farm called Pontefract. As  this is a political book with a political topic, asides like this might be attractive in and of themselve (or not), but they become distracting from the book's purpose.  <br /> <br />To close, I enjoyed Mrs. Whitman's book exposing what she sees as a legitimate threat to the republican party and their future. However, I must subtract at least one star for her failure to note that the existence of highly successful moderates within the current party at least dents her theory. I must also subtract a bit for the (what I found) distracting areas of the book that meander and stray from the immediate subject. Still, this should be a book that concerned republicans read.  <br /> <br />	2005-04-22

For those who like gripping court dramas that touch on historiography, epistemology, WWII history, and politics, D.D. Guttenplan has written your kind of book. \\"Holocaust on Trial,\\" is a 'gavel to gavel' account of the David Irving v. Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Book Co. trial.  <br /> <br />Irving, a non-PhD'd historian, writes books purporting to show that there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz, that far fewer Jews died there than is thought, and that Hitler had no knowledge of the 'final solution to the Jewish question.' Lipstadt is an Emory University professor of Jewish Studies who wrote a book, called \\"Denying the Holocaust,\\" in which she brands Irving as a 'dangerous' holocuast denier. Upon the release of Lipstadt's book Irving sued Lipstadt for libel in his home country of England where the libel laws are such that (contra US law) it is the defendent that must prove that libel did NOT occur and that everything she said was accurate. Thus, to show that she didn't libel Irving, Lipstadt must show that everything she writes about him is accurate. In order to do that, she has to, in a court of law, prove that the holocaust happened the way most historians believe - gas chambers and all. And, she must prove that Irving knowingly distorted evidence to arrive at a contrary conclusion.  <br /> <br />Guttenplan's book does a good job recounting the trial with journalistic detail. We get a good feel for who David Irving (who argued his case himself) and who the defendants are (though as Lipstadt doesn't speak at all in the trial, she is certainly the most absent of the characters). We get a good feel for the grave stakes each side is playing for. Should the defense lose, shock waves will flow through the entire historical community, who are watching with baited breath. Should the prosecution lose, Irving will prove himself to be a historical quack. This book does well at painting the picture of a tense, yet spectacular, trial.  <br /> <br />While Guttenplan tries tobe journalistically objective, never dismissing Irving as may be tempting, he certainly doesn't get a good impression of Irving. (Of course, Guttenplan is also quick to point out that just as Irving is not a PhD'd historian, neither is Lipstadt, who's PhD is in Jewish Studies.) Even readers who don't know how the real trial ended are likely to get the continual feeling that Irving is to be outmatched. In this sense, the book is anti-climactic; but just like watching \\"Titanic,\\" the fun is not in finding out how it ends, but in finding out how it gets there. Basically, Lipstadt wins and exposes Irving as a fraudulent historian with questionable motives and you, the reader, get to see how she pulled it off! <br /> <br />Other readers have noted that this book is long on journalism, and short on philosophical rumination. What is proper historiography? How much of history is evidence and how much is inference? How do we know what 'historical truth' is anyhow? None of these questions are discussed at any length. If that is what you want, Deborah Lipstadt and Richard Evans (a historian the defense used to debunk Irving's historical claims) both have books out that touch on these questions. This book is the journalism; not the philosophy.  <br /> <br />Anyhow, this is a very solid book about a tial all of Britian was watching (oddly, it got little publicity in the states). For those concerned with history and the mechanisms by which historians tell the good from the bogus, this is a book worth reading and thinking about.	2005-04-12
US	37928338	R6V4QLGPQI5T7	0830822674	966060934	The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism	Books	1	28	42	N	N	An Embarassment to Scholarship!	About a year ago (March 14, 2004), I reviewed Phillip Johnon's \\"Reason in the Balance,\\" which I thought was a decent (3 stars) book. Of all the proponents of intelligent design, I find him the most respectful and thoughtful. That is why it is a shame that this book was such a dead flop.  <br /> <br />Johnson starts out by chastising evolutionists for abandoning the rule that reason is to be a neutral faculty - that evolutionists defend a conclusion they like without respect to evidence, instead of following evidence wherever it may go regardless of where it leads. He thinks evolutionists have been doing the former while he claims to doing the latter. I don't know about that.  <br /> <br />Much of the book, for instance, is to do with a supposed problem evolution has with explaining how evolution increases genetic information in subsequent mutations. While Johnson means to point out a flaw in evolution, he only betrays how misunderstanding he is on how evolution works. Evolution DOESN'T add information to subsequent genomes (as one would add new sentences to a book). Rather, evolution tweaks and changes information already there in one organism to new information in its offspring (like changing a words in an already existing sentence by replacing one letter at a time with another, until a new word appears.) The fact that Johnson seems oblivious to this should be nothing short of embarassing to those whose views he represents.  <br /> <br />Another rhetorical shift he uses is to imply that there is a rift in science about whether macroevolution even occurs. As 'evidence' he uses the debate between scientists like Dawkins and Wilson and scientists like Margullis and Gould. Of course, what Johnson avoids disclosing is that none of these scientsits do (or did) doubt the occurence of macroevolution! They only debate HOW it happened - whether by gradual adaptation of punctuated equilibria theory (i.e., by gradual modification over time or sudden large changes). Either Johnson was unaware of what this debate was actually about (in which case he has no grasp of elementary scientific literature) or he simply wanted to portray the deabate as something it wasn't by shiftily leaving out relevent details and context. I think it is the latter.  <br /> <br />If that wasn't enough, Johnson also gets into questioning certain characters integrity for no apparent reason (other than that they do not agree with him). First up, academic Philip Wentworth. Johnson \\"analyzes\\" an essay Wentworth wrote about how his higher education at Harvard was accompanied by a loss of faith. Wentworth attributes this to education, which forced him to question his beliefs according to evidence. Johnson's reply? Hogwash! Wentworth was just insincere in his faith to begin with (otherwise, he wouldn't have lost his faith.  <br /> <br />Next up? Paul Davies - a scientist who posits something akin to a goal directed evolution. Johnson recounts, though, how when asked, Davies disavowed supernaturalism and intelligent design theory. Johnson's reply? Hogwash! The disavowal is insincere! Davies is just scared to come out against the scientific community.  <br /> <br />(Read: these authors, who disagree with me, can't be sincere. How do I know? Because if they were sincere, they'd agree with me. And as they don't, they can't be sincere!) <br /> <br />Lastly, Johnson attacks science for making an assumption of naturalism. But towards the end of the book, Johnson suggests that we restart our inquiry into the origins of life by 'starting with The Word.\\" Of course, doing that makes HUGE assumptions of a kind far more egregious than science's assumption of naturalism. It assumes (a) that God does (not might) exist, and (b) that the Bible (authorship unconfirmed, of course) is an accurate source of info about God (as opposed to the Koran, the Bhagvat Gita, or the Book of Mormon). How Johnson can excoriate science for making an assumption of naturalism while suggesting that it would be alright to 'begin with The Word' and assume (a) and (b), is beyond me.  <br /> <br />I must reiterate that I have enjoyed several of Johnson's books in the past, and am on his side when it comse to thinking that science has conflated the idea of sceince with the philosophy of naturalism. But this book is just bad, and I can't help but think that were I on Johnson's side of the debate over evolution (fortunately I'm not), I would be thoroughly embarassed by his scientific illiteracy.	2005-04-04

George Edward Moore has the unfortunate privilege of having spawned one of the most uninformedly invoked ideas of all time - the naturalistic fallacy. Like Thomas Kuhn's \\"paradigm shift,\\" the naturalistic fallacy is tirelessly invoked by writers to mean any number of things, not many of which agree with the author's original usage. That is perhaps one reason to read G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica. Another, of course, is that it is a classic of twentieth century ethics! <br /> <br />Most of the chapters, of course, deal with Moore's idea about the naturalistic fallacy. Contra those numerous authors that use it to mean simply the fallacy of supposing what is natural to be de facto good (that is one manifestation of it, but not it), the naturalistic fallacy has a much broader meaning. The fallacy, in Moore's view, is to explain what is \\"The Good\\" in any way other than to say \\"it is The Good,\\" - to suppose, that is, that \\"The Good\\" is definable in any way. To Moore, \\"The Good\\" is simply \\"The Good\\" because it is good and that is all we can say. Any attempt to equate \\"The Good\\" with something else - pleasure, a metaphysical entity, what is natural, etc. - is a manifestation of the naturalistic fallacy.  <br /> <br />Moore uses the first chapter to explain why the naturalistic fallacy is a fallacy. The answer is similar to Hume's is/ought gap. That is that any attempt to say what \\"The Good\\" is - i.e., the Good is what causes pleasure; The Good is what exists in the natural order - is nothing other than a criterion for recognizing things that are good; what explanations of this sort are not are actual definitions of the good. (In other words, saying that things which give pleasure tend to be good is much different than saying that \\"The Good\\" is constituted by what gives pleasure and that alone.) Another question that the above definitions can always be met with is WHY pleasure (nature, etc.) are good? In which case, the only real answer - owning to \\"The Good's\\" ineffability,is \\"They just are; it is obvious.\\" <br /> <br />The next few chapters (the bulk of the book) is spent trying to prove a negative case - that most ethical theories en vogue suffer from the naturalistic fallacy. Moore spends most of his time on utilitarianism but devotes a good amount also to metaphyiscal theories of the good, also.  <br /> <br />After the negative cases are made (I found some more convincing than others), he gives a positive case. Here is where Moore is suprising. While he argues that \\"Good\\" and \\"Bad\\" in regards to ends are factual matters, he is something of a utilitarian in practical ethics - meaning that he sees right conduct as judged by the consequences of the conduct in question. He is also a certain type of relativist who allows that what is right conduct often varies from time to time and situation to situation, as an act performed at one time in one scenario may well have different consequences as the same act performed in a slightly different situation in another time.  <br /> <br />All in all, I found this book exciting to read. Moore is a clear and engaging writer, and with a few exceptions of repitition, the book was easy and fun to digest. I am giving it four stars despite the fact that I disagree with much of it. While I am prepared to say, with Moore, that \\"Good\\" may well be essentially indefinable, I did not see him do anything to try and prove that \\"Good\\" was a property of the object, rather than a sentiment of the speaker. And if that is so, then we've no reason to suppose \\"Good\\" and \\"Bad\\" to be ethical facts of the matter, as opposed to sentiments that different speakers with different intuitions are expressing.  <br /> <br />Be that as it may, everyone concerned with ethics should read this book. Moore argues strongly for recognition of the naturalistic fallacy and what it means for ethics. Whether you agree or disagree, modern ethics is often a response to this guy.	2005-04-04

Unlike the executive and legislative branches of government, the judiciary is not supposed to be political. It is to make rulings on law, not political sentiment - on whether the law is constitutional as judged by the document's text, not on whether the law accords with the judge's own political beliefs.  <br /> <br />Understandably, Mark Levin is concerned that this is an ideal that the Supreme Court does not often live up to these days. More and more, the Court's rulings sound more like political arguments rather than legal ones. (Witness Roe v. Wade, where the right to abort is granted for moral and medical reasons with hardly a word devoted to legal rationale.) More and more, the Court is willing to look past the Constitution's actual words in favor of doing what the Court thinks is politically just. (Witness Lawrence v. Texas, where the court ignored the states' rights granted in Amendment X in favor of a 'general right to privacy' that is nowhere to be found in the document's text.) <br /> <br />But alas, in the end, I had to give this book 2 stars. See, while Levin rigihtly excoriates the Court for ruling in a post hoc fashion (picking the desired result first, and only then, searching for a legal argument to get them there), I can only accuse Levin of the same thing! This book is full of inconsistencies that lead the careful reader to suspect that Levin wants so desperately to arrive at politically conservative results that any legal rationale he offers was only offered to get him to that desired conclusion.  <br /> <br />Limited space permits me only a few examples. Many places in the book see Levin being quite clear that he believes the Court should interpret the Constituiton as it is written; what the document says is what it means. I believe this too, which is perhaps why I'm sensitive to how inconsistently Levin uses this idea.  <br /> <br />One the one hand, Levin quite rightly notes that the right to abort and the general right to privacy are not found anywhere in the Constitution's text and are, therefore, illegitimate. But soon after, Levin calls the McCain-Feingold Campaign Reform Act an unconstitutional abridgement of free speech because it limits the amount of money individuals can give to political campaigns. But, if Levin is sincere in his beilef that the court be loyal to the constitution's TEXT, then he must answer where he sees the first amendment refer to a person's right to give money! (It does not, of course!) Similarly, he suggests that the Court has gone too far in letting Congress regulate interstate commerce. But were he a textualist, he would realize that the text of the Constitution does not place limits on which interstate commerce the government can regulate!  <br /> <br />Another part of Levin's criticism that the Court lets congress regulate too much interstate commerce is a 3 page diatribe on POLITICAL arguments against regulation - why regulation is bad economic policy! While I am a libertarian who agrees with Levin's economics on this score, I am also apparently more sincere than Levin in my belief that judge's should limit themselves to legal, rather than political or economic, considerations when on the bench. Whether regulation is good or bad economics is absolutely irrelevent to whether it is Constitutional, and is thoroughly out of place in a book purporting to argue against infusing politics into law! (But apparently, Levin will make exceptions.) <br /> <br />That said, it is quite evident to me that Levin uses the same type of post-hoc method of reasoning that he accuses the Court of using. That is, he knows what results he wants - without exceptions, those of mainstream conservatism (suprise, suprise) - and uses legal arguments to arrive at those pre-determined conclusions. There are simply too many inconsistencies in Levin's reasoning for me to think otherwise.  <br /> <br />To close, I will mention again that I am in agreement with Levin on his main points. I do believe that the Court has strayed from what I feel is its duty to interpret the Constitution as a fixed and written document, rather than as a judicallly malleable one. My argument is not with Levin's thesis, but with his particulars. I simply do not trust him when he writes that politics should have nothing to do with the law, as I think his book is itself more a political, than a legal, tract.  <br /> <br />	2005-04-01

In Rights and Wrongs, legal scholar Alan Dershowitz delineates and argues for what he suggests is a new theory of rights. Having problems both with natural rights theory and with legal positivism, Dershowitz argues that rights are neither innate nor simple decrees by lawmakers; rather, human rights are invented by us and for us as checks against past human wrongs. That is, Dershowitz argues that rights are created (not discovered) in response to historc injustices in order to prevent their reoccurrence.     I find most of Dershowitz's argument convincing, particularly in regards to natural rights theories and their problems. First, he brings up the obvious epistemic difficultis. If natural rights exist, then where do they exist and how can we get at them? In the face of so much disagreement over what our natural rights are (each person generally supporting that conception which justifies her own political preferences), is there ANY reason to suggest that natural rights are anything but human-made 'oughts' masquerading as 'is' statements? Dershowit, through this and other arguments, presents a strong case that the answer is 'no.'    Then we go onto legal positivism. While Dershowitz is no friend to natural rights theory, he finds legal positivism to err towards the opposite extreme by taking the view that rights are nothing but the codified wiil of the legislators. There must, says Dershowitz, be something more exhalted about human rights than for them to be legislation as usual. While I understand Dershowitz's sympathies, I don't think his case here is very strong. Why? It has to do with what I think is Dershowitz's faulty charaterization of legal positivism. (His new theory turns out, I think, to be what logical positivism said all along.)    Dershowitz seems to think that if legal positivism is true, then this means that human rights are only the codified manifestation of the legislature's (or court's?) whim or say-so. Contra this, Dershowitz believes that while rights are human constructs, they have their roots in history, not on legislative whim. Of course, every legal positivist I know or have read would readily agree with this.     Positivist Justice Holmes first sentence of \\"Common Law\\" reads, \\"The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The felt necessities...\\" Another famed positivist, Justice Hugo Black, waxed eloquent in his book, \\"Constitutional Faith\\" about the bill of rights' historical rationale. And would any legal positivst deny that the 13th and 14th amendents were created to remedy historic injustices, as opposed to being created merely by legislative whim?     Quite honestly, I think Dershowitz's idea of what positivism is is something of a strawman. In consequence, I think that the 'new' theory he defends is actually one that had already been espoused by such positivists as Holmes and Black. (The funny thing is that while I generally agree with Dershowitz's case, professors, etc., have always seen me as a legal positivist.)     But I did give the book 3 of 5 stars because I think that all in all it is a worthwhile read, particularly by those who are believers in the idea of natural rights. (It is also interesting to read a book in which Dershowitz praises the judicial methodology of none other than Antonin Scalia!)	2005-03-22

In John Krakauer's introduction to this fine book, he makes an indirect but deliberate comparison between Middle-Eastern Islamic fundamentalism and the Mormon fundamentalism on our own shores. Undeniably, this sets the tone for the rest of this book, exploring the Mormon faith. While some could think the comparison controversial, this book did much to convince me that it was apt. (The big difference being one of size and power, not temperment or intent.) <br /> <br />The main event is this: in 1984, Brenda Lafferty and her one-year-old daughter had their throats slit by Mormon fundamentalists Ron and Dan Lafferty. This, for no other reason than that Ron recieved a revelation from God decreeing that several individuals - including Brenda and her child - be killed. While it is readily admitted that Ron and Dan Lafferty had long been excommunicated from the mainstream Mormon church, Krakauer uses the murders as a springboard to take us through Mormonism's own checkered history, thereby helping to put the murders at least in some context. (Why did Dan and Ron break from the church? Why did they dislike Brenda Lafferty? Why did neither brother express remorse at killing in the name of God? These questions begin to be answered by going back through the history of the Church of Latter Day Saints.) <br /> <br />Krakauer's chapters alternate between early and recent history - between the church's early years of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, to chronicles of recent Mormon scandals to do with polygamy and the very public abduction of Elizabeth Smart by a Mormon Fundamentalist. In so doing, Krakauer explores the roots of Mormon fervency and the often brutal effects that fervency has in curent Mormon societies.  <br /> <br />I agree with another reviewer who states that Krakauer, in exposing the underbelly of both 'mainstream' and 'fundamentalist' Mormonism, appears biased against the Mormon church(es) and way(s) of life. That said, I can't say that I blame Krakauer for that view. IF what Krakauer writes in these pages are true, then this negative view is indeed justified. We see a world where women have absolutely no voice and are often beaten and condemned should they not be completly obedient to their husband. We see a world that is so tightly controlled by the church hierarchy that members' highest duty is unquestioning obedience to whatever the Church president (referred to as \\"uncle ___\\") happens to want. Consequently, we see a world where God's law is everything and man's law, nothing. (Indeed, we see a world approaching that of the Taliban.) <br /> <br />All that said, this book is a hard one to put down, much like the bloody horror film is hard to turn off. Through Krakauer's excursion into early and recent Mormon history, we begin to see the context that lead to the murders of two innocents (\\"Innocent to whom?\\" is the question!) by two brothers that heard the voice of God. In so doing, Krakauer calls into question the nature and virtue of faith in general.	2005-03-20

The main thrust of the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion is  to question whether theological arguments for God that assign Him positive attributes (omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent, etc.) go beyond reason's limits in assigning these attributes. We watch Cleanthes (believer in theological arguments), Demea (believer more on faith) and Philo (disbeliever in theology's efficacy) hash out whether reason and experience alone give us reason to say anything whatever about God.  <br /> <br />Hume explores all of the major arguments for God's existence. First, the a posteriori argument is explored; the argument that just as seeing a house gives us reason to assume an architect and builder, seeing the world should give us reason to infer a designer. Hume (through the skeptical voice of Philo) sees much wrong with this argument. Why? Because the reason we infer a builder for a house is because experience has shown us that houses have builders, thus when we see a house, we assume that, like other houses we've seen, this one too has a builder. But experience does not tell us that where there is a world, there is a designer. The leap is extra-experiential. Further, even if we DID infer a designer, why infer just one? Houses have construction crews of multiple people; if we analogize between the house and the world, then why not infer that the world, too, might have infinite creators? (And why infer that the world's creator is omnipotent, if all that is needed to create something is to be more powerful than the thing created - no more, no less?) <br /> <br />Next, we go through the a priori argument - the argument from first cause. Hume (Philo) is quick to point out the obvious flaw with this. If everything needs a cause, then what caused God? If God is said to be eternally existing, then why couldn't the natural world - rather than God - be thought eternal instead? And further, why is a infinite chain of causes and effects so unimaginable, anyhow? (Isn't it just as sensical as an eternal  God itself not caused?) <br /> <br />Lastly, Philo brings up the argument from evil. In a nutshell, Philo suggests that while theology sees all the perfections of the world, proclaiming them clear evidence of remarkable design, theologians dismiss or downplay the imperfections. If God is said to all-good Himself, then why did he create humans with such flaws? (one assumes that an all-powerful, all-good God could have avoided those errors).  <br /> <br />Still, the main thrust of this book is that Philo, far from challenging whether God exists, challenges theologies capacity to assign ANY characteristics to God by reason and experience alone. Hume does a good job not only in outlaying arguments as to why reason is not capable of knowing a thing about God, but also in making believable dialogues (compared to Plato, whose characters are all made to be one-dimensional foils for \\"Socrates.\\") As in so many other areas, Hume was a pioneer in the realm of the philosophy of God. This book furnishes strong proof of that! <br />	2005-03-10

Many people struggle privately with their religion, at least some time in their life. Of  course, when they do, their tendency is usually not to write a book chronicling it. Fortunately for us, this is precisely what Canadian journalist Irshad Manji did. This book, written as an open letter to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, offers us a first-hand glimpse at Ms. Manji's struggles to identify, wade through, and possibly rectify \\"the trouble[s] with Islam.\\" <br /> <br />What are these troubles? The first is that unlike Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, etc., Islam's mainstream consists of Koranic literalists and what Manji calls \\"foundamentalists.\\" The Koran, so they say, is not only to be taken completely literally, but is perfect.  <br /> <br />As Christianity went through an arduous enlightenment period where Christians were forced to rethink and retool Christianity, Manji would like to see the same for Islam. She would like to see a time when Muslims are taught the virtues of thinking for themselves, learning from sources other than the Koran and the Madrassa. She even invokes a little-known idea from the Koran as backup: \\"ijtihad,\\" meaning something along the lines of \\"the act of independently interpreting Islamic law.\\"  <br /> <br />I applaud the Enlightenment spirit in which Ms. Manji writes this book. It is the same spirit that moved Thomas Paine to write \\"The Age of Reason\\" and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to write \\"The Women's Bible\\" - two books that dared to question the coherence and morality of Biblical literalism. What I question, though - and what Ms. Manji fails to give a good answer for - is whether Islam can really embrace such an Enlightenment process.  <br /> <br />Ms. Manji admits several times that there are plenty of passages in the Koran that endorse a purely literal reading of the Koran, and others suggesting that Islam is the perfect manifestation of God's will. (She cites no counter passages!) So how does one go about convincing Muslims to take passages endorsing Koranic literalism non-literally? And how does a religion that's holy book writes of itself as the perfect and final word of God convince itself that this holy book might not be so perfect or final after all? As one of Islam's core tenets is literalism, then how can Islam be de-literalized without, in some way, de-Islamizing it as well? <br /> <br />I am not suggesting that Islam cannot modernize in this way. Christianity and Judaism did it. And maybe with a book like this as a call to action, Islam can do it too. All I can say is that I would have given the book two more stars had Ms. Manji actually handled this question directly. Instead of \\"Would I like to see Islam change?\\", maybe, \\"Can Islam as it actually is actually change?\\" Instead of \\"How would I like to see Islam change?\\", maybe, \\"How much is it feasible for Islam to change, at least for now?\\" And more importantly, \\"How can a religion that's rigidity seems part of its very identity become less rigid WITHOUT LOSING THAT IDENTITY?\\" Had I heard Ms. Manji - a direct and firey writer if ever there was one - addressed this head-on, I'd have easily given the book five stars.  <br /> <br />In the end, I must give it three stars. Ms. Manji has written a needed book in a firey, iconoclastic style that deserves high appreciation. Shei s not afraid to call Islam out where she sees fit, and is not afraid to get personal about her simultaneous love and uncomfort towards Islam. Good book. But I'm waiting for the needed sequel.	2005-02-10

As many extremists and fanatics believe there is a secret world government - a New World Order - behind whose doors the world's fate is connivingly controlled, it must actually exist somewhere - at some location, - right? Thus was Jon Ronson's impetus for writing what would become this book. He wanted to talk to extremists so as to find out - and find - where the New World Order they talked so ravenously about existed.  <br /> <br />At the risk of spoiling the suprise for you, he didn't find it. But the resulting book is a revealing, shocking, and hillarious account of Ronson's attempt.  <br /> <br />Ronson recounts his meetings with a muslim extremist of the UK, several white supremacists, David Icke (a former British sports commentator who now believes the world is controlled by descendants of extra-terrestrial lizards), and a Papist preacher in Africa.  <br /> <br />What does this motley lot have in common? They all very sincerely believe in the New World Order and that they know where it is and who is behind it. The probem is that each of them seem to have a different take on who is in it and where it is. A few of the more riveting chapters are to do with Ronson's accompaniment of an 'underground journalist' named Big Jim Tucker, who is planning on infiltrating this world government - the Bilderberg group - at their next meeting in a posh hotel. <br /> <br />I'm not sure I wiil be giving anything away when I tell you that Ronson ends as he began - with not a single sighting of the secret world government that everyone talks about but can't offer proof of. But his journey not only makes for a comical and exciting read, but an educating one as well. Rare is the person that an infiltrate and offer up a close up view of those we call 'extremists.' And rare is the person who, like Ronson, can show us in equal parts their fanaticism and their humanness (and how the two might be connected). <br /> <br />An excellent read from start to finish. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-31
US	37928338	R2WG91K76P5AGG	0805071474	234644233	The Triumph of Evolution: and the Failure of Creationism	Books	3	2	2	N	Y	Who is This Book For?	Niles Eldredge admits in this book that he could care less whether people, in their private lives, choose to believe evolution or creationism. The reason Eldredge wrote this book, then, is becuase of the evergrowing tumult over whether to teach 'intelligent design' in schools as a science. This, Eldredge contents, is often due to creationists' misunderstanding of what science is, and hence, why 'God did it,' can't qualify as serious science, and also creationists' misunderstanding (or willing misreading) of sceintific evidence corroborating evolution. In brief, Eldredge is trying to 'set the record straight' on where evolution and creation stand - showing why evolultion has triumphed, and creation (in all of its incarnations), failed.<br /><br />Does he succeed? Maybe. He does give a good overview of what the scientific process is, why creationism can't qualify as science, what the fossil record REALLY shows, why the 'irreducible complexity' 'argument' fails not only now, but failed when Paley formulated it over 100 years ago, etc. He smashes creationist assertions about there being no transitional forms in the fossil record (Homo Erectus anyone?!), smashes holes in creationist lunacies to do with the earth being thousands, rather than millions upon millions, of years old, and the incongruity of their denial of macro-evolution while they concede the reality of micro-evolution.<br /><br />But, alas, there is one big problem with Edlredge's book - a problem that can easily contribute to the book's efficacy. The problem is that the book seems both to be too basic for already-believing evolutionists, but too complex in certain sections for creationists (and yes, I am assuming that creationists know little to no science!). On one hand, Eldredge's discussion of evolution in the first half of the book is more basic than most any evolutionary text for lay-readers that I have seen and will likely leave the evolutionist unsatisfied. At the same time, the second half of the book - where Elderedge refutes creationist claims directly, most pertaining to geology, introduces terms and ideas (without explanation or definition)that creationists will likely be unfamiliar with. Evolutionists will learn little that they didn't know before, and creationists will learn little because the book assumes too much by way of scientific knowledge, particularly about geology.<br /><br />Still, I would advise creationists of all stripes to read this book as Eldredge does a good job explaining where creationism goes wrong. Especially of note, Eldredge does a good job of explaining that there ARE transitional forms (Homo erectus anyone?!), that it is virtually impossible not to see that humans and apes share a common ancestor (99% similarity in DNA!), that \\"God did it\\" does not yield empirical testability that science requires (but evolution does.)<br /><br />As a well-read evolutionist, I can't say this book gave me anything I didn't know, but it at least deserves three stars for figthing the good fight.the book - where Elderedge refutes creationist claims directly, most pertaining to geology, introduces terms and ideas (without explanation or definition)that creationists will likely be unfamiliar with.

Dr. Thomas Sowell's book, \\"A Conflict of Visions\\" is an attempt to explore the primary, if unarticulated, philosophy of historical conservatism and liberalism. His thesis is that conservatism has a tradition of operating by a vision of humans that sees them as 'constrained.' Some characteristics of this view are: <br /> <br />(1) Humans have generally selfish natures.  <br />(2) Human reason, while valuable, is quite limited. <br />(3) Because of this, society grows by evolution, not central deliberate planning.   <br />(4) Social decisions generally involve not 'solutions' but 'trade-offs' (how much good for how much downside?) <br />(5) Procedural fairness, rather than results-based fairness, is the key to a just society.  <br /> <br />Conversely, Sowell writes that the liberal tradition operates on a vision of humankind that is 'unconstrained.' Features include:  <br /> <br />(1)Human selfishness is a quality that can be overcome by reason and education.  <br />(2) Human reason, when used properly, can trump human impulses, emotions, and feelings.  <br />(3)The planned society is best. Non-planned societies = chaos. <br />(4) While policy trade-offs might be a good short term solution, reason can discover true solutions that are equitable to all.  <br />(5)Procedural fairness is not fair so long as disperate outcomes result.  <br /> <br />Sowell backs up his thesis with impressive research, citations, and quotes. This is refreshing becuase it makes sure he is not simply creating strawmen. From the conservative side, his quites tend to come from Edmunde Burke, Adam Smith, Freidrich Hayek, and Oliver Wendell Holmes. From the liberal side, his quotes tend to come from William Godwin, Marquis de Condorcet, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Ronald Dworkin. (As one who has read all of these authors, I can assure the readers that there are no strawmen here.) <br /> <br />The only murky part of the book is that Sowell makes this vision sound too simplistic. While he acknowledges that not all thinkers will fall into either one or the other category (and even has a chapter on Marx and Mill - two thinkers that borrow from both sides), some of his choices of people and quotes to exempify each 'side' are less clean-cut than one might like.  <br /> <br />As a libertarian, it is strange to me to see Edmunde Burke (who valued tradition more than most anything) Friedrich Hayek (who valued the innovation of capitalism more than anything) in the same group. (And Holmes is not necessarily the best jurist to exemplify 'strict construction' of the contitution). [It would have been interesting to see, then, an appendix on the ideological divorce of libertarianism and conservatism.] On the other 'side,' I kept thinking that, although William Godwin might be a good example of someone who believed reason to be virtually omnipotent, he was also a liability to Sowell's case, as Godwin did not believe in a planned society whatever and in fact, was an anarchist who was against planning in any form!  <br /> <br />While the examples aren't perfect, Sowell didn't intend them to be. All in all, it is a good book and I think Sowell's argument is a good one, and for the most part, true. For some other books in a similar vain - exploring the ideological divide between sides - try George Lakoff's \\"Moral Politics\\" and E.J. Dionne's \\"Why Americans Hate Politics.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-19

After reading halfway through Tom Wolf's mammoth novel, \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons,\\" I found myself wondering whether to read on. Many other reviews are correct. The characters and characterizations in this book about contemporary college life as seen through a naive girl from Sparta, North Carolina seem simply to be overdone caricatures.  <br /> <br />So why did I keep reading, only to give the book 4 stars? The second half of the book makes up for the shortcomings of the first half. The characters gain more depth as the situations they are put in begin to take shape. Charlotte, our main character from small-town America, gets in with the 'in' crowd, in the process, compromising much of the values she entered college with. The character of Jojo Johansson, Dupont University's hot-shot basketball star, decides to beef up his academic workload at the risk of his hopes for the NBA. And so it goes; the plots thicken, the characters deepen, and the action begins to make these 'caricatures' into humans.  <br /> <br />At base, this is a story about people trying to find themselves in the hustle and bustle that is the modern university. The six-or-so characters that Wolfe introduces all have one thing in common - they are all trying to figure out who they are and who they want to be. In the process of this coming-of-age tale, Wolfe hits on the root of what college is all about - it is about making yourself who you are going to become.  <br /> <br />All in all, Wolfe has written a good - not a great - novel. Though the characters might appear stale in the beginning, the dilligent reader will be rewarded with a forward-moving tale of characters not as one-dimensional as they first appear.	2005-01-14

(p. 212)	The above quote is from scientist AND sociologist of science Michael Lynch, characterizing the type of arguments to be found in this book (as opposed to the 'science wars' as they are carried out in the mainstream press).  While the science wars have largely consisted of ad hominems, bitter denunciations, and fuming tempers, Lynch is correct. What one finds in this book is, \\"more peaceful arguments.\\"  <br /> <br />This book, edited by a chemist and a socioloigist of science, is a collection of essays by scientists and sociologists of scientists to do with the 'science war.' the questions at issue involve: Can science reach a truly objective reality? Is science 'socially constructed' (and what does such a term mean?) How much do social rather than natural factors influence science discovery and consensus-building? etc. <br /> <br />It grows apparent in the give and take of articles in this book taht the answer to all of these questions is harder and stickier than it first appears. For instanace, we learn that when scientists and sociologists of science hear a term like 'socially constructed,' they hear two very different things. To the scientist, this means 'not real' and is taken as a criticism. To the sociologist of sceince, it means that sceince is irreducibly a social enterprise (not 'not real').  <br /> <br />This volume is refreshing because each side is quite eager and willing to listen to eachother, avoid caricature, argue calmly, and respond calmly. There is much vigorous debate, to be sure, but there is also many an essay that starts out with something like: \\"After reading the essays submitted, i am shocked at how much my colleages actually agree...\\" While consensus isn't fully reached (why should we expect THAT?) there are a few things that are unilaterally agreed upon (as quoted from David Mermin's essay, \\"How to converse with sociologists\\" pg. 97-98): <br /> <br />\\"Rule 1: [Participants should f]ocus on the substance of what is being said, and not on alleged motives for saying it... <br /> <br />Rule 2: Do not expect people from remote disciplines to speak clearly or understand the nuances of your own disciplinary language... <br /> <br />Rule 3: Do not assume that it is as easy as it may appear for you to penetrate the disciplinary language of others.\\" <br /> <br />With that said, this is a book that makes an honest attempt to air both sides of the 'science war' while getting both sides to honestly understand the other. As you will quickly discover, the two sides that are often conveyed as radically divergent from the other, as often as not, meet in the middle. \\"[T]he more peaceful arguments,\\" indeed.	2005-01-11
US	37928338	R5HRMQCKP4CXZ	0415078652	963984611	The Open Universe: An Argument for Indeterminism From the Postscript to The Logic of Scientific Discovery	Books	3	16	19	N	N	"An argument for indeterminism?" Not Quite!	I do not have to tell any of you philosophically inclined amazon shoppers how much a quagmire the determinism/indeterminism problem has been in philosophy. As long as philosophers have been doing philosophy, there has been opinion after opinion on the subject, some decent, most not.  <br /> <br />Here comes Karl Popper (in my opinion, one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century) to offer his two cents. While I am a very big Popper fan, I did not come away from this book as satisfied as I could have been. The title promises a 'case for indeterminism' and at best, all we get is a \\"case why if the world is determined, we couldn't know that anyhow.\\" Let me explain.  <br /> <br />Popper sums determinism thus: Determinism is the beleif that future states of the universe are completely inevitable, as every effect proceeds inexorably from causes by static laws of nature. A crucial part of determinism, says Popper, is the belief that had we 'sufficient' knowledge of a past moment and the causal laws of the universe, we could predict with pinpoint accuract any future state of the world, as the future state would come inevitably from those unwavering cause/effect laws of nature.  <br /> <br />In this book, Popper attacks the second part of this book - the view that so long as we have 'sufficient' knowledge of the physical coordinates of a point in time, and of the relevant scientific 'laws,' we could predict a future state. He does this in two ways. First, the fact is that this idea is untestable. If we predict a future state and get it wrong, we can ALWAYS say that the information we had was not sufficient enough, and that even though we got the prediction wrong,it is only owing to our imperfect information (rather than, as plausibly, a not-completely-determined universe). Second, Popper suggests (rightly, in my opinion) that COMPLETE accuracy is something of a chimera. To predict a happening with COMPLETE accuracy, one would need to predict it down to the smallest measurement of time - down to the smallest measurement of space. But we have no reason to believe there exist an ABSOLUTELY SMALLEST measure of either of these two things (even though there might be a smallest-we-can-get-thus-far).  <br /> <br />These arguments are suprisingly solid (and when I've talked with determinists, they try and skirt these questions like the plague). The problem is that this is in no way a CASE FOR INDETERMINISM, as Popper wants it to be. Even if he has shown that we can not or could not successfully predict the future in any exactitude, this leaves determinism unscathed. The only thing it does is shows that even if determinism were true, we couldn't quite KNOW it (because we lack the type of omnipotence needed to know that we know it).  <br /> <br />That, in addition to the fact that pointing out a problem for determinists does not, in any way, make a de jure case for indeterminism (just as criticizing theory A does not automatically mean we should accept B). Popper even admits to this early in his book when he suggests that neither option - determinism or indeterminism - really make all that much sense. Determinism would mean that everything (including us making up our minds on the determinism/indeterminism problem) is completely determined in advance. Indeterminism means that somewhre, there must be causes that are themselves uncaused, or, random). Either way, any answer offered beomes very bizarre very fast, and Popper gives us little reason to think indeterminism any more sensical than determinism (other than intuitional arguments).  <br /> <br />So after reading this, I am left as I was: scratching my head and wondering whether the determinism/indeterminism problem will ever be solved. My guess? It won't, as the question seems bigger than what we can get after in our first-person viewpoints (and as William James said, if we are determined, we may just be determined to 'feel' free, which would render a 'real' solution impossible). While Popper has made some decent and original arguments highlighting problems for determinism, anyone picking up this book expecting a 'case for indeterminism' (as the title suggests) will be disappointed. All we get is a 'case why even if determinism is true, we couldn't know it as such.'	2004-12-21

There are sacred cows among us.  1.) bin Laden and al Qaeda are crazed lowbrow hoodlums who hate us for who we are rather than our foreign policy decisions. (republican) 2.) We are largely winning the war on terror against these hoodlums. (republican) 3.) It is possible for us to win an effective war on terror while keeping bloodshed to a minimum.(democrat) 4.) International interests (making sure countries like France like us) should trump Americn interests. (democrat)  <br /> <br />\\"ENOUGH!,\\" says Robert Sheuer in this brave and needed book criticizing the US handling of the war on terror. First, bin Laden and al Qaeda are not crazed irrationals who simply hate us for who we are. Rather, says Sheuer, they are highly bright, rational, and (in a value neutral sense) corageous individuals who hate us for what we do on the international scene, rather than who we are. Second, Scheuer suggests that through tactical blunders, overeagerness, and general hubrs, we are nowhere close to securing Afghanistan (I personally am not sure about this point) and are fighting an unnecessary and attention-diverting war in Iraq, while al Qaeda has been busy recruiting, strategizing, and growing.  <br /> <br />So what can we do to actually ameliorate the threat of al Qaeda? One of two things, Scheuer suggests. The first (and least likely) solution is to...give into al Qaeda's foreign policy demands. This would involve such things as ending our unquestioning support for Israel at the expense of Palestine, Discontinuing relations with Saudi Arabia (a most opressive and tyrranical regime), withdraw our troops from the Arabian Peninsula, and discontinuing support for countries like China and India, who quite unabashedly wage war on Muslims. Needless to say, Scheuer realizes that this will never happen (even though, to Scheuer's eyes, the claims are legitimate).  <br /> <br />The only thing left then, says Scheuer, is to commit ourselves to a brutal all-out war with al Qaeda and, in a sense,throw our PC caution to the wind. As Americans, we have grown quite squeamish of the idea that...well...war is war. Instead of dinking around the problem of al Qaeda by trying to \\"institute democracy\\" in two existing countries while merely \\"gathering intelligence\\" on al Qaeda, we should have, from the start, waged an all-out miilitary blitz against al Qaeda, doing whatever we have to do to destroy the organization and their supporters through brute military force. (Needless to say, this makes most of us, including myself, a bit squeamish.) <br /> <br />For the record, this is the only problem I had with the book. After telling us how highly unconventional an 'army' al Qaeda is (they have no borders, uniform, laws governing them, or 'central' headquarters to speak of) Scheuer doesn't come close to explaining how we can actually go after such a decentralized and militarily shifty group. In the end, his solution poses, to my eyes, as many difficulties as those he finds in the way we've handled ourselves thus far.  <br /> <br />But, alas. I will not deduct any stars for it because all in all, this book is the bravest, most iconoclastic, and least partisan book I've read to date on our war on terror. In an age where most of our post-Sept.-11th authors don't seem to write unless they have some political group to placate (generally called \\"preaching to the converted\\") Scheuer's only allegiance is to giving the American people a non-partisan and unabashedly honest critique of what's gone wrong so far and advice on how to correct it.  <br /> <br />Whether you agree or disagree (and particularly the latter) this book deserves to be read, thought about, and discussed.	2004-12-16

Why study science at all? Is evolutionary psychology science or informed speculation? Who were the Neanderthals? If these look like lofty questions, that is because they are. But author Ian Tattersall does his best to speculate answers (or at very least, discourse on why one can't be had.) <br /> <br />Tattersal is somewhat iconoclastic. For instance, he tries to dispell the 'myth' that evolution is a gradual process of small tinkerings and explicates the view (first made by SJ Gould) that evolution consists of much stasis punctuated by radical changes. He also rails against the 'ultra-adaptationism' prevalent in things like evolutionary psychology - the view that all (or at least, most) traits should be explained as ones 'selected for' due to their adaptationary benefit. Nonsense, Tattersall retorts. As evolution doesn't work on the reductionistic 'trait' - but rather than holistic individual - level, many of our traits could more easily (and plausibly) be explained as ones that were part of individuals who made it due to OTHER traits - exaptations that simply 'came along for the ride,' only to be utilized later.  <br /> <br />The reason I bring all this up is that these ideas are integral to Tattersall's essays (almost to the point of repitition). From his conjecture that the 'human' brain wasn't a gradual process, but appeared somewhat rapidly (with many of its functions coming to use only later), to his discomfort with evolutionary psychology (no, he does not say that traits have no genetic basis, as one reviewer caricatured. Rather, he suggests that evolutionary psych is oversimplistic and quite untestable), these essays draw on the iconoclastic ideas outlayed in the preceeding paragraph.  <br /> <br />There is one big con and one big pro to this book. The con is that Tattersal is quite repititious in that he brings the same two ideas back as the prime mover of every essay. The pro is that his view of what science is, is profoundly honest. From the first essay (on why science is so important and successful) to the last, he sees science as something that should never be afraid to admit that it doesn't quite know yet, a process that is ongoing in the collection of information and the testing of theses, and something that, to qualify as science, MUST be testable somehow (which is why evolutioanry psych gets Tattersall's criticism).  <br /> <br />All in all, a good book.	2004-11-28
US	37928338	R3RGWTKAXN8ANJ	0393035158	2927274	The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason	Books	3	15	20	N	N	Timely Thesis, Questionable Details!	Do you remember? Shortly after Sept. 11th, a few media pundits and academics began to realize that al Quada - the group that levelled the worst terrorists the world over - were bound together by one thing: a passionate belief that the Koran, interpreted literally, calls for an unqualified Jihad. Remember? Remember the controversey that insued, and how they were curtly told to be more 'sensitive' and 'respectful' to Islam? Truth be told religion has been the primary impetus in such deadly conflicts as Bosnia, Ireland, Israel/Palestine, Kurdistan, Rwanda and others. So why is criticism of religion as impetus to violence not allowed to be aired in our PC culture? Enter Sam Harris.  <br /> <br />Harris's view is that religion should be talked about as an impetus to violence. The difference, he says, between faith (belief in something that can't be demonstrated) and reason (beleif in soemthing where argument or evidence can be adduced) is the difference between stopping the conversation and thriving on conversation. If two groups believe in two different gods and that only their group, rather than the other, is the chosen and important one, what arguments can be ofered? None. As often happens, there is little to do but kill the unredeemable other group. (See any of the countries listed in paragraph one.) When two people disagree on something where evidence or argument is available, though, the tendency is more often to engage in a clash of IDEAS, rather than FORCE. <br /> <br />As if this wasn't controversial enough, Harris tries to explode the myth that religions have become more tolerant and accepting of things like science on their own accord - an internal change. Harris argues persuasively that had science not falsified six-day creationism, had medical advances not shown that illnesses had to do with biology rather than demonic posession, had philosophy not chipped holes in religious theology, (etc.) religion would still be where it was - in the dark ages. Historically, this is hardly an exaggeration. From belief in evolution to accepting new social trends (that later become the norm), religion has an embarrasing history of being the last to drag its feet kicking and screaming towards modernity.  <br /> <br />There are several problems I had with the book though. The first is that Harris leaves us with the firm impression that he thinks non-belief would automatically lead to less violence. What about the French Revolution (where atheism was prevalent) or the Soviet experience (where it was a virtual membership requirement)? Harris's answer is that those are faiths too, and therefore do not damage his thesis. In science, this is called \\"fitting the evidence to the theory,\\" when it should be vice versa. It DOES affect the thesis, by demonstrating that even if belief in god were eradicated, us humans can find plenty to kill over (and the fact that zealotry is easy, even without theology).  <br /> <br />Further, Harris notes that those who say that religion has produced more good in the world than non-belief has, are missing a detail: Of course that is true! Religion has been around infinitely longer than non-belief. If non-belief, he says, had the lengthy history that religion has enjoyed, it is possible that as many good things would have been produced under secularism's watch. But can't this criticism apply also to Harris's assertion that most of the world's wars have happened under religion's watch? Of course they have! Religion has a much longer and larger tradition than secularism. Had secularism the lengthy history of religion, might it have produced as many wars, as well? Harris is completely blind to this huge logical gaff.  <br /> <br />The second quip is that Harris derides 'moderate religions' - those that are not violent, are tolerant with regard to ecumenism, and are quite 'modern.' While I agree (paragraph 2) that this has more to do with secularilty than religion, there is little denying that these religionists - ASA FACT - are not violent. Harris's response: \\"They should be, if only they read their holy book. I have passages to prove it.\\" (Never mind the fact that, for instance, mainline protestants ARE NOT biblical textualists). Harris is creating a \\"damned if they do and if they don't\\" scenario. If a religion is violent, he criticizes it as an example of religion's irrationality. If there is a sect that is not, he suggests that it would be if they took their book literally, and then chastizes them as ignorant. So if it were pointed out to Harris that most western religionists are not - as a fact - violent, he might simply say: \\"They would be if they took religion seriously.\\" Not very convincing.  <br /> <br />Third, Harris quite often refers to our current situation as a war between Islam and the West. He suggests that Islamic fundamentalism will only become deadlier by martialing new technologies, and that the only way we may be able to stop it is to engage in a full-on assault on it. While this may be true (I don't rule it out) it seems dangerously close to the \\"us vs. the irredeemable them\\" that Harris chastises about most religious wars. Is he simply replacing zealotry with zealotry (disguised as a reasoned secularism)? <br /> <br />All in all though, this book is an iconoclastic and engaging read. Whether you agree with it or not (I agree with about 50% of it) it will certainly make you think - in ways that the PC police don't necessarily appreciate!	2004-11-18
US	37928338	RX3345N4DOTCY	1578517095	526432296	Changing Minds: The Art and Science of Changing Our Own and Other People's Minds	Books	3	71	73	N	Y	Interesting, but not terribly revealing!	For well over 10 years, Howard Gardner has been writing books exploring many aspects of the mind - from how the mind creates, to traits leaders have. Following this path, he has now written a book exploring the phenomenon of mind changing. How do we do it? What plays a factor in it? Why is it so dang hard to convincce people to give up well cherished (wrong) beliefs for new (right) ones?<br /><br />The problem is that we get only the vaguest of answers to these questions. As I like to say, the best psychology tells us most of the things we already knew (but may not have known we knew). This book follows suit. It might explain which of the seven \\"factors\\" (listed by the reviewer below) plays a part in different mind changing situations, but hardly eluminates beyond that.<br /><br />For instance, in a chapter devoted to how politicians try and change our minds, we hear about Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan (both iconoclasts who were successful in the end at mind changing). The explanation to their success in mind changin is that they were able to tell their story, their nation's story, and a vision for the country's future, in different conceptual language than their opponents (and convine us that their own story was better. That answer seems quite right, but I was hoping it would be followed by examples of how they did this - how they told stories different from their opponents, while gradually winning acceptance for them. Gardner hardly gives any.<br /><br />Much of the book is like this. After he explains the general principles utilized in one situation, he doesn't bolster it with detail and example, but simply moves on to the next situation.<br /><br />What it all makes for is a somewhat (somewhat!) interesting, but hardly revealing, book.	2004-11-15
US	37928338	R2UN3AVIKKEGS3	1932100318	787027901	Choice: The Best of Reason	Books	3	20	22	N	N	Giving the (Often) Voiceless a Voice!	Being a libertarian, I am often in a position of feeling quite equally distant from both the 'right' and the 'left.' The 'right' seeems to champion free-market principles and less government, but will defend regulation at the drop of a hat when freedom produces results it feels are immoral. By comparison, the 'left' champions such freedoms as that of speech and press and the rights of criminal defendants to due process, but argues for government incursion into most every area of the free market. What is a poor libertarian (believing in all of these freedoms at once) to do? <br /> <br />The answer: we turn to magazines like \\"Reason.\\" This book consists of a good number of articles that Reason has published in recent years in defense of all that is liberty. As with any collection of disperate articles written over a span of many years, some articles are better than others (and, yes, I skipped a few of the worse ones). All in all, though, this book deserves four stars for writing forcefully and soundly on issues that concern the libertarian position (a position sorely lacking from dialogue dominated by the orthodox \\"left\\" and \\"right\\").  <br /> <br />The book starts off with a bang - an article called \\"In Praise of Vulgarity\\" which argues that the role of entertainers pushing the envelope has done more than anything to break the traditionalistic strangle-hold on the culture(s) of the middle east. From there, we move to articles which argue that the commercialization of culture is a good thing, that anti-immigration policies hurt all involved, that the drug war is a cure worse than the disease, etc.  <br /> <br />Perhaps most engaging, though, were the various interviews contained in these pages. Reason has interviewed the likes of John Stossel, Christopher Hitchens, Milton Friedman, Dave Barry, and even a few key characters involved in the war on drugs who now oppose that effort. So engaging were these interviews that I began wishing either that this volume had, or a future one will, focus EXCLUSIVELY on interviews done by the magazine.  <br /> <br />The only other observation I had was that at least to me, that the articles seemed to decline in quality the later their placement in the book. Most of my favorite articles (described tow paragraphs up) appeared within the first 150 pages. The second half of the book contains such duds as an examination of the QWERTY keyboard (and its relation to market principles), a profile of an early 19th century \\"exploitation\\" film to do with sex, and some other seemingly trivial essays. Other than that, the book is still quite solid. <br />	2004-11-07

Within the next four years, at least 3 (if not 4) Supreme Court Justices are expected to retire, leaving vacancies that must be filled. What type of judges should fill those spots is a question of much debate. It was with that question in mind that Pat Robertson wrote this book.  <br /> <br />Now, first let it be said that although I am not a Christian, I am in strong agreement with a good amount of Robertson's observations. The courts have indeed usurped the power of democratic legislatures by striking down statutes (and legislating policy) on flimsy grounds. And, yes, the federal courts have certainly become more liberal in how they interpret the constitution, preferring not to look at what the document SAYS, as much as what these unelected judges think it should MEAN. Robertson speaks eruditely to both points and for that, he earns 2 stars. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I cannot give him 3 more. Having a master's degree in Politcal Science from a top southern institution, I have studied quite a bit to do with law and the judiciary. As such, I found much of Robertson's history either caricaturized or simply wrong, many of his positions unviable if not contradictory, and several of his arguments unpersuasive.  <br /> <br />Let me highlight the history. To Robertson's credit, he goes a long way in showing that many of the founders were Christian (something that is hard to deny). What Robertson does not do, though, is make a case that since they were privately christians, that God is somehow in our constitution. Pat asserts that He is, but anyone reading the constitution's text sees that He is not. There are many other historical gaffs in the book (like citing anti-federalist Patrick Henry as exemplar of the founder's intent, and deist Thomas Jefferson as an example of a good Christian.)  <br /> <br />As far as points being either nebulous or contradictory: Robertson states over and over that he believes the constitution should be interpreted by the founder's originalintent. There are several problems: first, the founders are dead and we can't ask them what they meant. Second, the only record of the constitutional convention we have is by James Madison dictated quickly and from memory. Third, is the intent to be that of the founders or the several hundred people who ratified the constitution into law via the states? I go into this because these are large problems that Robertson simply glosses over.  <br /> <br />Robertson also tells us that we should interpret the constitution, when possible, by discerning its quite clear text. With this point I agree (and I have as much respect for Scalia's textualism as Robertson does). But with that, Robertson is quick to tell us that somehow, the 'free press' clause  doesn't permit things like protection of pornography and that the 'free speech' clause doesn't protect flag burning. To quote Justice Hugo Black (himself a textualist): \\"I always thought that \\"Congress shall make no law,\\" meant \\"Congress shall make no law.\\") Apperently, Robertson doesn't think so, even while he professes that where the text is unambiguous, we should rely solely on it.  <br /> <br />I hate to ramble on with these points, but I do want to make clear how unsatisfactory this book is. If one does want to read a similar position articulated more intelligently, I would suggest that one reads (a) Robert Bork's \\"The Tempting of America,' (b) a new collection of Scalia's opinions called \\"Scalia Dissents,\\" and even a book by legal progressor Robert George called \\"The Clash of Orthodoxies.\\" All make the case more persuasively than Robertson's book.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-03

For the past few years - ever since Sept. 11th - James Carrol has been devoting his Boston Globe column to issues pertaining to international policy and terrorism. This book is a chronicle of those articles that start just after Sept. 11th.  <br /> <br />Carrol most certainly has a left-wing take on the war on terror, the war in Iraq, and the Bush admin.'s conduct in general. I would not though, as a disgruntled reviewr below has, dismiss him as a leftover 'hippie.' He is far from that. His critiques are prescient and his rhetoric effective. While sometimes overly-rhetorical and emotionally charged, Carrol tends to be quite calm and tempered in his critiques.  <br /> <br />His main critiques of the wars on terror and Iraq (and as Carrol seldom tires of asking, \\"I wonder where next?\\") are that (a) rather that going to war in retalliation for Sept. 11th, it would have been more effective and humane, to treat the event as a breach of international law and pursue al Quaeda and the perpetrators as criminals, rather than combatants. (2) What in the hell did Iraq have to do with terrorism as it relates to al Queada and is this a weapon of mass distraction? (3) As international leaders, we should be setting an example to follow. Instead, we have shown the international community that preemptive attacks are acceptable and, by effect, have sent nations like North Korea clamouring to get nuclear weapons so they can do it too.  <br /> <br />There are certainly objections that can be noted to these arguments but all in all, Carrol presents his case well. The only thing I did not like about the book is that being a collection of short essays, it never allowed Carrol to pursue a compelling line of argument for more than three pages at a shot. Other than that, the book is a good one.	2004-10-26

The title of my review refers to the fact that this book, while published in '91, is still quite an accurate portrayal of how the culture wars are conducted. The passing of 13 years and tenure of two presidents has not served to ameliorate the culture war between 'traditionalists' and 'progressives.' Hunter, then, was certainly right.<br /><br />Hunter's main thesis with this book is that, quite frankly, the culture war being fought over our schools, family policy, law, entertainment, etc. is not a war that will likely EVER engender a consensus. In fact, as it stands now, it seems even to proclude rational debate in favor of charged rhetoric, miscaricaturizations of opponents, and...well...mudslinging.<br /><br />Hunter asserts this thesis, backs it up with chronicles of how the culture war has been conducted thus far, and conjectures as to why it is so. First, he says, we are dealing with core philosophic differences over questions to do with 'how the world should be.' Thus, both sides have deep emotions on the said issues. Second, there is no incentive to try and foster consensus because in an adversarial system like ours, the game is about power - the power to get your policy instituted and your other's quashed. Third, each 'side' operates using somewhat incompatible philosophic assumptions. To the anti-abortion-rights activist, it is a child and abortion is murder. To the abortion rights activist, it is only potential life and prohibiting abortion is denying the mother freedom of person. Where one sees freedom (either of the mother or fetus), the other sees either servitude or murder. Incomatibilities like these, says Hunter, will ensure that there will be no satisfactory end to the culture war - just a long, tiring, rhetorically charged, and endless, struggle.<br /><br />Hunter makes his arguments well, is quite convincing, and is as objective as possible. He gives both sides due consideration, never caricaturizing them. While the book focuses on the culture wars from somewhat of a religious perspective (Catholic and Evangelical v. Liberal Protestant and Jew) in the end, the book is about the culture war PERIOD. Highly reccomended reading.	2004-10-26

I memorized the list using flashcards and reviewing them daily. I was pumped.  <br /> <br />Then i took the test and my experieince corroborates the two reviews immediately below: NONE of these words were on the test! When I took the GRE a few years ago (that time for my Masters degree), I used a Kaplan vocabulary book and, as I recall, its word list was more represented on the GRE. In addition, it's layout was a bit better.  <br /> <br />This book is quite simply a list of words and definitions (without pronunciation keys) interspersed with a few quizzes to test you. By contrast, Kaplan's book, while similar, had things like pronunciation keys (it is easier to memorize words you can pronounce), more creative quizzes, and a nicer layout (words went from easier to harder, rather than straight alphabetical.) <br /> <br />All in all, I've been disappointed with Princeton Review more times than once, and I would reccomend vocab and verbal books by Kaplan over PR any day.

So many reviewers seem to have reached the same consensus: this book is one of the worst of the GRE prep's one can buy.  <br /> <br />First, the most glaring shortcoming: the CD-ROM is simply a waste. Besides the practice tests, the ONLY other feature is a lecture (supposedly from an expert) on each of the sections that are each approximately 30 minutes in length. While this might sound decent, the info covered in the lectures is pretty much the same info covered in the book. By contrast, Kaplan's GRE CD-ROM offers practice SECTIONS (so that if you want to get a verbal score, you don't have to take a full practice test, as you do here). Theirs is also chock full of preperational tools (games, and such) that focus on each section. Much more effective than this dud!  <br /> <br />The book itself, while not bad, covers all of the same strategies and methodologies that all the other books do. The math section, as has been said, is full of typos. The verbal section, while decent, simply doesn't illuminate anything that cannot be easily gotten elsewhere, in a better book.  <br /> <br />One last thing: the paper-based practice sections don't seem to simulate the GRE question style very well. For instance, on the verbal, I had been scoring consistently at 700 on these paper-based practice tests. What I got on the GRE verbal, though, was a 530. Yes, I know that computer-based scores come out differently than paper-based ones, but the thing is that the questions offered here are generally not as hard and do not replicate well, the style of the actual questions you will find on the GRE.  <br /> <br />Get the Kaplan or the Princeton Review books. They are much better all the way around.	2004-10-03

Having read E.O. Wilson's book \\"Conscilience,\\" and (seemingly) having the same blanching reaction to it that Gould did, I was hoping from the outset to give five stars to to this book. But alas, by the time I finished reading it, though I agreed with all of its major points, my conscience only let me give the book 3 stars. Here's why.  <br /> <br />First, the book was published with little editing. This, of course, is hardly Gould's fault. While he lived to write the book (and I'm still very glad he did), he passed away before doing much editing. Be that as it may, the book would have seriously benefitted from having someone look it over. In many chapters, Gould meanders, tosses irrelevant asides, and strays regularly from promising lines of thought. That accounts for one star (that I subtract cautiously because, as i say, it is hardly Gould's fault here).  <br /> <br />The other two stars are subtracted because of Gould's strange use of historical anecdotes. Gould, of course, is known for this and many collections of his essays find him historically preoccupied. Be that as it may, the subject of this book seemed more to demand the type of abstract and polemical discussion that Gould avowedly is trying to avoid here. Some of the anecdotes (bringing up Nabokov as a legitimate 'straddler' between science and the humanities) are great as case-bolstering asides, but many simply left me befuddled (a) as to why they were relevant; and (b) why they took up entire chapters.  <br /> <br />The reason I dwell on the superfluity of Gould's anecdotal preoccupation is because the chapters I enjoyed most were the chapters where he hardly used anecdotes at all. One chapter finds Gould offering a mighty persuasive case that the science wars are themselves a 'social construction.' He recounts that not many of his scientist friends are even aware that there ever was such a thing, while none of his humanities friends have ever held (anything close to) the views sardonically attributedto them. No historical anecdotes in this chapter, and the chapter was all the better for it.  <br /> <br />The chapter that really earns its keep, however, is the last one which sees Gould taking E.O. Wilson politely to task for his view that conscilience is tantamount to scientific reductionism - that the science/humanities \\"divide\\" can be ameliorated only by scientifically explaining the humanities. Gould recognizes that Wilson's argument here is nothing but an overly-optimistic and exhorbitantly doubtful pipe-dream. Given such seemingly impenetrable scientific failures as: (a) the inability to explain consciousness in stricly neurological and non-subjective terms, and (b) the naturalistic fallacy, whereby a factual \\"is\\" doesn't per se translate to an ethical \\"ought,\\" Gould concludes that at least on some level, the humanities and the sciences will always occupy seperate places in the human condition.  <br /> <br />While this concluding chapter was only about 35 pages, it seems to contain virtually all of the main points in the book. That made and makes me wonder why, then, we were presented with so many maundering chapters on this and that historical anecdote to get to one chapter that succinctly makes and argues every promised point in the book!  <br /> <br />That is why I gave the book 3, rather than my hoped for 5 stars. Buy the book, especially if you want a useful counterpoint to Wilson's \\"Conscilience.\\" Also check out Mary Midgley's \\"Science and Poetry\\" for many of the same points argued more succinctly.	2004-09-30

About six years ago, I first caught the wine bug. A novice at the time, I recall that perusing wine shops was both a joyful and dreadful experience. Just trying to decipher the information (in foreign languages, most) on one wine-label was daunting enough, let alone trying to pick a good wine from the hundreds lining the aisles. Today, I am fortunate enough to work in a wine shop, and I can easily spot the same dread on my customers faces. Wine is supposed to be fun, right? So why is it so dang complicated?! <br /> <br />What got me safely from the \\"novice\\" to the \\"intermediate\\" stage - and what I tell customers might well do the same for them - is Ed McCarthy and Mary Ewing-Mulligan's book \\"Wine for Dummies.\\" This is the single best beginners guide to wine I've seen on the market, then and now. It strikes a perfect balance between informality and informativity, casualness and usefulness. Delving into everything from how to shop for, open, and taste wines, to explaining the basics of what the different grapes are and which regions excel in each, there is a lot of ground covered in an easy to digest style. (There is even attention paid to that often missed detail of how to pronounce intimidating wine terms like Qualitatswein and - my favorite - Trockenbeerenauslese.) <br /> <br />Thus, six years after I first caught the wine bug, I still find myself skimming these pages for their straight-forward and concise answers to the many questions the world of wine throws at me. Hopefully, it will do for you what it did for me: take an utter novice and turn him into an unbridled wine enthusiast without causing too much of a mental headache along the way (as some books do). This is why I reccomend the book to my customers and why I unhesitatingly reccomend it to you! <br /> <br />	2004-09-30

As one who is intersted in political philosophy and ethics, it has always befuddled me why there is such a death of popular books looking at politics from a moral point of view. With this book, though, ethicist Peter Singer has shown the necessity of examining politics through such a lens - especially the politics of a president who invokes moral justifications as much as George W. Bush does.  <br /> <br />Singer offers us a cogent and meticulous examination of Bush's ethical stances on domestic economic policy, social policy, and foreign policy. Singer's particular focus is on demonstrating not only (a) inconsistencies in Bush's ethics and (b)highlighting discrepancies between what Bush says and what he does.  <br /> <br />As an example of (a), Singer points out that while Bush justifies his opposition to stem-cell research by asserting, in natural rights language, that we must be a culture that values the importance of all human life, he simultaneously shows no hesitancy to use utilitarian logic when it comes to warring with Iraq (the unavoidable killing of innocents might be outweighed by the benefit of liberating Iraq and - supposedly - making American lives safer.) An example of (b) might be that during his campaign for president, Bush exalted states rights rhetoric, but when he came to office, Bush showed no hesitancy to trump states rights by proposing and supporting a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage (marriage having always been the domain of the states.) In 200+ pages of deft analysis, Singer offers many examples of both types of inconsistency and offers many good arguments for both.  <br /> <br />The only problems I had with the book are these: first, Singer is so convinced of his own ethical stances that he finds little need to argue for those views so much as argue against the president's. A prime example is when Singer takes issue with Bush's assertions that America is an amazingly free society by suggesting that since we don't spend more onprograms to help the poor, that we really aren't that free at all. With little argument to show why more income redistribution necessarily equals more freedom, I am left to think that libertarians and conservatives (who do not take this as given) will hardly be convinced by this. In other words, it is chapters like these, where Singer takes his own ethical stances for granted, that he will achieve nothing more than preaching to the already converted.  <br /> <br />Another problem I had is that while Singer does a good job highlighting how Bush's presidential record differs much from his campaign rhetoric, he seems unaware of two possible explanations: If Bush's campaign rhetoric differs from his in-office action, it might be that like many presidents in history, Bush may have found that the realities and exigencies of office rendered his pre-office ideas either unachievable or in need of modification so as to garner congressional support.) If, as Singer suggests, the fact that Bush's campaign rhetoric fails to match his presidential dealings makes him immoral, then i can think of exactly no president that would be deemed moral by this criterion (Reagan? Bush Sr? Clinton?) <br /> <br />All in all, though, this is a solid and well-reasoned book that, contra diatribes by other anti-Bush authors, never degenerates to charged emotionalisms or slams. It is calm, rational, and meticulous. Well worth reading, whatever your position.	2004-09-25

And in that, this book simply gives the data to suppport what most of us already know from experience and observation. Americans (as a whole) tend not to practice much restraint when it comes to buying. We save less than we should, buy more than we should, and go into debt sooner than we should. Via surveys, analysis of consumer habits, and observation of America at work, Juliet Schorr demonstrates how and conjectures as to why all of this occurs.  <br /> <br />She offers good data as to the 'how' part, but I'm not sure i liked her conclusions on the 'why.' She makes much of the magnetizing effect of advertising. While I don't doubt that this is a big factor, it seems overly simplistic. After all, if advertisements do not appeal to something consumers REALLY DO want, they wouldn't buy. (There are many companies who advertise and don't get buyers because their products were contra what consumers at large wanted to spend money on!)  <br /> <br />She also explains that 'keeping up with the Jones's' is a more-and-more prevalent phenomenon. But she inexplicably tells us that this phenomenon doesn't apply much to the poor and lower class. She never (a) gives us evidence of this; or (b) explains why in the world the poor would be somewhat immune from a phenomenon that the middle class is apperently so susceptable to.  <br /> <br />Of course, instead of simply writing a diatribe against corporatism and crass consumerism, Mrs. Schorr offers usable tips on how to individually restrain ourselves so that we, too, don't become overspent Americans. While other reviewers have suggested that many of the tips are not practical or usable (and some are a bit strange), quite a few of them (for instance, simply being cognizant of of exuberant consumer desire) are immenseley practiceable. Similarly, the chapter profiling downshifters was helpful in the sense that we can see how they make more out of less.  <br /> <br />Allof this is to say that while Schorr has written a good and prescient book, it seems incomplete at best and is, in my estimation, worth 3 stars.	2004-09-15

John Stossel does the kinds of things a journalist could get fired for (and that's why I love him so). His TV specials like \\"Greed\\" and \\"Sex, Drugs, and Consenting Adults\\" question sacred media cows, like the dogma that the environment is really in shambles, that capitalism is bad and government regulation is good, or that the drug war is worth fighting. He finds that all of these dogmas are flat out wrong and offers many good arguments to demonstrate it - all on national TV! That's the type of stuff a journalist could get fired for! Instead, Stossell's TV specials and segments are unexpectedly popular.  <br /> <br />The same iconoclastic attitude, tenacity, and wit that has made his TV specials so successful, makes \\"Give Me a Break\\" a page-turner and bestseller. In fact, much of what is in this book is simply an expansion on his television specials. Offering us scores of examples from his vast experience as a journalist, he shows us: why government regulation seems only to benefit the regulators (who are not elected or accountable to anyone); why markets seem always to do just about everything better than government (FedEx or Post Office? NBC or PBS? Public or private school?); how crimes against personal vices are morally wrong and ineffective (Is it really better to force drugs into the hands of street gangs rather than a regulated market?).  <br /> <br />One of the most interesting and enraging parts of the book was the recount of his career trajectory. When he was younger, he was known as a fearless consumer reporter, catching and exposing the rip-off artists and \\"greedy capitalists.\\" For this he won scores of emmys, universal praise from peers, and the respect of the journalistic community. Soon, he started to realize that the government scams us infinitely more than the capitalists (and that the latter are more often than not benevolent). But when he started applying the SAME techniques that had won him fame before, to expose governmental, rather than 'evil corporate' hucksters, he was universally panned by the journalistic community.  <br /> <br />Why was he praised when he exposed business scammery but pranned when he exposed the government's just-as-sly antics? Because he was on the 'wrong' side of course! As Stossell recounts well in this book, network media bias dictates that business is always supposed to be the bad guy and government (in its regulatory form) is to be the good guy. (When was the last time you watched a Dateline NBC or 20/20 feature story that pushed for deregulation or praised a corporation working without government assistance?). In the vein of Bernard Goldberg, Stossel takes you inside the newsroom and eptly demonstrates how the media has sacred cows of its own and how one can fall out of favor quickly when one dares to challenge them.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is a fun, engrossing, and quite eye-opening. Exploring everything from the drug war to war on poverty, from free speech rights to self-ownership rights, Stossel shows us why government is largely inneffective, why the market tends to fare better, and why the media doesn't want you to know any of this.  <br /> <br />Think the media (whether it be MotherJones magazine or FoxNews) is giving you the truth of things? Give me a break!	2004-09-10

It has become fashionable as of late to argue for cultural stasis. The green left, for instance, argues that nature is best and any 'progres' away from the natural should be silenced. Similarly, the conservative right warns that culture and social structure should remain in the '50's and that the new 'consumerism' is threatening cultural 'stability.' Both groups, and others like them, have their own vision of the 'best way' for society to be. To varying degrees, these groups want to save the people from the 'wrong' future by technocratic planning and regulation that allows for the 'right' future - their future. <br /> <br />Virginia Postrel opposes ideas of a planned future based on any model of the 'one best way.' She argues in this book that the best way for the future to happen is sponteneously. Instead of regulating industries, mores, and ideas, we should let people and companies be as free as possible to experiment with new ideas and innnovations, and through trial and error, let THEM decide what they like and do not. A future planned in advance through regulation and government controls leads to stagnation and fewer options. An open future leads to vibrancy, ingenuity, and increased options.  <br /> <br />These ideas, of course, are not new. Those familiiar with economists like Hayek, Sowell, and Friedman will recongize them instantly. These and other economists argued (iconoclastically) that planned societies (or planned markets) not only ciphen off people's inborn urge to try new things and experiment, but lead to social and economic stand-stills.  <br /> <br />Postrel's book alternates well between theory and practice. She offers scores of examples illustrating why regulations on markets tends to stifle valuable innovation, and why deregulation tends to lead to better and better technologies (while allowing consumers to sort the good from the bad instead of being dictated to from on high). From the ingenuity made possible by deregulation of airlines, to theremarkable progress (and sponteneous order) that the internet (unhampered by regulation) has offered, Postrel brings theory home by illustrating its practical effects.  <br /> <br />My favorite chapter is \\"Creating Nature,\\" focused particularly on the biotech industry and \\"its enemies.\\" It is also the chapter most relevant to me. While writing a grad paper on biotech, I read many of the works noted (and deftly criticized) by Postrel - by the likes of Leon Kass, Bill McKibben, and Jeremy Rifkin. These rather anti-technology luddites sincerely argue that the days before technology were better and that if we were as smart as they, we would realize it too. As Postrel notes, they are unashamedly snobbish, often deriding the general public for valuing the better life afforded by technology and the bugbear of 'consumerism.' Postrel eloquently explores all of this, highlighting the problems endemic to such thought.  <br /> <br />The only two criticisms I can offer of the book are these: First, Postrel seems so intent on grilling the luddites that she might err in the opposite direction and exhibit TOO MUCH faith in change for change's sake (she uses the phrase \\"faith in progres\\" quite a bit). Unfortunately, this makes her come off as having the same level of unquestioning zeal that she spots in her opposition. Second, the book is unabashedly libertarian. While this is not a problem for me (I am one too) she never quite comes clean about it. This may strike some readers as a tad covert.  <br /> <br />All in all though, this is an excellent read. The chapters are organized so as to minimize repitition, the research is varied and well done, and her arguments are extremely tight. For those not afraid of progress, or those curious about those that are, this is a must read.	2004-08-28
US	37928338	R19GARLPEUG1LF	1586482173	285320028	The Bubble Of American Supremacy: Correcting The Misuse Of American Power	Books	2	19	22	N	N	I didn't want to, but...	It is a shame that I can give this book no better than 2 stars. For starters, I agree ideologically with much of Soros's case. I am utterly convinced that the war in Iraq did nothing for us (and much against us). I am also disheartened because what should have been a feasible war on terror has consisted in nothing but us knocking out countries we don't like with a coalition growing more brittle by the day. What makes my low rating more of a shame is that Soros and I share a common philosophical hero in Sir Karl Popper and are both committed to the idea of the open society.     But, alas; for all that, I must rate the book only two stars. Why? It is simple. While the first half of the book (Soros' critiques of Bush's international methods) is astute and well thought out, it is poorly backed up, quite over-simplistic, and its arguments are readily available in many other books of better quality. Soros is not even close to the only guy who has criticized the go-it-alone \\"Bush Doctrine.\\" Read Etzionni's \\"From Empire to Community\\" for a much more researched, professional, and less rhetorical critique (and there are scores of other books you've doubtless heard of). What's more, while the section makes good theoretical arguments, the research is shoddy and most consists of personal anecdotes or references to New York Times articles. Not too impressive.     The second section (where Soros was supposed to propose his vision of the solution) was maundering, much less than clear, and episodic. One chapter suggests that instead of relying on the UN, we might rely on what is called the \\"community of democracies\\" but fails to make clear how this group won't suffer from the same self-interested in-fighting and utter imptence to enforce decrees as the UN. He also talks about how the US should use its superpower status to work for the 'good of the community' rather than simply national interest. Yet he doesn't explain in the slightest how we could get a gauge on this (as if the 'community' is a monolith as opposed to an aggrgate of diverse nations!) or any of the other innumerable difficulties posed by such a nebulous concept. To make matters worse, there is even a chapter in section 2 where he talks about little more than whether the cold war was fought over capitalism or 'the open society.' What relevance did this have? I thought section 2 was about Soros's ideas on a solution?!    If I were you, I would read one of the other books arguing against current foreign policy, and hightest on my list is Etzionni's \\"From Empire to Community.\\" It contains similar arguments (both positive and negative) as this one, but is much more thougyhtfully researched, less vague, and in the end, probably a better buy.	2004-08-26

It is quite difficult to me to feel anything but a benign \\"that's interesting\\" type of indifference to this book. On some things, Fukuyama does rather well. On others, I could not resist the urge to rhetorically ask myself: \\"Did he really get this published?\\"  <br /> <br />First, the good stuff. As others have noted, Fukuyama provides decent factual documentation and analysis to support part 1 of his argument - that the social bonds common to the days of yore have dissipated through time (aside from a few contradictions that I'll get to later). He also provides a quite lively, if a tad oversimplified and/or overeager, section on the life sciences' recent findings that we are social creatures after all.  <br /> <br />So that accounts for the two extant stars. What accounts for the three I decided to withhold? First, and most devestatingly, Fukuyama never makes it clear how this dissipation of 'social capital' can be attributed to the 'information revolution' - the transition from an industrial-based to information-based economy or culture. It seems his only strategy is to rule out, curtly and unconvincingly, other variables only to tell us: \\"Well it couldn't be those, and since the timing is right, so it must be the information revolution.\\" I don't buy it (yet), and don't see how Fukuyama expects me to.  <br /> <br />Second, there are an embarassing number of out-and-out contradictions in this book. First, there is the biggie: Fukuyama spends a lot of time telling us that via human nature, the rebuilding of social bonds is endemic and inevitable to humankind. Then, in the next section, he tells us that we must work dilligently to bring about what he just told us was endemic and inevitable. (This is reminiscent of Marx telling us that the revolution was inevitable and that therefore, the workers must be dillegent in ensuring that it comes about).  <br /> <br />There are other contradictions: Fukuyama tells us in the book that crime is and has been on the rise for sometime. A bit later, though, he tells us that the vast majority of American neighborhoods are safe and that it is only people's perception of rising crime via the media tht seems to be the problem. He also tells us that marriages dissolving in their first few years is a new frightening trend, while later in the book teling us that it is \\"not uncommon\\" for marriages to dissipate only after the kids are raised. I just don't understand!  <br /> <br />Anyhow, I could go on, but I'd rather get to my main point: although this book may have a few eye opening moments (generally those moments where Fukuyama is reinforcing things we already know), all in all, it is not worth your time. If you want to explore the weakening of the 'social fabric' try Etzionni's \\"The Spirit of Community\\" or Callahan's \\"The Cheating Culture.\\" If you are interested in the life sciences' research on the sociality of humans, try Ridley's \\"The Origin of Virtue,\\" or Axelrod's 'Evolution of Cooperation.' Both do a better job than this book.	2004-08-24

They say that the key element in engrossing drama is a main character with a tragic flaw. Chet Baker, it seems, had that - his inability (or lack of motivation) to care about anything (including consequences). At least, that seems to be Mr. Gavin's take in this gripping and unfinching tale of jazz trumpeter turned ravenous junkie, Chet Baker. From his early days that saw an overly doting mother to the many loves in Baker's life that played more the role of a mom than a lover, Chet Baker is portrayed (probably correctly) as a wrecklessly detached, yet childlike, soul all too content to drift through life letting others clean up increasingly heinous messes.  <br /> <br />As other reviewers have noted, this book is not a pretty read. For me, I recall many evenings where I couldn't pry myself away from these pages, yet hardly \\"wanted\\" to continue reading. (The former emotion always won out!) We see a junkie, an egocentrist, a master trumpeter, an inveterate manipulator, and - somehow - even a childlike innocent who we never cease, in some way, to feel at least some compassion for (and in some sense, that was part of Baker's ease of manipulation). And Mr. Gavin's well-written biography gives us a front row seat to it all! <br /> <br />Now, I've never been one to assume that in order to 'understand' a musician, one does best to know their history. But it is hard for me to imagine that I will ever be able to listen to one of Baker's glossy ballads in exactly the same way again, now knowing about the torturous life that his notes belie. And if you are a Baker fan (I have to imagine that if you are here, you are) no doubt the book will do the same to you.  <br /> <br />To close, I must reiterate that this is a wildly engrossing book that reads as much like fiction as a biography can. Baker's life, of course, is as intriguing and multidiminsional as any novelist could write. James Gavin obviously did his homework (as at very least evidenced by the huge list of sources and notes). Though certainly not for the faint of heart, Gavin's book should be a valuable addition to any fan's library.	2004-08-22

Bertrand Russell's \\"History of Western Philosophy,\\" quite simply, is the best all-around history I've seen. Will Durant's is accessible but more informative about its subjects lives than their thoughts. Copleston's history is much more informative but much too long (11 vol.) for any but the most serious student. Antony Flew's, for all of its strenghts, presumes much more technical knowlege than the average lay reader will have. Russell's book, then, seems the best all around intro - it is long enough but not too long, detailed enough but not overly technical, and interesting enough while remaining all the while informative. And unlike all of the others, Russell writes with the impeccable clarity we expect from him, and admirable enthusiasm.  <br /> <br />Russell's layout is thus: he sets the stage for each section (ancient, scholastic, enlightenment, romantic, modern) by giving a brief historical chapter. Once done, he sets to work on a 10-20 page walk through of each prominent philosopher therein. While he is quite objective throughout (with the occasional biting remark for humor), he generally finishes each 'walk through' with a critique from his perspective of the philosopher in question. These are useful for both the lay person (who has fodder for thought) and the more experienced reader (who gets both the philosopher's and Russell's view).  <br /> <br />Before I finish my review of this remarkably clear and interesting book, I must present a quote from the book that I feel is endemic of Russell and how he approaches all the multifarious philosophers that fill these pages. The quote intros his section on Greek philosopher Heraclitus: <br /> <br />\\"In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first, a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to bleieve in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude... Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intellegence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on any subject whatever.\\" (Chapter IV, paragraph 4) <br /> <br />Yes, Russell has biases (as has been duly noted in these reviews); yes, he makes occasional biting comments and undoubtedly betrays misunderstandings (though none, I think, deliberate). All the while though, it is obvious that in these pages, Russell presents his subject as honestly, excitedly, and (yes!) fairly as he can. Even when he does express his opinion, it seems obvious to me that he lets you know when he is doing so, and never proposes (as do many philosophers) to have the last word on the subject or to make the readers' minds up for them.  <br /> <br />Excellent book.	2004-08-17

As one who has always been passionate about early American history, I must confess that untill reading Dr. Wood's fine character study, I have not read any books devoted to Benjamin Franklin. Like many others, then, I came to this book imbued by the vision of Franklin that sees him first and foremost as the self-made business person that authored \\"Poor Richard's Almanac,\\" and the \\"Autobiography.\\" My vision of Franklin was of the champion of pulling onesself up by one's bootstraps, temperance, and frugality.  <br /> <br />Dr. Wood's intention with this book is not so much to dispel this vision - Franklin was indeed those things - as to augment it by filling in those lesser known bits of Franklin's life. While he was the self-made business man and champion of industry, he was also a man who, from there, forayed into the life of a gentleman of leisure and loved every minute of it. While he was a passionate American revolutionary, he was, before all that, a man who passionately believed in the British Empire and worked tirelessly to reconcile American and British inerests. While he was a man who was eventually loved by posterity as a true and exemplary American, he was, during his lifetime, just as often mistrusted and even scorned by fellow Americans.  <br /> <br />Dr. Wood, then, has written not so much a biography as a character study that works to explain (a) how Benjamin Franklin morphed into all of these multifarious roles, (b) how, remarkably, he was successful at all of them (well, all but one; you'll see!), and (c) how it wasn't untill after his death that Franklin's early life as a business-person was focused on almost to exclusion of all else, in essence, transforming his image to that of the quintessential American.  <br /> <br />Dr. Wood, in all of this, has created a thrilling and very educational book that 'gets into Franklin's head' as well as I imagine any book could. Throught it all, Dr. Wood remains somewhat neutral and defferential as to the character of Franklin, neither denouncing or overly praising him. Rather, he gives us the facts, tells the story, uses enough enthusiasm and warmth to convey the excitement that was Franklin's life, but never resorts to too much by way of polemic. Those expecting either a laudatory cheerleading or a denunciatory expose of Franklin will not find what they are looking for here. Those who simply want a good, robust and erudite, character studty will.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-12

Putting pen to paper with the same poigniant gusto of a great composer interweaving libretto to music, Mr. McWhorter hath produced such an entertaining writing on writing that little escapes his astute gaze and even less escapes the oppertunity to pique our interest and satisfaction.  <br /> <br />Okay, enough with the joke. We do not write like that anymore and this book (notice I just said 'book' rather than 'entertaining writing on writing') tries to explain why that might be - why we've become so much more accustomed to and expectant of an informal style in our writing as the years have gone by.  <br /> <br />McWhorter's answer, at the risk of sounding cliche, is that we Americans are not in love with our language anymore and that the sixties are partly the pivot point. The anti-establishment, anti-conformity, and anti-tradition notions of the sixties, he writes, made it beneficial NOT to use the highfalutin (some called it artful) languatge of yesteryear, as it connoted tradition, the establishment, and authority.  <br /> <br />For those expecting a piss-fest by McWhorter on this point, you are half wrong and half right by that expectation. While he never out-and-out bemoans the happening (and gladly admits that he is imbued with the sixties informalism as much as anyone else), McWhorter will (possibly inadvertently?!) come off as a bit preachy in this book. He goes through chapter after chapter citing what he exalts as florid and artful prose, only to remind us that we'd never even dream of talking like that today.  <br /> <br />In fact, this is where my strongest criticism comes. The book is TOO repetitive in that sense. While citing examples is obviously needed to prove his case (and he does a good job of it) it starts to make the book terribly repetitive after the third chapter. Every chapter save the first, in fact, follows this format: take a slew of examples of what writing (music, oratory, or prose) was like in the past, quote some examples from today,and say, \\"See, we don't do it like we used to and wouldn't dream of it in this day and age.\\" While I understand why McWhorter does this ad nauseum, when done in such high doses, it tends to make one want to skip chapters as I started feeling I could guess them word for word without reading them.  <br /> <br />Now I return to a previous point: McWhorter doesn't do a whole lot of side-taking in this book. In a sense, actually, he oscillates. While he occasionally makes explicit the benefits of informalization of language and reminds us that he has been affected by it as much as anyone else, he also seems, with this book, to be bemoaning the fact that the love for colorful and poetic language of the past is gone today. While it is noble to try and remain this agnostic (or at least, ambivalent) it also becomes a detriment as the reader (at least this reader) thought it made his point less clear than it might have been. Was McWhorter taking a stand on this issue? Was he opining for days of old, or neutrally demonstrating a trend? He seemed to oscillate between them, fully comfortable with neither. While in a sense that is good, in antother sense, it gave his book a lack of direction as we don't know, and never find out, which direction he is trying to go with us. <br /> <br />Thus, the reader that holds this book in their eager hands, holds a book that will exhibit tendencies to simultaneously frustrate and fulminate, to unsettle and entertain, to amuse and bemuse, at the self-same instant, that the reader will find herself....oh, screw it. Just buy the book and see for yourself!	2004-08-10

William James' 'Meaning of Truth' is a book consisting of 15 articles defending his pragmatic definition of truth against defenders both empiricist and idealist. Most essays had been previously published in philosophy journals and a few were printed in this volume for the first time.<br /><br /> To explain the backdrop briefly, William James, in his book 'Pragmatism,' had devoted a chapter to what is meant when we call something true. James told us that by calling something true, we are suggesting that the thing work in experience, and that the true is what works in experience. Further, James wrote that truth doesn't exist 'out there' in the world of objects without a knower, but exists ONLY in ideas ABOUT those objects. This, of course, is contra the longstanding philosophic view that the truth exists 'out there' in the objects (and would exist thus even if there were no knower to confirm them). Also, the longstanding view James writes against, has it that the true is the true regardless of whether it works in experience. Working in experience does not a true belief make.<br /><br /> All this is necessary to say because one can easily see how uphill James' battle was. Did he succeed? Well, as much as I liked this book (and am wild about James' writing style and wit), I gave the bookk three stars because the book did not fulfill its mission either historically or ideationally.<br /><br /> Why? Probably for the same reason this book did not meet its ideational goals. James aimed to convince the reader that his theory of truth was not only consistent, but a corect account. Now, while James' theory should not be ignored and he DID show that many of the criticisms (like the thought that pragmatism leads to anti-realism or solopsism) are hooey, inconsistencies can easily be spotted in this book, and what's more, he still doesn't see those areas where his theories DO break down.<br /><br /> I'll give just one example of each: As for incongruency, James repeats several times that his theory is unique because it starts and ends with experience. By his account, &quot;expeirence as a whole is self containing and leans on nothing.&quot; But he also says, equally as fervently, that the &quot;notion of a reality INDEPENDENT OF [experience] LIES AT THE BASE OF a pragmatist definition of truth.&quot; [217-8, my caps] On the one hand, then, James exalts the fact that his theory need rely on nothing outside of experience, and on the other, he states that it is dependent on the existence and postulation of an independent reality.<br /><br /> As far as those areas where James' theory breaks down: James makes explicit the fact that what we mean by truth is 'that which works in experience,' and by converse, that which works in experience may be called true. Of course, there is a problem. In politics, say, I might find that one way of redistributing income works better in experience than another, and even works well in experience for all the things I want it to do. But does it not sound a bit akward to conclude therefore, that &quot;the policy is the true one becuase it works best in experience,&quot; (rather than simply saying that the policy 'works better,' than the other? Without going into undue explanation, James might give an account of a NECESSARY condition for truth (To be true, an idea has to work in experience.) rather than a sufficient condition (Any idea that works in experience is true.).<br /><br /> I dislike being so long-winded and apologize for it, but it needs to be emphasized that while this book is a phenomenal read and explicates a theory that should not be ignored or blithely dismissed (James gets as much right as he does wrong), the careful reader is bound to come away from the book being less than satisfied.eats several times that his theory is unique because it starts and ends with experience.

US	37928338	R184KNT5NWUTJD	0385470452	763751136	A History of Philosophy, Vol. 8: Modern Philosophy - Empiricism, Idealism, and Pragmatism in Britain and America	Books	5	16	16	N	N	From Empirical Science to Idealism and Back Again!	Anyone that wants to study an informative yet well-written history of philososphy must thank Frederick Copleston. Of course, most histories are one-volume and while fun, hardly in-depth, this history is a whopping 9 volumes and consists of extremely detailed and thoughtful chapters on each major (and many minor) thinker(s). Remarkably enough, though, Copleston is eminently readable and is devoid of the technical jargon that would have seemed indespensible to a lesser writer. Always lucid, exciting, and exactingly informative, this set and book herein is highly recommended for the serious philophy student and the curious lay-person (who has time on their hands).  <br />  <br /> This particular penultimate volume focuses on the rise of scientific empiricism in the Darwinian age, the corresponding reaction of philosophic idealism, the pragmatism of America that tried to found something of a middle ground between extremes, and the &quot;full circle&quot; swing back into logicl positivism and scientism.  <br />  <br /> Coploeston does a good job profiling the thinkers here. In particular, I know little about idealism so it was exciting to see so many good chapters On Bosquiet, Bradley, Royce, and others. The chapters (while I still can't pretend to understand idealism) were quite lucid (at least now I'll be able to fake my way through it). Most exciting though were the chapters on J.S. Mill, the chapter on the scientific thinkers from Darwin to Huxley, the chapters on pragmatists James, Peirce, and Dewey, and the chapter on the return to empiricism with G.E. Moore. Bertrand Russell is also covered at length. <br />  <br /> Throughout it all, Copleston is mindful to keep the reader aware of the over-arching story - each thinker he broaches is brought up in a regard as a response to, or elaboration on, another thinker. The scientific empiricists came up and successfully reformulated philosophy into a materialism of sorts replete with hedonism and naturalism in ethics. Theidealists came up as a reaction to that, downplaying physicalism and paying more heed to the human's spiritual craving. And justas the idealists had reacted to scientific empiricism, logical positivism reacted to idealism bringing the pendullum back to its original position after swinging too far one way and then to the other.  <br />  <br /> All in all, this was a highly informative book and will be of interest to students with a hankering for the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in British and American though. The volume after this one - the last of the set - focuses on the same time period, but more intently on French (and I believe, German) thought. Enjoy.	2004-07-24

Nicholas Rescher has a history of writing great books outlaying and defending the methodology of pragmatism. This book, one in a long series of books for him, explores the pragmatic method and how it might be used to &quot;bust through&quot; some of the problems the field of epistemology regularly faces.  <br />  <br /> Rescher's first concern is to take on the skepticism about knowledge that seems to have come in vogue a time ago. The problem, it seems, is that the realization that certainty is unnatainable has caused many to become skeptics (*If we can't have certain knowledge, we can't know anything at all.*). Rescher suggests (and argues convincingly for) the view that while certainty is a chimera, there is no reason we cannot rely on scientific knowlege the same way we always have (even if it IS conjectural). Why? Because the methods of science have been qite shown to work IN PRACTICE. Yes, history might show some of its products wrong, but for practical purposes, the benefits of a method that gets along quite well in practice outweighs the risk of sometimes getting it wrong. Pragmatically, then, we use science because it is THE BEST WE HAVE.  <br />  <br /> In a similar way, Rescher writes chapters refuting skepticism, showing that the use of both categories and systemitization has less to do with reflecting the *one true reality that is* and more to do with pragmatic considerations like elegance of theory and communication efficacy, and on how the seeming circularity of reason's usage being only justifiable by reason itself, isn't much of a problem to the pragmatist.  <br />  <br /> The only downside to this book is that, as happens with Rescher - a guy who's written over 90 books - some of these chapters borrow strongly from his other books. The chapter on the circularity of reason's justification, for instance, is very familiar from his book on &quot;Objectivity.&quot; Also, the chapter on epistemic justification on reason and the scientific process was strongly borrowing from the book &quot;Methodological Pragmatism.&quot; I didn't subtract a star, though, because for those who've not read much Rescher before, it won't be that big a deal and it subtracts nothing from the books power.	2004-07-24

These are the types of questions John McWhorter sets out to answer. In the process, he will piss off school teachers, grammarians of the rigid sort, those who exalt the Classics solely for their now-essoteric and lofty language, and a slew of others. (Read some of the below reviews for proof).  <br />  <br /> His basic idea is that there is no such thing as a pure stamdard english and his arguments (as witnessed in the first, and most theoretic, chapter) are quite convincing, though I can't pretend I didn't agree with him going in. Language, instead of being a fixed system with immutable rules, is a pragmatic tool for communication that, like any pragmatic tool, is mutable to the *felt necessities of the times* (O.W. Holmes's phrase).  <br />  <br /> McWhorter dishes out example after example - English to Spanish to the creole languages of Africa - to show that language is not only always in flux, but many of the changes that would be called *degenerations* now will actually turn out to be... well... improvements. He gives rigorous exampes to show that some of the rules leading to more akward speech, like the rule againts split infinitives or that of never ending sentences with prepositions, were based on arbitrary attempts to cram latin rules onto english and that, particularly in spoken language, have proved to be somewhat futile.  <br />  <br /> All of this leads to some provocative essays on the practical usage of language. The most provocative of these essays might be the one in which McWhorter makes a strong and reasoned plea to start transforming Shakespeare into more modern prose. It is not only that we don't talk in Shakespearean lingo anymore, but that many of Shakespeare's word-choices, allusions, and phrasings are so far beyond the way we speak, that only the most educated of language-lovers could pick up on their *original meanings.* (Admit it; even though we love Shakespeare, we enjoy him more as an obscure intellectual exercise, rather than as the entertaining writer he deserves to be.) <br />  <br /> Other essays have a more practical application, like the discussion of *he* as a personal pronoun of *neutral* sex. Mcwhorter writes that while this won't do, all the other proposals - *she,* *s/he* and *he or she* - are not adequate replacements for various reasons. But what about *they?* We all seem to use it in speech: *Tell the student that they may pick up their test.* And it sounds right, so far as today's speech goes. But the grammar police are once again at it and insist that we can't use *they* because it connotes a plural, rather than singular, entity. The argument for why this is wrong is too long to get into and McWhorter does a good job with it. Needless to say, McWhorter is againt the grammerians.  <br />  <br /> The only essays I had a bit of a hard time with are the ones on ebonics. To be expected, McWhorter certainy argues well that ebonics is not simply lazy speech or slang, but is as legitimate a dialect as those of the deep south (where *you want to* might be pronounced *yaunt to.*) The problem I had though is that while he gives a good discourse on the *proper rules* that can be discerned in black english, he sems to contradict himself. By showing us the *proper rules* to be found in ebonics, showing that as a dialect it is quite legitimate, he has trouble convincing us that this does not contradict his initial thesis that there are no PURE standard rules of languages or dialects, but rather that they are always in flux. As the reader will note, he tries to reconcile thse two theses but in the end, hardly resolves them.  <br />  <br /> Nevertheless, this book is a great antidote to the overly-strict formalism of grammarians. For the record, he is not a nihilist that blithely suggests an 'anything goes' approach. While necessary for pragmatic purpses of communicatin, rules, McWhorter argues, are not things that (a) cannot be broken and (b) cannot change over time for the better. Rules always have changed and preumably always will, whether grammarians like it or not.  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />	2004-07-24

Talisse and Hester have here written a very good introduction to a very worthy thinker - American philosopher William James. These two writers, of course, had their work cut out for them. James, after all, wrote what would be known as 'classics' in no less than three fields: psychology [Principles of Psychology], religious anthropology [Varieties of Religious Experience] and, of course, philosophy [Pragmatism]. <br />Considering that anyone writing a 90 page book on such a prolific thinker has a lot to deal with, our authors' focus almost exclusively on James' philosophical, rather than psychological, essays. And they succeed beautifully in breaking James's amazingly pluralistic and robust philosophy in to bite-size chunks that, while easy to chew for the layperson, also retain much of the 'flavor' of James. <br />The sections are as follows: <br />(1) The first chapter (as is the standard in the Wadsworth series) is devoted to biography of James, focusing on how his life layed the groundwork for his philosophy. <br />(2) Next, we are treated to a chapter on James's metaphysics of radical empiricism (decidedly the most difficult of James's ideas to get ones head around, but explained well here). <br />(3) The next chapter is a nice explanation of James's theory of truth and belief - James's pragmatism. This was easily the most contreversial of James's ideas and the two authors devote time to handling some of the numerous objections/misunderstandings of James's belief-based pragmatism; <br />(4) The next chapter is, to me, the most exciting; it is to do with James's moral philosophy, wherein he gives up on the idea that one moral theory can do the job. James was a pluralist who saw social life as a struggle between multiple conceptions of the good and the good life. As moral philosophy is a focus of mine (and James a favorite of mine) I can attest that the two authors explain this section very well indeed. <br />(5) Finally, we are treated to a discourse on James's defense of the individual's right to believe in a higher power. Throughout James's career he offered a thorough-going defense of theism by pragmatic justification, and an argument that while skepticism can be a virtue, so can belief in the as-yet-unproved. <br />As I said, the professors manage to take William James - a complex thinker due to his unceasing pluralism and fear of philosophic thinness - and given us a nice step-by-step 90 pager sure to wet anyones appetite for more. After this book, I would reccomend Jacques Barzun's &quot;Stroll With William James,&quot; and even Lousis Menand's &quot;Metaphysical Club.&quot;	2004-07-12

I am one who has always been critical of our reasons for going into Iraq and, further, how we've conducted the Iraq 'war.' But I am equally uncomfortable when around my anti-war friends who, to me, always seem to oversimplify the issue by suggesting absuridities like (a) we should have given Iraq more time (as the UN has for 10 years, to no appreciable avail); (b) Saddam Hussein posed little threat to the international community (ignoring that even Clinton knew this wasn't true); or worst of all (c) that the war in Iraq will encourage Islamic anti-americanism even more (as if this wouldn't have happened anyway). <br />So as an opposer of the Iraq war, I appreciate reading books like Hitchens' that at very least gives some meaty considerations of the 'pro-Iraq-war' type. I agree with other reviewers that as the book is a short collection of short essays, Hitchens does more by way of rhetoric than analysis. I also agree that the lack of citations was a problem. But I vehemently disagree with those who feel that Hitchens does not know what he is talking about, that he simply has a 'neo-con' bias (Hitchens has always been and continues to be on the far left), or that his arguments are not eye-opening or persuasive. <br />Hitchens focuses on two things in particular: rebutting those overly simplistic slogans of what he calls (yes, a bit unfairly) the 'peaceniks'; and ruminating on Hussein's human rights violations and the overly-bravado way he openly (arrogantly) defies UN stipulations. He even goes so far as to point out (what we all kind of thought, but tried to suppress) that an international clash with Saddam was something of an inevitability. Was it best now or later? Since Hitchens doesn't put much faith in the UN, whose known Hussein was a problem, but dragged its feat for ten years, Hitchens answers that now is better than later in dealing with Saddam. <br />The 'peaceniks' bear much of the brunt of Hitchens' wrath. Slogans like &quot;no war for oil&quot; and &quot;But Hussein wasn't the worst of the bad guys,&quot; really get Hitchens' juice flowing. On the first, Hitchens asks us whether or not what the peaceniks are suggesting is to leave Iraq's oil resources in the hands of the self-same man who showed no hesitation in burning Kuwait's oil fields in the process of 'surrendering' them back to Kuwait? Is such a man not a huge danger to Iraq's oil fields as well? AS to whether we should treat Hussein with kids gloves simply because he is not the 'worst of the bad guys' here is Hitchens himself: <br />&quot;Did the people who said this have any idea what they were saying? How many bad guys could they name who had violated the Genocide Convention on their own territory, invaded two neighboring states, openly financed suicide bombing, sought and nearly acquired numclear capacity and were within easy reach of 9 percent of the world's energy reserves...A man that not only murdered his mildest critics but has also murdered members of his own government...[?]&quot;  [p.9]<br />This should at very least whet people's appetite to learn more. And despite the lack of citations or extended essays, a book like this should at very least be read by the war's critics (myself included, of course) to remind them that, if anything, arguments - good arguments - can be made on all sides. Reading this book confirmed much of what I've long suspected. Yes, I am still a critic of the war, but despite what all too many people say, neither 'side' on this issue seems to have a so desperately wanted monopoly on the truth.	2004-07-07
US	37928338	R3RQEPY2UJKVAQ	0807044113	787360809	Free for All: Defending Liberty in America Today	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Highlights the Necessity and Beauty of Liberty!	\\"Freedom\\" and \\"liberty\\" seem like two of the most over-used and under-appreciated words in our contemporary political vocabulary. Left-wingers might champion the freedom of dissenting speech (or freedom to abort a fetus), while opining about the necessity of hate speech legislation and railing against the right to own a firearm. Right-wingers might champion association rights and freedom of contract, but might rail to the death to regulate 'indecency' and stand opposed to the freedom of gays to marry. As Wendy Kaminer notes several times in this beautiful book, we tend to treat liberty as we do tax loopholes: we only champion the ones we use; to hell with the others. <br />Mrs. Kaminer's book, constructed from essays she has written mainly for The American Spectator magazine, shows that she, unlike most, is not that fickle. The antithesis of the partisan zeolot, Kaminer nobly defends civil liberties and freedoms WHEREVER they need defending. Whether it be defending liberty against the vicious assults they've encountered via the war on terror, or defending the rights of private conservative groups to discriminate against homosexuals if they choose, Mrs. Kaminer consistently champions liberty - everyone's liberty. <br />This book will most probably appeal to two groups - liberals and libertarians. While Mrs. Kaminer certainly approaches issues non-ideologically, she is much harder on right wing attacks liberty (regulating indecency on the internet, opposition to gay marriage and abortion rights, forcing the pledge, etc.) than on left-wing ones (speech codes, push for reparations, etc.) What's more, as a true civil libertarian, Mrs. Kaminer, as often as not, finds herself defending unsavory characters like pornographers, NAMBLA, criminal defendants denied due process rights, and the like - groups that tend to give conservatives more disease than liberals. But far be it from me to generalize; buy the book if you are concerned about liberty, no matter what side you standon. <br />The only two complaints I have tend to do with the format as a collection of essays. First, most essays here are ridiculously short - averaging about three pages. While this is good if you are a casual reader that might read one or two essays at a time, the more serious reader will find the lack of depth that 3 page essays afford frustrating. Second, as these are essays there is a significant overlap of information from one essay to the next. For instance, the chapter of essays on post-Sept. 11 liberty are well written, but after the first few, the repitition of information gets cumbersome and, to be honest, I started questioning whether i needed to read all of them. <br />All in all, though, this book is a sorely needed, non-partisan, defense of liberty and freedom (and its peicemeal encroachment) in contemporary America. If we ever hope to reverse the trend, journalists like Wendy Kaminer becoems absolutely necessary.	2004-07-04

This book - this stunner - focuses on what Tammy Bruce calls the moral relativism (more appropriately, moral nihilism) of our increasingly left-heading culture - the world where 'anything goes,' shame and temperance are bad, and morals are decidedly 'old hat.'<br />Now, keep in mind - a conservative she is not. She is quite pro-choice, and an openly gay feminist. Lest anyone over-react to her thesis before reading it, she is not arguing that we should go back to the 1930's where women stay in the kitchen, reproductive freedom is not an option, and go back to an ultra-religious environment (like me, she is an atheist too). She is simply arguing that we need to get past our current cultural climate where to talk of morals is to be branded a reactionary; to stand up for what's right is wrong; and where 'anything goes' is given carte blanche. She is arguing, in other words, for the infusion of common sense back into our moral vocabulary.<br />Here is my experience with this book. I am a critical reader and no matter what the position, I expect a good argument and good documentation. Well, Tammy Bruce gives us that and then some. Typically, I would start a chapter where she outlines a particular excess of the left's 'anything goes' morality, and think, \\"Surely she is just taking an isolated example of extremism and acting as if it is mainstream. Surely the left is not THAT far gone.\\" By the end of (almost) all the chapters, I was convinced that far from picking only extreme examples to make things sound worse than they REALLY are, she was representing what really was. It is all right there in her book - citation after citation after citation. Doubtless, you will have the same experience I did. Ms. Bruce is just that good a researcher and arguer. <br />The most eye opening chapters, I think, were those highlighting the mmoral bankruptcy of academia and those of the 'selling of sex' to minors on behalf of liberal groups like planned parenthood. The latter example follows the pattern outlined in the above paragraph. I thought, \\"Surely Planned Parenthood is not THAT bad of an organization. Surely no group designed to advocate reproductive freedom can actually be 'selling sex' to 10 year olds.' All I can say is READ IT!!! Especially if you have kids!!!<br />The only flaws of this book are that (a) Ms. Bruce talks often as if The Left (always capitalized) is a big monolith engaging in conspiracy tactics. (Even by doing things as simple as refering to [T]his Left as a singular noun, rather than a plural one.) The book, in other words, can get a bit 'paranoid' at times. Second, Ms. Bruce occasionally engages in a mode of vitriol, calling people 'toxic sludge' and the like. One would have expected her to rise above this, even when dealing with bad people, and her 'vitriol modes' are dispalatable to say the least. <br />But none of these flaws should dissuade you from reading this powerful work. It deserves to be read both by anyone (right or [you know you're out there] left) who feels that our country is experiencing an unhealthy age of nihilism and the 'anything is cool' mentality. Even I (a philosophical moral relativist of all things) am concerned and this book has reinforced the level of that concern. Get it and read it. Read it so you will 'get it.'	2004-07-02

I get uncomfortable around such phrases as &quot;interpretive framework&quot; and &quot;language community.&quot; While this book is deconstructionist in style, it didn't feel as akward as, say, reading Derrida. Much of her thesis, in fact, seemed quite the domain of common sense - almost as if the author was trying to say radically what might have been explained better non-radically. <br />In &quot;Language War,&quot; Dr. Lakoff presents her thesis that much more of public policy (than we realize) is not a war of ideas or policy-solutions, but of WORDS; more than we think, language drives our perception of the state of national debate in the policy arena. She goes on to explore, for instance, how a term like &quot;politically correct&quot; originally used sardonically by the left, has become a word used by the right to demonize the same left. Dr. Lakoff &quot;deconstructs&quot; how language and how it was used played a huge part in the Thomas/Hill affair, has helped shape Hilary Clinton's (then) negative image, and the ebonics scandal in Oakland. <br />In a sense, Dr. Lakoff makes many decent (I hesitate to say 'good') points. A key idea of hers (that most examples attempt to back) is that she who is first to define how a term is used - the sardonic uses of &quot;communist,&quot; &quot;politically correct,&quot; and, yes, &quot;deconstructionist&quot; - is she who sets the 'ground rules' for the debate. Dr. Lakoff also sensitizes us to exactly how many seemingly trivial language tricks are NOT trivial, but highly effective - the use of &quot;we&quot; in political pundit's articles to connote the illusion of audience solidarity, or the political 'apology' that is not: &quot;I'm sorry the media took me out of context.&quot;<br />But did we not know this on some level? Was it not obvious, to some degree, that elections are run more by rhetoric than ideational concerns? Did we not realize that much of what political pundits and spin-doctors do is play a &quot;war of language&quot; with eachother? (After all, founders like Thomas Paine, Patrick Henry, and Thomas Jefferson were quite brilliant at it.)<br />I guess on some level we certainly DID know these things. But Mrs. Lakoff provides an enlightening 'stroll through the newspaper' driving the point home that how we use language - even the details - have a huge effect on public discourse. <br />While one star is subtracted for the sheer silliness of some of these essays (does anyone CARE how language was used in the O.J. trial, or the Thomas/Hill scandal?) the other was for the authors extreme left bias. In fairness, she admits this right in the introduction - she comes out and says it: &quot;I'm a lefty.&quot; But sometimes this forces her to engage in language games of her own. At one point, even, when talking of Clarence Thomas's history on the bench, she talks of the republicans having been &quot;forced&quot; to bring on black judges - yes, the word she used is 'forced.' Forced by whom? (Answer: it was rhetorical!) Other times, she simply applies her theory unevenly: conservatives demonization of the word 'politically correct' was attrocious, but liberals demonizing of the word 'reactionary' was simply...well...justified. So much for trying to argue honestly. While I am no republican, I was quite struck by some of her more gauche moments of bias. <br />Anyway, read the book anyway; if anything, it will ensure that you never look at language (whether you want to include ebonics or not) again.	2004-06-23
US	37928338	R2TQH71PT0I7W5	0226015203	543709312	Law Without Values: The Life, Work, and Legacy of Justice Holmes	Books	3	17	25	N	N	Something Missing!	This book is meant as a polemic against Oliver Wendell Holmes, and in particular, how his skeptical worldview can seen in his decisions. <br />Here's the thing: I, personally, like Holmes and actually quite admire his skeptical philosophy. So, much of what the author sees as Holmes's faults, I tend to see as his strenghts. The fact that he had no use for ideas of natural law and objective 'right answers;' the fact that he recognized (to my eyes) the reality that social life is an ongoing struggle of interest against interest; his view that rights are not naturally existing, self-evident things, but only have validity through positive law. <br />There are two reasons I mention the chasm between what the author thought were strikes against Holmes, that I thought were points in Holmes' favor. First, this leads me to conclude that the this book 'preaches to the choir.' It will only convert the converted; if you dislike Holmes and the skeptical turn in law and society, you will like this book. If you admire Holmes and the skeptical turn he helped usher in, you will not be convinced here that you are wrong.<br />The second reason I bring up the above chasm between mine and the author's take, is taht he really doesn't ARGUE so much as he might do something like simply say: &quot;Holmes was a social darwinist who didn't see a grand purpose to life...&quot; He simply assumes that the reader will addend the sentence with a tacit: &quot;...and those traits are disgusting.&quot; There is even a chapter called &quot;Would you have Wanted Holmes for a Friend?&quot; which does exactly this: it points out the traits the author thinks are ugly about Holmes, and ASSUMES without further argument that the reader will concur. &quot;Holmes was detached from having many friendships...[and wouldn't that be just like that sour old man. Hmmph!]&quot; For my part, I wasn't convinced. <br />The other criticism I have is that the last chapter - which allegedly shows that the skepticism Holmes has ushered in is still with us today - was about as close to a joke as an academic book can produce. The author goes on about teen pregnancy, the rising crime rates, and, yes, even the fact that Americans are runnning deficits. Apparently this all links back to Holmes. To say it bluntly, this chapter seemed so far afield and widely stretched that this nicely written academic book was capped off by a chapter straight out of Pat Robertson's 700 Club. Hmm...<br />So there you have it: the book is good in that it is well-researched, clearly written and interesting as all get out. It is also one of the few books that really explores Holmes the philosopher as much as Holmes the Justice [see also The Essential Holmes, Posner, Richard (Ed.)] But if you are not a Holmes-hater before you go into this book, you will not be when you come out - and vice versa. For all the author's research and 'expose' of Holmes' personality, philosophy, and methods, he simply ASSUMES what he is supposed to prove: that Holmes is the villian the author says he is, and that these traits are the be-all end-all they are assumed to be.	2004-06-14
US	37928338	RXW21V2DL3FV1	0060188162	715541116	The Myth of Moral Justice: Why Our Legal System Fails to Do What's Right	Books	1	52	65	N	N	Law as therapy? (Yup.) Care to explain yourself? (Nope!)	I am the type of reader who, even if I think i will disagree with an author's stance, like to give the book a fair shake. Who knows? The author might present a case I've not seen and in the end, it may be worth my time and effort. (It has happened before.) Not this time. I came away from these 300+ pages thinking the book a complete and total waste of my time. <br />The authors case - if I may be so polite - is that the law should be more moral; it should focus on doing the 'right' thing. Lawyers and judges should become morally sensitive. Law should become more embracing of moral tenets over strict rules and focus on 'healing' the parties involved rather than being an adversarial system focused on settlement for settlements sake. <br />Here's the problem; the author keeps saying all of these things and NEVER actually explores the ins and outs of this thesis. For instance, when he talks of why judges and lawyers need to focus on 'rightness' rather than procedural minuteia, on 'healing' rather than settlements, he never - not once - gives a glimpse at how such a system would work, whether it is practical, or tackles objections that, at least to me, are simply obvious. <br />While my objections are too numerous to go into, let me give you a taste of what you are getting with this book. The author writes: <br />&quot;The winner-take-all structure of the legal systemis moraly deficient because it creates a presumption that justice has been achieved when morally it has not. Sometimes the ultimate winner should not have been victorious... [O]ften, the best moral result would... approximate some measure of victory in both parties - to send them both home healed rather than ambivalent or enraged.&quot; (p. 22)<br />But how do we KNOW who should be morally victorious (when we were not there to know that the alleged defendant did IN FACT commit the crime)? How can a legal system function other than adversarially (can it function communally?) How can a judge (who is not a psychologist) know when both parties are healed (and, say, in a murder, is there ANYTHING that could heal the victim's family in full? Surely not a forced apology!) And how can we measure (as the judge would have to do) when both parties are 'sufficiently' healed? Is it just measured by both parties say-so? If so, does that mean the trial could last 15 years? <br />My point is simple: the author DOESN'T EVEN TRY to map out either a positive case or handle any of these (what I think are) obvious objections. In the interest of giving the author a fair shake, it would have been nice to hear an argument. I did not. The book merely rehashes paragraphs like the above as if the positive case is self-evident (it is not) and objections don't exist (they do). <br />Another flaw is that the author cites (almost exlusively) fiction books and movies to make his case. &quot;Since in x movie, we know that x was guilty and got off, the legal system is not fair.&quot; But the flaw is that there is a difference between fiction and life. In movies, we often KNOW who is guilty. Thus, it is easy to say, &quot;the morally right decision is x because this character did it; we saw her do it on screen.&quot; In life, we rarely come in knowing who is guilty like in the movies. Thus, citing movies is simply too easy; saying, &quot;X is the right answer becasue we know SHE did it,&quot; presumes... that we know she did it! Thus, making the 'morally right' decision is easy in the movies; but sadly, the author does little to differentiate the fantasy land of movies from real life quandaries. <br />It is no exaggeration to say that I could go on for pages citing errors like these! While I can somewhat sympahtize with the author's plight on a 'gut level,' his failure to explain a positive case, sheer repetitiveness of claims he simply ASSUMES to be self-evident, and absolute failkure to handle ANY objections left me dissapointed. Simply put, this is one of the few books I can say was wasted time.	2004-06-13

This book is one that tries to fill in a bit of missing history - missing, that is, in our highly charged and politicized culture. Contra those whos would have us believe that 'secularlists' and others who held non-conventional views on religious matters have been a force of evil in this country, Mrs. Jacoby shows that if anything, 'secularists' have quite a robust and proud history. We - yes, I am a secularist - have been as active a part of this country's history and direction as religious folk and, as Mrs. Jacoby argues in this engaging work, that history has been largely for the good. <br />Many have taken Mrs. Jacoby to be saying more than, I think, she is. By 'freethinker,' many assume 'atheist.' Mrs. Jacoby's use of the term is a bit broader; a freethinker is one who holds highly unconventional (in a literal sense) view on religion - from those who are out-and-out atheists, to deists, to - at this country's inception - universalists. <br />The point, rather, is to show that from its inception, this country has been founded on a radical idea; that government need not be 'under god;' it can remain secular (the word 'civil' was used during the founding to connote a non-sectarian government). From the founding (and I did find her arguments a little less than convincing) she moves on to a chapter on deist Thomas Paine, on the woman's movement (particularly Stanton and Anthony's agnosticism), the growth of secularism during the 20'S and 30's, and the battle with religion - particularly Catholicism - that it has fostered to this very day. <br />In a review that secularist Christopher Hitchens wrote, he criticized Jacoby for her seemingly exclusive linking of 'freethinking' with left-liberal causes. After reading the book, I think that in part this is justified. The dominant force in established religion has been Catholicism and Catholicism has always been (with few exceptions) conservative. It is undeniable that by history's lights, secularism generally HAS been more prevelant and visible on the left as a counterweight. <br />But in a sense, Hitchens is correct. When i finished the book, I felt that Mrs. Jacoby gave the impression that secularism has ALWYAYS been a left-liberal venture  - that 'freethought' is a synonym for 'ACLU' What of Ayn Rand, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sidney Hook and the many others who supported libertarian or conservative causes while maintaining atheistic views? Hook particularly is a glaring ommission as he was an atheist who was instrumental in the fight against communism (so much so that a very religious President Reagan gave him a medal of freedom for his efforts - an atheist!)<br />This leads to another criticism. Like most any history, this one is quite selective. The chapter on Thomas Paine, for example, paints him as almost a demi-god; his historically acknowledge flaws - egotism, fondness for the drink, and overall 'rebel who needs a cause' rambunctiousness - are either ignored or cast aside with one-sentence 'brush offs.' Even secularist Bertrand Russell, when writing an essay on Paine, felt the need to mention Paine's bad spots. While Mrs. Jacoby has written a fine history, revisions like these (and virtual lack of citations when making contreversial claims) made me a bit trepidacious. <br />All in all though, this book is a very good one that lays out a sorely needed counter to Christian historians' assertions that atheists and freethinkers have had little to do with American history. This is simply not true and Jacoby shows it. She doesn't deny (who could?) that Christianity is an inextricable part of our history, but writes of the forgotten, yet abundant, examples of the contributions of freethought.	2004-06-10

While I try to 'understand' middle eastern politics, societies and history, I know that i will never be able to actually understand it. And while i am well-read and have an M.A. in political studies, I have never felt much familiarity, despite my effotrs, on middle eastern politics. <br />Mr. Lamb quickly tells me why this might be, as if i didn't already sort-of know, in his introduction. That is that the difference between the West and the Middle East's lifestyle is just night and day. Individual autonomy is king here; group cohesiveness is king there. Secularism is just an accepted thing here; it is often unthinkable there. We are so comfortable with democracy and all that comes with it here; it is still quite new and alien there. None of these are meant to suggest Western superiority; just to illustrate that if one is Western (unless one has a middle eastern ancestry, perhaps), one will never really be able to enter the mindset of the Middle East. <br />For all that, though, Mr. Lamb gives a good try and in light of what I said, that seems all that can be expected. He is a Westerner and, as another reviewer derogatorily stated, a Western Patriot. He sees things from a Western perspective and is the first to admit that as such, he never was quite able to shed the 'western eyes.' But he gave it a good go, and in that, the book deserves all the four stars I've given it. <br />This book was written well before Sept. 11th, which is refreshing. It is not a polemical tract; nor is it a scholarly work of history or political theory. While the book is not 'unbiased' in any sense that Mr. Lamb does not have a definitely American vantage point, it is 'unbiased' in the sense that Mr. Lamb refrains from taking too many sides or making many polemical arguments. <br />Rather, it is a work of journalism - the tales of Mr. Lamb's four years in the Middle East. He goes through the variou religious, political, social, and historical climates and backdrops that are (or at least to him, are) the Middle East. From Saudi Arabia, to Egypt, to Bahrain, he does a good job at examining the past and present context of Middle Eastern culture(s). And as the book was written pre-Sept. 11th (and only minorly updated with sprinkles about the attacks) it is not as frantic as most of the post-Sept. 11th books. It is truly a good read and for the lay person, a great one. <br />That said, Mr. Lamb comes away seemingly pessimistic about the Middle East. The problem he seems to have the hardest time with, while never coming right out to say it, is the problem most Westerners have. The West is always inclined to look forward; we are looking for the new innovations, new ways of doing things, improvements to be made, and how the future contains new and ever increasing knowledge to help us move on. Our only rule is that there is no rule so sacrosant that we cannot alter it if need permits.<br />The Middle East, at least as he and many others see it, is much more intent on traditionalism; if it wasn't in the Koran or have some tie in with tradition, it is ill-accepted. Even when legitimately trying to look ahead, the Middle East seems easily undercut by wanting to look back to the past. Islam encourages this, as the Koran is held to be relevant to all places AND ALL TIMES. Monarchy, dictatorship, fundamentalism, and what we westerners would (rightly or wrongly) call extreme social conservatism are not only prevelant, but seem inerradicable. Whether these judgments are right or wrong, I cannot say; I am not a middle-eastern scholar. Mr. Lamb, though, does seem to be saying the same thing as many others who've explored the region. <br />To conclude, this book tries to be as unbiased as possible. Does it succeed? Probably not. Will any Westerner's book succeed in this goal? Probably not. Does that mean it is not valuable? No; it is simply the best we may expect. It is well written, layed out,and thorough. Mr. Lamb tries to be sympathetic to as many people as he can, and in that alone, the book is better than most out there. I strongly reccomend it especially if, like me, you are simultaneouly fascinated, mystified, curious, and confused about this thing called the Middle East.	2004-06-05

Let me start by saying that I am a libertarian, firmly committed to most of the ideas represented in this book. In a way, then, it feels strange to have come away from this book with the dry feeling that I did. Here's why I did.<br />First, on television and radio, I am always skeptical of endorsement deals. &quot;Hi, I'm [insert hot-shot sports star] and I use [insert hot-shot product]. You should too.&quot; Well, this book is what i call a 'political endorsement' book of the type where the endorser, Madison, is conveniently dead. &quot;Madison believed [insert policy]. Therefore you should too.&quot;<br />Now, I guess that the title of the book alone should've indicated to me that this was what to expect,and i guess in some sense I did. With essay titles like, &quot;Madison and Multi-culturalism,&quot; one expects that the goal is to take Madison's writings and apply them to contemporary situations. Maybe i just didn't expect so much of the, &quot;...since Madison said x, x must be right,&quot; bit.<br />Before I go into my one MAJOR problem with the book, I did give it 3 out of 5 stars. Here's why. Whereas about half of the essays are 'endorsement deal' essays, about half are legitimately not. Of course, as the book is on Madison, they might mention him in passing, but most of the 'non-endorsement deal' essays do something like this: &quot;Madison thought x to be a problem. I think x is a problem too. I will argue my own case and I might mention Madison only in passing.&quot; The best essays in the book (about a good half of them) do exactly this. They argue on their, not Madison's, merits. <br />The only thing funny about that is that for all practical purposes, those essays needn't be in a book on Madison at all. In fact, if one took the 'endorsement deal' essays out of the book and left only the others, one could safely take Madison's name from the title. In fairness, my simultaneous criticism of 'endorsement deal' essays relying too much, and other essays relying not enough, on Madison, seem to have me wanting it both ways. I guess I wanted (a) a book that was more about history and less about polemical advocacy; and (b) just a little bit more substance than &quot;Madison believed it, therefore, so should we.&quot; <br />Now for my big criticism. A few authors claim for Madison views seemingly more extreme than Madison seemed to hold. Some authors say that Madison was a big defender of laissez-faire. I've read much Madison and i've yet to see the essay he wrote on private economic activity. Sure, he writes on strictly limiting the NATIONAL govt.'s powers, but he, as Jefferson, believed in things like public education, wrote nasty words about the unequal relationship of creditors and debtors, and generally did not write against states ability to regulate economic behavior. Was Madison a federalist? Yes. Did he believe in limited government? On the NATIONAL level, yes. Does that mean he supported laiseez-faire economics? Not exactly. And the CATO writers did a poor job showing he did. They do things like point to Madison's position on contracts BETWEEN THE STATES or his non-interventionist approach to dealing with other nations and jump to the conclusion that he supported free-market economics. They must do better than that. <br />Lest I get on too much of a diatribe, I have to say that, for all that, the book was decent. I gave it three stars for the 'non-endorsement deal' essays, and as they are about half of the book, the book is worth getting. I simply expected better for the other half.	2004-06-04
US	37928338	RLL1FJ1JNSOIJ	0226675548	184233071	The Essential Holmes: Selections from the Letters, Speeches, Judicial Opinions, and Other Writings of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.	Books	5	29	29	N	N	This is an Excellent Read!	The Essential Holmes, edited by Richard A. Posner (judge on the seventh circuit) collects the thoughts of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. via his numerous letters, court opinions, law journal articles and miscelleneous writings. It is a daunting task as Holmes was quite well-learned and something of a polymath, discoursing on everything from metaphysical philosophy to economics to law. <br />Posner, though, does a great job in editing the letters and pasting the relevant sections into easily digestible sections loosely related to the chapter's 'theme.' Posner's goal, to be sure, is to focus more on Holmes the philosopher, and i'm sure law students (who may know Holmes the Justice best) will thrill at the chance to really see how his philosophy - sympathetic with American pragmatism - extends into his thoughts on law. About the first half of the book is devoted to Holmes's philosophy on everything from metaphysics to the 'life struggle' and 'social struggle.' The second half segues the more theoretical sections into Holmes's views on statutory and common law, the interpretative 'theory' of both, and Holmes's ever contreversial and confusing views on individual liberty. <br />As the reader will find (or may already know) Holmes's social, ethical, and metaphysical philosophy is something of an individualistic relativism. Dreams of any final theory are suspect, and the social order is not much more than each person operating in self-interest, clashing with other people (doing the same) in something of a never-ending Darwinian struggle. From this (and the fact that Holmes believed all morality to be local and relative to context), law should not be seen as being gotten from some 'natural law'-like moral order, but should be disconnected from morality; rather, it should be seen as humankind's way of deriving regularity from the clashes of human interest in a neat little fiat. The law, then, is simply what the soveriegn says it is. <br />This (among other things) has made Holmes out to be something of a bad guy. To be sure, he can come off as crass and 'pre-post-modern.' But Holmes is also refreshingly real (at least to my eyes, as I am a philosophic ptragmatist through and through). It is becasue Holmes saw that there is no universal standard of 'natural law' or other such 'free-floating' fictions that he was such a believer in judicial restraint - holding to the constitution even when he personally disagreed. Many of those cases (Lochner, etc.) are included in this volume. <br />The only two things I was disappointed did not get more time was Holmes's first amendment views which are notoriously hard to decipher, and the conflict between his simultenous support of a 'living constitution' and his belief in judicial restraint. Both are conflicts that even the best of scholars wade through confusedly (never able to resolve their tensions), and it would have been nice to see a bit more focus on these two areas. <br />Of course, Posner is not at fault as this is an edited collection which can only provide what Holmes said; maybe he simply never resolved these two views. <br />To conclude, this is a great and artfully done collection that focuses more on Holmes's philosophy (from metaphysics to ethics) than do most of Holmes's collections. For those that know Posner, he is awfully sympathetic in idea to Holmes and his intro, though, breif is first rate; the selections, also, are fantastically picked. This book is not to be missed by lawyers who want some philosophy, and philosophers that want some law. Holmes was just amazingly skilled at both.	2004-06-03

Black co-workers I have had always seemed to me to exhibit a strange position in regards to affirmative action. No one believes, of course, that they themselves need the affirmative action boost to get ahead (&quot;I can do it by merit, thanks!&quot;) but people are equally convinced that others DO need that boost. But when everyone I consult seems confident that they themselves can get jobs on an equal playing field, it is hard to see who all of them think the beneficiaries are. Everyone seems to think it is the other guy. <br />This is part of what McWhorter calls the 'new double consciousness.' Privately, and to themselves, blacks are wont to talk about self-empowerment and individual achievement. But in public, the tune changes. Socially, racism makes those nice-sounding things impossible and while blacks might achieve sometimes, it is seen as the exception, not the rule. Personal optimism and can-do-ism turns to public pessimism and victimology. Like affirmative action, the private belief that I personally can do better for myself by my efforts is quicly abandoned when we deal with policy issues. <br />McWhorter writes this book in conviction that this new double consciuosness must be abandoned. Racism is not dead; there ARE still many legitimate problems like profiling. But this does NOT mean that blacks are doomed to ho-humming pergatory on earth or that obstacles cannot be overcome with effort. Nor does it mean that programs that give blacks handouts for being black amount to much more than 'liberal' white people hopinig for the quick fix so as to quelch (or mask) their guilt. <br />McWorter is not as conservative as most black conservatives like Connerly or Sowell. He does not expect it all to be a miraculous pulling up by ones own bootstraps; nor does he expect blacks to snap their fingers and 'get over it.' Rather, he offers many constructive, if unpopular, suggestions on how to alleviate what is shaping up to be a bad situation. <br />My favorite articles in this collection are: <br />&quot;The New Black Double Consciousness&quot; - McWhorter exposes what the phenomenon is and why blacks will play the victim card in public discussions by talk about strengh and stoicism in private.<br />&quot;Aren't You In Favor of Diversity?&quot; The affirmative action movement in academia is dissected. McWhorter argues that until blacks are held to the same standards as whites in terms of academic achievement, then academic success will fail to take a real hold as an achievable (and achievable it is) value in the black community. Learning should not be a 'white' thing, but a 'person' thing. <br />&quot;We Don't Learn Our History&quot; - McWhorter examines how black history is taught (mistaught) and argues that the problem is largely that blacks are taught the success stories as exceptions that hold no real weight in the real world - a pessimistic view that leads to needless despair. <br />&quot;The New Black Leadership&quot; - the author takes the likes of Jackson and Sharpton to task for talking a good game (and lining their pockets with the victimology card) while failing to actually DO anything. From there he profiles activists like Star Parker and John Bryant who actually ARE helping blacks 'on the ground' but don't get credit as black leaders because they are conservative. <br />These are just some of the best. The whole book is excellent and, though it is probably not what many want to hear, McWhorter is writing about what we AS A PEOPLE should hear. He does it well and whether you think you will agree with him - especially if you don't - this book is one you should have in your collection.	2004-06-01

Stephen Carter's thesis is quite a noble one: he thinks that we as a society have taken religious freedom and morphed it into something of an anti-religion bias. The public square, for instance, seems to give less and less credence to arguments or ideas informed by religion. Pro-lifers or those opposed to gay marriage are written off as 'fanatics' or simply holders of weak, because religiously informed, positions. The establishment and free-exercise clause (which Carter DOES see as a wall of seperation between church and state) has increasinly been used to banish religion from the public square entirely.<br />This is all quite unique for me because I am an non-believer, probably unlike many reviewers here. Even as a non-believer (polite term for atheist) I can see the trivialization of religion in our culture and particularly in the political arena. As we speak, George W. Bush is being dismissed as a 'fundamentalist' because he, like most americans (according to current surveys) opposes gay marriage. Apperently opposing gay marriage ipso facto makes one a fundamentalist which ipso facto marginalizes the whole opinion.<br />Here's the problem: the three stars I've given this book are for the thesis and the very good research (especially in part 1, where the problem is surveyed). The other two stars that I did NOT give the book were for execution. Each chapter seems to be on a wholly new topic (a seperate essay unto itself) and Carter does little to hold them together. The first section diagnoses the problem, the second section discusses the 1st amendment religion clauses (and as a law scholar, Carter gives a VERY surface level account) and the third section (apperently) works at a solution (which I was still waiting for when I closed the book for the final time). In brief, the research was good and Carter brings up many good points; they are just packaged in a quite random, meandering, book.<br />The only other problem to speak of is that on the one hand, Carter chastises current politics (liberal politics) for discounting religious faith; on the other he chastises religious faith for often being too dogmatic and zeolous. BUT THAT IS WHAT RELIGIONS DO!<br />Not all, to be sure, but most any catholic sect, for instance, takes stands, believes sincerely in them, and is convinced that their take is the only right one. Quite simply, most religions firmly beleive that their way is right and others are wrong - that they have access to the 'truth as revealed through god' where the rest are mistaken. To suggest that religion can still be religion while saying, \\"But I may be completely wrong about divine revelation or commandment,\\" seems to take the religion out of religion. Thus, I (and Stanley Fish has wisely said just this about Carter) think Carter is trying to let faith back into liberalism by telling religion to be more secular. (Be open minded about gay marriage; you might be wrong, after all, Mr. Robertson!). [Read the section on religion in Stanley Fish's \\"The Trouble With Principle\\" for these critiques.]<br />To conclude, the issue is one that needs to be addressed and Dr. Carter has produced a well-researched attempt to highlight what is wrong.

Stanley Fish writes with an overarching theme: general principles and theories might be pragmatically necessary (as communicative rhetoric) but beyond that are just not real or feasible. It is the ultimate irony, then, that while reading this book I found myself asking why Fish didn't apply this 'princple' (and principle it is) to himself.<br />The idea is that principles like 'fairness,' 'free speech,' 'justice,' and 'equality,' are, in truth, no more than rhetorical abstractions we use to justify things WE like. To be honest, Fish argues well for this and gives us many examples. But, as Fish himself writes, 'general principles' can be taken too far and outlive any semblance of usefulness. It is when he tries to apply this 'principle' to different problems that he gets a little weird and alas, the 'no general principle' thing comes to bite HIM.<br />The first section is a collection of essays written for campus debates with Dinesh D'Souza in relation to affirmative action and campus diversity - Fish being ademantly for each of these. Fish's argument seems to be this: \\"Since 'fairness' and 'equality' can mean anything to anyone and they as principles don't exist, Mr. D'souza or anyone else shouldn't appeal to them. We should only ever appeal to historical context - history is everything here.\\" The problem is that subtley, Fish is (a) making argument against him impossible because...what do you say to someone who refuses to acknowledge any principle at all1?; and (b) subtley sneaking general principles back in by saying: \\"When we take history into account, affirmative action (etc.) turns out to be fair (even though fairness is not a valid principle).<br />The next set of essays is on freedom of speech. Fish says that that too doesn't really exist and then proceeds to demonstrate by pointing out the obvious: no matter what 'theory' of free-speech one uses, there will always be hard cases where principle can't decide alone. He then proceeds to take principle too far and declare that because of this, the whole of free-speech law is a rhetorical put-on and therefore, things like hate-speech legislation or pornography bans are really justified. After all, if there are hard cases, then we can do whatever we'd like, right? The problem is that just because there are hard cases doesn't mean that we can't try to be as inclusive and libertarian as POSSIBLE. From Fish's recognition that free-speech always has boundaries doesn't follow that therefore we should just censor everything.<br />His next section is on legal theory and it is here he takes an almost opposite turn. He concludes (with Richard Posner) that general principles in law and legal theory are just as bogus as they are in any other field. BUT, he disagrees with people like the legal crit school (bet you didn't think Fish would do that!) by saying that here, general principles are at least pragmatically necessary so as to maintain the reason d'etre of law: consistency, order, and at least the appearance of trying to be impartial. Whereas in the other two sections, lack of general principles meant we should sort of do whatever is whatever, here - somehow - general principles have a vital role to play.<br />All of this is to say that while I enjoyed the book and it was very provocative, Fish does as most people who discover a 'general principle' do: he takes it a bit too far, applying it with a gusto to everything he can get his hands on. What he SOMETIMES pays lip-service to in these essays (and most of the time, not) is that while general principles may be hollow on examination, we can't help but use them as they are (a) valuable communicative tools; (b) unavoidable linguistically; and (c) pragmatically useful in things like law, science, philosophy, and even...literary criticism. LIke those Fish criticzes, I just think he is too drunk with his own \\"no principle\\" principle.<br />But get the book anyway. It is a great read and will most certainly make you think. Fish really is not that ultra-post-modern guy the conservatives like to pretend he is and some of the positions he takes in this book - against interdisciplinarianism and New Historicism - will prove it.is not that ultra-post-modern guy the conservatives like to pretend he is and some of the positions he takes in this book - against interdisciplinarianism and New Historicism - will prove it.	2004-05-21

Is what they said he said actually what he said or should we be listening to what HE said he said instead? In &quot;Justifying Belief,&quot; Gary Olsen examines the non-literary or - excuse the phrase - theory based works of Stanley Fish. Fish, of course, is one of the most demonized and malligned academics of the day; many people, in fact, know him solely by what his critics have said about him. That is always dangerous. Point blank: &quot;What they said he said,&quot; is much different than &quot;what he said.&quot; <br />While I don't want to go into much length here (and if you are reading this, you probably have at least SOME understanding of who Fish is and what he beleives) the basic principles are these: Neutral principles don't exist, and theory doesn't really do much for practice. Neutral principles like &quot;justice&quot; and (watch out!) &quot;liberalism&quot; only mean something when WE attach substantive content to them; otherwise, they are simply floating and content-empty abstractions. Everyone is for &quot;justice,&quot; only because each of us bring different substance to what it means. As for theory, Fish writes, it is all well and good to bandy about on theory, but to suggest that anyone consults it before doing a real-life action is just a bit...well... obtuse. <br />The problem, of course, and why critics call Fish nasty names is that he comes to the conclusion that all is rhetoric. Not, Olsen points out, in a bad way, but in a completely neutral way (&quot;rhetoric&quot; not being perjorative, but neutral, that is). While I think that Fish is on to something, there is something self-aggrandizing about a literary theorist saying, &quot;It all comes down to rhetoric,&quot; much like the egotistical economist says, &quot;All behavior is economic,&quot; or the biologist saying, &quot;It all comes down to genes.&quot; But read it and make your own call. <br />Basically, this book is an intro text to Fish and nothing more. As I've read both of Fish's real &quot;philosophy&quot; texts - &quot;The Trouble with Principle,&quot; and &quot;There's No Such Thing as Free Speech..&quot; - the level of uncritical discourse was discouraging. If you've read these the book will be disappointing; all Olsen does is go through one essay at a time and say everything Fish said in the order Fish said it, adding little if anything. That, of course, is what the book is for; I was wrongly expecting a moe in-depth examination. <br />The two sections I DID find entertaining were the two interviews done with Fish in '91 and '01. The interviews (and the whole text) was unrigorously fawning and as such, we learn little we didn't already know. It was still nice to hear Fish himself put his ideas into new words. <br />I gave the book three stars because while I didn't find the book to do much more than to re-say what Fish has already said, the book will be good for those who don't know much about Fish, and more peculiarly, Fish's critics that don't know much of Fish's own work (but are secretly hesitatant to read it). Olsen does do a good job of lucidly explaining Fish and that combined with the interview also does much to clear up some areas where &quot;what Fish said is not what they said he said.&quot; If you are a critic or a newcomer, this book is a good read. If you've read Fish, this book will show you nothing new.	2004-05-19

The anatomy of most Randian arguments is this: (a) Ask the philosophic question (what is life?); (b) caricaturize all of your opponents; (c) argue against the strawmen using arguments that your real opponents hold; (d) claim Rand was the first to think of these things; (e) don't tackle any serious objections; (f) declare yourself the victor. This is Mrs. Smith's formula and my, is she good at it!<br />The question is \\"Why be moral?\\" Her answer - what she calls Rand's 'revelation' - is that we should be moral because we need to survive; as we are beings who place value on attaining things that will sustain our lives, morality is the study of how those things should be attained. <br />But was this a 'revelation'? And is her assertion that values are facts (the fact is tha we have values) even close to proving that morality is objective? No and no. I don't know who the first was to see values as rooted in our biological and psychological needs, but I do know that William James said it in 1900; not long after was John Dewey in the '30's and '40's. As to the second question, they were relativists. The fact that values were shaped by our needs and wants was only sufficient to show..well.. that values exist. But they are irreducibly up to the individual's appraisal in order to impress on action. Mrs. Smith agrees with Dewey and James on this, yet she is blind to the fact that that view has always - ALWAYS - been known as relativism (and even subjectivism in the agent-relative sense). <br />From there, it gets worse. She argues that we should pursue self-interest simply because it is in our self-interest to and also that we should not infring on others rights to do the same because it is in our self-interest to do that. She never quite tells us why, save for repeating ad infinitum that we should care about being good to others because it is in our self-interest. Hmm...<br />Lastly, and this is where she lets her true feelings show, she talks about why rational self-interests cannot conflict. IF two people go for the same job (one they both really want) and one gets it, rational self-interest, she says, still doesn't conflict. Why? Because - get this - one of them is just confused about what is rationally in her self-interest. (She should realize that the best person got the job). If two self-interested people clash, then it is just a matter of one - or both - not being rational about their self-interest. The problem, as any real philosopher would tell you, is that we literally have no access to an impersonal view beyond ourselves. If both wanted the job THEN BOTH WANTED THE JOB! Saying that one of them is just not being rational is trying to access a neutral viewpoint where none seems possible (but in ones own personal imagination). Is that impartiality also rational? I personally don't believe it is. (I shouldn't want that job. To do so would simply be irrational!)<br />For all of Mrs. Smith's attempts, she leaves more questions than answers. IF values are contextual and up to the subject's own appraisal, then how is that anything other than relativism? If values, as she says, aren't merely up to personal desire, then why does she say also that needs and wants (sounds like desire to me) determine how we appraise values to work towards? If values are objective and based on the organism's survival, then what about those values that are beyond survival (should I get a cafe latte or help the homeless person? Should I support gay marriage?) If values are related objectively to flourishing, and two people disagree on how they want their lives to flourish, then if the two conflict, is one of them just not being rational (as opposed to simply two different ideas of 'flourihing')?<br />Questions, questions, questions. So where are the 'viable' answers?	2004-05-14

There have been several posthumous releases and I've enjoyed every one. Unfortunately, I enjoyed this one half as much as some others. <br />The problem, in a nutshell, is that if you are at all familiar with Berlin, then not much of this info will come as anything new. He discusses his view of pluralism, his admiration for Herder and Vico, his zionism, and several other well known areas of Berlin's thoughts. <br />The interviewer, in particular, did not ask very illuminating questions and as such, Berlin gives less than illuminating answers. At times (just my perception) it seemed like Berlin himself was less than pleased with a few of the questions. One important one that was not but should have been asked (as it is much on any Berlin-admirer's mind)is how he can reconcile pluralism (the belief that values irreducibly conflict both personally and interpersonally) and relativism (the view that ethical truths and ideals may simply be relative). While pluralism and relativism were talked of, there was not a single word about this question (that more than a few Berlin scholars have troubled over). <br />I gave the book three stars because it is just too hard to give Berlin any less. To be sure, I did like the book and the interview style makes it very readable and in some senses exciting (&quot;Yeah! I would've asked that one. I wonder what he'll say?&quot;) It may suffer from a problem long known to Berlin - his work is too historical for philosophers and too philosophical for historians. For me, it was just right. It may be for you too. If you are fairly new to Berlin this is a good place to start. If you are a veteran (or moderately so) you won't find much new or illuminating here.	2004-05-13
US	37928338	R1TT0KXYHH0XWV	0765808633	329254809	The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism	Books	2	5	20	N	N	You can't lose for trying...but....	I first read this work when it came out in 2000. At the time, I had been quite a believer in objectivism but completely irked by the Peikoff-style iron fisted approach to philosophy (that Rand was indubitably a part of). Objectivism was not much better, it seemed, than the very religous dogma it rebelled so much against. Then I read Kelley and decided that one could actually have a more tolerant and open objectivism. Unfortunately, as objectivists say, A is A - Objectivism is Objectivism (still with a capital \\"O\\") and my new found optimism only lasted about another six months. The \\"movement\\" will never change; it never could; the intolerance Kelley wants is built into the fiber of Rand's philosophy. Despite Kelley's efforts, I decided to quit.<br />This is NOT to say that Kelley doesn't put forth a noble effort. In fact, for those that admire Objectivism, this is really a great book and you should read it. In it, Kelley's main target is objectivism's assertion that as all ideas are moral to some degree, we as right thinking people should always - ALWAYS - condem those who hold \\"immoral\\" views - whether it be Kant, Marx, your co-workers, or your college professor. <br />Kelley tries very hard to draw a distinction between when it is appropriate to morally condemn and write off, and when it is not. Unfortunately, his argument is pure rhetoric and fails to do much except, as another reviewer nobley said, belabor the obvious. The problem, as that same reviewer said, is that intolerance is simply built into the system of objectivism. <br />So as to explain only enough not to bore the reader, there is an odd and unresolved tension in Kelley's simultaneous view that (a) \\"there is no dichotomy between fact and value\\" and (b) his dislike of the belief that things have intrinsic values discovered through Reason (natural law and the like). He correctly notes that it is a hard line to keep straight, but fails to mention that he doesn't ever actually draw the line. When one believes that values are a form of fact and that those facts can only be discovered through reason, one is - no matter how one sells it - a believer in the very intrinsicism one is preaching against. <br />Secondly, Kelley talks of toleration as, to a decent degree good, because 'there is a difference between error and evil.' We tolerate others because they (he never says 'we') have a right ot err. That is not tolerance that anyone wants; it is rather like a heterosexist tolerating her flaming gay cousin or someone tolerating a buzzing fly. That is not tolerance; it is condescension in 'tolerance's' clothing. <br />(And if objectivism isn't supposed to be Leonard Peikoff's religion anymore, then why does Kelley still capitalize the \\"O\\"?)<br />What Kelley, I think, doesn't realize is that, as Greg Nyquist below writes, the moment one suggests that there is no dichotomy between fact and value - between is and ought - the tendency will always be to suggest that \\"since I'm right and you're not, you should go my way; or I could just tolerate you by silent condescension.\\" <br />Read the book. See if it makes sense to you. I cannot tell you what to do (as I have given up those Randian pretensions). But for my money, Kelley is running against a current that is so fast and strong that while he might feel he is making good speed, he will still do nothing but lose ground.	2004-05-13

Supreme Court Justice and legal pragmatist Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote: \\"I always say the chief end of man is to form general propositions - adding that no general proposition is worth a damn.\\" He also wrote: \\"Do not be bullied out of your common sense by the specialist; two to one, he is a pedant.\\" Put these two quotes together and they describe Richard Posner's \\"Problematics of Moral and Legal Theory\\" perfectly!  <br />Simply put, Federal Judge Richard Posner has a HUGE bone to pick with moral philosophy's belief that they can effect law (or much else for that matter) for the two reasons stated above: (a) morality, says Posner (rightly, i think) is relative - \\"no general proposition is worth a damn.\\" (b) Moral philosophers are, by in large, pedants who take themselves much more seriously than anyone not a moral philosopher does. <br />Posner backs up and documents the futility of moral philosophy for law quite well. In fact, I came across this book while writing something to do with the abortion wars, which is used as an example of Posner's dilemma. The abortion contreversey has not been close to solved, despite moral philosophy's best efforts, because the matter is simply not one amenable to reason in the first place. One side sees a child; the other, a fetus. One side sees the mother's 'right; the other, the babie's 'right'. The fact is that for all of moral philosophy's talk that there is a 'right' answer in all of this (each side convinced that they posess it) the 'right' answer merely depends on which premises you accept (and will be unlikely talked out of as the conviction is emotional, not 'rational'). <br />Posner goes on to outlay a theory of pragmatism that, as Holmes briefly touched on in \\"The Path of the Law\\" that first, acknowledges that \\"no general proposition is worth a damn,\\" and that while theory has its place, so does practice and that the law needs to be much more cognizant of the latter than it has been.<br />If all this makes Posner seem likea post-modernist, that is because the difference (and there is a difference) is hard to decipher. Those post-modernists like Stanley Fish want to get rid of principle - \\"general propositons\\" - alltogether and see law as nothing but a game of political rhetoric. While Posner shares Fish's pessimism on general principles, he doesn't think they should be abandoned, but used pragmatically - not the caricature of using principles to justify ends wanted in advance, but to use them like we use rules of baseball; they are conventions and need to be seen as such (there is no 'natural law') but they exist and must exist to allow the game to be played. Posner explains much of this in the book (though it might take some read throughs to get it clear).<br />To close, I gave the book 4 stars becasue while Posner seemed to enjoy himself in trashing philosophy and law, one gets the feeling (as one so often does with Posner) that he has very little to put in its place. This may perfectly be his intent - that nothing can be put in its place. If so, he should point that out and explain why rather than just leaving us hanging. Oh well! <br />Simply put, this is the book (if \\"Sex and Reason\\" wasn't) that will ensure that should Posner get a Supreme Court nod, he will NEVER make it past the senate!	2004-05-10

The problem with ethics and 'moral theory' today is that it drastically overemphasizes the power of rationalism and appeals to...well...theory. Plato, Kant, Mill, and most of those in between have 'argued' for certain moral systems based on some objective standard (the pleasure principle, categorical imperative, etc.) accessible it is said, through the faculty of reason. There is, it is said, a True Morality and general principles therein (that exist whether we think they do or not); only the reasoned, contemplative mind can know them. <br />Richard Taylor has a problem with that. His goal is to examine rataionalism's manifestations in the history of ethical philosophy, argue why that conception is flawed, and replace it with something different, better, and hopefully better capable to portray morality as it really is - rather than as philosophers (who often value consistency over accuracy) tend to pretend it exists. <br />All that said, this book is literally one of the best reading philosophy books I have EVER read (I'd place it in my top ten). Taylor's three sections (history, argument against, elucidation) are simply first rate for their clarity, terseness, conversationalism, and structure. It is rare to read a 300 page book that can present a history, argue against its principles, present new principles, argue for them, present details on them, and still have you interested. This book does that. Even for those that are interested only in a general text on moral philosophy's evolution, buy this book for the first 150 pages; everyone from Protogoras to Plato, Kant to Mill is discussed in an insightful and delightful manner. <br />Finally we come to the argument against rationalism. Taylor's view to replace rationalism is a tough one for philosophers to swallow: general moral principles of the kind to objectively ground morality to don't exist after all. Morality, rather, is simply our set of rules (however informal) in living with others. What is good? What is evil? What is the moral life? Says Taylor, &quot;No general principles or objective mind-irrelative standard is going to help us here.&quot; Morality is conventional in the sense that it is solely based on human contrivance (and we are all checks and balances on eachother, even without the luxury of objective principles). But, though relative, morality is still based in large part on our human natures. But it is not reason we are after (as philosophers like to say it is) but emotion. <br />Taylor brings up many reasons why he thinks this is so, but one in particular stands out (as I'd been beginning to suspect it anyhow). Philosophers talk a lot about general principles. But when they do, they 'justify' them by appealing to the results they lead to. For the principle, &quot;See others as ends, rather than merely as means,&quot; (Kant) to be justified, philosophers appeal to experience (what situations the principle leads to) and sees if the results accord with our intuition. To find the theory wanting, all a clever philosopher must do is to show that the theory, when consistently applied, leads to strange results - ones that don't accord with our pre-existing intuitions. <br />So, Taylor argues, why not just cut out the middle man? IF we already 'know' that certain acts are wrong (as we test 'principles' by whether they accord with those intuitions) then why are we pretending that moral principles are real, rather than simply communicative generalizations that WE create to 'justify' what we already knew was right or wrong? In other words, while general principle is valid as a pragmatic and commuicative device (it gets us where we need to go), that doesn't negate the fact that it is artificial, not something that exists but is created, likegod, in our image, and anything but fixed. <br />He is not suggesting that we become simply irrationalists; only that objective standards of right and wrong don't exist. If the deranged person thinks that killing is good, we can say that by our conventions he is wrong, and we can say that his principles are not as conducive (as the non-aggressors are) to living well with others. We can also say that we regard him as wrong because we are able to 'put ourselves in the victims place.' What we cannot say is that (a) there is some objective principle to appeal to existing 'in reality'; (b) that the judgment has much to do with reason rather than the emotion of the thing. What's more, any rule we DO pretend exists as an absolute is at best context-relative and sometimes highly so. It may be relative to time (what if the murder had been of an Indian in the 1800's?), place (is it wrong to practice infanticide amongst primitive tribes of brazil that do it all the time?) or even person. <br />I rarely spend so much time reviewing any one book, but this one literally is just to good to be limited to 3 paragraphs. I hope this becomes a classic someday and I hope that moral philosphy - the drudge that it is - gains much from it.	2004-05-07
US	37928338	R24UO4IJD5N4AC	0142003921	672421436	The Newsboys' Lodging-House: or The Confessions of William James--A Novel	Books	4	9	10	N	Y	A strange psychological story of an eminent psychologist!	As a lover and student of philosophy, I have a prediliction toward pragmatism. And as I have a prediliction toward pragmatism, I have a fondness for James. And as I have a fondness for James, I found this fictionalized account of a 'missing period' of James's life interesting (if not a bit strange and obviously fabricated). <br />In this novel, John Boorstin is envisioning James in his thirtieth year. This is when he experienced his mental breakdown leaving him an inch from suicide and in complete emotional paralysis. He had spent quite a few months, we know, in a mental institution, but here, the diary stops - the pages referring to this few-month period have been cut out of his diary, leaving the period a complete mystery. <br />Boorstin imagines a scenario that as far-fetched as it is (and the author acknowledges that) is interesting and at very least entertaining. James goes to New York with little money where, in fascination with Horatio Alger, volunteers to instruct children at a Lodging House for orphaned kids. It is there he meets a 9-year-old boy called Jemmie and becomes determined to save this child (who James is convinced is good at heart, but slipping into street-life) from the cold and hard world of the streets. Therein, James finds himself ensnared in quite a few 'plots' that gradually help him become his own person (as we know that when the 'missing period' was over, James was remarkably more directed and focused). <br />As I do not know how many people reading this will be as familiar with William James as us philosopher types, there is one part of the novel I think that may get lost on those not as familiar with James. Though one need not at all be a philosopher to like this novel, the story very much ties into the meaning of James' philosophy of pragmatism wherein 'truth' is said to be dictated sometimes by the 'facts' and sometimes by 'what we personally need to believe'. So as not to get too philosophical here, I will copy one paragraph from thenovel that beautifully explains: <br />&quot;Until this moment, I had thought true belief to be absolute and beyond one's control, the inevitable expression of one's fundamental knowledge of the workings of the world. Now I saw that we created our beliefs even as we cherished their eternal permanence. All of us are bound up in beliefs which express not only our deepest truths but our deepest needs.&quot;<br />This is very much a part of James (both as a psychologist and a philosopher, James being equally adept at both). Boorstin's goal, in this fantastic but quite engrossing tale, is in part to give us a 'real live shot' of what James' pragmatism looks like in practice through James' very own eyes. The result is a very good novel that will at once entrhall you and capture your philosophic imagination.	2004-05-04

William James was as incongruent as his philosophy; and I don't mean this sardonically. He was a lover both of art and science; both of the unity of the whole and the plurality of parts; both of the rationalistic and the sentimental parts of life. It is always suprising to me not that he could be all these things, but how well he balanced them all. Whenever one trait would come to the forefront, James almost instinctively checked it with an equal and opposite impulse. <br />This book gives us a front-row seat to watch James's balancing act up close! By my estimates, a little over half of this book's text is letters either from or to James (by frinecs such as Perice, Holmes, Dewey, Bergson, and his brother Henry). The author does a good job weaving these letters together with biographical infromation; with this mixture, he does two things. He puts James's life in the context of his philosophy (philosophies?) and puts his philosophy(-ies)in the context of his life. The best part, to me, was the author's ability to discouse on each book James wrote integrating its philosophy with the events of James's world at the time.<br />As with most biographies, this one does have a tendency (too much so in my opiinion) to psychologize in ways that, to me, seem stretching. The last two chapters, for instance, on James's &quot;Morbid Traits&quot; and his &quot;Benign Traits&quot; are like a psychological summary of James, often identifying traits James posessed as ones that are hinted at in his works (particularly the Varieties of Religous Experience). While sections like these can be interesting, they can also (as these two are) become overkill. I read the rest of the book (which psychologizes but keeps it to a minimum) and skimmed these two chapters. <br />Otherwise, this s a great biography. Not so intellectual as to be inaccessable to general readers, but not to watered down that we don't both learn new things about James and the philosophic landscape on every page. To put it strangely, to me, James is like a great jazz ballad - the more you come into contact with its intricacies, the more you grow to cherish it. And, I suppose that James is like jazz - emphasizing the individuality of the parts rather than a pre-determined whole. And like a good jazz tune, James's philosophy was never finished - always open ended. <br />So go read the book already.	2004-04-16

In his book Life, LIberty and the Defense of Dignity, Leon Kass cites a few times that 2/3rds of the population are opposed to cloning. Well, I am not one of them. There is much to disagree with here and I've done much of it. But unlike those shoddy books like Fukuyama's Our Posthuman Future, or Bill McKibben's laughable diatribe, Enough, I can disagree with Kass while still respecting him as a thinker. I even nod my head at some of his points.<br />About half of this book deals with abstract, and half, concrete, issues. His abstract sections I was almost in total agreement with. Ethical philosophy, he writes, long ago lost track of how to deal with issues rather than theories, and real peoople rather than 'rational man' constructs. Minutia is argued on a quest to develop a consistent theory of the human right and good. BUT NO SUCH THEORY NEED TO BE CREATED! We are dealing with people who make most decisions on a hearty combination of feeling (not amenable to intellectualization) and rational thought. This is where Kass comes from.<br />Add to this that biology has gone on so well with the reductionist program that even it has started to lose track of how to deal with the whole person. Like wantling to understand a person-in-full by studying the small minutia of their lives seperately, event-by-event; you won't get the feel of the whole person that way; she must be studied as a whole person. Biology, by breaking us down to the smallest constituent parts, don't explain us, so much as break us down to the type of bite-sized chunks they find helpful in THEIR studies.<br />So Kass starts from the philosophy of the whole person. It is here that I feel he uses this more as an excuse to be inarticulate than a tool to REALLY examine the issue. Whether it is cloning, euthenasia, the selling of organs; he keeps taling about how our human dignity is threatened but never even attempts to explain what in the world he means.<br />He argues that our instinctual revulsion to such processes may reflect a deeper wisdom that intellect can't articulate. But didn't we also feel revulsion to the idea of heart transplants too? Many of us feel revulsed by the very idea of surgery (going under the knife and all). Does that mean that we are expressing a 'deeper wisdom' and should not have surgury at all? I think our revulsion to biotech comes more from the thought of the unknown and our desire to hold on to the &quot;natural order of things&quot;.<br />Life, he tells us, is precious. Thus, we must be very careful with how we treat it. I agree. But why does it follow that we have to, then, leave birth up to the chance process that causes miscarriages, deformities, premature deaths, and...let's be honest...unwanted babies that may well grow up to abuse?

John Lachs is a rare breed. That is to say he is a philosopher who isn't much for the trend of current philosophy to use big words while saying nothing important. Of course, most philosophers say they are not for this, but their writing suggests their tacit endorsement of the trend. Lachs, on the other hand, is not only erudite and refreshingly enjoyable, but he also writes about real problems in the real world in real contexts. At last: a book that can keep both the philosopher and the non-philosopher fortified. <br />This book is a somewhat loose collection of essays about such topics as moral relativism (which Lachs unabashedly admits that he is for), the right to die, the myth of a unified and singular human nature, technology, and...(suprise suprise... the relevance of philosophy to life. <br />Lachs comes from a quite pragmatic tradition and while there are more index cites of Dewey, he is to my eyes more at home with James. One of the big ideas in the book, in fact, is the existence of choice inclusive facts. Take the term 'human nature' (which is said to mean one definite thing - our essence). There are seemingly infinite traits we have, but when we are deciding what is and is not human nature, we CHOOSE which traits to emphasize and which not to. What's more, it is doubtful that EVERYONE who is human has ALL of our suggested traits (and animals might even have some of them). Does that mean 'human nature' is a social construct? No. It simply means that while the laundrey list of traits we can choose from is objective and really existing, the traits we choose to recognize as part of its description is based on human convention. This is straight out of the James playbook (as James, like Lachs, was a non-essentialist who saw 'essentials' as simply those traits of a thing we pay attention to out of the many the thing has). <br />This is a big idea and thrusts much of his book. When talking of morals, one of the biggest thrust of moral objectivism has been that morals are what accord with 'human nature' (natural law). But being that our natures are plural (we vary a great deal from eachother), there can't be any 'one' human nature. When talking about the right to die, this idea also serves as a spring-board.<br />All of the essays are worth reading. Aside from the idea above there are many meaty ones in here and as the book touches so many subjects, the reader will not be bored. The only other thing I feel needs saying about Lachs is that he is simply one of the best essay writers in philosophy that I've read. From the first paragraph (which is usually some intriguing hook - the technique of a novelist) to the last sentence, these essays are quie satisfying.	2004-04-08

While I am pro-biotech, I appreciate the fact that people are allowed to read and explore a myriad of positioins before they make up their mind. What bothers me, then, is that McKibben is so intent on scaring us into submission that he is either a.) puposely exaggerating and misunderstanding his information and doesn't care, or b.)literally doesn't know 'enough' about what he's writing so as not to notice his caricatures. <br />For instance - amd most troubleing -, well over 2/3rds of his citations are gotten from newspapers, trade magazines, and (a little better but not by a lot) popular science articles. So we get treated to all the exaggerated stories about the nutty little cult-like submovements that treat biotech as an unmitigated utopia while under the impression that this is the mainstream view. Well, the New York TImes is in the business of selling newspapers and reporting stories that can help them do it. If we haven't noticed, they are much less concerned with accuracy. But McKibben's index is not only littered with these types of exaggerated stories, but virtually all are gotten from the newspapers and trade rags. Not very professional. <br />Second (and partly due to the above) Mckibben is wont to grossly overexaggerate fears of genetic determinism. IF we can select genes for success, he says, then children will be comodities!!! But in saying this, he doesn't realisze - or doesn't let on - that a.) there is no gene combo for 'success' (such a blanket phrase), b.) success involeves quite a bit of 'luck' and evironment in addition to genetic factors; c.) a genetic tweek is by no means a gaurentee of superiority in a particular area. McKibben, though, doesn't know this; my guess becasue he is quoting from trade magazines that like to write article on the &quot;gene for x&quot; in order to give us a shocking and juicy cover story. &quot;Beanbag genetics&quot; is dead an someone forgot to tell McKibbon that he is more of a gentic determinist than even most genetic determinist are. <br />Third he writes aobut his fears that biotech will 'dehumanize' us. We get this alot and McKibben swears he is not a luddite. But the argument fits the bill perfectly: Limitations are what makes us human; the better humans are made to perform, the less human they'll be. McKibben says that we should just be happy with the progress we've made so far (after all, eradication of limitions in the past was a good thing; it is only the future doings that are problematic) and cash in our chips content only with the results gotten so far. But how would getting people to live longer, be less prone to obesity, have smarter brains, have better eye-sight, and have various other talnents be immoral? The problem is that McKibben doesn't really ARUGE a point here; he just repeats his emotional appeal about the joys of human limitaitons as they are (you too can die at 70! Woohoo!) like it doesn't require any further argument. But in light of all of the things we COULD be better at with biotech's help, we really deserve an explanation of why it is moral to know that you can improve humans and NOT do it. <br />Long and short: following McKibben's title, reading this book make me say: &quot;Enough!&quot;	2004-03-18
US	37928338	R1BCGQ3S4ZS9NK	0446606251	400570522	Snow in August	Books	3	17	23	N	N	A rollercoaster of ups and downs.	&quot;Snow in August&quot; seems divided into three parts (at least to me). They are:<br />1.) First 100 pages found me wondering where it all was going and whether it was worth my time to find out. These pages are quite slow and seem to be somewhat aimless (with little hints of a coming story line here and there). <br />2.) The midsection of the book takes these bland pages and 'clicks' them into place, revealing ever-better characters and a nice forward moving tale. This is the rewarding section<br />3.) The last forty pages were filled with utter confusion about why in the world the author decided to end what was a great 'earthly' story in such an 'unearthly' way. (those that have read it know what I'm talking about). The ending was compoletely unsatisfying and left an ever-promising book (that escalates the whole way) with a sharp decline and a 'flicker' rather than a 'bang' for an ending. It is not that I wanted the book to end differently and was disappointed that it didn't. Rather it is literally like Pete Hamill stopped writing only to have a completely new writer pick it up and write the ending after the manuscript sat in a desk for 6 years. That's how drastic the change is!<br />All in all, I give it three stars because the characters and scenery are so vivid ('40's New York) and some of the moments so touching (a catholic priest helping a rabbi scrub a spray-painted swastika off his synagogue). I am rarely one who likes over-detailed descriptions of scenery or a character's inner life(don't tell me; show me) but for this book, I gladly made an exceptin as the prose is so well done and the pictures, utterly delightful. <br />But the last 40 pages - I can't emphasise this enough - were so strange as to be...well...inappropriate-feeling. I figured that maybe it was just me - maybe a religious person would've gotten more from this ending than I (as it is very religio-mystical). But all of the devout religionists I know who read this were as troubled by the ending as I was (and a few reviewers, too, from the looks of it).<br />So there you have it: a roller coaster ride of ups and downs. Get the book, don't give up before page 100 (where things really start to fly) but if you don't 'get' the ending, know that not many other people did either.	2004-03-15
US	37928338	R1T3HXMYQ0CUO6	0830819290	999464694	Reason in the Balance: The Case Against Naturalism in Science, Law & Education	Books	3	33	43	N	N	Eye opening.. but what are we watching?!	I read this about a year ago and a propos for a book of this nature, it has garnereed scowling criticism and adoring praise, but not much in between. Well, here I come to fill the dearth. <br />I am an evolutionist, but I have, like Johnson, grown tired of scientism (the belief that everything non-science is nonsense) and an over-reliance on naturalism (calling everything that is merely naturalistic a full-fledged science). On issuese related to this he stands his ground well (better than any other IDer I've read). His point is this: science and naturalism have become increasingly synonymous and we are living in an age that craves for naturalism and naturalistic explanation even at the cost of accuracy or coherence. What does this lead us to? An uber-reductinism that, as William James puts it, leaves room for nothing we can care about: those intangibles like feelings, moral thought, ideals and such. They are dismissed as frivolity and 'touchy feely'. Instead we get 'selfish genes', reduction of the mind solely to matter (even though thoughts themselves are intangible as such), and our new moral code: game theory. <br />Another area Johnson picks up on is that science is starting to pass the threshold of being contingent on experiment and sense data. Rather, disciplines like sociobiology and theoretical physics are so theory based and oriented not on matter, but models, that they are hardly 'sciences' anymore. Johnson hits that on the head too. But instead of calling them philosophy (where they may better belong, being so theory based) we call them science; not becuase they are experimental, but because they are naturalistic.<br />But here is where I part ways with him. From here he assumes that science should not 'rig the game' by only allowing naturalistic explanations. Instead (this is where he gets sneaky) we should look at supernatural causes as a possible explanation (and his favorite, Intellegent Design theory). But what Johnson fails to hit on is that even the theoretical disciplines above a.) try to explain (rather than postulate and stop there) even if it is by model rather than experiment, and b.) that the above disciplines he castigates as 'not sciences' are at very least falsifiable (sociobiology might be, for example, by the fossil record or further DNA evidence). Intellegent Design merely replaces the mystery of matter's origin with the mystery of the 'designer' it posits but does not attempt to start explaining. And it is literally unfalsifiable because it lacks content other than &quot;a designer did it&quot;.<br />From here, it goes far downhill as Johnson gets into all the supposed moral consequences of naturalism: moral relativism, nihilism, secularism in law and education, etc. He shows, though, only that these are POSSIBLE consequences of naturalism but never seems to come around to why - if one does not posit an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibonevelent creator - that one has to end up a relativist and a nihilist. In fact, he failse even to cite the most embarrasing fact to his case: most sociobiologists are as stertnly committed to fighting relativism and nihilism as he is (and sometimes, as in the case of Dawkins, more vigorously)!!<br />In conclusion, I gave the book 3 stars because despite the fact that I disagree with much in this book, the perceptions about naturalisms connection to science and vice versa are spot on, and the rest of the book is, if anything, quite learned. I think that even those into science and naturalistic philosophy should at least benefit by reading some of Johnson's adroit criticisms particularly in the first half of the book. Unfortunately, outside of those good points, there is much passionate asserting and little explaining.	2004-03-14
US	37928338	R2NMP96GF8F09E	1590170091	191183042	The Legacy of Isaiah Berlin	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A Tribute to a Great Thinker and Pluralist!	This book, which was published from a conference dedicated to discussing aspects of Berlin's emphasis on value pluralism, is divided into three sections. The first focuses on his pluralism as he saw it within history. The second takes his pluralism and speaks of it in relation to moral theory. The third discusses that pluralism as relating to the question of Israel and nationalism. Obligatory disclosure: I skipped section three as Israel is not a question that interests me, so my review is on the first two sections.<br />Now, anyone who's read Berlin knows that he is notoriously hard to pin down. He is to historical to be a philosopher yet to philosophical to be a historian. As one who wrote more historical studies than philosophical essays (in the proper sense) Berlin's thought is hard to synthesize. This book, though, does a good service by focusing on Berlin's central theme: the plurality of values and their connection to history and philosophy. See, for Berlin, no one system could account for our moral lives. Values, ends, means, these all conflict inter- and intra-personally. No system, said he, will resolve these so that they all line up and 'hang together'. Abstractions, too, like Liberty, are meaningless without a concrete context; liberty of what according to who's view? That pluralism is what this book discusses: the first part on its affect on Berlin's historical study, the second on his philosophy. <br />There is a great group of thinkers here: Mark Lilla, Michael Walzer, Ronald Dworkin, Thomas Nagel, Charles Taylor - on and on. The essays, more-or-less, form a consensus and largely find Berlin's pluralism unproblematic as far as its truth goes (the only article that takes issue is Dworkin's). Each thinker, though, has a different take on what accepting pluralism means and whether, if conflicting values is 'inevitable', how far we should go to TRY and reconcile them. That's where the fun is; in these small differences. I should mention to that each section ends with a 20-or-so page 'discussion' section that must have been transcribed during the seminar. We see a lot of good interchange here between the panelists. <br />All in all, this is a book that should not be missed by those that find value (or question) in Berlinian pluralism.	2004-03-06

In the year or so that I've been acquainted with her work, Mary Midgley has quickly become one of my favorite philosophers (outside of Karl Popper and John Dewey). This here is philosophy for the real world. <br />As such, she starts with real questions: How does morality fit into the evolutionary schema? Science's answer: game theory and self interest became self-interested cooperation. How does the mind (our first person view) fit into naturalistic accounds of the body? Science's answer: it doesn't, really. The mind is the brain and that first person 'viewpoint' is an illusion propogated by the genes. <br />If I had to give a brief summation of what Midgley does in this book, I'd say this: she takes on reductionism in all of its scientistic forms. Those who want another evolutionary psychology account of the evolution of morality will not find this book comfortable (that's why the title might be misleading). Rather Midgley comes to pluralistic conclusions that when asked to choose between moral libertarianism and reductionistic fatalism, answers: why not a little of both? Why are scientists so eager to do away with the mind as either an illusion or as merely a 'propogation center' for memes? Answer: because they want a unified physicalist view that can't tolerate anything (like the mind) that doesn't disappear into purely physical terms. But, Midgley asks, does that erase the fact that the mind, despite all the 'explaining away' is still there? <br />Anyhow, another way this book's title may be misleading is that Midgley's concern lies mostly with the issue of how free our moral agency is. Thus if the reader is looking for a book to answer specific moral questions like: Why do we share? Why do we like doing things for others? Why do we fight? and such, the reader won't find that here. Teh essential questions are: How can we give a non-reductionistic account of the mind in a physical world? and How can any form of freedom be compatible with a world of determinism.<br />Enjoy.	2004-03-04

I am currently finishing my masters degree and am researching doctoral degress. Unfortunately, I not only enjoyed this book, but recognized many things in it as so true that they were funny (and sad).<br />Point: Universities are much less concerned with teaching students as they are with plumping out research that is trivial, abstruse, and to all but maybe 10 peers who will read the resulting article, irrelevent (and those ten are reading it to cite it in the next essay). Point: The humanities have done away with virtually all standards, are interested in theory that poorly reflects the real world, and consist mostly of 'guts' courses that are called that because they are so easy one can pass the tests on gut instincts. Point: tenure is partially destroying education. Once designed as a bastion of academic freedom, now it serves to insulate already detached professors even more from the real world, and destroy any notion of accountability.<br />Here's the books downfall: it is so eager to point out these things (even though the book is for the most part right on) that it ends up sounding paranoid and overly combative. Every example of a poor professor is accompanied by an adjective like &quot;assinine&quot; or &quot;abysmal&quot;. There was even one section where the author points out that &quot;one study says...&quot; in order to show how bad social science education is. I was left wondering....what the other studies said. In other words, the book leaves us with a feeling that while largely correct, the author may have been a.) selective and b.) a little overeager to rip on all things academic for the meer sake the it feels good.<br />But the main messages is that education is overpriced while quality declines. The proffesoriate cares infinitely more about themselves (and their obscure research) then their students. Graduate students do the teaching while professors 'play at' writing important things. This is all, unfortunately, true. But I do want to write that while the author is quite pessimistic, I am not. I am currently finishing graduate work at a small liberal arts college in Richmond, VA (if you'd like you can figure out which one as there is only one). There, the teachers teach, there is no such thing as a teachers assistant, class comes before research, and classes are small enough where students even have the teachers home phone. Anyone contemplating colleges I urge you to read this book and consider the smaller liberal arts schools (and the one I'm at is top notch).<br />Good book!	2004-03-04
US	37928338	R1HIFT8EXTHIZS	0060936649	302174200	Wittgenstein's Poker: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Much Ado About...Well... You know!	When I started reading this, I knew quite a bit about Popper and little about Wittgenstien. I guess that makes me a symbol. See, if one is a Popperian, one learns quickly to dislike Wittgenstin and if one is Wittgensteinian, one practically ignores Popper. Further than that, I notice that if one is to pick up a philosophy text, one will almost always come across Wittgenstein in the index; never Popper. Pick up a science text? Popper is likely mentioned and Wittgenstein skipped.<br />All of this is to say that this book touches on one of the livest debates in philosophy. The authors use as their 'centerpiece' a fiery metting between Popper and Wittgenstein at an informal 'philosophy group' meeting at Cambridge. Popper was the guest speaker and Wittgenstien, the home-turf professor. No one really knows quite what happened (except that a disturnbed Wittgenstein was waving a fire-poker around). That is the stated goal of this book. Through detective work, the authors plan on finding out what happened. <br />But the problem is that they never really get around to doing that. They go through Popper and Wittgenstein's childhoods, early careers, and little tid-bits about their tempermants, and even a little (and we are talking 'above surface level' here!) about their philosophic disagreements. All of this makes for interesting reading and I confess that I had trouble putting the book down through quite a bit of it.<br />So what is the problem? Well there are two: First, after the said 250 page detour, the authors come back and give about 25 pages attention to the one-night debate in Cambridge. The reader is left scratching her head and wondering, &quot;Why did we go through all that fo so little tie-in?&quot; Of course, the answer is: &quot;Because then, you would not have had enough pages for a book&quot; But that hardly seems like good enough reason to me.<br />The second problem relates to the first. After going through too much background info on the two philosophers and having been given little reason to actually care about how it is relevent to the Cambridge meeting (the authors seemingly just assume the reader will care on her own accord) the last 50 pages ad absolutely nothing! C'mon, we were prepped by 250 pages only for the authors to say, &quot;Well, we don't really know what happened during the Cambridge meeting and probably never will.&quot; After a book whose first pages read like a detective novel meticulously setting the scene of the debate and promising us some detective work, we end with a shrug of the shoulders and virtually no investigation? <br />Well, at least the book was entertainin...that is...to someone like myself: a philosophy student passionate about Popper and already curious about the Cambridge incident! The writing is good, the detail about the thinkers lives and idiosyncracies (boy did P and W ever have those!) were intruiging and interesting. But if you are something of a beginner and have no prior interest in Popper, Wittgenstein or getting to the bottom of the Cambridge incident, I fear that you will come away with little. As the authors base so much (the full bios of Popper and Wittgesntien) on so little (a ten-minute argument at Cambridge), you will probably feel there is &quot;much ado about nothing&quot;.	2004-02-29

I didn't know what to expect - a graduate student assigned to read a page-turner crime novel for a graduate seminar. All in all, I tend not to like Dershowitz, but I will hand it to him on this one; all things considered, he has written a good and somewhat haunting book. I'm sure the questions it raises will be with me for a long time. <br />The scene is this: Max Menuchen is a holocaust survivor living in Cambridge, MA who discovers that the Nazi who murdered his family (by a fluke, he alone survived) is living not too far away. The pain and anguish of knowing this (and of even worse information uncovered in private research) is unbearable. Max decides to torture his killer and drive him to suicide. Is it murder? If it is murder, is it justified? Is it just revenge? <br />The theme is explored decently and though the dialogue is stiff and the plot (particularly in the details) feels somewhat contrived, Dershowitz knows how to exploit this challenging and dark theme for all it is worth. As some reviewers have noted the characters are a bit stale, but I suppose if one is readin a Dershowitz crime novel for character depth, then one needs to evaluate their lease on life (though I grant that Dershowitz's habit of making every character, including side-characters, a lawyer, is a bit frustrating). <br />On a sidenote, some of the less favorable reviews accuse Dershowitz of 'justifying' the main character's actions of revenge and torture. First, I must have read the wrong book as Dershowitz's ending is far from clear on that point (the last section is even entitled 'Justice?' with a question mark). Second, I thought Dershowitz did a decent job portraying many sides and opinions (as Dershowitz does in real life). Simply because he writes what some may feel are convincing argument supporting the main character doesn't mean that he is offering carte blache justification. Third, Dershowitz's goal in this book, I feel, is to make us think and one great way to do that is to getus fired up. Those that accuse Dershowitz of 'taking the wrong side' are fired up and, thus, thinking. <br />So as not to ramble on that point, I give the book 3 stars because while I thought the theme and idea development was pretty good, there are many areas where the book felt a bit too contrived and/or superficial.	2004-02-23

It is very rare that I will write more than one review for a book. I wrote one for \\"Vision of the Annointed\\" a few years ago, and is by now burried in the heap of 5 star reviews below. In it, I praised Sowell for walking us through some of the rhetorical tricks used predominantly by the left wing (though since reading the book, I've become sensitive to the 'right' using similar arguments). I stand by that review. So why am I writing a new one?    I've recently picked up the book again after 2 or so years and have read through some - not all - of the chapters again and...it really hit me. The most important thing about this book is not simply the 'expose of the left'; rather, the predominant message seems to be about how the left (and I would argue, the right) ignore why 'tradeoffs' have to be made.     To put it more philosophically, the politicians dream is the policy that has no downsides. Sowell realizes that in a nation of many millions, every policy has negatives and that politicians should, instead of being focused on perfection, should be focused on taking the most gain for the least loss. This, Sowell says, is capitalism and markets. Yes, there are some losers. But there will be more winners and less losers through markets than there will through a regulatory state.     Now, let's put Sowells argument into modern context (the issue that made me pick the book up again). Lately, companies have been moving overseas and this, says the dems (and to a lesser degree the reps) is a problem. The solution being proposed? Let's pass laws to keep them here. The problem with that is that it ignores the real problem (by refusing to look at tradeoffs). The real reason companies have been moving is that they are so regulated both in what they can produce and how much it costs to hire workers (what, with minimum wages, increased benefits and such). Liteally, any company that didn't go overseas where they can produce cheaper goods with more freedom would be a fool. So there you have a Sowellian dilemma: either we can keep wages extraordinately high and regulations tight, while accepting the fact that companies are going to move in revolt, or we keep more companies here by accepting a bit of deregulation and decrease in payroll expenditure. WE CAN'T HAVE BOTH even though BOTH parties are trying to deny economic fact in favor of utopianism by telling us that we can. (This, of course, is not an example Sowell gives in his book, but the idea is there throughout the chapters, the one on how Nader hurts consumers being one of the best).      My point in this is simply to give a taste of what Sowell's big point is (one that I think has been lost in the excitement of bashing lefties). My first review also failed to pick it out through the excitement but the more I think about what is wrong with much policy today, the more I'm convinced that Sowell pegged it here: good gains require a willingness to take small losses.	2004-02-22

LIke many, I picked this book up from an interest in anthropology. Like most of those same people, when I finished it, it felt as if i'd ended a great novel. To be completely honest, there are a severely limited number of times I (a twenty-six year old male graduate student in politics) have read a book only to have tears roll down my cheeks. Seriously, this is a glorious story as well as a fascinating anthropological commentary.<br />Here's the context: Ken Good was a graduate student under Napoleon Chagnon who was one of the first to do work with the Yanomamo indians. Chagnon wanted Good to do some research (field work) that might help supplement Chagnon's thesis that that Yanomamo are violent more by nature than culture. No matter the reasons, Good ends up not only abandoning Chagnon and his research, but finds the Yanomamo significantly less violent (by nature or culture) than Chagnon did. This may, in part, have been due to the fact that where Chagnon always remained the detached observer (his book is full of graphs, charts, and statistics), Good's got very personal (no stats here, for better or worse). <br />...Which brings us to the next layer of the story. Beyond being an anthropological perspective on the Yanomama, it is a fantastic - FANTASTIC! - love story. After a few years of living in the Yanomama community, good was offered a wife according to tradition. It took him a while to warm to it (and her even longer, given that he had strange habits like writing in notebooks and wearing 'foot coverings' Who would do such things?!). Their love blossomed, though, and the second half of the book is much about a host of difficulties: his struggle to 'hold on to her' when obligation took him out of the village for months at a time, the struggle to get a legal marriage to a woman who has no birth records, and later, how to get her out of the village with him. <br />The only problem i had with the book has less to do with the book and more with its circumstances. Good comments that Chagnon, in painting the Yanomama to be 'fierce people' overexaggerated (rather than fabricated) their ferocity. My guess, after reading both books, is that Good did the same thing by possibly underexaggerating. Good, for instance, will speak of some of the heinous things that Yanomama do, speak of it as a ancillary side-note, and wrap it up in two sentences, only returning to the topic chapters down the road. Truth be told, I think the truth lies betwixt Chagnon's and Good's accounts and I can't fault either book, but when one reads the two together, one gets the impression that BOTH authors completely missed (or ignored) things that the other got. How else could such different accounts come to pass? <br />For all that I strongly recommend this read both for education in anthropology and as one of the best love stories around.	2004-02-21

As noted by many who knew or were influenced by Gellner, he was a dying breed: a polymath who was equally adept at philosophy, sociology, antrhopology, and politics. That ability, always noticeable in these essays, is what makes this book so different from like books on the subject.<br />This is needed because the subject - the problem of relativism in the social sciences - has become such a commonplace one, that one could easily fill a Barnes and Noble with titles adressing it. For all that, one would be hardpressed to count one one hand the books that actually contributed anything useful to the discussion rather than just rehashing the problem while pretending to have original thoughts on it. <br />I ramble on that for a reason. Gellner's is precisely one of those books that would be counted on that hand. The reason is that he is both a philosopher and an anthropoligist (as most writers in the one discipline ignore the methods of the other). Gellner's philosophic side wants to gravitate towards human universals and in this he resembles Kant and the Enlightenment. His anthropologist side, though, wants to gravitate towards the differences, and in this he takes after Herder and the Romantics.<br />As those who have read Gellner before know, he sides more-or-less with the Englightenment on this one (never all the way). As a brief synopsis, the first and fourth essay defend positivism and argue that the scientific process not only applies to the 'social sciences' but is the best way for them to operate. The second and (my favorite) third essay, deal with the problem of human universals in a world of seemingly different areas, approaches, cultures and...dare we say it...natures. The fifth, sixth and seventh essay (more antrhopologic theory and less philosophy) deal with and demolish 'structuralism' and 'hermeneutic' approaches to antrhopology with the lattter taking direct aim at Wittgenstien's 'community' theory of language. <br />While this collection is short (at 187 pages) the insights are fantasitc and as mentioned above, blend the theoretic prowess of the philosopher with the empirical traditon of the antrhopologist. On a personal note, as a longtime fan of Karl Popper, I found Gellners extended critique (first essay) of Popper most useful. Long and short: this book is worth the time, effort, and money.	2004-02-18

As E.O Wilson notes in his blurb for the back cover of this book, it is amazing how few philosophers are really willing to pay attention to and write about genetic engineering. Especially in light of Stock's thesis: Genetic engineering, like it or not, is comming, ready or not. <br />Honestly, I thought that Stock's book would be one of the few to really provide moral arguments for genetic engineering, particularly 'extratherapeutic' engineering. While there is a little of that, the book devotes much more time to exploring the inefficacy (in a utilitarian sense) of government regulations and bans on therapy. In that sense, his book is not quite a moral response to ethical luddites like Kass and McKibben, but governmental luddites like Fukuyama.<br />Without spoiling the book for you, I will summarize some of his reasons (so you get the flavor: 1.) like abortion, there is simply too much demand for such therapies (and those that don't believe this should look at how much we spend on 'anti-aging' pills and surgeries). Thus, there is too much incentive for consumers to form black markets should bans be in place. 2.) Due to the plurality of world politics, such bans are, at best, regional. While Germany might ban research, China surely will not. 3.) Like abortion and drugs, black markets will be more dangerous that publically visible and monitorible legal ones. 4.) Bans or strict controls are going to cost astronomical amounts of money (and privacy) to prevent and catch law-breakers. <br />There. I've only given you a taste, and if any of those arguments sound frail, read the book. The elaborations are first rate! This brings me to two small complaints. <br />First, Stock tends to get ahead of himself in that the first half of the book is filled with sweeping proclomations like, &quot;In the future we might be able to do x. Even though most scientists don't believe me on the feasibility on x, I really do think it could happen.&quot; In other words, he makes strangely radical predictions, reminds you that they are stragely radical predictions and simply defends them by saing that anything is possible. <br />Second, Stock will occasionally come off as a will-o-the-wisp cheerleader. Particularly when he addresses concerns about the efficacy of unregulated markets, Stock simply tells us that we need not worry and that markets have taken care of themselves in the past, therefore they will work in the present. While I believe him (being the libertarian that I am), too many people i know share a scepticism of the market for Stock to dismiss the argument so curtly (assuming he wants to convince anyone). Other examples of this will-o-the-wisp style are in the book (though not enough to get annoying). <br />To conclude, as this book has much more to do with cost/benefit analysis of regulation (that more or less winds up in favor of free markets) rather than ethical philosophy, the book will be much more interesting to political thinkers than bioethicists or philosophers. In fact, I would suggest reading this book and Fukuyama's &quot;Our Posthuman Future&quot; together as they take the same questions (where to regulate biotech) and come to different conclusions.	2004-02-14

After reading this book and seeing the author lecture on C-SPAN, I can honestly say that I am embarassed to be pursuing a PhD with hopes of becoming an academic. White is the caricature of an academic: pompous, arrogant, incessantly dogmatic and intolerant of those who aren't academics, and even pushy. Will I ever be like that? I hope not. <br />What I thought I'd get is a treatment on how, say, public discouse has degenerated so as of late and what we might be able to do to rectify it. What I got instead was Mr. White telling us how it is a shame that more people don't think like he does, how everything that is commercial is worthless, and hiow the world would be much better if everyone was Noam Chomsky.<br />In other words, this book is completely mislabeled. Rather than having a subtitle of &quot;why americans don't think for themselves&quot;, it should read: &quot;why americans should think like Curtis White.&quot; In fact, Mr. White ends up caricaturizing his own position somewhat by setting such a slanted agenda towards the anti-corporate left, that I came away from the book (as I'm sure others did) thinking: &quot;I'd rather see a 'dumbed down' america than subscribe to the utopian mind-control that Mr. White is sneaking in through the back-door.&quot; In other words, his position - that americans don't think for themselves - is undercut by the realization that Mr. Curtis wants to literally tell us what to think, buy, read, listen to, and want. (I'm not exaggerating. He is really that bad!)<br />Don't buy the book; I'll sum it up: Don't shop at wal-mart, even though they have good prices and merchandise. Don't watch TV, because despite the fact that it is entertaining, it is not deep. Instead, read poetry or philosophy (but only by leftists). Don't buy anything from a company that owns more than 2 stores. Oh...and...don't question why you are doing all of this. Only then, will your life be truly free.<br />This book is awful.	2004-02-10

In some ways, it is a novel; in some ways a philosophical treatise; in some ways, a 'travelogue'. It works well as all three, to tell the truth. <br />Montesquieu - who later wrote 'Spirit of the Laws&quot; - published this collection of fictional letters between two Persian brothers roaming Europe, anonymously. And, yes, the book did cause a decent amount of controversey as M was denounced as an unbeliever. To be sure, this book is some of the most thrilling satire on Western European ideosyncracies I've ever seen and, to be fair, christianity - religion in general - is not exempt from M's jibes. <br />While the novel can be read as quasi-fiction, there is no story line between the letters (161 letters and 6 unpublished fragments in all). Each letter, is more like a condensed essay reflecting on some subject - the nature of governments, some religious tradition, a behavioral trait of a certain people; there are even some letters thrown in from the brothers relatives, wives, and eunuchs pertaining to the goings on in Persia. Truth be told, one could read these letters in a random order and be fine (with exception of a few necessarily linear 'chunks').<br />All in all, the 'theme' is the quest for universals, as these Persian brothers are seeing the Western world through Persian eyes (hence the ability for satire on Western traditions). While I'm not sure there is an answer made to this question (as Montesquieu is always talking through his characters which may be right or wrong), it is an entertaining effort, and a brilliant encapsulation of some enlightenment ideas, particularly on religion and government. Even his later &quot;Spirit of the Laws&quot; is prefigured here.	2004-02-10

It is so rare to finish a book in just a few sittings simmply by lack of will-power to tear yourself away from it. Rare still is it to find a non-fictional book having that effect. Buy this one. If you like that feeling of not being able to resist reading &quot;just 10 more pages&quot; and having it turn into 50, you won't regret this book. <br />In brief, it is about a hyphenated man - born in Afghanistan by an american mother (the first american mother ever to live in Afhanistan) and an Afghani father. By high-school, he has moved to America and 'loses track' of his Afghani roots - truly Americanized. The real 'blow by blow' of the book comes from a trip he took as a freelance journalist back to Afghanistan to write about it before/during the cold war, and his subsequent return to America, ending with his torn feelings over Sept. 11. <br />The beauty of this book is that he remains sympathetic both to his Afhghani and American sentiments. While recognizing the hell that the middle east can often seem, he never fails to recall his fond memories of growing up Afghani. At the same time, he dances close to the conclusion that he is, for any intent or purpose, an American first and an Afghani second (without ever really imposing that choice upon himself). <br />As the other reviewers will tell you, the sparkle that is this book came about after the world trade center bombings. The author, who writes educational childrens books for a living, decided to write an e-mail on Sept. 12 to 'set the record straight' seperating the Afghani fact from the Taliban fiction. Subsequently, the e-mail, which he mailed to 20 or so people, got forwarded enough times that it reached possibly 1,000. The e-mail (and you may have gotten it) is included as an epilogue, and he explains his feelings on the 'middle east question' in the prologue and last chapter of the book.'<br />Like I said, though, the action is in the middle of the book, where he recounts his catastrophic trip to the middle east (where, among other things, they don't take American Express. Just read it and you'll understand!) From first page to last, this book will entertain, enrage, entrhall, and...dare I say...enhance you!	2004-02-09

I've just about comlpleted my graduate study, and being the smart fellow that I am, am past the point of elevating the founders (or anyone else for that matter)to demagogue status. Still, Jefferson is certainly one of the most brilliant people who'se ever put pen to parchment, and this book will show you why. <br />Broken into sections on such topics as the Virginia constitution, the US constitution, religious liberty, and slavery, this edition assembles Jefferson's personal letters, bills in the virginia legislature, excerpts from his autobiography and even presidential addresses. Put together, they give us a great chunk of Jeffersonaian thought (libertarianism, anti-federalism, republicanism) and even insights into his personal life (yes, &quot;dialogue between the head and the heart&quot; is here; Peronally, I like reading that one aloud). <br />The only criticisms I have are that the editing could've used a little alacrity. In that most of the items herein are personal letters which refer to specific historical events, persons, and goings on, the editors lack of introductory paragraphs, guiding footnotes, or references is a glaring omission. Now, I've studied most of the events and had only marginal trouble filling in details, but I pity she who has not read Jefferson before trying to make sense of the contexts without which the letters lose at least a bit of importance. Long and short: if you're familiar with Jefferson in detail, this is a great read. If not, read a good biography first. <br />(Before I go, I should point out that for those used to the dry style of Jefferson's autobiography and &quot;Notes on Virginia&quot;, his letters are so much more pleasent to read. He is terse, vivacious, and quite informal, by contrast. Don't let memories of late night slogs through &quot;Notes on Virginia&quot; dissuade you from this collection.)<br />What are you standing there for?

Out of America is a black man's journey back to Africa as a newspaper reporter. Within the book, a myiad of political and social issues are delved into and the answers - not THE answers, to be sure, but answers as good as any other - are disturbing. <br />While Mr. Richburgh makes clear towards the beginning of the book that he never felt his 'blackness' was his defining characteristic, his journey in the book sours him on Africa and wipes many preconceptions out of the window. Before anyone can help Africa, he concludes, Africans need to help Africa. The descriptions of tribalism, dictatorship, factionization, and senseless murder seemingly as a way of life, are disturbing and graphic. Richburgh pulls no puches. The irony is that in the process of reading a book where the author ultimately concludes that Africa may be less 'salvagable' than we thought, it is obvious that he is not callous about this judgment, that he remains all-the-while sympathetic, and that this conclusion is one of the hardest ones the author has ever had to make (he tells us THAT much).<br />Many who've read Out of America denounce Richburg as an out-and-out &quot;uncle Tom&quot;. He is a black man who realizes that he is an &quot;american&quot; before he's an &quot;african-american&quot; (as if I'm 'european-american' instead of just plain 'white'). The irony is that those who are shocked that Richburg, a black man, would DARE criticize Africa seems to prove RIchburgs ancillary point. Black leaders, intellectuals, and arm-chair diplomats have pussyfooted around Africa, ignoring abuses of 'human rights', ignoring the deadly tribalism and murder, so as to keep the image of &quot;Africa - the glorious motherland&quot; alive. We may, of course, criticize Europe (&quot;the hegemonic western world&quot;) but dare we ever criticize atrocities in Zaire?! How dare we! So it is ironic that the authors point - that we must be realistic instead of untopion when dealing with Africa - is played into perfectly by those so willing to call Richburg an 'uncle tom&quot; or a 'sellout'. <br />So as not to rant anymore, this book is somewhere between a personal biography, a corageous political statement, and an insider glimpse at the sheer hell international journalists go through to get the story and the shot. Don't miss it.	2004-02-09

I'm torn between the naysayers and the wide-eyed on this one. First, I am a naturalist who believes, like Shermer, that ethics doesn't need god. Unlike Shermer, though, I don't think that this is anything close to a 'science'. Seeing people conflate 'it's a naturalistic explanation' with 'its a scientific explanation' forgets that science is a process, not an ideology. Yes, Shermer gives us a naturalistic explanation, but just like most evolutionary psych, it is simply naturalistic \\"puzzle filling\\" of what MIGHT have happened, not experimental and falsifiable conjecture that makes for science. <br />For his part, Shermer does a decent job (so long as we see his as that of a philosopher, not a scientist; Shermer, I think, would protest this). He presents a case for a naturalistic ethic and goes into a fair amount of detail. <br />Here's the problem: not only has everything here been proposed before by those more apt than Shermer (Mary Midgley, JL Mackie, Steven Pinker, William James) but the things he says here are quite common, and really in need of little defence. <br />Shermer's point is that moral 'rules' are naturally endowed by evolution (or so it seems) and are provisoinal - they hold for most people, in most situations; they are more like guilelines for action. Okay, I believe it (just as I believed it when the said authors wrote it). But he really doesn't follow this up with what exactly that means. What are 'most people' and what are 'most situations'? Most troublingly, does merely saying 'evolution did it' and showing that homo erectus shared food (thus enforcing altruism by pasing along their genes) really mean that the theory is 'scientific' (even though it is non-emprical albeit good conjecture?)<br />I am giving the book a three-star rating, though. Truth be told, I enjoyed it and think its judgments (although better defended, say, by Mackie) are sound (and easier to read than Mackie). Particularly if you are into biology and haven't really done much thinking in philosophy, this book is great! Shermer is an entertaining, and widely learned writer (even though I disagree with some details about, say, group selections power to explain). <br />If a more detailed, less lay-like book is what you are looking for, I'd suggest: Mackie's \\"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong\\", Midgley's \\"Beast and Man\\", and even Paul Ehrlich's \\"Human Natures\\". <br />If you've read and liked this book, read Ridley's \\"Origins of Virtue\\" and Flanagan's \\"Problem of the Soul\\".	2004-02-09

Mary Midgley has written an important book that, in true Midgley fashioin, straddles the middle ground between deference to science and its efficacy, and a critical eye of some goings on in the scientific community.<br />This book is about 'mtyhs' and their importance in science. Unfortunately, 'myth' might not have been the best word to describe Midgley's enterprise. In this book, she is NOT, a.) saying that science is a myth (that it is not trute), b.) using 'myth' to mean 'fairy tale', or c.) going on a fashionable post-modern lit-crit 'exploration' exploring the history of mythology as it relates to science. YEEEECCHHH!<br />Mary Midgley is much too smart for that. Rather, 'the myths we live by' are those metaphysical concepts that bleed into science now and again, masquerading as part of testable science: concepts like the gene as selfish replicator, materialism that would reduce mind to matter, the AI view that humans are smart machines, etc. Not that these concepts can't be valueable at times, but concepts like these are philosophical assumptions, not not testable fact.<br />To give an example of Midgley's intent here, my favorite section is that on the bran/mind conundrum that scientists are itching to resolve by pretending the mind  doesn't exist. Midgley (and this reviewer) both have confidence that the mind is caused by the brain and that dualism is not tenable. But here's the problem. &quot;Explainling&quot; the mind by neurons and synapses IGNORES the emprically obvious: I can see neurons in brains, but can't 'feel' them in my mind. The brain and mind 'feel' of different qualities, and any explanation of the former doesn't necessarilty 'explain' the latter.<br /> Other theorists like Dennett, say that the first person is an 'illusion' put forth by our genes to aid survival. If so, then it is not an illusion anyone (including Dennett) can 'stand back from' long enough to check whether it IS ACTUALLY an illusion (as one pulls stick that looks bent out of the water to find a straight stick). Others like Blackmore posit memes - units of culture (whatever such units consist of) that infest our minds while we are just passive vessels, waiting for memes to duke it out and replicate. Midgley responds with the obvious: if we are asked to believe that, then isn't it WE who are asked to believe that, and doesn't that in turn create a dilemma? If we are asked to believe that we aren't willfully in control of our minds (but the memes are), then how is it that we could willfully believe that at all? All of this is attempts by scientists to push explanatory theories farther than they seem to be able to go. IF materialism works on a physical level, then we must force it to explain mind. Midgley's answer? The mind seems to resist phsysical explanation in that way. What explains one thing brilliantly, may be clumsey when applied to another.<br />That was just my favorite example; there are many more. The point she is trying to make is that while 'myhts' are essential to science (mtetaphysics can not truly be seperated from it), we must watch how we use it. In the tradition of William James, Midgley warns that the world is quite pluralistic in its qualities and we may just need a pluralistic approach to dealing with it. Grand unified theories? Don't be so sure. Universal acids? Probably not. Ultra-reductionism? No matter how much we can reduce, there will always be whole organisms that need explaining just as much.<br />The only complalints I have are these: first, as a long time Midgley fan, I feel that she is, in some ways, writing the same book over and over again. This tends to happen to philosophers that say really original or contreversial things, as thhey keep having to re-explain themselves. If you've not read Midgley before, or not much of her, I wouldn't worry about this. If you have, read it but you might end up skimming some sections.<br />The second complaint is simply that as this book is ony 170-some pages, and she covers so many areas (myths), she doesn't really go into any in as much detail as I wanted to see. Otherwise, no complaints.she covers so many areas (myths), she doesn't really go into any in as much detail as I wanted to see. Otherwise, no complaints.	2004-01-25

Sidney Hook was the epitome of what I feel a philosopher should be. He spoke to real issues that affected real people in real ways. Also, he was not a partisan to ideology. Like Hannah Arendt and his mentor John Dewey, Hook came to conclusions after thinking them out, often shokcing people who expected him to come to conclusions along a 'party line'. Even today, nobody knows where to put him: was he a neoconservative or a socialist. Well...Hook was neither.<br />Enough about the man for now. This is a book of essays spanning from the 50's to the late 70's. The subjects, of course, sre those areas where philosophy and public policy mix, though far from being abstract and obtuse (as most attempts at political philosophy end up) Hook is always speaking to concrete concerns and to actual people.<br />The first section deals with the general relationship between political areas and philosophy (specifically, ethics). The second section is on issues of rights. The third explores different &quot;heroes&quot; and particularly &quot;anti-heroes&quot; in history: Bertrand Russell (anti-hero), John Dewey (hero), Alger Hiss (anti-hero), etc. (That section is great fun!). The fourth section is on religion and culture and by in large contains a thrilling exchange between secular democrat Hook and Christian socialist Jacques Maritain. Wheewww, do sparks ever fly!<br />My favorite essays are: &quot;Philosophy and Public Policy&quot; which discusses the philosopher's proper role in public policy - anylizing practice, not creating bizarre theories (if only Rawls had read this). Next, there is &quot;Reflection's on Human Rights&quot; which has become one of Hook's most contreversial essays as Hook believed that rights are not natural, but are ethical conventions that never existed in a 'state of nature' (and why would they have?). In the third section, there is &quot;The Relevance of John Dewey's Thought&quot;, which explores Dewey's non-theory theory of government: that is, that one should not look for all-encompassing theories resting on some bedrock first principles in order to deal with the here-and-now of political life. As commonplace as that sounds, most philosophers still have yet to grasp that simple concept. Last there is &quot;A Talk with Vanoba Bhabe&quot;, which is Hook's talk with an indian pacifist in the tradition of Ghandi. Hook, consistent with his Deweyan pragmatism, comes to the conclusion that pacifism tends to lose touch with reality and the hard choices it demands. For my money, I agree.<br />Not to say that there are only three essays that grabbed me; they all did. Rather, I am going to stop here at the risk of boring the reader; really I could go on and on. While some of the essays speak of events that are now dated (and before my '77 birth), these are still must read essays for anyone into public policy. Wow! Philosophy can actually be important (someone should've told the academy this)!	2004-01-24

Andy Clark has a bold - no, a really bold - thesis: our minds and our selves are not limited to our 'biological skin bag' called the brain or even our biological selves. We, in reality, are cyborgs in the sense that we are merging with a world of technology so much that where 'it' begins and 'we' end is becoming a fuzzy line - a line that we might be best to dispense with altogether. Quite literally, our brains can be called only part of our mind. <br />Curious yet? I know I was. So, here is my experience with the book: I read it, raised my eyebrows quite a bit (and mumbled some under-my-breath &quot;Wow&quot;s) and remained unconvinced that we are LITERALLY cyborges in the sense that Clark has in mind. Whatt I did come away with (the reason for the 4 stars) is a new lens with which to view the world. Every time I see someone talking on their cell-phone, saving data to their hard-drive for retrieval later on, or even driving their cars, I will now be asking questions like, &quot;How much can this piece of technology be said to add to her nature?&quot;<br />Still sounds weird? Clark's method of argument is to argue that the brain - what we sometimes call the seat of the self - is suprisingly malleable and accomodating to outside influences. Even our own image of what is and is not 'part of ourselves' is radically flacid. His case is suprisingly powerful. For an appetite whetter, though, just think of yousrelf driving a car. When you are driving, you usually do not think about driving as such: &quot;I need to turn left, and to do that, I move my steering wheel left which moves this external car, with me in it, left.&quot; You almost feel like the car and the steering wheel is an extension of you in that controlling the car becomes 'second-nature' - turning left becomes as natural [check the metaphor] as moving your left arm. <br />From here, Clark talks about how it is human nature, seemingly, to use tools to aid us: from pen and pencil to store thoughts, to wristwatches helping us coordiante time, to the internet allowing us to communicate farther and farther distances - that's just what we do; adding that the 'we' in that sentence is no longer simply biology, but actually includes the technologies that we use. <br />All this, to me, was convincing in the sense that there is much more continuity between our brains and technologies than we usually realize, and that they do help change our natures. But, it does not follow that because the self is a concept that easily adapts to technology (that is becoming constantly smaller, more invisible, and human friendly) that this means literally that we now have 'cyborg' natures: that we are not still biologal selves with ever-increasing relationships with technology. If Clark used the phrase 'our cyborg natures' metaphorically  maybe I could go along (and as convincing as the book is, probably would have). But he means it literally, and he is not as convincing as he needs to be. <br />Buy and read the book though. Lilke me, you may remain unconvinced by his larger point but you might well be swayed by some of his smaller points. Really learning to appreciate how integral a part of our goals, natures, and every-day lives technology is, is an exciting thing. Postulating how technology could change us in the future and even eradicate or alleviate many of our limitations is not something to be feared or scoffed at, but to be embraced.	2004-01-15

It has been about three months since I've read this book and I am still calling it to mind on a regular basis. Like some reviewers below, I give this book a high rating while admitting that Fish's views are unpalatable, infuriating, and troubling, as often as not.<br />Fish's central thesis here is that there are no such things as neutral principles - those completely objective, a priori dicta, formula, and abstract ideas to base our 'neutral' theories on. From my experience with this book (and I think you will have the same experience), not only was Fish saying something quite differnt (less radical?!) than what his critics pretend he was saying, but I found myself in more agreement with Fish than I thought I would (or wanted to be!). <br />To make it brief: Fish is saying that whereas intellectuals like to think that we derive theories from neutral principles (&quot;We value freedom, liberty and individual autonomy; therefore we shall create a policy of free-markets.&quot;), it is usually the opposite that takes place: we figure out what our ideology is and THEN we quest for the 'neutral principles' that will justify it. (&quot;I believe in the free-market; the free-market emphasises liberty, freedom, and individual autonomy, so I will use those to justify my preferences.&quot;) More directly, the neutral principles, Fish writes, are not _a priori_ but _a posteriori_. Actually his most revealing example (towards the end of the book, as I recall) was that of christians struggling to 'justify' creation science by using, of all things, the postmodern criticism that science (or evolution, at least) is simply ideology masked as empiricism. These christian thinkers even CITE POSTMODERN THEORIESTS AS AUTHORITIES. This is fishy (excuse the pun) becuase, as Fish writes, there is no way these christian thinkers would have aligned themselves with the post-modern argument (that they usually criticize) unless they found the argument, not true, but useful. That is, whereas christians might believe in objectivity of facts as a general principle, they don't really mean that. They'll gladly switch to the postmodern 'relativist' argument if it suits their needs. <br />He's not ONLY bashing the christins or the right wing in this book (his criticism is dispersed over all ideology). Rather, through 'deconstruction', he is trying to show that ALL general principles are constructed in the service of conclusions ALREADY REACHED. I do not take it that far as I think that in science and law, for instance, where the rules are already somewhat 'set', one can reach conclusions not ideological by nature, therefore I found myself disagreeing with Fish's assessment of the first amendment as ideologically laden. <br />Still, I found the book a warm antidote to some of the problems in this petty world I sometimes call crackademia. Particularly, I can vividly recall not being able to control my laughter (signifying agreement with Fish) in, of all places, my university library, during a chapter where Fish criticizes academic philosophers. Philosophers, he says, think that in order for morality, epistemology, of what have us, to work, there needs to be a coherent, internally consistent system or theory (and it is the philosophers job to argue for one). Therefore, moral philosophers are baffled because morality (as it is in the real world) doesn't seem to follow one system, any system. The philosopher wants a sound argument for a cogent system, looking at human action as somehow extracted from this system. The philosopehr wants first principles (without those, we can't act). Fish's response? &quot;Open your eyes, look at the world, and realize, dear philosopher, that people survive without your philosophic systems and first principles.&quot; The philosophers job, then, is not to concoct general principles or argue for systems that nobody will use anyway, but to actually look at behavior, action, and things as they are in the real world, not the fake one philosophers gleefully construct for themselves. The chapter is the last one called &quot;On Truth and Toilets&quot; and is alone worth the price of the book!<br />To end, while I do not agree with Fish's ideas as applied as extremely as he applies them, I think there is much more truth to what Fish says than critics let on. Fish does not say that judgment is impossible; he only says that neutral judgment (an oxymoron) is impossible. We judge from where we are; our first person subjective viewpoint. Nor is Fish a nihilist. If the world is not objective, FIsh is not saying it is nihililstic, but _intersubjective_. Basically, may the best first-person argument win. Whether Fish seems like your cup of tea or makes your stomach churn, you will not come away from this book unchanged or unscathed.	2004-01-13

I guess someone has to play the job of the paranoid futurist and Fukuyama has done a great job of it in the past. Here, he is no better. His aim: the biotech industry. His worry: biotech threatens human dignity. His arguments: (?)<br />I bought this book after seeing him on a C-SPAN panel discussion and he seemed quite balanced. Myself seeing nothing wrong with biotech (and being puzzled at the 'human dignity' arguments), I am still willing to hear good arguments to counter my own. I thought this would be the book. It was not. <br />The first section of the book is a rehash of the developments and techinical information needed to make a meaningful discussion of biotech. Here, Fukuyama gains both his stars. He was clear, concise, and he even managed to say in one sentence what I've seen others say in 2 paragraphs, and more comprehensively. Being familliar with a lot of this info from past readings, a lesser writer may have caused me to skip over the chapters. Even though I'd read most of the info before, reading it in Fukuyama's words was exciting. <br />Then there is the second, decidedly more philosophical section, where the author discusses first, human rights, and second, human dignity. Here, we see that Fukuyama is truly &quot;Aristotle's bulldog&quot;. He first makes a(n almost irrelevent) case for natural rights. How does he do it? Surprise, suprise: humans have natures; those natures are (with minor variance) universal: therefore, human rights exist. He tells us that &quot;ought&quot; actually can be derived from &quot;is&quot;. But here is the problem. Fukuyama is very selective in what he recognizes as human nature. Many prominent biologists have shown that brutish things like revenge, rape, infanticide, and bluffing (via game theory) are also part of our universal natures. Should we recognize them as rights too? Fukuyama, oddly, is silent. (somme other reviewers have made astute critiques of his &quot;natural rights&quot; proofs). While I think that 'oughts' should be made with 'is's' in mind (judgments should be INFORMED by fact), Fukuyama (and other natural rights theorists) must unavoidably be selective in what parts of our natures to count as 'natural rights' and which not to. These are value judgments and ones based almost unavoidably on PRIOR conceptions of what is desirable. Therefore, &quot;is&quot; to &quot;ought&quot; is not a necessary step, but a highly 'unnatural' moral leap. (Oddly enough, Fukuyama quotes Hume saying exactly this, never quite rebutting him. Hume, it turns out, makes the stronger case!)<br />From there, we talk about human dignity. I certainly agree with Fukuyama on two points: first, science has had a nasty tendency to (somewhat sadistically) make statements &quot;degrading human dignity&quot;. Instead of being the third chimpanzee (an oversimplification to say the least), we are &quot;JUST (read: only or merely) the third chimpanzee. Similarly Richard Dawkins likes to say that we are survival machines BLINDLY programmed by our genes to ensure their, not our, survival. The second area that I agree with Fukuyama is that science has made it appear that since we are made of the same stuff as other animals, that we are really not much different from them. This ignores obvious empirical evidence that even if we have the same emotions as, say, bonobos, we not only have more of them, but we can do such things as supress them, learn about them, modify them (fairly quickly) and be aware of them in a second-order way. Fukuyama, then, is right on these two counts and becuase of both of them, science has appeared to threaten our human dignity. <br />Where he is not correct is on the conclusions he draws from is: that biotech DOES threaten our dignity. If our natures can be manipulated, he says, then there is really not much special about us at all. My answer: only if that is the way YOU want to think of it, but your conclusion doesn't necessarily follow. After all, we can control diamonds: we can cut them, color them, crush them into powder, chisel them to our specs; but does that make a diamond less valuable to us? No. So if I were to engineer my daughter prior to birth to try and ensure that she is as healthy or has the 'best brain' possible, does that diminish her future high score on the SAT's? I highly doubt she will really think of it as my, and not her own, achievement. Fukuyama also assumes that we will be able to genetically engineer to ensure our children are succesful in life. Hmmm....I thought environmental factors played pretty important roles in ones 'succcess' (whether you've the right business partners, whether consumers like your ideas, whether you are in the right place at the right time with the right people...etc.)<br />There is a third section that takes his 'arguments' and applies them to public policy debates where his ultimate stance is to put serious regulations on cloning and biotech. I found this section only skim-worthy, as they rely on the faulty argumenets in previous sections. <br />I generally don't write long reviews, but there are honestly so many fallacies, over-simplifications, and unrealistic speculations in this book (not much of a departure from The End of History)that writing a short one would feel wrong. My suggestion? Read the book, but do so skeptically. A better book explicating the same kind of fears but with better arguments? &quot;Human Cloning and Human Dignity&quot; by The President's Council on Bioethics.	2004-01-11
US	37928338	R3J2O16OK7PHT2	0803200773	680157580	Religion in a Free Society	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good book by a good pragmatist!	While writing this review, I fear, there is no way I can pretend that my admiration for this book is due to much other than the fact that I agree with its stances. Hook was a very famous (infamous?) secular humanist up untill his death in the 80's. Here, though, he suprises everyone (well, not me) by writing very neutrally about religion's place within a free society.<br />Hook was famous for never letting ideology dictate the beliefs he would hold and here he proves it. Atheists, said Hook, all too often let their beliefs a.) distort the quite religious history in America, b.) exaggerate negatively the effect that religion has, and c.) force them into an 'ultra-seperationist' position. I agree on all three counts. Like Hook, I suppose I should mention that I too am an atheist and am in no way sympathetic with religion, but facts are facts. <br />Far from caving weakly into religion, though, he is quite neutral. What harm, says he, does VOLUNTARY silent prayer at the beginning of the school day do? What Hook worries about is that by towing the seperationist line in the courts, rather than in the legislature, subjecting it to democracy-proper, what seperationists will actually do is take something that was not really an issue to most people (he is persuasive in his assertion that before the courts took hold of the issue, not many people cared about it) and made it a huge issue. All of a sudden, VOLUNARY school prayer (which a miniscule number of schools did anyhow) was legislated against and was so visible that it became a huge issue with Christians as a majority having the most violent reaction. Catholic school enrollemtn balooned as a result. Exactly what secularlists did NOT want to happen!<br />While some might look at this as peace-keeping at the expense of minority rights, Hook is simply asking us to take a step back. If you are an atheist who does not believe in god, how much consequence does allowing others to believe in god publically have? It should have none as you now believe that they are believing no more than a fiction. Hmm...<br />Then again, Hoook might anger the christians in his defense of why argument on policy that is religion based has no place in a democracy. Saying something like, &quot;x policy is good because of y theological reason,&quot; says Hook, renders democracy defunct as these arguments do not encourage further debate, but are conversation stoppers in themselves. <br />Personally, I think Hook is wrong on this count and his reasons less convincing, but the book is quite thought provoking and as a philosopher rather than a historian, a politician or a lawyer, we are given an interesting discussion on what religions place is in a democractic society. Hook, as always, argues cogently and reasons well to come to a myriad of conclusions without the all-too-common ideologically driven rhetoric.	2004-01-04
US	37928338	R1R6UM20W58VAJ	0060957603	952386302	The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey Through Twentieth-Century Philosophy	Books	3	18	27	N	N	Not half bad; about half good.	When I read this, Rutgers philosopher Colin McGinn's autobiography, I wanted to do so as if I were just coming to the subject myself. What impressions would I, a young person wanting to explore philosophy a bit more, get out of it?<br />   Unfortunately, what happened was this: I read it 'as' that young person, decided philosophy was too boring, but my older more experienced philosophical self kept wanting to 'jump in' and rewrite sections of the book. Maybe I could make it more interesting than McGinn.<br />This is not to suggest that I literally could; just to point out a big problem with the book. Philosophically (even for a beginner) it is boring. It focuses much on the philosophy of language and, to be honest, questions no one (sorry, you linguistic philosophers out there) cares about. What do we mean when we refer to an object? Is a thing merely ts traits, or is it an actual thing that has traits? What is it really to follow a rule? As one who is quite read in philosophy, I can tell you that this is why most people are not read in philosophy. If the beginner wants a good and accessible intro, go to Bryan Mageee's \\"Confessions of a philosopher\\". Same format as this - an autobiography. It is just much better as it talks much about the issues that most laypersons will fin more interesting like the nature of knowledge (what do we know versus guess at), what existence is, and other such things. <br />Now, if you are NOT expecting any sort of intro to philosophy, this might be a great book for you. For me, it was very helpful as I am applying right now for my doctorate in political philosophy. McGinn spends much of his time on the workings of academia and what being an academic and philosopher is all about. This part was thrilling to me! From McGilnn's unfortunately heated exchange wlth fellow philosopher Michael Dummett, to his Oxord days, to the details of when, where, and why, he came to the conclusion that the mind/body problem, amongst others, could not be solved at all. Interesting stuff!<br />Overal, then, I gave the book a three. To summarize, if you are new to philosophy and want your appetite whetted don't look for it here. GEt either Magee's above mentioned book, \\"From Socrates to Sartre\\", or if you've the patience and interest, Russell's \\"History of Western Philosophy\\". For academics and the laity well read in philosophy, this will be a fun book, but only as a 'beach read'.	2004-01-04

Many have already resorted to metaphor to describe and encapsualate science - for Popper it was biological evolution; for Kuhn it was the paradigm; for Feyerabend it was anarchy; for Haack it is the crossword puzzle. Along with Popper's 'evolutionary' model, I think Haack's is neck-and-neck for the best metaphor. Every essay herein, though not exclusively concerned with it mentions this metaphor.<br />I want to come back to the metaphor in a bit; first, a synopsis of the book. Haack is one of the few brave souls willing to take the middle position in the science wars (which, by the way, no one is really fighting anymore). Her middle position concedes to the scientists that facts are facts, not constructions, that the scientific process is, when used properly, as objective a method as one can get, and that science has achieved overwhelming success in discovering true things rather than simply inventing or constructing them. To the skeptics - the relativists, postmodernists, etc. - she concedes that science can too easily be led by background assumptions that are not objective, that there is no 'one thing' that is the scientific method, and that science is a much messier and stranger affair than many scientists want to admit, leaving much room for misstep. These essays explore these concessions as they apply to natural and social sciences. What do we mean when we say 'the scientific method' (remembering that Haack is skeptical that there is 'one')? Why have the social sciences been less successful than the natural and are they still sciences (to the latter question she answers 'yes')? Are religion and science actually compatible (though she is not as extreme as, say, Dawkins, she answers a loud 'no')? Will there be an end to science?<br />Now back to the crossword metaphor, which is quite significant to the book. It is currently fashionable amongst reductionists to seea unidirectional approach in science. When you explain the lower stuff, you can then explain the higher stuff. Science, it is said, has as its goal to discover the lower stuff which leads in a chain to the higher stuff. Haack's method looks a tad different (though she is sympathetic to a degree to this). Rather, some questions (entries) may partially help with other quetions (intersecting entries). Sommetimes one answer turning out to be false (a wrongly filled in entry) misleads scientists on others (as the wrong entry provides a wrong 'clue' to the other). Scientists must then backtrack to figure out how much of the 'puzzle' has been filled in correctly and how much can be left as is. <br />The important thing is that science, in Haack's metaphor, is not a linear pattern per se, but an amalgomation of scattered entries that assist with and are assisted by intersecting entries. Kuhn, Feyearabend, Popper, Lakatos, Peirce, and a plethora of other thinkers were right and wrong: they all expressed ASPECTS of what science did, but each ignored other aspects. This is why Haack comes to the conclusion that while science is definitely a discipline worth pursuing, there is no one method that can encapsulate it. The worried reader may be getting the impression that this is a throwback to Feyerabendian relativism. So as to keep this brief, it is not. Haack is as objective as can be. <br />In conclusion, this is a great book by one (and this is rare) who refuses to get pissy about the science wars. She gives each 'side' their due, explains how each side has misunderstood pieces of the other (perhaps in order to make their side look better) and delineates one of the best metaphors ever to be uttered in how science works.	2003-12-31

This is one of only 3 books I've been willing to review after giving up half way through. Georges is a crystal clear, and sometinmes entertaining writer. The book, though, is uncritical, unduly repetitive, and even superficial. <br />   Am I expecting too much? This is, after all, suppoosed to be an intro book. No, my appraial is not based on a highfalutin motive. In fact, it is because this is an intro book that I think there is a disservice done by its surface level approach. <br />   Each chapter (at least in the first half) follows a pretty simple formula. The author asks questions like can machines think, emote, reason, be conscious, understand, etc. Letitimate questions, all. His response, though, seems to be &quot;Yes, they can do all. Why? No one has proved that they cannot; that's why.&quot; I suppose that in its own way, this is a legitimate reason to remain agnostic on whether computers could one day achieve these traits, but it is also an easy way to dismiss the question. Scientists do not - or should not - work that way. A theory is not viable simply no one has disproven it. Rather, evidence must first be martialled in its favor for it to be taken seriously. (Not that this can't be done for AI, but the author owes it to us to at least survey the arguments). <br />Second, the author takes these traits (emotion, consciousness, reason, etc) and in an effort to 'understand' waht they are and get some sense of how they might work, he offers a simple explanation: evolution created them. Now I believe wholeheartedly in evolution rather than creation and my qualm is not whether the statement is valid. Rather, it is whether 'evolution did it,' is an answer to his question at all. Saying that evolution created consciousness does nothing to illuminate our view on what it is and what makes it work. Of course, we don't have any really outstanding theories yet, but again, the author owes it to us to at least survey waht we do have. <br />Third, the author accepts UNCRITICALLY the thought that AI will create machine minds and even ones that outgrow us. While this is a possibility, an introductory book like this, should be examining the legitimate criticsism (By people like Searle, McGinn, and Lanier) against it. Rather, he answers criticism of strong AI by suggesting that anyone who denies it must be a mystic who believes in a soul or god or some other immaterial substance. Not true! There are legitimate criticms of AI and I get the feeling that the intro reader is going to come away from this book with the false impresion that there are not scientifically based criticisms.<br />The long and the short is that this book is simply lightweight enough for me to fear that the first-time reader will not be exposed to very much from this book. For those who want to read some thoughtful introductions, &quot;Is Data Human&quot; by Michael Hanley, &quot;Society of Mind&quot; by Marvin Minsky (which this book cites from) and &quot;The Minds I&quot; by Hofstadter and Dennett are good ones. With the exception of the first, all of these books may be a little more tedious (not much) than &quot;Digital Soul&quot; but they are also more informative.	2003-12-20

What we have here is an excellent collection of scientists and philosophers writing articles about the latest research programmes in physics, artificial intellegence, cognitive science, and evolutionary biology. All of these contributers are members of [...] which is a forum for 'leading minds' to converge and converse on what the latest programmes, excitements, and theories in their field are. <br />   What I thought I'd find is cocksure scientists writing in a clamour about their ultimate victory in the science wars and how this would inevitably lead to a reductionistic view of everyhing and anything. (Call me cynical, but the popular science market has been doing a lot of this lately). I did find a little of that only a little); by in large, though, the focus was simply on what certain fields were really doing, how it MAY affect other fields and the general populace, and overall abstainment when it comes to grand proclomations. No 'theories of everything', 'consciliences' that repeat Wilson's mistakes of wanting to 'scientize' all other disciplines, and no cockiness.<br />All that having been said, this book is absolutely thrilling. These scientists (the likes of Dennett, Pinker, Minsky, and Smolin) are writing fasinating essays of very promising theories in their fields and their roles in hashing them out. Can universes organize themselves? What are animals really thinking? Is the brain reducible to algorithms and if so, could machines achieve a first person experiencial perspective? How malleable is human nature?<br />If you are like me and REALLY excited about these questions and hearing scientists - if not answering them - discussing what answers might look like, then this book is a fantastic exploration. The big winners, you ask? In my humble opinion Jaron Lanier's essay on scientism and AI takes the cake; also Dennett's article delineating the intentional stance is good. David Deutch does an excellent job writing on quantum computation as doe Marvin Minskyon why AI might want to rethink how it looks at the mind. <br />The last 30-or-so pages is a miscelleneous collection of thoughts by leading scientists and philosophers in response to John Brockman's lead off essay discussing the relation of science and humanities. Again, Laneir comes off the most thoughtful and thought-provoking (ironically he is the only contributor WITHOUT a formal degree) but the rest of the responses are insightful and well written. <br />If you want to explore a variety of fields, points of view, and ideas, this is a tremendous book. Brockman and the contributors certainly did science and society a service in putting this one together.	2003-12-18

Sidney Hook was a preeminent philosopher from the 30's to the 80's, but his essays - from defences of secular humanism and the scientific method, to discourses on the problem with the idea of natural rights - sound like they could've been penned yesterday. This book is probably the best single collection of essays spanning Hook's career and diversity of interest. <br />   The first set of essays is on Deweyan pragmatism. Here we have classics like &quot;Naturalism and First Principles&quot;, arguing that first principles are not as sacroasanct as philosophers think, &quot;Pragmatism and the Tragic Sense of Life&quot; and &quot;The Place of Reason in an Age of Conflict&quot; - both of which are refreshing reads in an age of absolutism, be it pacifism, Christian fundamentalism or any other trendy -ism floating around. Hook remins us that values can, do, and always will conflict. The place of philosophy is not to naively pretend that a 'system' can eradicate them, but to deal with ithe fact that no theory can. <br />The next section is &quot;Studies in Marxism&quot; and while I can't say that there are any notable highlights here (as I'm nothing of a Marxist or sympathizer) one has to admire how Hook took a pragmatic view of Marxism and if anything, made a &quot;historicist&quot; doctrine a bit more feasible. <br />The next two sections are on Democratic (1) theory and (2) practice. They include classics like &quot;The Democratic Way of Life&quot;, &quot;Are There Limits to Freedom of Expression&quot; (where Hook pragmatically answers yes), &quot;Conflicts in Ways of Belief&quot;, and for all you that thought Hook was a conservative, &quot;A Critique of Conservatism&quot;. In an age where 'democracy' has been taken to mean everything from &quot;freedom&quot; to &quot;equality&quot; to &quot;economic justice&quot; to &quot;fairness&quot;, Hook reminds us that democracy is a process and while they may achieve these things, they are synonymous with none of them. Respect for democracy as a process does not mean any particular results - it just means majioritarian representation (which in most cases is a good thing). <br />The last section is &quot;In Defense of a Free Society&quot; which includes such notable essays as &quot;Human Rights and Social Justice&quot;, &quot;In Defense of the Cold War&quot; and &quot;The Intellectual in America&quot;. <br />All in all, this is a great book. Whether you are just being introduced to Hook, increasing your knowledge of this wonderful thinker, need a brush up, or an expert, this book is an intellectual treat. A gadfly of our time, Hook had the eye of a hawk, the pen of a true intellectual, and the polemics of a champion.	2003-12-02

In it, Sidney Hook - secular humanist, pragmatist, and defender of the open society - writes on multiculturalism and its excesses in the academy, the right to die, McCarthyism, and what relativism is and is not (Hook is a relativist, just not the kind critics like to bash). <br />The funny thing is that while most of these essays were written before the 1980's (and some of them in the 1980's) many of the same issues are prevelant today, and Sidney Hook took \\"modern\\" stands on these issue before most of us did. Once again, he was ahead of his colleagues by a good many years. (In fact, he is the first open \\"right to die\\" champion I've seen!)<br />The \\"crowning moments\\" are these: a brilliant review of Allan Bloom's \\"Closing of the American Mind (this is where he explains why what Bloom criticizes as relativism is really subjectivism - another thing entirely, as Hook calls himself an \\"objective relativist\\" and means it). The dialogue between Howard Zinn and Hook on whether America is democratic is a good one, but Zinn clearly overexaggerates or is blinded by ideology. Anyhow, Hook calls him out.

Dawkins new book is a broad ranging essay collection - spanning subjects from religon to Africa; from explanations of &quot;memetics&quot; to personal eulogies to admired colleagues, including antagonist Steven Jay Gould. I'm always skeptical of buying essay collections this wide ranging particularly from thinkers I'm used to reading whole books from. I've no regrets picking this gem up though. <br />Truth be told I bought this book for a graduate paper I was writing and was planning on reading ony the few relevant articles (on which subject, I'll never tell!) The more I started reading those essays, though, the more I realized that this was a naive goal. Given Dawkins crystal clear writing, his wit, the excitement in how he explains things and the absolute diversity of these essays, I couldn't stop reading. Once I got Dawkins thoughts on postmodernism, I HAD to read his thoughts on religion, which led me to the included book reviews on Dawkins late antagonist Steven Jay Gould, which led me to... Before I knew it, though I didn't plan it this way, I'd not only finished the book but was dissapointed that there weren't more essays to read. <br />The long and the short - what I'm saying is that this book is bound to please people of widely diverse interests as there are so many topics covered in this book (even a short, chiding essay about jury duty that will keep us former jurors howling). And those that have read Dawkins and think they know the man and his persona will find more dimensions to him than they ever thoght existed. His remarks on Gould's passing and the section thereon are moving as are his other eulogies.<br />The only area I did not find agreeable is Dawkins hostility to religon, which I do not think is entirely undeserved (his essay on the illogic of religious perspectives on cloning is right on). Rather, I think that Dawkins has a tendency (a very real one) to go wildly overboard into an anti-religou tizzy. I wish he, like Gould, could learn to peacefully and nonzeolously agree to disagree with religion. And really, for those of us who've read Dawkins for years now, I think it is getting a little old. <br />Other than that, no complaints. Buy the book. It is fun, interesting, and there is something in it for everyone. You'll love it - I promise!	2003-11-26

FACT: Not many people really care about the abortion issue anymore. FACT: Not many people ever really did. FACT: Speicial insterest and lobbying groups, not regular people, are the ones who 'take sides' and push the abortion debate. FACT: The regular person, when polled, is smack-dab in the middle of the two &quot;sides&quot;. <br />   So Congress just passed a bill banning partial birth abortions, hailing it as a big victory...despite the fact that less than 1 percent of abortions are late term. Why, if congress has so much else to do that affects so many more people, did they spend so much time, money, and emotion on this piddley bill? REad this book to find out. <br />   Here is the irony. Abortion is one of the most polarized issues we've ever faced as a nation. BUT, the average person is overwhelmingly ambivalent about it. No one is completely pro-life; no one is completely pro-choice - except the lobby groups who have everything to gain from demonizing the opposition, scaring the citizenry by exaggerating problems (this is how the later-tem abortion bill got so much attention; and remember the Bork Supreme Court nominations?). <br />Anyway, this book is very neutral to each side and is premised on the idea that how the abortion debates have been conducted is more a symptom of a declining deliberative democracy than it is about lack of moral resources. The conclusions above are well borne out in this book and the author is rightly befuddled over how any of this actually happened. <br />Good book for all political science or ethics students. The abortion debate is used as a micro-cosm, pointing at larger problems prevelant in how we conduct political &quot;debate&quot; (read; No Spin Zone) and how the average citizen thinks (or doesn't) on the issues affecting us.	2003-11-18

It has always seemed bizarre to me how the best arguments against original intent are made by...historians! This book does many things, the least of which is to offer a very penetrating argument againt original intent. It is a book, first and foremost, exploring the history of American contitutionalism. Was judicial review intended? How do we make sense of the limilts (if there are any) of the contract clause? And what in the world does the ninth amendment actually mean??<br />Levy has a true historians eye and quite simply, is great at what he does. In this collection of loosely connected essays exploring the histories of these and other problems in our constitution's history, he points out what judges should've known all along; there are as many intents as their were framers, ratifiers, and Supreme Court Justices. What's more, much of the 'history of intent' is simply a jumbled mess; ambiguuos, imcomplete, and imprecise.<br />The best essays of course are those focusing on whether original intent is a.) what was intended by the founders (isn't that ironic?) and b.) the doctrine we should actually be using. One thing I've learned in my study of the Constitution is that judges, as smart as they are, are simply bad historians. From Dred Scott to Bowers v. Hardwick, judges have botched history - whether deliberately as in Scott, or not, as in Bowers. One Justice Levy is particularly hard on is (one of my judicial heroes) Hugo Black - and for good reason! Black's history is narrow, reflects an overconfidence in the founders that they never even had of themeselves, and simply (particurly with the fourteenth amendmen) gets a lot of it wrong. He is hard on Robert Bork for just this reason.<br />In summary this is a great book. Levy doesn't take too many sides here, but is probably something akin to a Jeffersonian Democrat. He is rigorous, mindful of the burden of his task as historian, and illuminating. For another great argument by a historian on the difficulties of original intent, read Rakove's \\"Original Meanings\\". For an argument in favor of OI, the standard is Bork's \\"Tempting of America\\". Enjoy!	2003-10-23
US	37928338	R1EY8NTSG140UG	B00005VOS0	34189397	A constitutional faith	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	A great defense of literalism and democracy!	Mr. Justice Hugo Black will rightly go down in history as one of the &quot;great dissenters&quot;. His views of the incorporation doctrine - that the fourteenth amendment demanded complete incorporation of the bill of rights to the state level - procedural, rather than substantive, due process, and his first amendment absolutism virtually ensured that his opinions would be dissenting ones. Of course, while many of his theories, like incorporation, have long since become legally commonplace, others, like his push for procedural rather than substantive due process, have become even less fashionable today than they were in Black's day. <br />   Quite simply this is an immportant book of jurisprudential theory. In a few more than 60 pages, Justice Black lays out his theory of democracy (that courts need to limit themselves to the law's letter so as not to usurp democracy from the people), dual sovereignty (thet whenever possible, the judiciary should not invalidate state legislation, but assume that the people of that state can do so via the democratic process), his views on what is and is not due process, and most importantly, his defence of judicial literalism. <br />   Since his defence of literalism (an often overlooked, but very sensical theory) is so important, here is a taste: The founders created a written constitution when they did not have to. They added an amendment process to it. They created a judiciary to interpret the law 'under the constitution'. These three things very easily point to a literalist conclusion. Had the founders wanted judges to read broad principles into the constitution - letting the documents meaning change with changing situations - the founders wouldn't have WRITTEN a constitution, but rather given it a Magna Carta, will o' the wisp, style. Had they wanted an 'evolving constitution', they wouldn't have put a legislative amendment process in (implying that this is the ONLY way to amend the document). <br />Of course, the other main reason for Black's textualism is his observation that as standards of what is just, fair, and right, change from time to time, unelected judges should not concern themselves (at least do so as litle as possible) with them. If judges can re-interpret statutes from year to year based on their own standards of 'reasonableness' or what have us, then, Black argues, what is the point of having a statute at all? <br />But I've digressed - hopefully enough to whet your appetite. In the tradition of Holmes, Cardozo, Frankfurter and otheres, Black gives us a rare oppurtunity to see a justice step out of their robe and let us read through their thoughts on method. This is a truly thrilling book about an overdue judicial philosophy.	2003-10-11

Like many other Dewey readers, I find his work frustratingly hard to penetrate. This book is a bit more readable than most collections, but is still quite difficult.<br />First, all of these essays speak on the common theme of pragmatic metaphysics (epistemology?). This alone is a difficult (but immensely rewarding) subject. Fortunately, two of the best essays here (&quot;Nature and its good&quot; and &quot;A short catechism concerning truth&quot;) are in dialogue form - something Dewey did only twice. <br />Other than those two there is some brilliant - and tedious - philosophy here. Of course, the title article needs no introduction - it is a standard and rightly so. &quot;The experimental theory of knowledge&quot; and &quot;The intellectualist criterion of truth&quot; both go far in explaining how Dewey breaks the dualism of real/ideal in metaphysics. &quot;Beleifs and Existences&quot; is also a great essay for understanding how Dewey looks at beliefs, not objects, as the 'creator of the world'. <br />Overall, I have to say that, in honesty, the book gets quite repititious about 2/3rds through. The basic gist is that the essays here map out Dewey's 'experimentalism' by showing how both the intellectualist idea of a priori or absolute truth 'out there', and empiricist concept of passive experience, are both flawed. Dewey outlays his brand of pragmatism, stemming from the naturalism touched on in title essay. <br />For Dewey fans, this is a great read. For those semi-interested and versed in Dewey, recommended but possibly after you've read &quot;Quest for Certainty&quot; (which, I think, is a more 'important' and even 'inviting' book). For the novice to Dewey, this is not the book to get. Read 'The Essential Dewey: vol. 1&quot; first.	2003-10-02

Bertrand Russell has written some of the most fun and intellectually accessible essays in philosophy. This book is a collection of such essays, most having to do with religion. As his thoughts on religion changed gradually over time, this book tends to focus on his middle and later essays and, unlike some other collections which take essays from all points in his career, is quite consistent. <br />   One thing that deserves mentioning is that the title of this book may be a bit misleading. As with most of Russell's 'popular essay' collections, the book title is simply the title of the lead-off essay. In fact, for those looking for an intro to philosophical and logical argument against god, the essay &quot;Why I'm not a Christian&quot; is simply one of the best that has been produced. Otherwise, only about 5/8ths of the book is devoted to the subject or god and religion. There is also an essay on academic freedom, sexual ethics, and historical figures like Thomas Paine (though not focusing on Paine's atheism so much as his rationalism). There is also an end essay written ABOUT Russell and his experience being denied a professorship because of his contreversial social views. <br />   And what a contreversial thinker he was. He was a man dedicated to 'the life of reason' somewhat in the enlightenment tradition, science, and a liberal ethic (both socially and politically). This book gives a good sampling of all of these stances and is quite a joy to read. As I started with, Russell writes clearly, enjoyably, and has a sharp wit and humor (as the satiric essay on 'nice people' clearly illustrates). <br />    If one is looking for a book exclusively dealing with Russell's reliigious writings, this may not be the best book. Rather, there is a book by Routledge press called &quot;Russell on Religion&quot; that deals exclusively with Russll's religious essays. There is minimal overlap, though, between the two books.	2003-09-28

Karl Popper, simply put, is one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth centruy. Even though Popper's writings are clearly written and accessible, Popper is also one of the easiest to misunderstand. <br />   Dr. Notturno's book is one of the best intro's to the world of Popper's writings that there is. First, his book is extraordinarily conversational and easy to understand. Second, Dr. Notturno has an excellent working knowledge of Popper's philosophy of critical rationalism and takes the reader step by step through Popper's thought from the ground up - first, Popper's anti-justificationism, then, conjecture and refutation, World 3, the aim of science, leading to Popper's social philosophy of piecemeal engineering and the open society. <br />   What really makes this book stand out though (for beginners and professionals alike) is that Notturno, since he is so well versed, keeps in mind how and why Popper's philosophy has been mis-understood in the past. Consequently, he is mindful to explain in a way that the reader can avoid misunderstanding Popper, say, as a relativist, or an advocaator of psychologism. <br />   As an example, most books start by focusing on Poppper's theory of conjecture and refutation or falsifiability WITHOUT first explaining how Popper gets there by way of anti-justificationism. This leads to many mistakes including the inclination to misread Popper's views by either labeling him as a skeptic or, in the opposite direction, as a logical positivist type (that Popper himself couldn't stand). <br />   Of course, all of this is making the book sound complex or unacessible when nothing could be further from the truth. I've read most of Popper's writings and several other 'intro' books. Dr. Notturno's is certainly one of the best AND one of the easiest to read. If you want to find out about Popper's extraordinary philosophy, read this book. As a next step, read Popper's own book &quot;Conjectures and Refutations&quot;.	2003-09-28

As with most essay collections, this book is about theme and variation. The theme is ethical pluralism; the variation is by 'worldview'. First, the theme. Ethical pluralism means a variety of different things. A.) it can mean that values are incommensurate and often irreducibly conflicting; B.) it can mean that within a particular 'worldview' there are a variety of different ways to live; C.) it can mean that there are many, and equally rational, vantage points from which to see the world and the issues therein. This collection - as a collection, not a unit - oscillates between the three meanings. <br />Now for the variations - ethical pluralism is discussed in these essays from a variety of different vantage points; each discussing how ethical pluralism permeates their philosophy or religion. Natural Law, Liberalism (classical and egalitarian), Islam, Confuscianism, Christianity, Judaism, Feminism and Critical Theory are the vantage points from which the essays are respectively written. For each worldview, there are two essays; the first, giving a philosophical and historical outline of pluralism within the particular worldview; the second, by another philosopher of that tradition who expands on on the first essay. <br />   Overall, the collection was good, well thought-out, and informative. Occasionally it got a bit repititious (as essay collections on a specific theme tend to do). While some of the essays (those on natural law, liberalism, Judaism, and Christianity) were written on how these philosophies deal with societal pluralism in general, many of the others (Islam, feminism, Confuscianism) seemed only to tout pluralism by suggesting that WITHIN THEIR GROUP there are slight variations of adherents, thus, they are pluralistic. Personally, I like the first approach better. <br />Still, there is a wealth of information in this book. Even the worst of the essays were informative and all were written in a very cordial and non-abrasive manner that attempts to explain, not convince or convert. Many traditions to explore and all seem to have much to say.	2003-08-20

It was, I believe, Bertrand Ruseel who said something to the effect of, &quot;There are two types of philosophers. Those who divide everything into two types and those that doen't.&quot; Rescher is more or less that second type. On ones side there is the objectivist who sees things as context independent; then you have the subjectivist who doesn't. Rescher is....well....a bit of both. <br />His main point is to outlay a positive philosophy of objectivity (that is, the objectivity of knowledge) while making room for cognitive pluralism. The point being that one can, says Rescher, be an objectivist who believes that not all knowledge is of a subjective kind while realizing that a.) we see the world from our (not, say, God's) point of view, b.) that the objectivity of the world is not a proven thing, but a pragmatically necessary assumption on our parts, and c.) that our knowledge is tentative as we never know which beliefs we hold will turn out falsified later. The problem is that subjectivists exagerate these claims and use them as &quot;proof&quot; that may only suggest in a subjective form and by extension, that reason must be subjective too (&quot;Your reason is different than mine!&quot;). Nonsense!<br />Rescher also tackles the 'circularity of arguments about rason. First, he outlays: &quot;What is reason?&quot; The answer is circular but not troublingly so. &quot;Reason is being rational; or, doing what any rational person would do in your situation.&quot; So when we ask what is reason, we find that is is being rational. But when we then ask why be rational, we are answered with, &quot;Because its the reasonable thing to do.&quot; Rescher doesn't see this as troubling; in fact, he said we should expect nothing but a circle here. If it wasn't circular, we could justify our preference for reason without reason, in which case, why wouldn't we just use THAT facutly? A circle shows us that it is difficult to get away from reason and even when we don't want to use it, say, we gnerally try to do so by rational justification. When relativists try to give us a reason to abandon reason (and how many books have been written for just that purpose), they are biting the hand that slaps them. <br />From here, Rescher spends a chapter on tackling relativist arguments (cultural, historical, feminist, class interest, etc.). Unlike the current popularity, Rescher is very respectful, cogent, and almost humble here. Next, Rescher spends the next half of the book talking about cognitive objectivism (in its pragmatic form) and ethical relativism. For my money, I don't feel as comfortable with Rescher when he moves into ethics. These sections felt rushed and I'm not sure they left me convinced. Still, even minus those chapters (which you still, of course, may like) this book is worth your money and time.	2003-08-19

I may well be one of the last people who should be giving this book 5 stars. First, I'm a libertarian whose generally skeptical of military action. Second, as this book is largely about just war theory in the christian tradition, it should be noted that I am a non-beleiver. This book, though, is a rarity. It is well argued, is assertive yet cautious, and unlike so many others on both sides of the issue, does not degenerate into an empty rhetorical minefield. <br />   What the book is about is using just war theory, a system in christian ethical philosophy that aims at deciphering moral from immoral war, and applying this theory to the war on terror. The question: Why do we fight? The answer: Because if we didn't, either we or many innocents in the middle-east would experience far worse brutality than we would by intervening now. Again, while I'm skeptical of military intervention unless for the most extraordinary reasons, this book has gone far in forcing me to reconsider why we are doing what we are doing. Contrary to much propoganda, we are in fact conducting ourselves fairly, judiciously, and cautiously. <br />In fact, one of the most noticable things she does is to contrast the way radical islam (and she carefully contrasts this with Islam) conducts itself with the way we conduct ourselves. It is night and day. Terrorism kills indiscriminately: if you are western, you die. We are judicious and discriminate if we must kill: We kill terrorists and do everything possible to ensure that civilians live. Radical islam does not 'talk it over' before killing. We do - even if the left feels stifled when voicing opinion, they may still do so and sometimes to great effect. We use force via an organized army and recognize international statutes of war ethics. Radical islam does not. The differences go on and on. <br />While I remain unconvinced of the Iraq war (which this book does not address as it was written previous to it) Mrs. Elshtain's arguments on the moral reasonsfor us to engage in the war on terror are thoughtful, intellegent (not hot-air rhetoric like, say, Sean Hannity) and extremely insightful. It has forced me to re-examine my (former?) positioin and it may do the same for you.	2003-08-18

The oft overlooked (and certainly most reasonable) ethical philosophy is neither monism (there is one ideal concept of the good) or relativism (there is no ideal conception of the good) but pluralism (there are many ideal conceptions of the good). Here, Kekes gives this under-represented philosophy a chance to shine. <br />As the author notes, the book draws its main inspiration from two key pluralists of the past - Michael Oakeshott and Isaiah Berlin. He starts with a broad sketch of what pluralism is and, in brief, offers a defense against monism and relativism. <br />From there, he outlays the six key elements of pluralism: there are a plurality of values, they will at times inevitably conflict, the resolving through reason of those conflicts, the importance of moral imagination (putting yourself in the other's shoes), the moral possibilities needed for life, the need for limits from within and without and the prospect of a pluristic moral progress.<br />The next chapters are spent one each devoted to one of these principles. The key is that while monism aims at one ideal of the good life and uses reason to get there, and relativism denies anything but a ideal that  is relative (to culture, class, history, etc.) and foregoes reason to get there, pluralism takes the best of both. There are a plurality of good things and values, they conflict much of the time, but we can use reason to find our way, i.e. there are a plurality of good ways to live and they are all rational. <br />This is an alright book, well written and the concept is well explored. Kekes is a bit repetitive (even in his 217 pages. As his six 'principles' overlap a bit, each chapter says slightly what the other did; still, there is plenty of info here. Especially as he devotes equal time to statement and defense.	2003-08-11

I read this book and am writing this review after the famous/infamous supreme court ruling of Lawrence v. Texas, the one that repeals the Texas gay sodomy law. Needless to say, there is much discussion for and against this decision. Many objectors are using religious arguents. Should they or should they not be allowed? Even as an atheist, I'm becoming dissatisfied with the manner that religious arguments are being excluded from the 'table of ideas' just for mentioning the 'g-word'. <br />Perry is a law professor at Emory (he was at Northwestern when this book came out). \\"Love and Power\\" is a sequel to his book \\"Morality, Politics, and Law\\" [see my review] and extends its arguments about the impossibility of a truly neutral politics. Liberalism (that is, in a Lockean sense)is fond of discussing 'neutrality' which has given them a rationale to oust 'g-word' arguments from the table. Perry's first job is to show that neutrality theorists like Bruce Ackerman and John Rawls are advocating a pipe dream. Quick example: On abortion, neturality theorists think that non-legislation, since its non-legislation - is a neutral stance. They also feel that arguments for regulation, when based on religous arguments, are not neutral. Therefore, only secular (supposedly neutral) arguments can be heard. One easily sees why this view is anything but neutral. <br />After Perry gets done there, he outlays his urging of 'ecunemical' politics that strives - not to remain impossibly neutral - but to devise arguments that are as acceptable to as many people as possible. These arguments, of course, may well be religious in nature and, yes, some people (hard atheists) might get hosed. Perry's point, though, is in order for anyone to take a stance on anything, it is necessary that she argues a point and that point will not be agreed upon by all (after all, why would there be a discussion if everyone agreed?). Perry argues, though, that 'secular' intellectualism has tended to over-exagerate any excluding effect that religious moral argument has. After all, most religions (and secular philosophies) share many of the same tenets, like resepct for life. Can the exlusion factor really be that high?<br />Overall Perry has written another great (but brief, at 137 pages less endnotes) book. The reader should read \\"Morality, Politics, and Law\\" first as many of the ideas in this book are first explored (and more thoroughly) in that book - that one being more of an 'all around' book instead of having a more religious focus. The only problem is that I didn't come away thinking that Perry dealt with criticisms as much as he could. His view, after all, - that we should engage in pluralistic and sympathetic debate - can approach a 'head in the clouds' feel. For my money, I find Perry's uncompromising pluralism to be a welcome change in law. Still, more rigor would've been nice.	2003-08-08

Every time I get done reading one of the 80+ books by pragmatic philosohper Nicholas Rescher, I always have to pause and ask why he is not more well known. This book is everything one could want. The topic is relevant, the text is economical, terse and well layed out, and the thought is penetrating and insightful.<br />   Reschers subject, of course, is pluralism - epistemic, ethical, and political. Rescher has two 'enemies' from which to defend his version of pluralism. One is the consensus theorists or (epistemic, moral, or political) absolutists who hold that rational minds will inevitably come to consensus on thought-out issues. The second are the 'relativists' who have given up thorougly on the possibility and have hence concluded that differences in these areas are a matter of 'taste' or at very least, can not be picked between using reason. <br />   Reshcer defends his views well, but I fear that these two adversaries have been 'radicalized' by Rescher. As a shining example of relativism, for instance, he picks Paul Feyerabend (who even most relativists look at as radical). In short, though, Rescher's view is between these two extremes. With the 'absolutist' he shares the view that reason is capable of making justified decisions between options and that we are justified in making evaluative judgments that some options are better or worse than others. With the relativist, he shares an acknowledgment that reason is not an absolute and that there may not always be 'one right answer'. In short, he is a pragmatist who says: &quot;While we can and should use reason to decide the best course of action, epistemic and axiological differences between people make pluralism between views inevitable.&quot;<br />   As mentioned, the text is well laid out. First, Rescher defends his pragmatic pluralism on epistemic grounds (different people know different things), then on ethics (different people rationally value different things) and then political pluralism is explored (it is often rational just to agree to disagree). While I share the below reviewers skepticism about some of Rescher's political conclusion (particularly that 'agreeing to disagree' is not a kind of consensus) but overall, I found his arguments persuasive. Trust me, you will enjoy this book!	2003-08-05

Somewhere exactly in between hard-line interventionism and soft-line pacifism lies the cool, tempered and thoughtful (if still imperfect) moral approach of just war theory.<br />   According to just war theory, there are seven moral imperatives to be cognizant of before any war can be justified: a just cause, appropriate intent, response is proportioned to the stimulus, their must exist a reasonable hope for success, peace must be the end goal, only those authorized to declare war do, every other option has been exhausted or is infeasible. Similarly, if a nation or alliance decides to go to war, there are two rules, according to just war theory, for combat: first, one must do as little damage to noncombatants as possible, and second, the use of force has to be no greater than is necessary. <br />   Using these guidelines, Johnson takes just war theory (a concet that's been in discussion since Grotius) and applies it to contemporary (1997) situations. He reviews how international law has adopted the just war theory and how the church has embraced it (even as they embraced pacifism, they used its principles as a fall-back plan). <br />   The advantage of a book like this is that a.) Johnson is comprehensive in his theoretical discussions and links them to concrete events (Somalia, Iraqi guif war, American civil war). The second advantage is that as it was written in '97, the book is calmer in tone than those written post-Sept. 11th, particularly in his informative and clear-headed discussion of the differences (but not incommensurability) between Western and Islamic culture. <br />The disadvantages are two: First, Johnson tends to wander into lengthy digressions in his chapters, so much so that occasionally, I found myself wondering if he'd come back to his original argument. He always did but it left me wondering without the digressions, if the book would've been 140 instead of 227 pages. Second, Johnson is not a good writer. His dull prose meant combined with unpredicted digressions left me wandering my mind a bit, so that I would end up reading the same page three times, each time noticing another better way to work the thought he expressed. <br />All in all, it is a good book that brings up to date a theory of just wars that was last seriously broached by Micheal Walzer in 1977 (in a classic called &quot;Just and Unjust Wars&quot;. The dryness and unpredictability of the text, though, keep this from a four or five star ranking.	2003-07-30

Ahhh...I love books like these. It's one of those that you have to think about but don't have to think about. &quot;Come again?&quot; Lachs has written a great collection of essays whose prose is so beautiful, terse and enriching that you, the reader, will be able to go through 100 pages at a time without ever suspecting that you learned as much as you did; you just thought you were having fun!! Like Sesame street for adults!<br />   Before I give you the wrong impression, here's the synopsis. &quot;Community of Individuals&quot; is a collection of essays divided into three sections: &quot;Intellectuals and Courage&quot; consists of ruminations about the role of the teacher and the university. Lachs has some astute and all-too-urgent views taht are more like calls-to-action for profs and students. &quot;Issues for Individuals&quot; focuses on individual issues like epistemology and the creation of ethics. &quot;Problems for communities&quot; is exactly that; Lachs discusses bioethics, euthenasia, technology, and ethics in our prosperous age. The final section, and in my opinion the most enjoyable, is &quot;American Philosophers&quot;. Lachs does such things as compare Peirce and Santayana's view of human purpose, emphasize the individualism of American thinkers in their break with German Idealism (well, except Royce!), and take Paul Weiss to task for his rigid and confused views on human nature and the creation of the self.<br />Through all the essays, Lachs is a Jamesian pragmatist through and through. His concern is to create essays dealing constructively with issues that have practical consequences and is always careful (like with Weiss) to recognize when philosophy tends to become so theoretical and abstract that it stops reflecting this messy ball of stuff called life. Even the more abstract articles (on human epistemology and American theorists emphasis on the individual) are written in ways that tie even the most abstract discussion into practical life. <br />The one curiosity of this book can either be construed as a fault or a benefit; there is really no discernible common theme of the book. After reading it, I even went so far as to read the back cover and introduction again to make sure I hadn't missed something. I don't think I did. While each section is pretty internally consistent (particularly the &quot;Problems For Communities&quot; section, which focuses on issues in science), the book taken as a whole is quite scattered. I don't deduct a star because, as I said, this can be taken as a welcome change or a frustrating diversion. It depends on your tempermant.<br />Still, I can't reccomend this book highly enough. It is fun, fresh, relevant, cautioned, and optomistic all at the same time! Can you ask for a lot more?	2003-07-26
US	37928338	R2NDJTGNNLCJBA	0060977590	100187888	Civility	Books	4	24	25	N	N	Preachy - but then again, is that a bad thing?	I must confess that when I see books like this, I have a tendency to cringe. Most books on civility are 'how to' manuals written by self-styled morally superior curmugeons who want us all to live as they do. <br />   Then again, I though to myself while in the bookstore debating on what to procure, isn't it about time that someone writes an honest, frank book about how to be civil, particularly in the civil arena? After all, democratic politics thrives when discussion, self-government, and liberty without license are at high levels and in case anyone has cared to notice, all are at levels approching an all time low.<br />   So I bought it and my judgement was correct. Professor Carter is not on a high horse, he does not condescend and his comments and observations are astute and viable. (although as an atheist, I felt he gave me no option besides &quot;be a moral christian&quot; or &quot;be uncivil&quot;).<br />   The book - broken into three parts - can get repetitive, particularly on part II. The first part, on what civility is, defends Professor Carter's notion of civility against all comers: Sociologists who think uncivility spurs pluralistic politics, psychologists who think it is a good way to air frustration, and philosophers who think civility is just plain opression without the name. <br />The second part identifies different ways that we are uncivil to eachother. Carter argues that uncivility is generally a result of how easy it has become not to interact with eachother, hence, not spend time identifying eachother as &quot;people, same as us&quot;. Instead of writing letters, we use the internet; instead of taking mass transportation like trains, we drive to work alone in our automobile; instead of joining clubs, we watch characters on TV join them. This is where Carter gets preachy. One hears him subtley thinking, &quot;Ahhh. The glory days; let's go back, shall we?&quot;<br />The third part is the easiest to skip. It is about how to regain civility. We all know how, of course, but generally try to forget that we do. Teach kids 'right' and 'wrong'; set good examples; think about others, sometimes, in lieu of ourselves. These are not hard rules, just common sense ones we've convinced ourselves to be oppresive ones. While this section merely points out the obvious, it is the obvious that we've been overlooking and need to be reminded of. <br />There are particularly great chapters here. A few chapters are on the art of listening to others views sympathetically, instead of listening so as to construct an immediate retort. Two consecutive chapters are on the rule: &quot;liberty is not licesncse&quot;. Just because we have free speech, does not mean we need to, or should, be offensive just because. Another stellar chapter is on the civility of making moral judgements. Too many people are telling us that judging is wrong (which of course, is itself a moral judgement). In reality, moral judgement is necessary to maintain civility, to remind yourself what and what not to do by example, and to let others know that you either approve or disapprove of their actions, which is as powerful as any legislation. <br />All in all, this was a good, well-thought, succinct and enjoyable book. Occasioinal preachiness and repetitiveness aside, it is one that (as one reviewer noted) should be read in high school, college, and as a pre-requisite to public office. Of course, don't tell the PC police!	2003-07-22

The first, is on the self; written by philosopher of science Karl Popper. The second is on the brain; written by neurologist John Eccles. The third part is transcript of dialogues between the two. But here's the thing. They are both body/mind interactionists, or shall we say, dualists living in a world of materialism.<br />   First, my obligitory disclosure. Eccles section is slow going if you are not well familiar with brain science, so my review focuses on section one and three. (I tried to read Eccles section, but it proved too much.)<br />   Popper starts off by distinguishing three 'worlds' (not literal, but metaphorical) of things. World 1 is the world of physical matter; world 2 is the world of subjective thought; and world 3 is that of objective thought (thought translated into language, creative product or something else 'apart' from your subject. He then tackles what he regards as mistaken philosophies in the traditions of materialism and paralellism. As the book was written in 1977, most of the views he tackles - like the behaviorist assertion that mind doesn't really exist but as impulses - no one really believes anymore. As a result, much of this is not very exciting.<br />Both his section and the final section of dialogue between Eccles and Popper are very slow going in that Popper, in particular, rehashes his views on mind/brain interaction, the 3 worlds of thought and other previously published scientific views without explaining them or their relevance to his dualism as well as he could have. In the end, I was left wondering a.) is what Popper and Eccles wrote here all that interesting?; and b.) is it at all contreversial? In the end, I answered &quot;no&quot; to the first question - after all, even those of us who profess materialism are, in daily life, practicing dualists. To the second question, I answer &quot;yes&quot;. Much of what Popper has to say is going to strike the reader as contreversial. I just don't think it - particularly his 'three worlds' theory - will strike her as relevant or accurate.	2003-07-17

Also, an essay called \\"Children, other minds and honesty\\" explores the gradual process children go through learning that and how other people think, and by extension, how to act with them. <br />The next set of essays covers \\"the meaning of life\\". Flanagan is pretty close to pragmatism, in that, he freely admits that we create our own values, but it is as much a social as a personal process. Sometimes morals get in the way of values we've set for ourselves, and sometimes they accord completely. Like James, Dewey, and O.W.

NIcholas Rescher is what pragmatism - or can we say pragmaticism - needs. A clear head, a reasoned view and a loud voice. Rescher is dismayed by what has come to be called 'neopragmatism' represented by Richard Rorty, Hilary Puntam and Nelson Goodman. Theirs is epistemically relativistic, very focused on personal beleif and all around mushy. Rescher is mad. <br />   I am too. Pragmatism's founder Charles S. Peirce was a clear, reasoned and objective thinker indeed. This book comes very close to bringing pragmatism back to Peircean origins. Rescher's underlying theme is metaphysics and, if we'd like, epistemology. Pragmatism is concerned with how we come to know things, have beliefs and why we call things true. To some, the answer to this last question in particular is obvious: 'true' means reflective of reality. Particularly in the theoretical sciences, though, this is problematic as we don't ever really know whether our theory is true or just a better approximation than the last. Pragmatism is what happens when we attempt to acknowlege the highly conjectural nature of science (and life) without getting all pissy about overblowing its ramifications, like Rorty does. <br />Rescher also goes through pragmatic theory of languate (an update on Peircean semiotics). As a rule, I don't like discussion on language, but this definitely held my attention as it has everything to do with what 'truth' means. Afterwards, Rescher goes into ethics. It is here I start to really have problems. Rescher likes Peirce, but hates the other two 'founders' of pragmatism: William James and (my favorite) John Dewey. Rescher's formulation of pragmatic ethics though, is almost a mirror of Dewey's AND James'. He doesn't seem to realize it. Still, good chapters, all in all and as most modern pragmatists don't even attempt anything but the most relativistic broaching of ethics, Rescher gets props from me. <br />To close, this is a good - albeit very elementary - introduction to pragmatism. The reader should certainly be aware though that Rescher's treatment of James and Dewey (both highly criticized but seldom read) are very undeveloped and almost caricatures. Also, I agree with Mr. Ryan below that this one may have benefited from some editing.<br />Also recommended, Susan Haack's &quot;Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate&quot;.	2003-07-14

This is the type of book that, unfortunately, is lacking within the legal profession. Perry is a law professor who concerns himself with religious and/or moral issues in law and politics. How is morality reflected in law? What is laws proper sphere when legislating morality? Can neutrality ever be a viable option amongst a pluralistic society? These are the questions Perry asks in this book. His answers: 1.) all laws are reflections or morality, 2.) we 'should' refrain as much as possible but 'should' is only a guideline, and 3.) No. Neutrality is contra democracy. <br />Of course, mine is just a summation. The book is roughly two-hundred pages of text with extensive endnotes taking up 100 pages themselves. The first part of Perry's book focuses on the question: In a pluralistic society, are consensus, objective claims to moral knowlege, or moral neutrality in law reasonable goals? Perry says no. He is not a moral skeptic who argues qua Mackie that moral knowledge doesn't exist. Rather he is an epistemic relativist. (read the book to find out more) It is this relativism, and the subsequent belief that moral and political consensus, while desirable, is a bit chimeric that fuels the rest of the book.<br />The next part of the book focuses on the possibility of a liberal (meaning either neutral or equalitarian) theory of moral legislation. Perry again is skeptical, taking on Rawls, Dworking (ew[...]) and Ackerman, finding them wanting. He then outlines his suggestion on his theory. (read the book to find out more)<br />To close, he outlines his 'non-originalist' view of constitutional interpretation. Interpreting the constitutioin as a.) a living blueprint and b.) a set of aspirations handed down from the framers, Perry argues, is most consistent with his moral and political theories. I don't agree and, after reading the book, fail to see that Perry adequately connected this legal view to his above moral and political ones but...hey...more for his sequel to explain, right? (I think it's called &quot;Love and Politics&quot; or something akward like that). Overall, good read, thought provoking, and on a subject badly neglected by both philosophers and law students.	2003-07-13

Ever since the &quot;war on terror&quot; - as with most morally difficult times - we are quick to condemn bad acts, using the word evil not so much as a label but as a dismissal. Rarely do we a.) face up to the fact that evil tendencies seem inherent and b.) after having done that, be honest enough with ourselves to introspect on what exactly evil &quot;is&quot;. <br />MIdgley is an astute introspecter and goes through many arguments that she disagrees with and gives us just as many that she finds satisfying. First, and this is the subtracted star, though, she tells us that our examination of evil as a positive trait (as opposed to the abscence of one) is misguided. The first chapter is spend by in large walking us through why she feels it easier to examine evil as more a degree of abscence of goodness, than as a positive trait unto itself. This I find entirely unconvincing. Not that I think it is a positive trait, just that I'm not sure why it is either. Introspection doesn't seem to tell us. <br />What is entirely welcome - and this accounts for the four stars - is that her discussion never strays from discussing evil as a natural part of us, rather than dismissing it as either something that we learn via a blank slate effect, or something that only some of us really have. Yes, we've come a long way from Rousseau's natural man and Locke's tabula rasa. <br />More or less, the book focuses, as apropos of Midgley, on the seemingly endless conflict and irreducibility of the human predicament. We are animals. We are moral. We are self serving. We are altruistic. We are sympathetic. We are ruthless. We are NOT formulas. It's just amazing that philosophy took this long to figure it out.	2003-07-12

This is an absolute value! Most of James's published writings including the hard to find \\"Pluralistic Universe\\" and \\"Essays in Radical Empiricism\\" are here. As well, we get the compolete \\"Pragmatism\\", \\"The Meaning of Truth\\" and excerpts from \\"Varieties\\" and \\"Psychology\\".<br />   Before reading this collection, I'd read quite a bit of James. I bought this primarily for \\"Essays in Radical Empiricism\\" and \\"Pluralistic Universe\\" as this edition is cheaper than buying them seperately. I decided, though, that I'd read this one straight through and I'm glad I did. James is an amazingly astute, extremely relevant (if to some, troubling) thinker. <br />   Unfortunately, James has been somewhat ignored.  His goal as evidenced by most of this volume was to break the dualism prevelant in philosophy of an exagerated empiricism and an equally exagerated rationalism. James devoted most of his career not to building a solid and reductionistic philosophy (the activity of todays preferred philosophers) but to wiping the slate clean, being realistic about what we can know versus speculation, and reporting how things really are rather than what makes us comfortable. While James' commitment to radical empiricism and pragmatism made and make philosophers balk, they are also why we need to read and discuss him today. <br />My only complaints (for which I don't subtract anything) are: 1.) that the book does not go from one book in its entirety to another. Rather an essay from \\"Psychology\\" may be followed by one from \\"The Will to Beleive\\" and vice versa. This annoyed my because I did want to read them as they were meant to be read (chronological essays). Still, the divied up essays are good for continuities sake (as the editor did a good job sequencing them. <br />2.) As James probably did not intend for any one person to read all of his essays, he repeats himself (in ideas and words) frequently. In fact, in James' essay collection \\"The Will to Beleive\\" he apologizes in his preface for repeating paragraphs verbatum during various lecture/essays. Imagine that X 10. Oh, well! MInor compaints for such a great collection. Also, recommended is the \\"Writings of John Dewey\\" also put together by McDermott.	2003-07-12

Here it is; another book about the soul. Do I sound enthusiastic? I wish I could be. I like Owen Flanagan a lot; &quot;Consciousness reconsidered&quot; and &quot;Self-Expressions&quot; are masterworks in the philosophy of mind and ethics. This book, despite being well written and more thought-stirring than most... well... it's simply another book trying to get rid of the soul. So as not to beat around any philosophical bush, it suceeds if you don't believe in a soul, it fails if you do. <br />   First, Flanagan's perspective is probably a bit different than most; he is a buddhist with some fairly unconventional - albeit penetrating - insights. For instance, he has no use for the concept of unified consciousness (or the feeling that your consciousness is a distinct 'entity-like' thing). Rather, upon introspection, we (or, he) notice(s) that it feels more like a stream of seperate thought-trains that occasionally coverge (generally, when we are paying attention to something). <br />Similarly, Flanagan revives the often overlooked (suprisingly) concept of the stream of consiousness. The mind doesn't start and stop as many philosophers of mind lose track of. Rather, it continues when we are not at all paying attention and is quite random at these times. The long and short of this is that Flanagan starts his book with introspection on how the mind is, not how (like Dennett does) he'd like it to be. It is messy, larger than life, confusing and contradictory at times, but any workable philosophy of mind must start with as true a reflection as possible.<br />From here, we go down hill. Flanagan spends an unnecessary large chapter protesting that the battle between free will and determinism doesn't exist; in its place is a great mixture of both. He tells it to us like we've not heard it before and despite my efforts to do otherwise, I couldn't make beleive that this was at all new to me or anyone else. <br />   The last few chapters see Flanagan coming back to his attempt tosketch out a naturalized concept of the human being without a 'soul' and the last chapter tries to construct a viable ethic from this 'new found' human ecology. I for one, share his distaste for soul and soul-like speculation. Still, I can't shake the feeling (and I'm sure you won't be able to either) that we've read too many of these arguments before.	2003-07-12

Mary Midgley is a gem of a moral philosopher. Isn't the discipline supposed to be dead or something? Not so, says Midgley. In fact, this book in large is an argument for why moral philosophy is so important right now!<br />While the book mostly portains to science and its intersection with philosophy, she starts by lamenting the proliferation of disciplines and even sub-disciplines (or 'hyphonated disciplines, i.e. &quot;Neurophilosophy&quot;). Her beef is not with the fact that they are proliferating but in the fact that none of them wander outside their self-created boundaries. This is the first role, Midgley prolaims, for ethical philosophy.<br />Others, she says, involve practical application of scientific knowlege to life. Scientists generally aren't concerned with this area and that is neither right or wrong (although it'd be nice if it got SOME attention). They simply aren't trained for it. Philosophers can help. Also, philosophy, as its edges are not so rigidly defined, are good at thinking through issues like epistemology, ontology and in general, keeping an eye that science doesn't overstep its boundaries of demarcation (wherever that line might be). While this book was written too early, the subsequent advent of 'memetics' is case in point and Midgley, apropos, has been a fervent critic that science has overstepped its demarcation line. <br />While all this might seem like 'philosophies attempt to get in on the success of science&quot;, particularly to those who listen to Daniel Dennett and his ilk, Midgley's suggestions are sincere, well reasoned and not self-congratulatory in the slightest. This book should he read by scientist and philosopher alike. Also recommended, are her books &quot;Beast and Man&quot; (see my review),  and &quot;Evolution as a Religion&quot;.	2003-07-12

Mary Midgley, one of Britian's most cherished moral philosophers, wrote \\"Beast and Man\\" at age 50. At a time where behaviorism and existentialism told the world that there was no such thing as instinct or human nature, Midgley took pen to paper after raising three kids and in observing them, realized how wrong that notion was. Kids have instincts, natures. What's more, these natures are not so far off from what we know of animals  natures.<br />Now before I give the impression that Midgley's book is another sociobiology book in disguise, it is the farthest thing from it. The first thing Midgley does is to make it clear that phrases like \\"Man is JUST (substitute \\"merely\\", \\"only\\" or \\"simply\\") an animmal are not only unfair to animals, they are unfair to humans. Sociobiology even sadomasochistically revels in depressions like this. (after all, aren't we 'only' the 'third chimpanzee'?) Usually, the mistake made is to thihk that animals are 'humans that just haven't gotten there yet' or that humans are 'dressed up brutes that play at ratiionality'. Midgley spends many pages on tackling both of these assumptions, as tacit as they sometimes are.<br />From there, she tackles things like what it means to say 'instinct', why 'reductionism' doesn't explain much of anything, and intertwining them all with examples of why the 'lower animals' and humans have so much in common yet are so incredibly different.<br />In short, this book is not to be missed. It is informative, provocative, challenging and all the while written in a crisp and sensitive prose. Never has it felt so good to be called an animal.	2003-06-14

There is a review from Richard Dawkins on the back of this book; it starts with, &quot;I would never have expected a book about 'nature or nurture' to be even miidly interesting let alone a real page-turner.&quot; In a way, I was sort of with Dawkins on this one. I'm not sure how much gene/environment polarization there is within the science community. Still, I got the book for two reasons. First, I've read Ridley (Origins of Virture, Genome) before. Second, and as Ridley points out in his book, even if there is a lack of gene/environment extremism in science, the laity is still quite polarized when they should not be. <br />   Ridley starts by envisiioning photograph of the twelve great men Ridley feels have influenced study on human behavior. They are Charles Darwin (evolution), Francis Galton (first heritability theories), William James (instincts as a part of psychology), DeVries and Mendel (shared discovery of genes), Ivan Pavlov (conditioning theorist), John Watson (behaviorism), Emile Kraeplin (personality as history), Freud (psychoanalysis), Emile Durkheim (founder of sociology), Franz Boaz (studied relations of cultures to one-another), Jean Piaget (studied how children learn) and Konrad Lorenz (discovered the phenomenon of 'imprinting' in instincts). <br />   Each chapter loosely starts with discussion of one of these thinkers. Basically, Ridley thinks that within all of these thinkers, there is something like a correct answer. Of course, each thinker got as much wrong as they did right so through tasty anecdotes, statistics and modern research results, Ridley shows us what he thinks each got right and wrong.<br />   The only problem I had with this book is that the chapters hop from one to another idea without adequately tying them together. Even the last chapter &quot;a budget of paradoxical morals&quot; extrapolates conclusions that didn't quite seem to represent what I'd read in the book. Each chapter by itself was interesting, but taken as a whole, the book is muddled. Still, not bad for Matt Ridley.	2003-06-13

John Dewey, as I've heard, was never comfortable with labels. Throughout his career he shifted from and to many rubrics: pragmatism, interactionism, instrumentalism, transactionism, experimentalism. Truth be told, all of these are present in \\"Reconstruction in Philosophy\\" and partly because of that, this is probably the best intro to Dewey available.<br />Dewy has a bone to pick with traditional philosophy. Not only has it lost track with real, as opposed to academic, problems (anyone walking down the street can tell us this) but it never really was that good at depicting real questions and descriptions anyway. Take comcepts like Plato's ideal forms and Kant's a priori. Neither of these are teneble in any realm of experience; rather, they were a misguided quest to explain the permanance and stability of the world.<br />Dewey's book is an attempt to pull the carpet out from under their feet; science and inquiry using its methods shows us that the world changes and if anything, stability is something that is felt by us - not inherent in the world. Thus a prioris, ideal forms, seperation of the noumenal and phenouminal amongst other current 'problems' in philosophy - all based on the idea of permanant/transitory dichotomy - are not only wearing thin, but are fast showing to be irrelevant. From this, he builds the groundwork of a philosophy in between rationalism and empiricism. Taking from rationalism an admiration and recognition of reason's power to direct action and combining it with empiricims fascination with experience, Dewey creates a philosophy that puts the spotlight not on one or the other, but on both as leading to and taking from eachother.<br />The first chapter are a philosophical survey of how philosophy went wrong; particularly in Ancient Greek and early Christian philosophy (both having a love affair with absolutes outside of experience). The second chapter focuses on the mistakes when philosophers, like Francis Bacon, widened the chasm between the real and experiential and the ideal and rational.<br />From here, Dewey proceeds piece by piece to show what was wrong and how to fix it by making clear tht scienctific inquiry (the equal interaction between subject and object) leaves no room for absolutes, forms or a prioris (or at least, not in any pragmatically useful sense). By extension, things like formal rules of logic above experience, non-experimentalism in moral or political theory and psychology that includes the individual without an equal part of the social; all of these become little more than unfounded but continually persisting glorifications.<br />For the reader interested in Dewey, naturalism, instrumentalism or the implications of pragmatism, this is a great introduction. From here, I suggest Dewey's \\"The Quest for Certainty\\" followed by \\"Experience and Nature\\", topped off with \\"Human Nature and Conduct\\".l and experiential and the ideal and rational.<br />From here, Dewey proceeds piece by piece to show what was wrong and how to fix it by making clear tht scienctific inquiry (the equal interaction between subject and object) leaves no room for absolutes, forms or a prioris (or at least, not in any pragmatically useful sense).

People will likely come at this book from one of two directions; philosophy or biology. The book is certainly not dissapointing at all coming from the latter angle. It is a great history and analysis of some great evolutionary thinkers: Dawrin (both of them), Huxley, Dobzhansky, Dawkins, Gould, Lewonton and a handful more. Ruse focuses on how they came about their ideas, how others recieved them at the time and whether their ideas and writings hold up to certain epistemic and non-epistemic metavalues of sciecne: predictability, objectivity, conscilience. <br />   It is when coming from the philosophy angle that the book fails to hold up. After all, from its title, we expect to be treated to a query on whether evolutionary biology has made it over the hurdle from metaphysical philosophy to bonafide science (and many readers will not even have been aware that this was even a question). The first chapter is an introductory overview of the dilemma. There are two views of science: one objective and descriptive of the world out there (a la Karl Popper) and one more subject dependent, influenced by cultural factors enough not to yield true description of reality (a la Thomas Kuhn). Ruse discusses the difference in these two thinkers writings. Coming from a reader whose read both authors, his description of Kuhnian 'subjectivism' is well off the mark and his synopsis of Popperian objectivism also could use a fair amount of tweaking. Instead of Kuhn, maybe Dewey would've been a better choice. <br />   It is after the first chapter that the chapters become short summaries of key thinkers: the first half devoted to history and biography and the second, a review of each thinkers scientific achievements and whether they represent sceince or metaphysical philosophy. The chapters on the two Darwins, Dawkins, E.O. Wilson and Lewonton are incredible and penetrating. The others are adequate. All of these are followed by a brief conclusion chapter to tie up loose ends, too brief for the books purposes <br />   In the end, maybe Ruse got so caught up in how much fun he was having with the individual histories that he forgot to focus on the question. The nature of science was to be our topic and sometimes we get a glimpse of analysis on the question but not enough to warrant the books subtitle. For those concerned with the history of the field of evolutionary science - from its days as natural philosophy to the present - this book will no doubt satisfy. As an examination of where evolutionary sciecne does and does not hold up as an objective (or subjective) discipline, Ruse leaves us dissapointed.	2003-05-16

Books	3	20	29	N	N	A surface-level history	Evolutionary philosopher Michael Ruse has given us some interesting and challenging books, like &quot;Mystery of Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Taking Darwin Seriously&quot;. This is not one of them.<br />Ruse tracks the concept of teleology (or, direction) in pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. I share the below reviewers sentiments that the history he gives is a very compressed one and was pretty rushed. We jump from Plato and Aristotle to Kant to Darwin to Gould all in a matter of chapters and Ruse isn't very thorough about any of them (well, except for Darwin). Ruse came off like a track-star so focused on getting to the finish line she forgets how to keep a steady pace. <br />One would also have thought that we'd go beyond history; either focusing more on the current climate of the escalating Gouldian v. Dawkinian approach or even focusing on some of the theoretical difficulties that scientists face when having to conjecture on teleology. In fairness, we do get a bit of the latter in the second-to-last chapter but in proportion to the historical chapters, it was dissapointingly cursory. <br />The chapter on Intellegent Design, though, is a bang as Ruse brings the concepts of teleology - evolution style - into ID and examines how people like William Dembski and Michael Behe handle the concept. <br />I still gave it three stars for clarity of writing, overall interest (so long as you're expecting a history; not expecting conceptual discussion), and the difficulty of subject matter and how well Ruse handles it.

Sidney Hook, like many pragmatic theoriests, wrote on many subjects. One of his favorite, though, was naturalism and how it stacked against religious faith. This book, almost exclusively, is on that. <br />   First, I have to say that the first three essays, none of them dedicated to naturalism as discussed above, are maybe the best three here. \\"Philosophy and Human Conduct\\" asks the question of whether a particular philosophy of epistemology, metaphysics or what have us has connection to particular political beliefs. Hook answers that there may be small tendencies (idealism tends, not always, leads to a leftist; realism, to a rightward stance) but this should only be taken as a tendency. \\"Moral Freedom in a Determined World\\" writes of the paradox of determinism. Honestly, you've doubtless read these ideas before. \\"The Ethical Theory of John Dewey\\" is a great summary (Hook was a better writer than Dewey anyhow) on Dewey's theory of values and their link to the sciences. These three essays, the best ones, take seventy-three pages.<br />   The next section is devoted to rebutting theism. While this is fun for us naturalists, it gets tiresome and Hook rehashes many of the same arguments that both he and others have used before. Honestly, I think his conceptions of religion are also a bit off. Especially in an essay titled \\"Naturalism and First Principles\\" he goes a bit overboard in the difference between science and religion - the former, he says, solves mystery; the latter, revels in it. To an extent, this is true but for a counter-view, the reader should check out Popper's \\"Conjecture and Refutation\\". Popper believes that both aim at explaining mystery. Belief in Divine something and belief in science both try to make sense of things; the difference? Science does so in ways falsifiable; religion, generally not. Most of Hooks essays from here out, unfortunately, make similar assumptions. I got the impression that he was attacking straw-men. <br />From here, the only other essay I really found exciting was \\"Scientific Knowledge and Philosophical Knowledge\\" which asks whether there is any common ground, whether one can get by without the other and whether each are seperate, or mutually supporting. Hook is not the first, nor the last to broach these questions and his answers, like most whove attempted the questions, are inconclusive but the ride is fun anyway. In short, read it. Some essays are fun; some not. Especially good for those sick of Putnamian and Rortyan \\"vulgar pragmatism\\".	2003-04-20

The world is as it appears to be through our senses - Every event has an explanation - That explanation is intelligible - There are absolute realities and it is these that science &quot;gets back of&quot;. These are some of the assumptions of science. The question of course is how many of them can really be answered apart from specuation. <br />Nicholas Rescher, in a clearly written, tersly laid out, and cogent book ventures into some of these questions and ventures answers grounded in Peircean (Popperian?) pragmatism. The reason we believe the above presumptions - and presumptions is what they are - is that they enable us to do science at all. Tautology, you say? How can Rescher claim that doing science is why we make these assumptions if these assumptions are (at least partially) necessary to do science? In the tradition of pragmatists Charles S. Peirce and John Dewey, we do science to gain increased control over our environment (even if that control is just more security of knowledge) and it is that end which causes us to make assumptions like these that help us in our pursuit. <br />Rescher demonstrates, as far as metaphysics will allow, that it is pretty well certain that some of the above assumptions are false. There's no reason, for instance, to suppose that ultimate truths exist; that is to say, that even though we can state facts and seemingly true theories about x, spaitally, x is likely able to divide into smaller units and they into smaller units ad infinitum. Thus, search for scientific knowledge must (will?) be a never ending one. Similarly, scientific realism which asserts that scientific theories describe things as they &quot;really are&quot; is questionable. Our view of the world changes with time; it always has. None of this is to suggest that there is no true reality or that science can get no closer by degrees of describing the world; just that the end goal will always be an end goal.<br />Rescher's view is of a realistic pragmatism; science is judged by utility. We use our theories because they work, they help us predict, and becasue of this they are the truest we have. Far from the &quot;vulgar pragmatism&quot; of Rorty or Fish which, to a degree, disavows reason as just another way of knowing, Rescher's view of science makes reason that much more important. As fallible, limited beings, it seems the best tool we have. <br />My only complaint is that for those familiar with these issues, this book may come off as repetitive. Indeed, about half way through, I found myself guessing, rightly, what the author would say next. All in all, a fairly easy, yet very enlighening read. In addition, I would also reccoment Popper's &quot;Conjectures and Refutations&quot; and Susan Haack's &quot;Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate&quot;.	2003-04-20

In the early and mid -90's, it seems that there was a push to popularize science. Authors came out in droves to write books the public could understand on what seemed beyond the publics understanding. Dunbar actually remembers, in one section, that it was not too long ago that any bookstore had a FICTION section (maybe even subdivided by type) and a NONFICTION section in which everything from physics to music history was shelved together. Those days are no more. <br />This book's goal is not only to tell the laypublic that science is exciting, worthy of attention, and not in the least the strawman that cultural relativists have set up for them. The problem (the big one, that is) is that he never really makes the point. For the first 2/3rds of the book (in my view, the most interesting bit), Dunbar gets no-where near that topic - talking instead about how humans from all cultures, and animals from many species have used a scientific outlook to solve problems. As the animal section is likely the most counter-intuitive, that is the best section here. <br />For a while, too, we also talk about (in a good, but really irrelevant chapter) about how chimpanzees have developed, to a smaller degree than us, the same kind of social thinking that we have. They run in hierarchies of rank, they engage in deceptive psychological trickery (obviously requiring a sense of relating to others) and develop complex social relations. Dunbars point here is that maybe evolution gave us much more ability to understand social relations better than the natural sciences. If so, that would very well explain the overwhelming popularity of the \\"human sciences\\" like sociology, psychology and law, but all in all, this is a very loose connection made by Dunbar. He never actually ties it in.<br />Another interesting part of the book, although a subtle one, is Dunbars decidedly instrumental stance on why we do science. I'm not sure how many scientists this will [annoy], but I know most scientists do not seriously hold instrumentalism. For Dunbar, science is instrumental in that we do it because our brains have evolved by making sense of (or observing sense in?) the world and gaining control over it by hypothesis testing. Dunbar really says no more about it than this, whereas most scientists figure that science (and with it, truth) are useful in themselves; science can be used instrumentally (technology) but truth is also good in itself. I agree with Dunbar.<br />In conclusion, an interesting book and a very easy read for those uninitiated with science. Even those who know science quite well, this will not be a complete waste of time as it will only take a few hours. Still though, if we are looking for good popularizations, go with Dawkins \\"Unweaving the Rainbow\\" (see my review) and Carl Sagan's \\"Demon Haunted World\\". On the difficulties of thinkilng scientifically, try John Horgan's \\"The End of Science\\".	2003-04-11

This book is about the 'pragmatic' concept of democracy and the law in it; aobut 3/4 of the book is spent on the former, 1/4, the latter subject. Posner believes that 'democracy' has been misconstrued by many academics (my, how he scorns academics) and many left liberals, to whom 'democracy' means that everyone shall take an interest in politics, everyone shall vigorously deliberate with friends and neighbors and everyone will vote with an informed and semi-altruistic (\\"common good\\") mind. To Posner, this is an impossible utopia. <br />Posner, and I agree with him, would rather \\"democracy\\" stand for a system where we vote for leaders so that they, not we, can take the interest in politics. Part of Posners point lies in highlighting that deliberative democracy (the kind outlined in the preceeding paragraph as opposed to his concept of pragmatic democracy)is prevelant amongst activists and academics precisely because they, being interested in political issues, find it easy to convince themselves that everyone else must be too. They are also more likely to associate with others that have similar intersts, helping to reinforce the belief. Posner's pragmatic democracy is defended against deliberative democracy from a variety of angles (winner take all or proportional representation, how far should free speech be taken, FEC regulations, majoritarianism or countermajoritarianism, state v. federal, etc.) Keep in mind that Posner is not arguing that we should not strive to increase peoples participation in politics, but that assuming everyone to be capable, intersted and responsible enough to live up to deliberative ideals is a goal just short of giving society a 100% makeover. <br /> The second bit of the book is on law and the pragmatic concept: that is, law as an extension of practical reasoning, not legal reasoning, of which Posner argues there is no such concrete thing. Judges, while reccomended to stick to law if it it's instruction is undeniably clear, should look atdifficult cases (where a clause may not have direct application or is simply ambiguous) as, in a sense, creating law where it did not exist before. All of this, he couches in the over-broad argument of reasoning from likely consequences. Why does this not, per se, lead him to out-and-out judicial activism? Becuase a few of the consequnces of such activism are loss of continuity if a clauses application is excessively changed, loss of judicial credibility, and decrease in peoples ability to follow law as they read it to apply. The average person, Posner suggests, should be able to predict how the judge will rule. All of this he applies to two cases in particular: Bush v. Gore and Clinton's impeachment (which due to Posner's tendency to wander into unrelated topics, he never quite gets around to). Unfortunately, this section can be skipped if you've read both Posner's \\"The Problems of Jurisprudence\\" (see my review) and his two books on Bush v. Gore and the Clinton impeachment. <br />Still there are some problems. The book being on the two subjects of pragmatic philosophy and pragmatic law, he never ties the two together. Maybe he assumed the connection was self evident but the one does not follow from the other. Also, Posner's polymathic tendency to wander from tangent to tangent sometimes in the space of a few pages, was more noticeable in this book then others. Especially the chapter on Kelsen v. Hayek on law stuck out as irrelevant. Another strange example is that Posner's first broaching of Bush v. Gore led to a lengthy digression on third parties and proportional representation that, while stimulating, was never tied back to Bush v. Gore as the chapter simply ends. Third fault: we've read many of these ideas before in Posners other books (which I strongly reccomend in addition to this one). This one is just a bit more in depth about what is meant by pragmatic law and democracy. <br />In conclusion, this book is still spectacular, engaging and exemplary of Posner's intense and sparkling wit. I did not deduct any stars from the three above faults because had those faults not been present, this book may have had 7 stars (if that were only possible!) Like many others, I disagree with much of Posner (preferring a textualism closer to Scalia) but have to admit that without this guy, law might be a bit more dull!!	2003-04-08

Like many people might, I looked at the title of this one and fell in love. \\"Social construction of what?\\" I'm in, I said to myself, for a great 'take em down' kind of book a la Dawkins and Sokal and, honestly, I love those kind of books. Well, I used to; untill Hacking took all the fun out!!<br />Why do I say that? Because I've been fooled all these years by gross caricaturizations of social constructionism (which, as were told, ALWAYS must be synonymous with relativism). This book, the only neutral one I've seen, is devoted to explaining, I think, to both sides of the debate (if you want to call it that!) that there is much more middle ground than is realized. Like most answers to most questions, the most likely answer to \\"Are you a social constructivist?\\" should be \\"It depends on the circumstance\\". <br />Hacking, a philosopher of science, goes through different meanings of social construction: on the less contreversial side, we have laws and I.Q. Not many will say these aren't real in the sense that they work, but besides that they don't really exist. You can't hold them, directly observe them; they are social tools. In the middle, you have mental disorders and averages. Like the others, they don't exist outside of our classification of them. (one might make a case for mental retardiation, but ask five psychiatrists what \\"schizophrenia\\" is and you will get five different answers). The most contreversial, of course, are things like gender and physical matter. Both of these things are observable, thus, it is hard t osee how social construction can change anything with them. Hacking calmly explains how some people suggest you can. <br />Anyhow, Hackings point is that most of us, however small a degree, are social constructionists about something; we just didn't know it. For my part, on Hackings three part quiz (try it, you'll like it!) I scored a 4-5-1. I never would've realized that by reading more of the polarized books about the science wars and the straw-men therein. Makes me woner...Are the science wars social constructs?....	2003-03-31

I've not read any others in the &quot;great philosophers&quot; series but I have read a few of the &quot;x in 90 minutes&quot; and &quot; on x&quot; series (very similar in that they run about 70 pages each and are meant to serve as brief layperson's overviews). From what I know of this type of book, this one is quite badley done. <br />   As a long time fan of Popper, I sympathize with how Mr. Raphael must have felt in attempting this project. Karl Raimond Popper was a thinker whose ideas lead him from and to many topics. From ontological speculation (realism) to epistemology (critical rationalism) to the progress of science (conjecture and refutation) to ethics (a very bizarre and unfortunately not so discript pragmatic liberal humanism) to politics (democracy with again, not so discript piecemeal engineering). If you read his autobiography &quot;An Unended Quest&quot;, he even has a philosophy of music! <br />   For all that, Mr. Raphael could have done 10 times better than he did. Out of all the ideas above, Mr. Raphael talks about only conjecture and refutation (in 10 intro pages that compares in attitude to a kid being forced to eat her brussel sprouts). <br />   The next 49 pages are spent discussing Popper's views on the impossibility of historical prophecy. Not that these views arent important but in light of Popper's humongous contribution to the philosophies of science and epistemology (and the non-contriversial nature, at least in todays world, of Popper's anti-historicism) focusing, by in large, the whole book on it is putting pages to bad use. <br />   What caused me, though, to give the book 2 stars (I may have given it 4 otherwise) is that the book is marketed as an introduction to the ideas of Popper for those who've either never heard of him or never read of him. Had this book been marketed as an intro specifically to his anti-historicism, it would have been much easier to swallow. As it is, the reader taking this as an apropos introduction will beinfinitely misled. <br />   Fortunately there are better introductions. Bryan Magee's &quot;Philosophy in the Real World: An introduction to Karl Popper&quot; is, with maybe 40 more pages than this volume, a much better, more accurate, and proportional volume written by someone who knew Popper as a teacher and friend. For the student who has more time, Geoffrey Stokes &quot;Popper: Philosophy, Politics and the Scientific Method&quot; is a book that examines, first, Popper's political philosophy and works backwards to reveal how his philosophy of science gets him there. The best introduction, however, is going to be Popper's own &quot;In Search of a Better World&quot;.	2003-03-26

If you're a long-time fan, you've read these ideas before. If you are a newcomer, there are better books to start with. <br />   For all that, the first essay, \\"The Logic and Evolution of Scientific Theory\\" is the best short summary of Popper's views on science that I've read.

Also, this book, I'm quite sure for the first time, gives us Popper's views towards international policy. 'Waging Wars for Peace', an excerpt from a radio interview, is pretty timely in 2003 and reminds us that there can be no thing as an absolute pacifist. Not destroying someone certain to kill only postpones. The title essay, at 6 pages, is another timely celebration of technology; timely because many on the right and left (for different reasons about different techonologies) are preaching against technologies while failing to see the many good sides. <br />   All in all, a quick and fairly worthwhile read.

Whereas Popper's terseness occasionally led him to vagueries, Notturno is always crisp. <br />Second, books on Popper tend to rehash his views (which the authors either understand or not - 50/50). Notturno extends Popper's thought. Never quite disagreeing with any of it, Notturno does find fault with a few of Poppers vagueries and corrects them. The essay herein - \\"induction and demarcation\\" is notable as it focuses on Poppers tendency to mislead on certain views he held. The distinction between falsification and falsifiability, the problem not being of induction altogether but the fact that bad inductive conclusions, unlike deduction, will not point to a false premise, and from it the fact that Popper did not quite believe all induction to be invalid. <br /> Some other good essays to note (in addition to the ones listed two reviews below) are \\"education and the open society\\" which is a good essay on why current education methods might fail (his similarity to John Dewey in this, and other, regards always amazes me). Also 'inference and deference' is a great article exposing the failure of logic to justify, contra popular philosophic practice, deference to authority. Not barring it outright, Notturno highlights two errors of thought that lead us to defer abdicatingly to authority: defensive thinking and poitical thinking. If there was an essay focusing solely on these two concepts (this one only devotes a few paragraphs) then I would've had to give the book seven stars. Also worthy of mention is the afterword \\"what is to be done\\" about post-communism and how a proper trainsitiion toa truly open-society can take place. In short, very good book. If you are a Popper fan and are tired of reading secondary books that only rehash, never expand, this is the best book I can think of.	2003-03-10

There are, in general, two types of American history that one can be fascinated by. The physical (wars, homesteading, etc,) and the intellectual (creation of law, American philosophy, etc.) The second type of history is decidedly the lesser studied of the two. There have been few good books on America's intellectual tradition(s). Commager's is one.<br />Commager's 'thesis' is that pragmatism or variants thereof (not always explicitly so) is our nations motto. DeTocqueville, shortly after the founding, commented on American emphasis on practicality over the more European abstractions. Commager elequently backs up his thesis and gives us 450 pages of reading pleasure in the process.<br />The book is selective in that it tends to focus on the scientific and poltical reactions to social darwinism (which caught on like wildfire in the states, second only to the backlash it inspired). If I had to guess the thinker Commager most admires in his book, it would be Lester Ward, who developed devestating arguments against social darwinism, heightening the importance of environment to evolutionary thought. Commager is even more selective when, while rightly championing these developments, he doesn't talk much about its more extreme and ridiculous incantation in todays cultural relativism. So many subjects, so few trees!<br />Anyhow, if you are interested in exploring pragmatism, the rise of evolutionary environmentalism or American radicalism in politics (which is deeply connected to the previous two) then this is a great book.	2003-03-06

When I was a libertarian who didn't realize I was a libertarian (I figured I was just a conservative who was smart), this was the book that gave me my diagnosis - &quot;You might be a libertarian if...&quot;. This book does and does not serve that purpose. <br />   Charles Murray, infamous co-author of The Bell Curve, writes with clarity, simplicity and understanding about libertarianism. He gives us a cost/benefit understanding of libertarianism, i.e., how much does the program cost vs. how much benefit (in relation to the program's non-existence) do we derive. The more centralization, the less benefit is generally derived and the more the cost is increased. As I said, clear, simple and insightful. <br />   There's one problem - this is not always known as libertarianism. Murray tells us the libertarian rule of thumb is &quot;The more local control, the bettter.&quot; No, that's anti-federalism, which tells us that government that is local is best. Libertarianism, by contrast, tells us that government that is minimal is best. A socialist town could please and anti-federalist but not a libertarian. By contrast, a large country with a small centralized government might do the opposite. I am both an anti-federalist AND a libertarian. Still, when reading Murray's book, beware of the difference as he doesn't explain it.  <br />Despite that flaw, I highly reccomend this book to those who are not sure what libertarianism is, are curious whether they are libertarians themselves, or are new libertarians and want a good read with good clarification. A better read (in addition to or in place of) is &quot;The Libertarian Reader&quot; edited by David Boaz. A collection of essays, the reader accurately conveys the diversity of libertarian thinkers better than this book does.	2003-03-04

Before this book, I'd only heard of Michael Oakeshott through name-dropping from conservative friends. No one but that small conservative circle ever mentioned him and after reading this, I can and can not see why.<br />  As noted below, this is an expanded collection of essays ranging from Oakeshott's views of political rationalism's follies to exegesis of Hobbes. The common thread of all of these essays is Oakeshotts distaste for the rationalistic tendency of, not faith in reason, but overconfidence in it. Reason, Oakeshott reasons (ha-ha)is an instrument. Life is a collection of emotions, faiths, conquests, mistakes, and a vast array of experiences that may or may not have to do with reason at all. Thus, the mistake made in political thought is its overreliance on utopian, &quot;I know better than you&quot; reason. Oakeshott, with this as a springboard, makes his case for a conservative libertarianism.<br />  Oakeshott hints that this rationalism is all the most relevant on the 'left'. I'm not sure this is quite accurate, after all, how could we explain John Dewey, Herbert Marcuse and Richard Rorty, but as I said, Oakeshott only hints. Scott Ryan brilliantly points out that someone like Ayn Rand and I'd suggest, Plato, give the 'right' a tainted legacy of rationalism as well. The problem with Oakeshotts essays in the section on rationalism in politics is that after he expounds his view that with rationalisms inadequacies, political philosophy becomes muddy, he spends 300 more pages on political philosophy. It's like a bad joke!!<br />  What this book is good for is section 3 (on Hobbes) and section 4 (on conservatism and politics). As Oakeshott is more conservative that liberarian, this book is a great exposition of why conservatives (or those true to the label) are how they are preferring big government where social tradition is concerned but small government in economics. Why does conservatism put such high value on tradition? Why does it see welfare centralization with skepticism? Why the religious tendencies? All of these are, advertently or not, elucidated in section 3 and 4.<br />  Beware, Oakeshott has a tendency to be wordy - not in the sense of content, but in the, &quot;If I can say it effectively in 100 words, I'll tack on an extra 300 for kicks,&quot; kind of way. About the physical book; as noted below, &quot;The Liberty Fund&quot; makes a habit out of publishing inexpensive, impressively beautiful books.

Honestly, I read this book about a year and a half ago. Since, though, I've reread several sections of it. Bethell gives a fascinating account of the history of market, and not-so-marketlike, ideas. Yes, this book is a polemic of sorts and Bethell provides a few chapters explaining (very well) market theories like the tragedy of the commons and even explaining Marx fairly accurately. So the book DOES have a bias, but the research and statements within are very accurate. <br />   The two chapters that stood out to me were one near the beginning, showing us how America originated as a quasi-capitalist system of personal icentive. Second, and most interesting of all, was a full chapter devoted to the entirely strange story of Robert Owen and his New Melody utopia. Long and short, Owen was a millionare turned socialist (notice its only the very rich and very poor that are socialists?) who lost his bankrole on a bizzare utopian scheme, wherein he bought land in the U.S., got volunteers, and lost it all some years later because the workmen turned lazy. The reason I highlight this chapter is because as important as the facts of New Melody are, they are seldom collected in book form (at least not ones in print). Here, Bethell devotes AN ENTIRE CHAPTER to the catastrophe. Buy this book, if only for that. <br />   Still, even without that chapter, this book is a goody. Marx and Mill are discussed, the soviet union experiment, even contemporary issues like property and the environment, and intellectual property rights are discussed. Overall, a good book that will get the unconvinced thinking and get the convinced even more convinced. Convinced?	2003-02-27
US	37928338	R3K8TTUB3JE8JQ	1568024185	869711057	Rulemaking: How Government Agencies Write Law and Make Policy	Books	3	14	17	N	N	I finished with more questions than answers.	I am on an endless quest, it seems; to find a book on the administrative state that is informative while being at least mildly enthusiastic about its subject. This book starts out enthusiastic. This book certainly started with enthusiasm. The first chapter, in fact, is devoted to convincing us why the administrative state is a superb American invention (a view I do not always share!) Chapter 5, which is devoted to public participation in the Admin. state also bubbles with giddiness.<br />   Like a horse on crack-cocaine, though, this book stars with gallant speed, slows down fast and ends with an mild gasp. I'm sure this was not the authors intention. There are two main reasons. First, as the book is structured so that each chapter examines another area of admin. state rule making (oversight from the 3 branches, rulemaking structure, inherent paradoxes of the process) the first two chapters, which are almost overviews of the rest of the book, builds up high expectations. For example, when the first chapter lightly nibbles at rulemaking's structural issues, tow paragraphs in we are told that we will need to wait untill another chapter for a discussion. The author does this repeatedly throughout the book, thus leaving the reader in a constant hang. <br />   The second reason for the flickering finish of the book is that, and unfortunately as with most admin. state books, not much save for completely varied anecdotal information is offered. How are rules written, the book asks; it depends on the administration, it answers. What about modes of public participation and debate? Depends on the rules of the comission. After a while, its almost pointless to read the next chapter as we begin to guess the answer to each question posed.<br />   The reason, though, for the three stars is this: Chapter 1 (on justifications for the admin. state), Chapter 3(paradoxes inherent in the rulemaking process) and Chapter 7 (the role of theory in rulemaking and its reform) are actually decent and informative chapters. Vagueness aside, they do provide useful anecdotes. Also Chapters 3 and 7 present ideas, discussions and points that are all but ignored in other books on admin. state rulemaking. Buy the book, read those 3 chapters and maybe skim the rest.	2003-02-25

This book looked very promising. After all, anyone whose read either Feyerabend or Lakatos knows that they had geared up to write, \\"For and Against Method\\" cut short by Lakatos's death. We've read \\"Against Method\\", just never the \\"For..\\". This book was to be our chance!<br />Why 'was'? Well, the correspondence that takes up most of this book is funny, personal, warm and caring. If you're looking for clarification of the thinkers, look elsewhere.  Each letter will start \\"Dearest Imre/Paul, I just got your last article and am going to send you one of mine. Let's get together in Boston next week. By the way, I've something nasty to say about Popper/Kuhn/Searle. Take care, Imre/Paul.\\" Not very insightful. To be sure, these letters ARE EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING and insightful into each thinker's personality. For instance, from reading this, it is easy to see that a large reason Feyarabend was a scientific 'anarchist' is because he loved to disagree with everyone and taking sides meant he had to agree with someone, thus spoil his devilish fun. In Lakatos, I see someone who wished he could be Feyerabend but could never shake that bugbear called common sense. As I said - insightful into each personality, not each philosophy. <br />There were, however, other parts of the book. The most educational was the opening dialogue (actually written by Matteo Matterlinski) where Feyerabend and Lakatos lay out their views and criticize the other's. Next, we have the Lakatos lectures which spend 7/8ths of the time reviewing other people's views and only then explaining his own (very badly, I may add). The two appendices were interesting. Lakatos and Feyerabend wrote on their views towards academic freedom. As one may expect, Lakatos is the more conservative here. <br />Still, I must give three stars as the correspondence was a treat to read. It will have you laughing, shaking your head and oddly enough, coming away with HUGE amounts of respect for both thinkers as their playful intellectual jabs at eachother and willingness to be on the recieving, as well as the giving, end, exemplify how all sciences should conduct themselves.	2003-02-18

Routledge Classics has done us all - fans of clear thinking, clear writing and great literature - a real service by re-releasing Karl Popper's intellectual biography &quot;An Unended Quest&quot;. In additiion to offering informative accounts of how he came about his greatest theories, he gives us entertaining life stories as well.<BR>    <BR>   As we would expect from Popper, this book is set up similar to his problem solving methodology: (P1)- (TT)-(EE)-(P2). For those unfamiliar, this stands for problem 1, tentative theory, error elimination, problem 2 - and this is how Popper, at least, according to his biography, led his life. A problem would arise, he'd think about it enough to offer a best conjecture, go about watching its results (recieving criticism from others as well as himself, setting aside a refuted theory if necessary) and this would invariably lead to new and more challenging problems. It is party because of this ongoing method that Popper descrbes himself as &quot;the happiest philosopher I ever met.&quot; <br />   The first half of the book is especially thrilling. Popper shifts from a chapter relating personal events and development with &quot;digression&quot; chapters relating how these personal events led to theories, ideas and problems to be solved. Of note to me, with a B.A. in music, were the chapters exploring Poppers love for 'classical' music. Especially of suprise here was that he has many of the same tastes and reasons for them as I and he discusses many of those ideas in what could be the most exciting 'digression' in the book. <br />   The second half of the book concentrates more on ideas and lesson events. This was the period where Popper, although still looked at as unconventional, was a bit more accepted. This period saw him write &quot;The Open Society and It's Enemies&quot;, &quot;Poverty of Historicism&quot;, and &quot;Conjectures and Refutations&quot;. As most of this is about explaining his ideas, not the events therefrom, those familiar with Popper's writings may get a bit bored here. Still, with prose as crystal-clear and exciting as Popper's, nobody - from the novice to the professional philosopher - will want to miss a paragraph!	2003-02-15

A short while ago, I wrote a favorable review of &quot;Against Method&quot; by Paul Feyerabend. This book, though, is much more difficult to swallow. Feyerabend suggests that many Western intellectuals (by this, he usually means Karl Popper) are skeptical of relativism and after reading this, I can see why. Feyerabend is almost too good at what he does. The relativism, or Rorty-like 'pragmatism', that he seems to champion, undercuts him at every turn.<br />   First, this book focuses more on culture than scientific belifs. Feyerabend makes clear from the get-go that he is a believer in 'democratic relativism&quot; - literally, that what works for one culture may not work for another. This is really not a radical view untill you take Feyerabends conclusion that because of this, there can be no objective truths, standards, or even critierion for deciphering either. Here's how he undercuts himself though. For Feyerabend, this relativism demands that we recognize our ability to learn from other cultures, engage in dialogue and even argue from time to time. The problem is that if reason is just as good (no better) than any other way of proceeding, it is difficult to imagine how dialogue can proceed, outside of a reasoned structure. At the end of the first essay, Feyerabend stretches further still. If quarks and gods are both theoretical (that is, not empirical) then isn't it strange to regard quarks as more 'real' than gods. Well, Paul, not if you consider that quarks are a) open to falsification, b) accountable to scientific prediction that CAN falsify them and c) have so far enabled us to make accurate predictions without being falsified, then I guess the answer is &quot;no&quot;.  <br />   Many readers will also read this book as a diatribe against Karl Popper. I would urge these readers, if they've not read Popper, to first read either &quot;Conjectures and Refutations&quot; or &quot;Objective Knowledge&quot;. Many of Feyerabends characterizations are wrong. Feyerabend constantly underestimates Popper's recongintion of theory and ideology in conjectures and observations. Feyerabend also miscarachterizes Popper's falsification as a view that as soon as an individual sees her theory falsified, she should abandon it as quick as possible. Nope! She should defend it while keeping in mind that she could be wrong. Third, Feyerabend misconstrues Popper as an elitist of science who claims that Western scientific conclusions are the most valid. Popper would be the first to admit that good ideas can come from anywhere. Popper's only suggestion is that matriculation of those ideas into our lives involves making up our minds, which involves reason and that empirical methods are good insofar as they HAVE TO BE the common denominator of intersubjective discussion.  Overall, Feyerabends conclusions are all-in-all self defeating, his arguments are largely misunderstandings and his book is verging on being a waste of time.	2003-02-11

In Popper's case, the views advanced were that all knowldedge must be held as tentative and that real intellectual progress comes not from verifying true theories (which can never be 'for sure) but in falsifying and eliminating old ones (which you only need to do once). The critics misinterpreted and Popper did repeat himself time and time again. <br /> This is one of the very few bad things about the book. Honestly, if you've read Popper before (Conjectures and Refutations, Objective Knowledge, Logic of Scientific Discovery) this book will have little, if any, to add. If you've not, this is a great introduction. <br />There are 3 sections: On Knowledge, On History and a section for miscellaneous essays. The first section touches on Popper's views on how we recieve, criticize, falsify and act on knowledge. The second is an expansion of the first. Here, Popper focuses on historical events hee deems important: Immanuel Kant's phiosophical formulation, the invention of the book. He also gets a tad bit into politics, where a liberal democracy is preferred. <br />It is the third section, though, that is the payoff. Essays ranging in diversity from \\"How I See Philosophy\\" to \\"What Does The West Believe In\\". The best essay in the book, \\"Toleration and Intellectual Responsibility\\", is a critical rationalist's look at the role of intellectuals (Popper carefully avoids snobbery here) role in perpetuating a tolerant, non-violent society. As crucial now in '03 as when he gave the lecture in '82.<br /> To conclude, if you are new to Popper, this is a good intro (but Conjectures and Refutations or Popper Selections might still be better. If you've read those or much other Popper before, you will probably find yourself able to guess what Popper says ineach essay without much problem. You can safely skip this one.	2003-02-09

As with (to a lesser extent) Feyerabend, Kuhn wrote his contreversial opus in the mid 60's. I think it's safe to say that anything hinting at anti-authoritarianism, as it seemed to do on the surface, was begging to be misunderstood. Honestly, after 'paradigm shift' became a bastardized slogan for everything from class-struggle to new-age revelations through meditation, I'm not sure Thomas Kuhn ever recovered from this world-wide misunderstanding. What I read in &quot;The Road Since Structure&quot; corroborates that as we find an author that constantly needs to clarify, &quot;This is what I'm saying. This is what I'm not saying. Now that we're clear, let me repeat myself!&quot;<br />   First, as anyone who's read &quot;Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; knows, Kuhn has no talent for clear writing. Nothing's changed since. These essays, although more concise and to the point (perhaps that's Kuhn having learned his lesson) are still difficult reads. The first section, I think, is the book's 'payoff'. It is here that he reiterates, clarifies and expands on what is and is not scientific revolution, incommensurability and paradigm. Two essays in particular, &quot;What are Scientific Revolutions?&quot; and &quot;The Road Since Structure&quot; are worth the price of the book alone.<br />   The second section consists of replies to Kuhns many and in an ideological sense, far ranging critics. Most of these papers were written for symposia and are difficult in the sense of listening to only one end of a phone dialogue. As he is generally responding to papers of others, without access to those papers, it is akward reading to say the least. Still, for those of us scientific philosophy nuts, the essays &quot;Reflections on My Critics&quot; (part of a symposium featuring Lakatos, Popper and Feyerabend amongst others) and &quot;The Natural and the Human Sciences&quot; are excellent illucidations of Kuhns thought. <br />Honestly, the interview, I didn't like. Much of it is Thomas Kuhns history and as for the reviewer below that bemoans a self-absorbed Kuhn talking about himself and his &quot;intellectual project&quot;, I'm not sure what else you should expect from an interview of a philosopher. Interviewers like to ask about the interviewee and philosopher's like to talk about what they work on. Honestly though, if you are at all familiar with Kuhns life, this interview offers little that you didn't already know.	2003-02-08

Paul Feyerabend, in writing this book during the anti-authoritarian, hippie infested, mid 60's was, like Kuhn, just asking for heavy misinterpretation. This should make us want to read the book all the more. Feyerabend, as you will discover, is NOT anti-science, Feyerabend is NOT anti-reason and for god's sake, FEYERABEND IS NOT A SUBJECTIVIST! What he is advocating is scientific anarchism, meaning: science does not proceed by any set of rules, criterion or methods. So, as may suprise you, Feyerabend is not even that contraversial.<br />Feyerabend supports himself like this. Science operates from theories which inextricably use observation, preconcieved theories (like \\"the earth is moving right now\\"), language and subject-dependent vantage point. Since none of these are completely, or ever could be, accurate, no theory can ever be proved, and so many theories would be refuted because of changing paradigms, preconceptiois and world-views affecting all of the above, science would never make any progress. Thus, if there are any rules, they are pragmatic hence science is purely instrumental meaning it can only be judged in retrospect and rules only exist situationally. All may be broken. <br />So how is Feyerabend not contraversial? Between Popper (all theories are inextricable from preconceptions that sometimes are shown erroneous), Dewey (science is pragmatic and instrumental) and Kuhn (paradigm shifts mark heavy changes in science and because of their scope, make scientific change excruciating and unreliable), all of these Feyerabendian critiques have been made before. The other detriment is that while he makes strategic points against method, it would've helped his credibility if he guided us to a new starting point. If we can only judge science in retrospect, but still can't even be sure that are preconceptions won't get in the way, than how could we even do THAT. An attempt at an answer (even in guess form) would have been nice. <br />To his credit, the book is written well (certainly not difficult to read), is thought provoking (this coming from a Popperian) and does make some good adjustments to what came before. Popper's insistence that theories, when replacing others, need to be at least as explanative as the old ones. Feyerabend smartly answers with a quick retort - 'Why? Why couldn't a new theory solve most of the problems so well, that we use it assuming the rest will be figured out in due course?' There is also a brilliant post-script where Feyerabend advocates 'seperation of science and state' and makes a beautiful case for science education that teaches many 'hows' instead of many 'whats'. Also his \\"postscript on relativism\\" and three prefaces (original, third edition and chinese edition) give a much deserved slap in the face to those that still look at Feyerabend as a relativist and non-believer in science. They need to read this book like they should've the first time. You should read it too.	2003-02-06

For a while now, I've been a big fan of Karl Popper and it's good to see that his work is getting some (not all) of the attention it deserves. This book, while far from comprehensive, is a decent addition to any student of Popper and while explanatory, is far from an uncritical exposition.<br /> As Mr. Champion below pointed out, this book has a 'top down' theory. Wheras it is generally assumed that Popper's epistemology and metaphysical theories are the foundation on which his political (and metaethical for that matter) philosophy rests, Stokes sees it the other way round. This actually makes a bit more sense to me as his political and epistemological theory are only somewhat cohesive with eachother. Pointed out are things like Popper's instrumentalism in politics in contrast to his 'knowledge for its own sake' epistemology. (I was glad to hear John Dewey's name mentioned here as any Popper reader would be wise to get into JD). Also the dualism held between objective fact and subjective value is pointed out (mainly because Popper never offers a satisfactory bridge between the two).<br /> Stokes seems to very much like Popper's political thought while still calling falsifiability into question as an exclusive demarcation between science and non. (He correctly mentions Feyerabend's quip that too many scientific theories later deemed accurate were initially falisfied.) In fact, I think it's safe to say that Stokes, while laying out Popper's philosophy accurately albeit hurriedly, ends up with ambivolence. Every philosophy has holes, no philosopher has thought of everything or wiped out every contradiction in their work. This book should help the next generation understand, examine, and strengthen Popper's critical rationalism.	2003-02-03

Yes, I was excited when I read this collection, but the further I went, the more something just didn't feel right. <br />   I came away convinced that the authors should have subtitled their collection &quot;apologia for the constitution&quot; as every essay (save for one on campaign finance), no matter if it was on the two party system, amending the constitution or state vs. federal pwer, always reached the same conclusion - &quot;It's perfect the way it is. Don't change a thing, really!&quot; Not only that, but it felt to me like the reasoning used was simply an instrument for arrival at this desired conclusion. In other words, the essays crossed the line from polemic to propoganda. A few examples:<br />   In an essay written to convince us that a two-party system is the most democratic of all, the author gives one sole reason. Only in a two party system can a candidate be elected by over 50% - hence, a majority. The more parties, the more you divide the vote. Why does this seem like a strange argument? Because most people don't vote anyhow and there's much reason to believe that it is BECAUSE of the lack of choice casued by that system. (When we do the math, G.W. Bush garnered maybe 30% of all possible votes as many people didn't cast any vote) It seems plausable to me that by representing more viewponts by increasing third party viablility, we would increase voter turnout and we'd wind up with higher overall percentages in any given camp. Sound far-fetched? Too many political scientists have entertained this notion for the essayist to blindly ignore it.<br />   Second example: In an article on state v. federal power, the essayist unqestionably (and I mean this literally, not figuratively) sides with federal power. She blithely tells us that the founders wanted the federal government to be larger than state governments but doesn't explain why, if that was the case, the ninth or tenth amendments needed to be written or why we settled on the name &quot;the UNITED STATES&quot; instead of just America. She didn't even ask why, if the federalists were really as federalistic as she draws them, acts on a national scale like voting was constitutionally assigned to be conducted by the seperate states. <br />   I can't say unilaterally that these essays are wrong simply becasue I disagree with the conclusions (despite the fact that, for the most part, I do). I simply wish that the authors had went about proving their cases by arguing for the conclusions. Instead, each essay simply picks a conclusion and skates smoothly towards it. Not much substance.	2003-01-30
US	37928338	R3JXOO1S9INZPA	0312254598	617022471	The 15 Biggest Lies in Politics	Books	3	6	6	N	N	While not at all in depth, eye opening nonetheless!	If you're reading this review, you've probably correctly observed the play-pen behavior that politics, candidacy, political journalism, and everything else inside the beltway has become. And if you're reading this review, you may be either in the dark about the specific ailments that've lead to this stranger-than-science-fiction climate of symptoms, or you're pretty sure what the problems are but want to hear the authors take. Whichever the case, you've come to a pretty good place. <br />   The two authors (from my understanding, a republican and a democrat, not that these terms mean anything anymore) have written a pretty provacative and insightful book, attempting to 'prove' points as far from conventional fox-news wisdom as the irrelevance of the abortion debate, to PAC's as a healthy part of democracy. In the end, they are pretty convincing on all 15 of their points. <br />   The problem, though, comes from the fact that there are 15 chapters, all focusing on the shattering of a different political 'myth.' The result is that while this is an entertaining and eye-opening book, there is no coherence at all. The only coherence, itself inadvertent, was the midsection of the book where there are a few chapters in a row on what the authors feel is the oft-exagerated power of money and special interest on political campaigns and public policy. These chapters are especially eye-opening as they may be the hardest for most people to swallow, but taken togheter they become seriously redundant. If the authors had thought about it more, they should've reduced these 3 chapters to 1 which would've left more room to be more in depth in other chapters. <br />   The other fault (or virtue, depending on where you stand) is that while non-partisan over all, this book will likely appeal to the more conservative or libertarian voter. From the authors beliefs against McCain-Feingold campaign reform or gun control as crime reducer to their support of religion as an effective tool in politics to their crushing conclusions that social security as a fraud, most (not all) of their positions are those recently taken up by those on the right. <br />   In conclusion, despite the above glitches, this book is witty, erudite, 50% entertaining and 50% informative. Personally speaking, my favorite chapters were 1) that discussing the relative unimportance of the abortion debate to most people (look at polls, it's true), 2) shattering the myths that republicans are for small government and democrats are compassionate, 3) the chapter on the myth of gun contol being a crime reducer (as another reviewer pointed out, very persuasive) and 4) cracking the myth tht tax cuts are good (while I don't agree with their conclusion, another well-argued chapter). As the blurb on the books cover points out, this is a good \\"self defense manual for voters\\". A similar book readers may enjoy is \\"Ten Things You Can't Say in America\\" by libertarian author Larry Elder, who takes up very similar points.	2003-01-28
US	37928338	R27CFUMKS7MGMC	0415931932	196149499	Fixing Elections: The Failure of America's Winner Take All Politics	Books	3	12	17	N	N	Great Premise, Good research. Bad execution!	This is one of those books that it's a shame to give 3 stars to. The premise - that a winner-take-all political system not only provides egregiously faulty representation but directly leads to all sorts of strange biproducts - is on target. With the premise set, the author leads us to all sorts of eye-opening statistics relating to the faults of this strange (and in world politics, very rare) election system. <br />   Yes, it is a shame to have to give this work 3 stars, but here's why I did. After the premise and statistics, the rest of the book sees the author lose much of his focus. First, he does not offer any solutions. Once the problem is pointed out, he keeps pointing the problem out. I, a proud member of a third party (Libertarian), was hoping to hear more about our impossible FEC regulations, how failed and successful third party bids might teach us, and about such ideas as proportional representation and other alternatives to \\"first past the post.\\" Unfortunately, we don't get any of it!<br />   Another big complaint is that the second section of the book, where the author writes of candidates over-reliance on polling, sound-bites, attack methods and vague linguistics, is bordering on irrelevant to a discussion of winner-take-all. It, of course, is relevant in the sense that a two-party system, by forcing an \\"either/or\\" decision, becomes more about driving voters away from your competition than about bringing the unconvinced over to your camp. In this sense, the two-party system that political scientists and economists agrree is the result of winner-take-all, exacerbates \\"slam-paigns\\", reliance on polls, media pandering and the like. Still, under any other democratic syetem, the author tacitly assumes that these tactics would be absent but never explains that unlikely belief. <br />   Third, he contradicts himself on a huge point. The first half of the book he writes (in my view, correctly) that the two-party winner-take-all system leads to vague, centristcandidates. The second half of the book, though, takes the opposite view - that it leads to polarization and from it, undemocratic or extremist representation. I fail to see how both apply and the author never tried to convince me that the second view was correct. Consequently, I still don't buy it.<br />   To conclude, this book is great for two types of readers: a) readers who are new to the problem or who need convincing that the winner-take-all - or for that matter, the two party system - doesn't work. Especially provocative is the authors astute observation that many of the problems assumed to be created by \\"big money\\" are in fact creeated by winner-take-all. b) this book is great for those who know that something is rotten in the state of our democratic republic and winner-take-all system but have yet to connect the dots. ...	2003-01-28

No one will ever accuse government of acting like a business and accordingly, there has been a slew of books that suggest that government should. Most authors on the subject have said the same thing: efficiency, competitive incentive and the like are the tools government should adapt in order to have the success that business enjoys. <br />   These authors disagree slightly. The key to effective business management and the trick government has yet to master is the art of trade-off. Instead of making choices based on absolutes and win/lose scenarios, government should decide policy based on maximizing gains while taking small losses. <br />   While this is the main thread of the book, the authors are far from redundant. They apply trade-off technique to many different scenarios: Environmental policy (wherein government should work WITH businesses, not on top of them), procurement of sports teams (wherein state and county government should accept that overbidding does more damage than good), tobacco subsidies (might it be better if tobacco farmers lose their jobs rather than every american contributing to a ridiculous scheme?) and others. <br />   What's more, this book, aside from honestly being the best book on government policy I've read in a year, is completely non-partisan and very objective. The authors are concerned with how to make wise choices and to do this, they focus on how to get there, not preconcieved results. They end up with a regulatory stance on campaign finance and EPA while having a free-market stance on free trade and even private road ownership as a way to reduce traffic at key hours and keep pollution in check. While people may disagree with some of their conclusion, the premise of the book, better living through trade-offs, is a great one that is taken to great heights in this book.	2003-01-25
US	37928338	R302CFDD494K2L	0743442679	852824430	Spin This!: All the Ways We Don't Tell the Truth	Books	1	11	24	N	N	Here's some spin: This book's not completely horrible!	I really do not like writing bad reviews but I do wish people to know what they are and are not getting.<br />   Like some other reviewers, I was hoping for a decent discussion on spin; what, how, why. Instead, this book is an repetitive barage of mildly entertaining anecdotes, slams and profane asides. (I'm not easily offended, but any political writer who uses the word 'bl**job' as much as Press does gets a bit annoying.) That's not to mention that the book could also, and was likely intended to, serve as an advertisement for his CNN show &quot;Crossfire&quot; as he mentions it once per page. <br />   To his credit, this book is non-partisan, candid and from time to time, fun. Still, from his discussions on different kinds of spin, the history of spinning and all the rest, there was not one original thought in these pages. Everything Press presses in this book, we've all thought before while pondering the nature of political spin. With that in mind, it's tough to say whether Press was being deliberately condescending by writing this book, or if that was only the unintended consequence.	2003-01-21

When I first read \\"The Bell Curve\\", I found it hard to question the logic of it. Now, after reading several commentaries, including an essay by Thomas Sowell in the book \\"The Race Wars\\", it is easier to second guess at least parts of the book. I reccomend it with some reservation. Still, the book is unfairly slammed by exagerated reviews. <br />   First, if you are new to the book, you may think the book is about race. It is not. Only chapters 13 and 14 touch on race (and my gues, the authors put these chapters in to make contreversy). One could easily read the book without those chapters and come away with a clear, cogent argument as the two chapters are superfluous. The book is about IQ (and, yes, that is still a contreversial idea.) Anyhow, even if the authors are right about the 18% gap between the average black and white scores, that still leaves an 82% overlay between the two sets of scores. Discrimination based on an 18% chance of being correct is irrational!!<br />   Second, if you've read the negative reviews, you will not only think that race is the agenda of the book, but that the agenda is a \\"eugenic\\" conservative one. Any good history book will show you that the biggest proponents of eugenics, like Harold Laski, Theodore Roosevelt, Beatrice Webb, Emma Goldman and Aldous Huxley were left wingers, and sometimes socialists. Even the 'nazi' ideology that this book is sometimes compared to ignores the fact that the nazis started as a big trade union - decidedly, a left wing idea. To be sure, the authors are libertarian so in a sense, that makes them conservatives - but only in a sense. There's still a wide gap between libertarians and conservatives.<br />   Third and lastly, there have been great arguments made against this book. I strongly suggest that before, during or after this book, one read \\"The Race Wars\\" consisting of essays written about and generally against The Bell Curve. The most engaging and factual was by Thoms Sowell. Sowell argues that we can not be sure that intellegence determines class is possible, but it is just as possible the other way round. Poverty grows up without an abundance of books, quality schooling, 'intellectual' conversation and stimulation that middle-class and rich do have. Couldn't THAT just as easily be the explanation?<br />As said earlier, I do reccomend reading this book. It is thorough, thought-garnering, and eye-opening (in a neutral sense). I would reccomend \\"The Race Wars\\" as a post-script though. \\"The Mismeasure of Man\\" is almost surely the wrong book, as it argues against eugenics which, as we know, is NOT \\"The Bell Curve\\".	2003-01-20

As this is the first anthology of public policy writings I've read, I can't comment on the quality here as compared to other writings. What I can say (after reading about 80% of the essays) is that this is like most anthologies: thorough, varied, and very poorly organized.<br />  The essays here range from everything from philosophy of public policy (Dahl's article) to the tidbits of implementation (Sabatier &amp; Mazmanian's article); from the really well-written (Majone and Wildavsky) to real snoozers (Rubin). With all this variance, the one thing I didn't get is any conflict in views presented. I'm no expert, but I'm sure that public policy experts don't actually agree on as much as these contributors seem to. I can't help getting the feeling that the editors views are amply reflected in these pages.<br />  The other complaint is lack of structure. In particular, the section on &quot;The Players&quot; is put after &quot;Making Public Policy.&quot; In retrospect, this made much of the latter-mentioned section harder to understand. Of course, this is easily remedied. If you do buy this collection (and I would hesitatingly reccomend it) read section 3 before section 2.	2003-01-18

Richard Dawkins was the thinker that introduced me to evolutionary biology. His books give everything one could want - enthusiasm, wit, engagement, substance and splendor. I can't tink of many others I would want writing a book for the laity on the wonder of science. <br />   There are a few problems - the first may be relevant to everyone and the second, to those who've read Dawkins before. The first criticism is that this book starts off with a stated goal. I, Richard Dawkins, do solemnly swear to explain that science is not stuffy, a killjoy, or a myth (as postmodernism would have it.) The problem is that from the title, we suspect the first goal to occupy the bulk of the book but #3 takes up the entire second half, where Dawkins rails against the religious and the superstitious. Of course, I can hardly blame him but this was not the book to do it in because the title would be horribly misleading if it was. <br />   The second problem (applicable mostly to those who've read Dawkins before) is that most of this has been written before - not literally but figuratively. Most of these thing have been explained to us before, either by him, or by Carl Sagan, Isac Asimov or (second half of the book)James Randi and Michael Shermer. <br />   If you want a one stop shop, where you can get a broad overview of science in all its mystery and wonder, than get this and/or Sagan's &quot;Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot;. Otherwise, if you'd like to focus on one piece or aspect of science more indepth, look elsewhere.	2003-01-14

Further, it has always seemed to me that the cliche &quot;We're not a democracy. We're a democratic republic,&quot; was always a subterfuge for denying (while acknowledging) a paradoxical truism. Dahl's extended essay goes a long way in showing that to be correct. <br />   Are we more of a republic or a democracy. Dahl thinks that we have more elements of the former. Using the electoral college, &quot;first past the post&quot; as opposed to proportional senate representation, and the fact that the senate and the president (in the original constitution) were more-or-less picked by federal and state legislatures. So in this sense, as that of any good history book, the founders were not the believers in democracy that high school civics has us believe. <br />   Through all of this, Dahl makes some interesting suggestions. Why shouldn't the senate be abolished. It's raison d'etat, after all, seems to be to give unequal representation (2 members per state regardless of size), and create a more 'enlightened' (6 years, 35 yr. of age minimum) house. But why couldn't a unicameral system, used in most democratic countries, work? Also, he proposes that any house be proportionally represented. Parties send out ballots with a list of candidates, people vote for the party they'd like to see, and each party seats according to percentage of votes. Biproduct? This would get rid of our dead-horse two party system. He suggests some others, but I don't want to spoil the suprise.<br />   Still, Dahl's book is quite flawed. It is extremely one sided. Dahl doesn't even try to give arguments for the electoral college. Well, first, there's the very fact that we are the UNITED STATES of America. If we went by straight popular vote, the state lines would become a mere formality and we might-as-well federalize the whole process. While I agree that it should be set up proportionally rather than winner-take-the-state, it is important, especially during elections, to treat states as sacrosanct entities, not just inconveniences. Dahl talks a lot about the Federalist, but has he read the Anti-Federalist, where a lot of these arguments are made (and ironcially, it is chock full of the democratic sentiment Dahl so admires).<br />   Final flaw - Honestly, Dahl did not do enough explaining as to why democracy is worth striving for. To some, it may seem self evident but often they confuse the concept of civic equality, freedoms of speech and press, and material equality with democracy. In fact, Dahl gets these confused constantly. Especially in the last chapter where, when he asks &quot;is democracy desirable?&quot; he answers &quot;Yes, civic equality is desirable&quot; but fails to answer the question asked. <br />   All in all, this book is insightful, challenging, and worth reading (It won't take long). Just make sure you take Dahl's comments at face value. It may be good to counter some of the arguments with those found in the Ant-Federalist papers.	2003-01-12

These are essays she wrote over a given period of time - each pertaining to a different incident. From an inquiry into exageratory tactics of the New York Times' \\"100 Neediest Cases\\" to exposes of the PC environment everywhere from the Smithsonian to teachers colleges, Mrs. MacDonalds book goes a long way in exposing shocking cases of political correctness and anti-intellectual postmodernism (what does this word actaully mean?). <br />   Still, while she goes far in giving us new stories to chuckle at (not to downplay how fun THAT is!), she doesn't go very far in tying the stories together or positing any common themes hence common solutions. Of course, to most readers, these will seem obvious. Common themes? Lefty attempts to dumb-down culture in favor of artificial equality. Solutions? Cut the foolishness! In a sense, I agree but I can't help thinking that that is a bit reductionistic. It would've been nice to hear Mrs. MacDonalds suggestions. As simply a collection of essays, the author owes it to us to tie them together with commentary through an afterword, postscript or introduction (well, she does have an introduction, but all it tells us is that we are reading an introduction to a bunch of essays. Big help!)<br />   Still, I can easily grade the book with four stars. The writing is witty, easy to read, terse and always thorough. From time to time, it resorts to a bitter tone and cheap shots but not as often as most books of this ilk. Two great books to read after this one though, is Thomas Sowell's \\"Vision of the Annointed\\" and \\"Quest for Cosmic Justice\\" as both of these share Mrs. MacDonalds enthusiasm for anecdotes but unlike her book, tie them all together.	2003-01-10

A number of interesting themes and sub-themes are raised in this spirited chapters. First, so as not to mislead, we should clarify what Barzun means by &quot;entertainment.&quot; As the review below affirms, Barzun is not against science (well, maybe science with a capital &quot;S&quot;). Here, entertainment should be taken as used in &quot;entertaining a thought&quot;, in other words, to occupy. <br />   Probably the most integral point in the book (at least the one I though most interesting) was the division between technology (as with any other -ology, a conceptual study) and techne (the concrete application of science into contraptions, medicines and other things we mistakenly call &quot;technology.&quot;) The lovers of science in the Baconian (or high school chemistry class) sense will likely see this book as a put-down to science but Barzun intends no such thing. He takes a tragic view of certain &quot;sciences&quot; like the social and behavioral ones but that is, he says, because they are not quite sciences. Yes, they are good at quantifying, measuring, using obsequious language but those aren't enough to qualify them as sciences. In its proper sense, science is a method or outlook, not a collection of facts and dogmas (which interestingly enough, are anti-science.)<br />   Being a grad student, I laughed my head off on the chapter &quot;The Cult of Research and Reason&quot; which flawlessly points out the paradoxes in our current obsession with research. Some scientist is granted money for research. Her goal is to write a paper that cites other papers and if she is successfully published (in an obscure academic journal, no less) she will be read by people who will cite her work and they, in turn, will be cited by others. The point being what? We seem to forget that the validity of a paper or &quot;research&quot; is not the citations themselves, but the quality of them. For more on this, read Barzuns &quot;Teacher in America&quot; or &quot;The American University&quot;<br />   The subtracted star is for repitition. Barzun is an amazing writer but 10 pages at a time might be devoted to repeating the same paragraph over, trying simply to say it more cleverly each time. Truthfully, the book could've been 150 pages. Still, this book needs to be read by the laypeson and professional alike and today, more than ever!	2002-12-30

Marx was a very strange fellow and this reading this book felt like surveying the scene of a car accident. It hurts to continue but one finds themselves so intrigued that they can hardly stop. For my part, I disagree thoroughly with just about every idea Marx had. Still, I thought it refreshing to read a biography of the man that objectively treated Marx as human first, ragamuffin later; Unlike the brief essay on him in Paul Johnson's &quot;Intellectuals,&quot; which is meant only to slam Marx and infuriate the reader. <br />   I took half a star away for the a-little-less-than-constant humor (or so the author thought.) At first it was mildly amusing, probably do to its gauche inapropriateness. After the first few chapters though, it became a nuisance. How about this one? &quot;Like another Marx, Karl did not want to belong to any club that would have him as a member.&quot; PUKE!!<br />   The other half star is deducted for a suggestion the author makes about three-quarters through, when discussing Das Kapital. He suggests that Marx did not mean Kapital to be a work of science, but a work of ART (he means this literally, not figuratively.) His evidence? Marx refered to Kapital as his &quot;work of art&quot; (my guess, this is metaphor). Also, the author argues, if Marx had already summed up the themes of Kapital in a speech a few years earlier (he did), then why did he write a 1000 page tome espousing the same ideas (he did). Honestly, with flimsy evidence like that, this claim looks utterly ridiculous - not to mention likely insulting to any Marxist or person who takes Marx seriously as a thinker. Enough to cost half a star.<br />   Otherwise, this book is an unbiased, humanistic read that plays just like a novel. Marx, of course, is a far superior character than any author could ever devise and in the end, my bet is that whether you love or hate him, you will find yourselves modifying your opinion to ambivalence as Marx (the person, not the manifesto) is much too complicated to love or hate.	2002-12-24

Uncharactaristic of Russian novels though, is Turgnev's terse, economical form and (in my opinion) his neutrality to the chaaracters involved. Unlike Tolstoy, there are no seemingly irrelavent asides, and unlike Dostoevsky, Turgnev doesn't play favorites with the characters.<br /> The novel itself is about a young man (Arkady) returning home from college with a friend (Barazov). These two boys are nihilists (meaning they accept no tradition or general truth outside of the scientific). Arkady's father and uncle are traditionalists and the clash is interesting and as several reviewers mention, shockingly relevant to our current climate. <br /> Another point of departure from the Russian Novel... is that the characters change very much through out the novel. Instead of accentuating character traits and sticking with those, Turgnev cleverly weaves the characters through the ups and downs of love, travel, deuling and death. If you appreciate good characters as I do, you will find the growth of these multi-faceted characters thrilling. You might even want to keep a highliter handy for some of the authors amazing observations and lines (i.e., \\"After all, he didn't become a nihilist for nothing!\\") ...	2002-12-19
US	37928338	R1GY2K5RJFG8YR	0140432566	144909662	Caleb Williams	Books	3	6	8	N	N	I have very mixed feelings about this one.	Today, William Godwin is perhaps best known as the 'anarchist' philosopher who wrote &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice...&quot; It is my understanding that in the 19th century, although his philosophy was popular, his fiction also garnered significant attention. After reading both &quot;Enquiry&quot; and &quot;Caleb Williams,&quot; I can see both why his novels were popular then and why they're scarcely in print now. <br />   As a story, this novel is pretty good. It is a psychological suspense story of first (teetering on second) rate. The tale is about Caleb Williams's descent from a promising career as personal secretary to an intellectual, to a fleeting criminal that ironically was, at first, innocent. So, while the plot and action are good, these are buried in over-emotional asides and one dimensional characters. You never quite get to know Caleb, Mr. Falkland or anyone else here. All in all, as a story, I give it 4 stars as the plot makes up for any weaknesses.<br />   As a political/social commentary, this novel has 2 stars. First, unless she has read &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice,&quot; the reader will not pick up on many of the subtle points Godwin makes about the nature of liberty and its preconditions. Second, while trying to show Caleb as victim of a flawed legal system, Godwin created in Caleb a character that was just as villianous. The only way Calebs often villanous behavior could be explained is Godwin's belief in determinism; the theory that our actions are predetermined solely by external circumstance - in other words, Caleb, while increasingly underhanded in his actions, is not responsible for them as he is treated like a criminal anyhow. At any rate, one may not get these points if they've not read Godwin the philosopher. <br />   In short, I would reccomend this novel but with hesitancy. First, I would qualify the reccomendation with &quot;but you should read &quot;Enquiry&quot; first.&quot; Well, since &quot;Enquiry&quot;is 800+ pages (and out of print in every edition) this is quite an undertaking in itself.

It's a shame that most politicans haven't read this book because if they did, many of the same mistakes so astutely pointed out in it would not have been repeated (to the tee) during this new 'push' for Homeland Security (with a capital H and S.)<br />   All modern references aside, Mr. Gillon has done us a service in writing a book that even-handedly deals with unintended consequences of certain past legislation in the hopes that we may avoid them in the future. Looking at failed welfare, immigration, affirmative action, mental health and campaign finance legislation, Gillon presents us with an educational (and mildly entertaining) lesson: LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP!!!<br />But here's the problem; Gillon never quite sums it up. Reading through each chapter examining its respective reform, Gillon tells these tales AS tales without ever writing \\"and the moral of the story is...\\" The underlying problems leading to unintended consequences, although many in truth, boil down to a few basics. The problem of legislation 'modification' by special interest, the problem of congressional group-think (we should all be worried when a bill passes by a huge margin), the problem of new legislation clashing with old legislation not thought of or any varying social factor that was not accounted for, and poor implementation due to open-ended, sticky language in the bill leading to multiple 'interpretations.' Indeed, all of these are present in the book, but Gillon gives us history ONLY, at the expense of the book containing a thesis and possible argument.<br />   Of course, if one wants to explore unintended consequences, one could read Thomas Sowell's \\"Vision of the Annointed\\" and \\"Knowledge and Decisions\\" or any one of Friedrich Hayek's books. Still, despite Gillons minor (and I guess it is rather minor) flaw, this book is an excellent presentation of how legislation fails; just not why it fails.	2002-12-11

I first read Open Society a year and a half ago (reading volume 2 first.) I've come back to many of its quotes and arguments since, so I recently reread it and let me tell you - it's better the second time. <br />   Popper's goal is to go through (in brief) some of the worlds most mistaken large-name philosophers who he feels were responsible for creating closed social systems. This second volume focuses on Hegel (from an Aristotlean tradition) and Marx. Hegel alone is enough to earn Popper 5 stars as anyone who can (at least attempt to) explain the dialectic in anything approaching language is an amazing feat. In fact, a few reviewers below take issue with Popper's 'mischaracterization' of Hegel but due to Hegels chimeric and unintelligible explanations, I would suspect that no correct representation would be possible. In fact, this is one of Popper's arguments and that, in itself, is about as close to the truth of Hegel as one could get. <br />   Marx simply transforms Hegelian dialectic into a (to his credit) more intelligible, material one. Here, we get into crucial discussion of historicism and any deterministic system trying to plan history in advance. This, Popper notes, ALWAYS leads to totalitarian thinking as when one accepts the a priori 'direction' of history, one will become slave to she who dictates it (i.e., Marx or Lenin).<br />   Honestly, even if these parts of the book were never written, the list price is more then returned to the reader by the ending essays, where Popper discusses 'the sociology of knowledge' and why most ideas therein are antithetical to open societies. Popper's prose throughout the book is clear, entertaining and unrelenting. Trust me, you will be as entertained as you will informed. (can be read without prior reading of part 1)	2002-12-08

This collection consists of a bunch of satisfying niblets (yes, niblets) of that system, some better than others. <br />   First, anyone into anarchism has got to read Kropotkins essay of that title for the Encyclopedia Britannica. It has to be the clearest written, most well-stated short intro around. His essay on \\"The Anarchist Morality (written oddly enough as a retort to some kids who, after stealing some books, justified it with \\"To each according to his need.\\")The early essays, which take us through the first hundred-or-so pages are the best, as they get into the underlying theory of anarchism and what \\"sponteneous order\\" might look like. Of course \\"Modern Science and Anarchism\\" is a complete misnomer because the essay is heavy on philosophical speculation with not much scientific speculation. The latter essays are more-or-less historical propoganda and will be of interest to the history student. <br />   Still, in a world of inarticulate and often unsavory characters, Kropotkin comes off as astute, thoughtful, clear and insightful. Of course, science has (done its best to?)prove Kropotkin wrong on his altruistic evolutionary theories. Even modern \\"reciprical altruists\\" in the wake of Dawkins, Wilson and Ridley are looking less altruistic and more reciprical. I guess only time will tell. Hmmmm....	2002-12-07

First, I have to say that I did like this book; when I first read it. Honestly, Mr. Ventura's positions are very close to my own and I'm sure I would have voted for him if I'd been in Minnesota. <br /> So if it's not his points that cost him the stars, what did? His attitude. Since his last year and a half in office became a minor disaster, it's only confirmed the hints in this book. Ventura is very much into himself and (like so many other's in our government halls), suprisingly unconcerned with the people. I say this because through anecdote after anecdote, a book on policy (and I believe Ventura COULD have written one if he'd lost the ego) became about what he's done and why he's done it. <br /> Still if you are a libertarian (l or L), there are some great things in here. Of course, they are better said elsewhere (all except for Ventura's deft criticism of republicrat government.) ...	2002-12-07

Lysander Spooner, the fiery american anarchst, offers a great counterpoint to the collectivist anarchist of the same era, Emma Goldman. Like Goldman, Spooner's rhetoric is explosive, lively and (very unlike Goldman) right on the money. Well, at least most of the time. <br />   This is a very good collection featuring Natural Law, Vices Are Not Crimes, No Treason, Letter to Thomas F. Bayard, and Trial by Jury. Of course, the last article takes up a good portion of the book. In addition, we are treated to an obituary written by an equally fiery anarchist, Ben Tucker. <br />   So why the 3 stars? Well, as much fire as Spooner has, therer are many holes in his arguments. Much of No Treason, for instance, is spent on the constitution as violation of contract law, but Spooner doesn't seem to realize (or maybe assumes it as natural law) that contract law doesn't exist without government. You pick one or the other...not both! In Natural Law, we find Spooner repeating himself in each paragraph, appealing to what at best can be described as overarching faith; at worst, a chimera. And this is what Spooners anarcho-individualism is supposed to be based on?<br />   It must be said that No Treason's part iv and Letter to Thomas Bayard are astute in Spooners criticism of government as thievery and it would be hard to argue with the arguments in Vices are Not Crimes. Trial by Jury is interesting but dissapointing especially when we realize that Spooner, who often criticizes government for being inconsistent and, indeed, arbitrary, couldn't be much happier if the 12 individuals could mend any law at will post facto. I'm just not convinced that Spooner thought it through.<br />   For all of that, if you are interested in anarchism (respectable anarchism, not Kropotkin and Goldman) then Spooner is one of the only games in town. For a different (and less reverent) take on anarcho-individualism, I'd suggest reading Max Stirner's The Ego and His Own.	2002-12-07

Oh so rarely do I get the oppertunity to read a book that, when over, I wish I could read again for the first time. This book was well worth the money (I paid hardcover price) and then some. It was thorough, interesting, informative and, dare I say, entertaining!<br />   As a lover and believer in science, I've never been quite so confident in sociobiology as I'm from the Popperian school that figures &quot;If there's no concievable falsification method, then it can hardly be a science.&quot; Just because it explains, does not mean it explains correctly. After reading this book, I've still not made up my mind but to say that the battle over sociobiology is even stranger than I thought it was. Honestly, I don't think the author (who IS on sociobiology's side) intended this book as an argument for or against, as her history is quite objective, or so it seemed. <br />   Looking at the criticisms below, I find they are all valid. If you are not used to academic writing, this book may not be for you. In fact, this book came out of the authors PhD. thesis (?). It is quite a long, involved 400 page, closely spaced book but it is NOT long-winded. The mark of a long-winded book is if the reader can identify passages, chapters or sections that could be easily cut and there simply are none. Another criticism is that the author is bisased towards sociobiology (and possibly towards Richard Dawkins). As mentioned above, she is, but restrains herself well in the name of objectivity. I reccomend this book highly with two modifiers. First, I would suggest having read two books before starting this one- Wilson's &quot;Sociobiology&quot; and Dawkins &quot;Selfish Gene&quot; These two books are brought up repeatedly throughout, though not explained well. Second, if the reader is not used to heavily referenced, academic style books, this book will not be as rewarding as it may appear. Other than that, five stars!!	2002-12-06

For me, a firm believer in science and its ability to know, there are still a few basic criterion for the rubric, &quot;Science.&quot; I feel that neither psychology, evolutionary psychology, neuroscience nor cognitive science has met them. The problem is that it is so difficult to perform experiments on the mind. Also, even if we can know how the mind works (generally through introspection) and how the brain works (through extrospection), is there any reason to believe that we can fuse the two knowledges? Well, not really.<br />   I was hoping that this book would go through some of these quips but sadley, it misses them all. The only reason Horgan seems to be skeptical of the &quot;mind sciences&quot; is his recognition of the fact that a good, predictive and somewhat unifying theory is nowhere close to close. Unfortunately, I think Horgan has not looked at the history of science. Always, a Lamarck preceeds a Darwin, a lesser, more guessed at than concluded theory preceeds a solid and explanatory one. I wish Horgan would've brought up some other issues, but he is quite redundant in this one.<br />Another thing I did not like about the book is that it seemed less about reflection than it did about trying to be an interview journalist. His style is enjoyable, to be sure, but not satisfying as the whole book consists of streams of interviews conducted with every type of &quot;mind scientist&quot; available. Very little reflecting, very little concluding, and no common link to tie these interviews together. Basically, it rambles. <br />Instead, I would read Mcginn's &quot;The Mysterious Flame,&quot; Nagel's &quot;The View From Nowhere,&quot; and Penrose's &quot;Emporer's New Mind.&quot; All three are much more in depth and discuss many more problems of &quot;knowing the mind&quot; than this one does.	2002-12-01

I like Darwin, Dawkins and Dennett just fine. The problem I've always had is the claims made by memetics and evolutionary psychology as sciences. Speculations that can not be tested are not sciences no matter how you slice it, so I was looking forward to a book that contributes to this great, important discussion. In all the frenzy of excitement about memes and EP, criticism is too easily dismissed.<br /> This book seriously dropped the ball. Most of the essays here were whiny and irrelavent tot the topic at hand. The first essay tries to find commonality between EP and religion for no apparent reason than to tell us \\"Since EP uses religious metaphors like 'revelation,' and since religion is bad, EP is bad, too.\\" Unfortunately, the book is chock full of hasty non-sequitors like that one. Hilary Rose's chapter, by way of another unfortunate example, laments EP because it is threatening to take the fun out of social science by threatening to intoduce the empirical method into the otherwise free-flowing humanities. Gasp, what a concept!<br /> The best essay is far and away that of Steven Jay Gould who distrusts EP not because its un-PC or because it uses religious metaphors, but because it assumes that any observable behavior must have an adaptationary explanation. Not true, says Gould. There are such things as spandrels, or neutral traits that get selected for, incidentally, with more useful traits. Also, punctuated equlibrium (all Dawkinites should check this out, it's really not as bad as you think) and environmental flukes (like metoer-caused mass-extinctions also give us reason to suppose that EP's faith in incremental linear adaptation is a chimera.<br /> I'm quite suprised that no one but Gould touched on the extremely speculative, theoretical and by extension, untestable nature of EP which is the biggest argument I could think of against it. The problem, can anyone think of any one trait that could disprove EP? No! It's explantations are and always will be posthoc. This book ignores that. I guess I'm not really suprised as it would ruin the books intellectually light-weight theme. But if you do read this one, read Steven Pinkers \\"The Blank Slate\\" as an accompaniment so you aren't fooled when certain authors incorrectly demonize EP.	2002-11-29

It is rare these days to read a proper treatment of science. Bookshelves in the \\"science\\" sections are filled with astronomy, biology, chemistry and such. Not to suggest their is anything wrong with these disciplines; it's just that science is a way of thinking, or if you will, a method- not a collection of beliefs. <BR> <BR> Karl Popper has been largely misunderstood, being labeled a relativist and destroyer of objective science. To be sure, he did believe, as the reader will find in this enjoyable collection, that all theories- even well corroborated, are tentative. To give his critics more ammo, Popper considers science \\"reasoned myth-making.\\" Neither of these extend to relativism. If theories are tentative- always subject to new and different tests- a theory can never be fully proved but CAN be fully falsified. This is the essence of the books essays. Whether Popper is discussing the pre-socratic philosophers, social science or demarcation, his falsification theory is the common theme here. As for the \\"reasoned myth-making,\\" Popper has a bone to pick with those who think that science is purely based on observation. Any theory, by necessity, is a generality and there are no generalities in nature. Theories are made by observation + induction and induction, as Popper will add, is never logically - only psychologically - justified This is another common thread of the essays.<br /> Two suggestions for reading this book. First, if you are a Popper critic, you NEED to read this book as he goes a long way in explaining many beliefs of his that critics get wrong. Second, do not read the book front to back. As all of these 500+ pages are on the falsification theory applied to different situations, it will get extremely repetitive. Read a few essays at a time and come back later.	2002-11-26

Well, I recently re-read it and my opinion has changed a bit.<br />   When you are a youth that cant stand religion, homeopathy or Deepak Chopra, a book like this is great. Through personal tales, Shermer explains not why people belive wierd things, but why he believed wierd things and how he overcame it. His past was full of new-age curealls, Objectivism and other silly cultish stuff and Shermer is quick, not only to point out why we get trapped into fuzzy thinking, but express sympathy with those who currently do.<br />   If this makes the book sound condescending, that's because it is. This is why I changed my opinion about the book. What I originally read as a calm, objective book now seems a bit polemic and, honestly, that's the way most people will read it. Of course, there are other books along the lines of this one but they all seem to miss one crucial thing. Instead of explaining that new-age, Deepak and homeopathy are pseudosciences, the books never explain what is flawed about them (besides the fact that they're so silly!) and how we, the readers, can spot the flawed arguments for ourselves. This book, to conclude, is chock-full of anecdotes and jabs but, getting caught up in the fun of it, never answers the title question.	2002-11-25

After reading 5 of his books now, I'm not sure there's much that Jacques Barzun can't do. Honestly, I, like most people, think they understand William James and I, like most people, found out that I was further from him than I thought. In an engaging thrill of a book, Barzun explains James- dare I say it- better than James explained James. Of course, WIlliam James, who, when pragmatism is differentiated from pragmaticism, pioneered a completely new system of thought. As such, he did not always express himself well. His &quot;Pragmatism&quot; befuddled more people than not and &quot;The Meaning of Truth,&quot; meant as a clarification, confused those not already scratching their heads. In the end, James fell by the philosophical wayside until Barzun dusted our friend off and re-introduced us.<br />  Barzun explains James' pragmatism from the ground up, so to speak. He starts with &quot;The Principles of Psychology,&quot; which is really one of the best written pieces of American non-fiction on the planet and James' philosophical starting point. Next, he goes into &quot;Pragmatism&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of Truth&quot; taking much of the ambiguity out of a philosophy already difficult to the unaccustomed. Next, &quot;A Pluralistic Universe&quot; gets a summation along with &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience.&quot; I hope I am not leaving you with the imppression that Barzun is doing any of this in an academically dry, sardonic manner. Nope. Just like James, his words bubble with excitement and humongous energy.<br />  Honestly, before I started this book, I wasn't the biggest fan of William James and after, I'm still not the biggest fan of Wiliam James (preferring John Dewey much more). Still, I've come away the better for getting to know Barzun and James; i've read a great book and learned a bit more about a great (if tragic) philosophy. Also, read &quot;The Metaphysical Club&quot; and James' own &quot;Principles of Psychology.&quot;	2002-11-21

To those who've not read Popper before, I highly reccomend that you statrt now- and with this book. To those who have experienced these pages first-hand, you understand why Popper and the theories herein are so important.<BR> <BR> As short-windedly as possible, I'd like to say how I came to read him. I had forayed into philosophy through Ayn Rand who managed to convince me- as she does so many readerss- that philosophy is a chasm between soft relativism and hard objectivism. Either one believes in absolute truth and reasons 100% ability to grasp it, she wrote, or that truth is a chimera and as such, reality is mutable. I believed her. Later though, I grew restless. Truth is out there, I supposed, but how can we guarantee that our beliefs are and will always be correct? Grudgingly, I read Popper and it all made sense. <BR> <BR> Most are familiar with Poppers theories on demarcation and epistemology but this book goes into great detail on both in clear, enjoyable language. Truth, Popper tells us, is absolute. It is certainty that creates the dilemma. Since experience has shown us that objective reality exists, science works but does not take us the full way. Theories are superceded and what once seemed true may not tomorrow. So the ultimmate test of a theory should not be whether it can be VERIFIED- if we look for supporting evidence of a pretty good yet minorly false theory, we'll probably find it- but whehter the theory can be FALSIFIED- if we look for evidence against a pretty good yet minorly false theory, it's easier, quicker and beter to find IT. What does this mean? Reality exists, otherwise why do science- it's just our CERTAINTY of any belief that will prove elusive. This book, in its small yet powerful essays, explains, examines and defends this theory of an evolutionary approach to knowledge (i.e., science.) Popper is not Foucoult; his intention is not to destroy science but to enhance it. <br /> If you're like me, in awe of Popper's theories, perplexed asto why more people aren't and would like to read others who give similar views, one can do no better than C.S. Pierce and John Dewey. Especially Dewey's \\"Quest for Certainty\\" which underlines the experimental process of knowledge and breaks down the false dualism of knowledge and action. Also, Michael Polanyi and Thomas Kuhn (don't believe what Kuhn's critics, even Popper himself, says about him) have similar approaches. for a contemporaary Popperian style, read Susan Haack's \\"Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate.\\" Not to dissuade you from reading this first as this is the starting points, the other books are enhancements.

First, to define terms. Alright, this book deals with many terms from epistemology to metaethics. Philosophers are given thorough biographies: everyone from ancient stoic Epictetus to the recently deceased Robert Nozick. Second, we use a dictionary for summaries that are objective. This book is extremely even-handed in its treatment in the gamut of terms, ideas and people. <br />   Third, we use dictionaries to get definitions that are clear and understandable. This is the books weakness (-3 *s). In fact, I was suprised to see Antony Flew's name on a dictionary because, despite being a hell of a thinker, his writing is terrible. Yes, philosophy is technical. Yes, the language is grande, using words like schism and epiphenomenon but the point of a dictionary is to explain and clarify meanings of unfamiliar words. Large and vague words are used, probably so as to create the detatchment required when writing dictionaries. Still, there are many other philosophical dictionaries on the market that are more user friendly. My suggestion, pick a term and compare how the available dictionaries define them.	2002-11-21

I read this book about 1 year ago and I can say I barely learned a thing from it. Not that the concept isn't a great one. Browne's objective is to write a book that shows you how to be free in most every facet of your life. Do we have to compromise a bit of honesty for the sake of cordiallity? Do we have to sacrifice certain belifs for the sake of marital (or romantic) love? Do we have to compromise self-interest in the name of charity?<br />  Browne answers no and shows us mildly convincing ways to get there. Problem is, the book is horribly (I do mean horribly) written and if you're like me- with a taste for authors who've a modicum of literary sense- you will not want to finish the book. Honestly, if I found out that Harry Browne had written this as a first draft under a week-long deadline, it would only confirm my suspicion. Despite the occasional great insight, this book is not worth the time or effort.<br />  If this, though, is the type of book you seek- a self-help motivator that can assist you in living your life on your own, not other's terms- I can make no stronger reccomendation than Nathaniel Branden who'se books &quot;Six Pillars of Self-Esteem,&quot; &quot;Honoring the Self,&quot; and &quot;The Art of Living Consciously&quot; offer many more insights and methods for achieving those goals while offering clearer, tighter and more terse prose.

Don't let the label fool you. Notice I wrote pragmatICIST, not pragmaTIST. The difference, you ask? Well, in contradistinction to Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnams 'pragmatism' which stresses anti-science and devalues terms like 'objectivity' and 'truth,' Haack is a philosophical descendent of Charles Peirce and John Dewey (begrudginly, I'll throw William James' name in, but that's a stretch). These essays are brilliant defences of the pragmaticist vision of truth, scientific method (or, if we like, methods) and objective knowledge.<BR> <BR> If all that sounds too philosophical to the average reader, it most likely is not. Haack writes with a down to earth style, a sparkling British wit and a very even flow; especially considering the complexity of some ideas expressed in these pages. It should be mentioned though that although topics covered in these essays include multiculturalism, feminist epistemology, sham reasoning and relativism, this book is much more philosophical in nature than others. Haack is not just another author throwing down the 'science wars' gauntlet (not that it hasn't been thrown down enough already). Whereas most books attacking the abuses of feminism, relativism and postmodern thinking in science, while rightfully exposing their disasterous consequences, end up more as social commentary than actual reasoned arguments; and nary a philosophical arguemt is launched. This is precisely the void that Haack so flawlessly fills. <br /> Highlites include a brilliantly constructed 'panel' discussion between 1800's pragmaticist Charles S. Peirce and modern neo-pragmatist Richard Rorty. Haack constructed the dialogue using exerpts of their work and she does a beautiful job making it feel like a discussion. Also, the essay 'Puzzling Out Science' and 'Science as Social' do an excellent job showing that science (contrary to the old Baconian and new 'pragmatist' thought) can be both social and individual. The last two essays deviate a bit from the underlying sceince theme, tackling affirmative action and the absurdities of the academy's expectation that professors (along with masters and doctoral students), to achieve noteriety, must argue the most outlandish theories in the most outlandish way. True to form, these essays are not blank social criticisms so common in books today but are well reasoned, philosophical explorations. The only problem with the book is one common to essay collections. The essays tended to repeat themselves from time to time, not only in ideas (towards the end, you WILL be predicting what Haack's next line will be) but in phrasing. Save for that, flawless!	2002-11-15

Robert George is just one in a line of thinkers (from Thomas Aquinas to John Finnis) to attempt a validation of Christian principles on rational grounds. While I applaud his efforts and his exceptional writing ability, as a philosopher he has extremely little substance. <br />   His first mistake is to mis-characterize 'secular liberalism.' First off, I am NOT a secular liberal and I still recognize the mischaracterization, noticing that he does a lot of 'summarizing' of peoples views while offering appallingly few quotes from them. He has misread Peter Singer and John Rawls while somehow, putting Robert Nozick- the libertarian philosopher who wrote \\"Anarchy, State and Utopia\\" as a criticism of Rawls- on the left. Huh?<br />   To give an idea of the shakiness of his argument, one chapter is devoted to the rationallity of mairrage. This rationality, he says, can be proved by the fact that we come in two sexes who are attracted to eachother and can (in theory, not always in practice) produce offspring. Since homosexuals can not do this, mairrage between them shouldn't be allowed. Alright, so we come in two sexes and can produce offspring. Where does the self-evidency of mairrage come in? He never explains. Sommehow, he also takes the lefts advocacy of abortion (and the 'fringe left's' advocacy of certain infanticide) as evidence of their adherence to mind/body dualism but cites no quotes to back this up; just the usual misinformed, over-simplified summaries.<BR> <BR>  If you are a non-philosopher and/or a fanatical (as opposed to a rational) Christian, you will probably like this book as it does at least try to back up Christian principles with reason. However, if you are a philosopher and/or a rationalist (regardless of religious persuasion), you will recognize this book for what it is; philosophy for the playpen.	2002-11-13

About two years ago, I read Pinker's 'The Language Instinct.' Barely a year had passed before I read his 'How the Mind Works' and 'Words and Rules.' Each, of course, was amazing, erudite, well-researched and completely entertaining. I didn't think it possible but Pinker has gracefully outdone himself. Not only entertaining, this book is one that HAD to be written and I'm sure glad Steven Pinker thought the same!<br />   The title, 'The Blank Slate' is one of three commonplace theories that Pinker sees as contributing to the misdirection of politics, society and science in general. In brief, the belief that we are all interchangeable tabula rasas (the blank slate), that we are born with only good instincts only to be corrupted by society (the noble savage) and the existence of 'higher' spirit or soul in each human body (the ghost in the machine.) It's not hard to see why the blank slate is a bogus theory. Humans, as products, of biology have innate urges and are in a sense, genetically INCLINED towrds certain behavior. Why is the blank slate dangerous? Belief that crime can be 'unlearned' through rehabilitation, that 'reality' is simply a synonym for 'conditioned belief' that can be reframed at will, and that there is no thing as measured intellegence- all of these beliefs lead to socially disasterous consequences. <br />   It should be said that the authors goal is not shock us, stir up unnecessary contraversy or get off on offending his readers. This is not an anti-PC book; in fact, Pinker is admirably calm and well-reasoned. He discusses sciences relations to social policy, but doesn't preach about or disclose his political leanings. He talks about feminism but where he comes out against 'gender feminism,' he has nothing but praise for feminisms goals of parity and equality. To be sure, he lets us know that evolutionary science has tended to point towards the right by showing us that marxist and postmodernist interprestations of 'social reality' to be untrue.On the other hand, though, Pinker shows us that sciences insistence that while biology doesn't explain everything, it factors in to more than we think, alienates the right-wingers and backs certain left-leaning theories. In this way, science, and hence Pinker's book, is apolitical.<br />   In close, I have to affirm an observation below. At first glance, a commentary on the problem in the arts and humanities by scientist, Pinker seems not only a far stretch, but snooty. After reading the book in full though, I can easily say that it is not only the best chapter of the book, it ranks amongst the best discourses on the 'humanities slump' that I've ever read, easily beating out most by humanities professors. This book deserves every piece of it's 5 stars and then some!!!	2002-10-12

Like too many others, my journey to becoming a Barzun addict was a slow, steady build. Yes, it was through first reading 'From Dawn to Decadence' that I came to admire his electrifying prose and sparkling wit. And his books on culture and education...my gosh, man!<br />   So there I was in the neighborhood bookstore and I see a brand spankin' new Barzun reader. Since I read in tangents, the format seemed a bit scattered but I bought it, knowing that I would always, no matter what tangent I was on, find something of interest in this volume. <br />   I couldn't have been more right!! I've had the book for, maybe, nine months now and I'm STILL finding, savoring and rereading these excerpts. So many topics covered- from baseball to Berlioz, crime-fiction to higher education, race to romanticism. These days, whenever someone writes about so many subjects, there's always a suspicion that we, the readers, will find ourselves slighted- how can one person actually EXCEL in so many areas and still retain quality and grace. Barzun is a stunning example of someone who can and if you're anything like me (not reading all the way through, but reading each exerpt as it strikes your fancy), this book will rank on your 'most rewarding purchases' list	2002-10-12
US	37928338	R29MJTJ0RDZGOC	0521456479	143490049	Stirner: The Ego and its Own (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)	Books	4	24	28	N	N	Interesting if abrasive food for thought!	\\"What is supposed to be my concern. First and foremost the Good Cause, then God's Cause, the cause of mankind, of truth, of freedom, of humanity, of justice; further, the cause of my people, my prince, my fatherland; finally, even the cause of my mind. Only MY cause is never to be my concern. 'Shame on the egoist who thinks only of himself.'\\"<br />   In this, the first paragraph of his powerful book, Max Stirner sets the stage. His cause? 'Nothing.' His goal? To stop at nothing. In The Ego and It's Own (more literally translated to The Person and His Property) Stirner tries making the case for anarchism based on individualism, rebelling against the collectivist strand professed by Proudhon and Godwin before him.<br />   When Stirner says he 'base[s his] cause on nothing,' what is meant. Simply, he takes nothing (even our supposed self evident truths like right to life) as givens. Everything is questionalbe; nothing immune. So really, this book is not for the squeamish. First, he takes apart religion for setting a 'transcendental' cause higher than the individual. Then he attacks the concept of the state- and socialism- for doing the same. Then he takes apart concepts of 'rights' becuase without a god to grant them and a state to inforce them, what right do I have to live if you kill me? To clarify, Stirner does believe in cooperation for each party's benefit; just not coerced in ANY way. <br />   While Stirner is said to be a precursor to Nietzsche, there is no evidence that Nietzsche knew of him. In fact, the biggest influence he might've had (in print) is Marx's 300 page(!) critique of Stirner in his German Ideology. I've not read it, but it's clear that Marx has a lot to wrestle with.<br />   Now for the subtracted star. Stirner, while being an egoist, is somewhat of an egotist. He repeats the same things many times and a reader would not miss much if she cut out 150 pages early. Secondly, and it must be said, Stirner is not profound because he is philosophicallychallenging. He is not; then again neither are most anarchists. He is profound because he has the gumption to say what no one else will. He even questions why it is considered bad to sleep with one's sister. Can we argue? Hmmm.... What are you staring at me for, read the book already!	2002-10-03

Here is a book that focuses on government, but not in the way most do. The fad today is books on 'banishing beurocracy' with trendy management techniques and buzzwords and this book, to its credit, realizes those books for what they are; bunk!<br /> From the getgo YWNW focuses not on faddish trickery, but on how to make sure government GOVERNS, not just pays it lip service. Using a host of examples of government (state and federal) ideas gone wrong and right, the authors extract simple rules and 'tips'. The good news is that these tips are helpful, astute and right on the money.<BR> <BR> The big problem- overwhelming, actually since it cost the book 3 stars- is the proportion of anecdotes to substantial analysis. Each chapter starts off with a 5-6 paragraph anecdote relating to the chapters theme, be it government takeoves, or the importance of vision. After the example, instead of the authors giving you the 'moral' of the story and connecting it to the theme, they give you another 5-6 paragraph anecdote. If your lucky, the authors will tell us what these examples have in common in a 2-3 paragraph conclusion, which occasionally is only another anecdote. If your luckier, you will only have to swim through 4 more stories before you get there. Stories and real life examples can make books more fun and interesting, but when there is a poverty of analysis and explanation in a book like this, it sort of defeats the point. <br /> Unfortunately, I can't think of any better books to take it's place. As mentioned above, most others revolve around management fads and substance-less pep-talks. My reccomendation is to buy this one (possibly used) and read only the very beginning and very end of the chapters. Only then, if you've not grasped the chapters theme, read the anecdotes.	2002-09-26

Makes beautiful music come to life!	Are you an enthusiastic novice to classical music? Frustrated by how much there is to know and how little time you have to learn it? Like Beethoven and don't know who to listen to next? Jan Swafford's got your back!! This book is excellent.<br />   What makes this book stand out is it's attention to the characters behind the music. To paraphrase Swafford's introduction, how can one learn about the string quartet without learning about the person of F.J. Hayden; the romantic symphony absent Beethoven's idiosyncracies? And what characters they are! Swafford dispells much of the 'tragic genius' myth of Mozart, shows us an overly sensitive (especially in love) Hector Berlioz, not to mention the silently tortured soul of Tchaikovsky. Trust me, this is going to be GOOD!!<BR> <BR>   The book is divided into chronological order of periods. The author starts off each section/period with a brief overview of it's historical context and brief biographies of some of its minor composers. Then, he goes on to the biographies, looking in detail at the lives and works of each. Swafford definitely has biases but makes them obvious as seperate from facts. He also uses quite a bit of humor e.g., &quot;The life of ...Franz Liszt could be seen as an..illustration of the maxim, 'The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.' Expecpt that Liszt never really left the road and never quite made it to the palace.&quot; Cheesy? Perhaps! But it makes it so gosh durn fun. <br />   The only complaint that I have is the sardonic treatment of some composers. I was especially annoyed with Swafford's repitition of how unoriginal Mozart was. In truth, Swafford is right. Mozart, though prolific, was conventional to an extreme. But Swafford reminds us over and over again; as if he enjoys tearing an icon from the pedestal. Also, though he tries to remain impartial on the experimental music of the twentieth century, his bitterness show through; especially with minimalism, wherin &quot;ideas, which are not interesting to begin with, do not become any more interesting.&quot; Thanks to Swafford though, classical music whic IS very interesting, becomes infinitely more interesting!	2002-09-24

This book, at 80 pages, had me really excited at the halfway point. HIs critiques of the existing systems of government- especially direct, representitive, and majoritarian democracy are deft and well formulated. I figured that as the author had presented his case against the state pretty well by page 40, he'd have a great affirmitive case for anarchism.<BR>  <BR>   WRONG!! There was no case. Once he'd laid down his anti-government case, he simply repeated most of what he'd wrote one more time. Even the last sub-chapter 'Utopian Glimpses of a World Without States&quot; didn't attempt anything. That in mind, the books title is not only misleading, it is a fabrication. AS there is no defences of anarchism here, it might best be called 'Critiques of the Idea of Government.&quot; <BR>   <BR>   Well, the two stars I gave it were for amazing clarity in writing. This book, under a worse writer, could've easily been two hundred or more pages but Wolff keeps it short and energetic. Also, his critiques of the state (especially on voting procedure and inadequacies in district-representation) were great. <BR>   To Close, I must mention that there are many books similar to this one that are far superior to this one. For a great deffense of anarchism (favoring the market) read Randy Barnett's &quot;Structure of Liberty.&quot; For a good defense of anarchism (favoring no market) read Proudhon's &quot;What is Property&quot; and for a book questioning the legitamacy of the state coming to a minarchist- libertarian- conclusion, the true classic is Robert Nozick's &quot;Anarch, State and Utopia.&quot;	2002-09-17

I must admit, I've read many of Rousseau's essays and books yet, I've never liked him. This book makes me like him less. \\"Reveries\\" is Rousseau's attempts to record his thoughts on ten solitary walks. In the first walk he compares his undertaking as like Montaigne's (that's Jean-Jacques for you!!). In a way, it is. These, like the essays of Montaigne are on both the 'trivial' subjects like botany and children, to the more philosophical, like the obligation to truth. Unlike Montaigne though, there is no order whatever to Rousseau's thoughts.<br />  Another disjunction between the two is that Montaigne didn't think nearly as much of himself as does Rousseau who, towards the end of his life, did not have many friends and spends the greater portion of each essay telling us that it is their fault and who needs 'em anyway. He desperately wants us to feel sorry for him while protesting (way too much, wethinks) that he doesn't need our sympathy.<br />  In fact, any good biography on Rousseau will tell you that the reason he didn't have any friends was that he was vain, selfish and trivial. After reading these essays, I see it. He was also losing his mind to paranoia and throughout the reveries, refers to the 'plot' against his life and in the ninth walk, even mentions the spies that follow him!! Whew!!<br />  In the end, lack of structure, repitition of 'poor me' and conspiracy themes, and pure pompousness ruin this book. His 'Confessions' are slightly better, but I'd start with 'Emile.'	2002-09-04

First, here's my obligatory disclosure. I was only able to make it through 3/4 of the book before I gave up. There were two reasons for that. First, the author's concept of the meme as a 'worldview' idea is a little too narrow. A meme is ANY idea. A melody, a phone number, a concept- not just a 'worldview.' Bloom gives the false impression that all memes are to blame. Nope- just the hateful ones! <br />   Second, there's only a certain amount of repitition I can tolerate. The author not only keeps making the same point,- that 'worldview' memes make it easy for unremorseful killing in nature- but he keeps using the same anecdotes- particularly Islam- to back himself up. Other reviewers have said it best- a string of selective anecdotes does not constitute science!! What does it constitute? Pseudo-science. <br />    Although the authors idea of a superorganism is eye-brow raisning (hence, one of my two stars), Bloom gives us no attempts at explaining HOW these individual organisms can be connected. The only psychology each of us knows is her own- how can that lead to a group mind?! Bloom offers no suggestions. Understanders of science know that if you're going to postulate a 'what' (especially an audacious one), you'd better at least be looking for a supporting 'how'. But, hey, when has pseudo-science ever needed to explain it's theories?<br />   I have accounted for one star. What about the other? Bloom writes with a flair that is exciting to say the least. I couldn't stop reading the first two sections. I'll try a backhanded compliment- If it weren't for Blooms exciting prose, I may have stopped before the halfway point. <br />   As for books to read in place of this one (which I strongly reccomend doing) \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\" by Daniel Dennett and \\"The Meme Machine\\" by Susan Blackmore are great for memtic theory as related to evolution. \\"Economics of Justice\\" by Richard Posner offers a much more solid account of how groups form organically, and \\"How the Mind Works\\" by Steven Pinker shows an infinitely better understanding of psychology.	2002-08-27

Not only is Rand slowly gaining steam amongst academic thinkers, she is all over popular culture. There has been two successful fims ('The Passion of Ayn Rand' based on Barbara Branden's biography and the Oscar noiminated 'Ayn Rand: a Sense of Life.') Both the Ayn Rand Institute and the Objectivist Center- think-tanks devoted to Ayn Rand's objectivism- are experiencing huge popularity. Heck, today- Aug. 26, 02- C-SPAN will re-air the Ayn Rand episode of their American Writers series. The viewer request was through the roof. So why, with all her idiosyncratic views, can't we seem to get enough?<br />   This biography goes a long way in answering that question. Nathaniel Branden, Rand's first 'intellectual heir', takes us on his journey with this enigmatic figure, Rand. From when they first met- he as a college student, she as the successful author of the Fountainhead- to thier intellectual partership and ultimately thier misguided affair. The most interesting part of the book, I feel, is the cacophonic break between Branden and Rand, forcing Branden to reevaluate his life and principles.<br />   It would've been easy for Branden, now a successful psychologist, to handle this book badly. It could've wound up being a bitter memoir about what some have called a 'cult'. Or, it could've centered on a philosophical diatribe of Randian thought. Fortunately, it does neither. It is written almost as fiction. The players, even those Branden clearly doesn't like, are treated with respect and empathy. He also writes with remarkable honesty- clearly a sign of a man who's given much time to self-reflection. Yes, there are spots where Branden does get down on Rand. Her philosophy is also touched on, in part. None of this, however, is induldged in to a fault. What we get is the story of a man in a unique, magnanimous, and ultimately life-defining situation. This is one of the few books I've read that I found perfectly enjoyable- emotionallyand intelectually- from beginning to end. Also read 'Confessions of a Philosopher\\" by Bryan Mcgee.	2002-08-26

This is not the book that many will expect it to be. If the reader is looking for a book taking a position for or against affirmative action, she will be dissapointed here. In fact, half of the book actually is absent talk of affirmative action at all. What Carter does do in &quot;Reflections..&quot; is relay to us his experiences, thoughts and feelings on the matter in the style of an internal socratic dialogue. <br />   Stephen Carter is just the man to do it. He has written many books on the many aspects of law and, as he conveys in this cultural memoir, has aquired views notoriously hard to pin down (how many 'liberals' do YOU know who wrote books suggesting that church/state seperation has been taken too far?!) Accordingly, he can admits both being helped by affirmative action and being psychologically hurt by some of it's misguided effects. His willingness to think and write about these quandaries, so often neglected by other thinkers, makes this a fascinating read. No dogmatic diatribes or easy answers, just discussion that is passionate yet objective. <br />   While affirmative action dominates the first half of the book, it is used as a springboard to the second half, which discusses a deeper problem- that of a noticeable distrust in Black America of dissenting political voices. Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele, Clarence Thomas and the like are quick to be called 'white' or 'inauthentic' if they voice opinions contrary to mainstream black thought. Whether or not you agree with Carter's observation, his discussion here is lively, thoughtful and always respectful of all angles. <br />   So, to close, the reason for the subtracted star is the fact that this book might disappoint two expectations readers may have for it- First, there are no conclusions reached here. While this is a good thing in itself, the reader looking for winning intellectual argument will need to look elsewhere. The second is that the title is a bit misleading as only about 100 pages are actually on affirmative action. Again, the discussion after is just as mind-capturing. Still, because of the title and synopsis, it is a bit misleading.	2002-08-24

It's a sorry commentary on academia that a scholar is no longer judged on the soundness of their thought, but rather on the controversy of their ideas. Singer certainly is austentacious but this should not be taken to mean he is anything but.<br />   Many have judged him negatively because of where he ends up. My negative judgement is based on how he gets there. Basically, Singer argues from a lot of 'should's and 'wouldn't it be great if's, which is hard to avoid in the field of applied ethics. He also leaves much inonsistency when he DOES reason. For instance, I was annoyed at his comparison of the animal liberation movement to the womens and black liberation movements. Of course, if the comparison is made, we need to fully make it. What Singer fails to realize is that when rights are given (Singer stubbornly refuses to admit that conference of rights and social liberation are the same thing!?), corresponding responsabilities always come with them. So if we treat animals as equal beings in privilege, we must hold them to equal responsabilities. Does this mean that when an animal hurts, kills or steals from another that she should be charged with assult, murder or theft? The appropriate reply is 'No.' Why? Because animals don't seem to have the forethought to understand or comply with the social contract. It is THIS lack of comprehension that makes the animal liberation movement, although it would be nice, hardly possible. Animals don't appear as having the ability to join in a civil society. <br />   Singers book, however, is good to read as an ethical kick in the pants. It WILL make you uncomfortable. I, a whole-hog (get it?) omnivore found myself squirming during some chapters depicting animal slaughter and lab tests. You may just as easily find yourself squirm at the pontification on baby M. (born with a non-functioning brain and kept alive for two years). Whatever you do, MAKE SURE you understand Singer's arguments before you criticize. Many negative reviewersbelow do not understand his euthenasia stance; it's an easy one to misunderstand.<br />   All in all, this book is an adequate glimpse into an over-quoted and under-read mind. The book is quite repetitive, but as it consists of short essays, the reader can skip around when (not if) she gets bored. The two stars are for tenacity and originality- not consistency or brilliance. In the end, Singer fails in both of those.	2002-08-23

This book is an amazing study. The book is ordered by amendment (or clause.) Within each part, the first essay focuses on the amendments original meaning and early history and the last essay focuses on the amendment today. Buyer beware. It seems that there is definitely a bias towards original meaning here, as each finishing essay comes to the conclusion that we've strayed from that original intent. But bias or not, can you blame them.<br />   Of course that opens up an interesting dilemma that is unexplored in this book. Yes, we have strayed from original meaning (we've even FORGOTTEN the tenth amendments existence!) but this is only negative if you subscribe to 'original meaning' jurisprudence. As an aside, it seems most legal scholars and jurisprudential thinkers do not. Even Scalia and Posner, supposed conservatives, reject it; Scalia calling it 'the lesser evil.' This book assumes that readers share sympathy with original intent. <br />   Where this book DOES prove its worth is in the attention payed to the fourth, fifth, ninth and tenth amendments- all of which are sadly neglected in legal dialogue of today. In fact, my favorite four essays were the ones focusing on amendments nine and ten. <br />   So overall, this book's quality is high. On the whole, the essays are well written and exciting.  But whether or not you've made up your mind on original meaning vs. broad principle jurisprudence, do check out \\"Interpreting the Constitution\\" edited by Jack Rakove.	2002-08-21

As the dualism/materialism debate has raged on in philosophy and philosophers gloat privately that they've solved the problem, it is rare to see one willing to throw their hands in the air. Mcginn, although having written what in the end is a repetitive and self-defeating book, has made an admirable and somewhat enjoyable attempt to explain his partial surrender to hope of ultimate answers in philosophy of mind.<br />   Mcginns theory, in an nutshell is that, while we can view the brain only from outside, we, at least so far, have only been able to see the mind from the inside. From this, he concludes that we can not connect the two views i.e., even if we know that certain neural patterns cause certain sensations, this only explains THAT there is a particular connection, not HOW those neurons create the sensation. The middle ground needed to transition the two views, Mcginn argues, is inaccessable to human consciousness.<br />   It is here that Mcginn takes it too far, even though he is correct to remind us that we've no reason to expect that every concievable question has an answer accessable to human consciousness. He even reminds us that, as evolutionary creatures, our minds, like every other organ, were evolved to solve our ancestors problems. Why, from that standpoint, should we then expect that the human mind is capable of understanding itself? My answer would be that just as we have no reason to suspect that we can successfully answer the problem, we have no reason to suspect that we can't. <br />   To make matters worse, explaining the theory the first time is not good enough. With slight variation, every chapter restates his theory with equal vigor. Even the discussions of the sections dispelling pansychism and dualism (with and without god) are given short treatment in favor of correspondingly lengthy explanations of why Mcginns theory is to be favored. <br />   What good I can say is that this book is probably one of the best intros to tht philosophy of mind outside of Pinkers &quot;How the Mind Works&quot; and Dennett and Hofstadter's &quot;The Minds I.&quot; For the more experienced, Read Mcginns (and for counterpoint, John Searle's) academic work.	2002-08-19

It probably is. The essays here touch on legal reasoning, economics, philosophy of law, sexuality and many other topics, giving the reader a 'survey' view of Posner. Most books of essays, though, have a cohesiveness that I did not detect here, which is fine, so long as the intention is ONLY to get a sampling. <br />   I can not stress enough how phenomenal a writer Judge Posner is. The essays are both challenging and readable; contraversial yet objective. In one, Posner defends his book 'Sex and Reason' against radical feminism. In another he examines Richard Rorty and the impact that modern philosophy has on law. Perhaps the best essay is on pragmatic legal reasoning, entitled \\"What am I? A potted plant?'.<br />   Besides the lack of cohesion, the biggest reason for the subtracted star is that, while Posner discusses economics, legal method and gender issues, his full length books on the subjects are better.

Before reading, I had heard many great things about the book and seen a briliant PBS interview with Wright. Robert Wright is a great pop-science writer but after giving this book a good read, that's about all I can say about him.<br />  This book is not cohesive in any way. 100 pages in, I was already scratching my head as to where he stated his thesis. After reading through some damn interesting (to his credit) anecdotal examples of 'cultural evolution,' I understood what he was trying to do. It's just a shame that he never got around to tying the examples together and relating them to the 'non-zero sum' thesis. <br />   As much as I believe in the probability that evolutionary theory works and is still working, his explanation of the 'destiny' of cultural evolution is nothing short of a huge oversight. By showing us that cultures get bigger by improving non-zero sumness and extracting that this must constitute the 'direction' of human history past and future, is like saying that since the giraffe's neck has gotten bigger through the years, that the giraffe was destined to have long necks and that those necks will continue to grow in the future. Wright ignores two things. First, all evolution is contingent on environment. We can never say that something was destined to occur unless we are POSITIVE that no other environment was possible. In other words, written language, say, was never inevitable, but one of many possible ways to deal with many possible environemts. Second misunderstanding, the law of diminishing returns. To say that the giraffe must be destined to an ever longer neck simply because that's how it's evolutionary history points, ignores the fact that at some point that neck becomes too long for the body. Same with the enlargement of non-zero sum games. At some point, non-zero sum (in any of its forms) may be abandoned for another idea that is found to work better. There IS such a thing as too much altruism. Simply because we've seen no such line yet,doesn't mean we won't find it in the future.<br />   For better books on non-zero and zero sum games, read Robert Nozicks &quot;The Nature of Rationality&quot; and Matt Ridleys &quot;The Origins of Virtue.&quot; For books on the evolution of cooperation, read anything by Robert Axelrod, and lastly, for a great critiqe of 'purposeful evolution' (a position Wright indirectly defends), read Richard Dawkins &quot;The Blind Watchmaker.&quot;	2002-08-15

Andrew Sullivan has written a gem with \\"Virtually Normal.\\" In these beautifully written pages, we find an author exploring- his goal being to understand first, question next- four explanations for and proposed methods of dealing with homosexuality. In the end, he finds all four lacking.<br />   The doctrines given treatment are: prohibitionism- being gay is a choice of deviance and as such should be treated as a sin, constructionism- gay is merely a social construction and there would be no 'homosexual problem' if we deconstruct sexuality, Conservatism- we should let people be gay but homosexuality should NEVER be encouraged socially. Finally we get to Liberalism. Perhaps Sullivan finds the most trouble here. The liberal doctrine states that as a persecuted group, gays should be tolerated to the point that if social coercion becomes necessary (through 'hate crime' legislation and the like), all the better. Through 'education' (resembling indoctrination) equality can be forced. Save for prohibitionism, I would agree that liberalism is the most dangerous of all.<br />   Although it will be obvious that Sullivan has a special distaste for liberalism, he finds serious flaws in each of the four doctrines for good reason. His conclusion breaks sharply with all of them,resembling more of a classical liberal (J.S. Mill) approach. Tolerance should be encouraged, never forced. Government discrimination is the evil, private discrimination will die in the free market because it is always inefficient. Sullivan then devotes time to gay marriange and military service, asserting- very correctly- that untill homosexuals can serve their country openly and marry legally, they will always be on unequal footing. If the potential reader has never heard Sullivan speak on these issues, she should not delay. <br />   His afterword is a much needed response to seemingly universal misunderstanding on his book. As he criticizes the four dominant views, he gets criticized by them in turn. Eventhe 'conservatives,' who as ironic as it is, were the group that his defenders were overwhelmingly from, misunderstood his arguments against liberalism as an affirmation of conservativism. Sullivan, if I had to guess, is a republican with a small 'r', i.e. he believes in a somewhat self governing republic. Whatever your views, this book will challenge, educate, and motivate you.	2002-08-11

Edward Larson has done us a favor by writing on an often both neglected and misunderstood piece of history in the Scopes trial. The author handles all involved with an even hand minus the kid gloves so often used in the name of 'objective' journalism. Criticism (and praise)is given to all parties when it is deserved.<br />One glaring problem. The reader quickly picks up that, in Larsons view,- and I tend to agree- the case became more about evolution versus creationism than about whether Scopes violated the Tennessee antievolution law or even the constitutionality of the law itself. So the problem becomes that, in Larsons desire to give us a journalistic account of the trial, he never comments on the issues of law involved. For instance, we know that the defense read the antievolution law to prohibit teaching evolution ONLY if it's account differs with the bible. The defense's challenge was that evolution can be taught in accordance with biblical creationism. Hence, Scopes broke no law. Although the scholars to prove this were never able to testify, it would've been nice to hear comments on legal issues like this one. <br />I also could've done without some of the tedium of the pre-trial explanation. Some of the detail was repetitive. I'm not sure how many times we needed to be reminded of the fact that the ACLU did not want Darrow's name associated with the trial. <br />Still, this is a great read that moves like a legal-thriller of the first rate. At last, an author has found a way to give scholarly treatment and serious attention to a trial looked on by many as a joke.	2002-08-06

This book is a truly inter-disciplinary venture. It explores evolution (group selection BY survival of it's individuals) and works gradually up into game theory, ethics, human psychology, anthropology and finally, the possible biological origin of good government. <br /> Ridleys main argument is to show that human cooperation is not- contrary to popular thought- a biproduct of government and law, but a natural development. What's odd about this is that cooperation seems to come straight out of the prisoners dilemma which is generally depicted as a selfish game. For those not familiar, in brief, the prisoners dilemma is- 2 or more players are in a game. If each cooperates with eachother, they share the reward equally but if one deciedes to cheat the others, she alone gets the full reward. Rationallity dictates that it's in the individuals interst to cheat, getting the full reward. Ridley shows us that emotions, possibly evolutionary ones, come in to counter this and encourage cooperation. In other words, Ridley blows holes in the theory that cooperation comes out of 'group selection'- rather, it comes from individual selection. <br /> The only problem with books as inter-disciplinary as this one, is that one doubts from time to time whether the author really knows about biology, government, law, psychology, anthropology, history AND philosophical ethics. I can't say that Ridley is definitely overstretching. His statements do appear sound and error free. Still, his tendency to make sweeping statements in so many fields detracts from his credability. Not enough to loose a star though.<BR> <BR>For the interested reader, another great book on the evolution of law as an extention of human nature (coming to much the same conclusion as Ridley's) is Judge Richard Posner's \\"The Economics of Justice.\\" Albeit a bit more academic and not as coversational, Posner's book serves as a good paralell read to Ridley's.	2002-08-01

Once again, I have to go and do things out of order. I read 'revisited' before the original. That said, Huxleys arguments will be accessable even to those who've not read the original. I'm guessing, but it may even be more beneficial to read this first. (Kind of like reading the introductory exposition before the classic fiction.)  Huxley is a skilled polemicist. Not only is his observation skills remarkable but his writing is forceful with a sense of urgency. Ironically, the two writers I can compare his fervent style to is Ayn Rand (The Virtue of Selfishness) and B.F. Skinner (Beyond Freedom and Dignity). How's that for strange company!<br />  Unfortunately, like the above writers, Huxleys ranting is exciting at first, leading to mildly annoying, spiraling to nervewracking. A reader reading in 1958 might've been able to take that urgency as the communism mentioned in this book was quickly spreading. In 2002 however, it's a bit harder to take.<br />  This is not to say that much of the observation in this book is not happening today. The 'propaganda', 'selling' and 'organization' sections are DEAD ON!! Propaganda: Those in control have convinced us that government (Huxley warns us of vague terms such as these) is the best way to solve problems. Selling: Business is getting bigger and successful advertising is suspiciously easy. Organization: As business gets bigger and needs to become more effective, the organizational structure spreads and to some degree subordinates the individual to the whole. Last but not least, Chemical Persuasion: Huxley was half right. As above trends continue, we medicate more. Not only is illegal drug use out of control, but drugs to combat psychiatric disorders (including 'Math Disorder'? Thanks DSM-IV!) are abundant. Might this be fooling us into thinking that the problem is solved upon the individuals adjustment to the world? Does the problem lie not with the individual sickness, but the world itself? Huxley would cheer 'Yes.' \\"Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness.\\" Why is Huxley half wrong? Neuroscience has shown quite otherwise.<br />  Because of it's overpreachiness and what seemed like a mission to doom and gloom us (while talking the COMMUNISTS tendencies to exploit fear in propaganda) I could only give it three stars. A quick, dark read to give you cause for pause? Yes. A propehsy? Well.....perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness.\\" Why is Huxley half wrong?

US	37928338	R1Z9P6LCJMKBXT	0761534040	897968670	The New Thought Police: Inside the Left's Assault on Free Speech and Free Minds	Books	4	13	17	N	N	A New Hero of Mine	In the style of Andrew Sullivan and Christina Hoff Sommers, this book is garaunteed to earn Ms. Bruce, a pro-choice, feminist who still has trouble with the left, some strange company- the traditional right-wing.  The book is well argued and documented without being fanatical (something both Ann Coulter's and Robert Bork's attempts fell victim to.) There are a few problems I had. Not big ones as they only cost one star.<br />   First, there are already SO many books in the ultra left expose genre and (despite my inclinations to the libertarian right) it's getting rather repetitive. As I mentioned earlier, this book is more cool headed and rational than most. Still, the same format that made the others in the genre so successful is used here. Anecdotes and statistics meant to wear on and outrage the reader. Of course, this is all okay because 9 out of 10 readers will be expecting that format by the title alone. This leads to the second fault.<br />  This past week, I saw Ms. Bruce on C-SPAN and she spoke about her goals in writing this book. In the spirit of Mill, Popper and Dewey, her message was that of pluralism. We know that she isn't rallying against the left because of conservative views- it's because the New Left silences debate instead of meeting it. In short, this book's message is that everyone should subject their ideas to challenge and scrutiny of other view-points. However, looking at other books people bought with this one, I see Ann Coulter, Bernard Goldberg and Patrick Buchanan. Unfortunately, it leads me to suspect that Ms. Bruces awesome message of encouraging debate and pluralism will be lost on the hardened right-wingers that ARE reading the book. I certainly hope that will not be the case. It's just too good a message to be ignored or undermined.<BR> <BR>  The reader that does get Ms. Bruces powerful position of increaing dialogue (not monologue), will recognize the beauty and wisdom therein. If she takes Ms. Bruces thesis seriously, her next read will not be Pat Buchanan, but maybe Catherine McKinnon	2002-07-28

The new god is evolution and, frankly, I'm an atheist.  First step, I read Dawkins &quot;The Blind Watchmaker.&quot; That lead me to the works of Daniel Dennett and Steven Pinker. It was Pinker that lead me to evolutionary psychology and Wright's well-written, thought provoking book does an excellent job with the subject. After some time to reflect on this book and evolutionary psychology, I'm still an atheist, but my conclusion is that evolutionary psychology (and this book) is MUCH too speculative. the territory is still largely uncharted.<br />  This is not to say that Wrights explanations are not convincing. He does a fantastic job mapping the logic of his arguments- especially the argument for monogamy as an invention to ensure that more males get a chance to mate, leading to increasing diversification through generations. His hypotheses are sharp and well-backed through glimpses at other species and internal logic.<br />  Therein lies two problems. First, untill we can actually witness the past much of the info presented will remain speculation. Even archeological data can only go so far where psychology is concerned. While helpful to biology, physical relics do little to give us a glimpse at pre-historic minds. Second, even when Wright argues a point by it's internal consistency, this does little in the way of expanding science. Science does not care for internal logic. The best evidence is always an theories correspondence to reality. Abstract reason doesn't help and I'm afraid that Wright relies on it a bit too much.<br />  That said, I think that anyone wanting to ponder behavior (both rational and not) will definitely want to sit down with this one- and while the theories desperately need to be treated as tentative, Wrights postulations are certainly reasonable and some of the best I've seen.	2002-07-27
US	37928338	R22YSMB1KNVNZ7	0198297297	890248127	The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law	Books	3	16	24	N	N	Good points that are tedious and slowly made.	Randy Barnett(Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Law, Boston U) has written a good, cogent and sometimes clear defense of decentralized libertarianism i.e. anarchic capitalism. It is divided into three major sections. The first deals with problems of knowledge (broken into first, second and third order problems). Such puzzles as individualized local knowledge, how best to convey it and how law can best be communicated are given thorough (but accessable) treatment. <BR>   <BR>   The second section deals with the problem of interest. This is the shortest and least original part of the book. Starting with the 'natural law' that humans tend to act in their own self interest, we come to the dilemma of how to make sure that while doing this, everyone follows law, has appropriate incentive not to cheat, and utilizes 'freedom of contract' to the best of her ability. <BR>   <BR>   The third and most interesting section is on the problem of 'power.' Here we start exploring the virtues of capitalism and the many problems linked with 'public property.' Barnett discusses how things like streets and police forces could be improved by bringing them into the private market where they are accountable to their clientele. The observant reader will doubtless be scratching her head here. What about the 'free-rider' problem, making sure enough people using a service are paying, and that certain things are available to most (if not all?) This book covers these things with quality explanation.<BR>   <BR>   I've subtracted two stars because Barnett has a tendency to repeat himself every chance he gets. Not only do we get a condensced summary at the end of every chapter, he spends a good bit of every chapter reformulating what we learned before it. So while I liked the book (I'm still a minarchist, not anarchist) I found it a bit longer and dryer than it could've been, especially when compared to books like &quot;Law, Legislation and Liberty&quot; and &quot;Anarchy, State and Utopia.&quot;	2002-07-23

However, those same people see Dershowitz's &quot;Supreme Injustice&quot; as an objective, non-partisan account? Dershowitz is a defense lawyer. What do they use? Rhetoric. Posner is a judge. What do they use? REASON.<br />As one who did not voter for Bush, Gore or Nader, I can say that this is the most intellegent, thorough and fair accounts given of the 2000 fiasco. The one thing it's NOT is the most readable. If you don't want numbers, textual explanations of obscure state clauses and discourses on democratic theory, this one will be a doozy. If you DO want a beach read, I direct you to Bugliosi. Also, if it's conservative apologia you're after, do yourself a favor and just watch Fox News.<br />Posner is not a pundit, he is a judge. He does not defend Katherine Harris's decision not to accept late recounts as a 'conservative,' he does so because the law gave her discretion. He refrains from bashing the supreme court decision, not as a conservative (he correctly disagrees with their 'equal protection' reasoning), he does so as a judge realizing they did the best they could in the time they had.<br />The key thing to take from this book is that he doesn't slam anyone (except for some overzeolous pundits). Second guessing motive is a slippery slope and he admirably refrains from left or right bashing. What we are left with is facts. As mentioned earlier, Dershowitz, as a defense lawyer, has proven one of the most effective rhetoricists on the planet. My guess is that a major reason this book didn't sell so well is because the rhetoric is absent. <br />The major flaw is that if Posner wnated to write a book for the lay person, he failed. This book, if you've no coffee around will make you dizzy. My reccomendation, read Bugliosi for a warm-up, Dershowitz for a light jog, and these will have worked you up to Posner. This is serious business!!	2002-07-05
