Perhaps it is his background in philosophy that provides his characters and societies such realism - what might have happened if Neitzsche had been interested in becoming a political figure?  Yes, his invented languages and places are somewhat heavy but one actually gets used to them after a while.<br /><br />His use of magic - closer to psi than anything - are much more realistic than any other fantasy novels that I have read before.  The same goes for the individual fights and large-scale battles.<br /><br />The central character, Kelhus, and his society are the most intriguing creations since Moorcock's Elric.  In fact, for those who are high-level practitioners of qigong, Bakker's descriptions are very close to reality.  Kelhus' abilities, mental state and even the philosophy of the Logos seem to accurately reflect reality.	2005-09-30

The novel was not as quite as fun as the first due to flashbacks and unnecessary extra information that made some sections a bit of a wade.  She has yet to develop some characters such as PB very well but there is promise.  And yeah, the sex 'scene' with Sergei was juvenile.<br /><br />But the real fun in this series is her take on \\"magic\\",  Ask any of the advanced practitioners of qigong and they should tell you, if they're being honest, that a lot of what she describes is actually true.  The inner sensations and some of the abilitie actually exist in individuals who have trained to a hig enough level.  Even written spells exist - they're called \\"fu\\" - and, yes, they do work.<br /><br />Too bad the organizations that oversee everything don't exist...Yet?	2005-09-15

This book epitomizes what all good instruction books should be.  It is clearly and concisely written.  The reasoning is well explained and backed up with both personal experience and scientific reports (there is a good reference section).<br /><br />Brendan starts with his own story - \\"you can't compete without eating meat\\" - and proceeds to prove the naysayers very wrong.  He explains, in a clear fashion, what one is doing through intensive training (stress) and how to make your diet help your performance.<br /><br />He clearly explains the rationale behind a raw vegan diet as well as why he uses certain additional dietary supplements such as Maca.  He provides menus and recipes in the book.<br /><br />For anyone following the healthy path of raw vegan food this is a great reference.

Although this 'field' has lots of material devoted to it, Tart combines a Western (rational and scientific) approach with hands-on knowledge of experimentation.<br /><br />To any high-level practitioner of 'internal arts' such as Taoist meditation there should be many sections in this book.  Particularly relevant are the sections on the systems approach as well as his diagrams of the mind in general.  There is an inherent simplicity in his scientific explanations that is quite elegant.  To an advanced practitioner, the explanations are grounding and relatively satisfying for explaining the purely cognitive state one may attain from practice.<br /><br />Excellent and sure to be widely referenced in the future.	2004-08-16

The observations on \\"stilling the mental waves\\" are interesting in a scientific context when compared to brainwave studies of advanced meditation practitioners.<br /><br />The commentary in the book is useless and appears to be written by people who did not progress very far in stilling their mental waves.	2004-08-11

This book finally leads medicine (and biology) from the early 1800's into the 21st century.  That is, these areas have been stuck in a mechanistic, chemical-based view of how the body works since they elected to ignore Maxwell's work - work that has lead to all of the electrical gadgets and technology we all love so dearly.<br />For some reason those in who study life have elected to ignore Maxwell's work and concentrate on chemical reactions.  As was pointed out back in the 1920's (and earlier even) this approach precludes life so it is no wonder that medicine has not advanced very far.<br />Becker lays the groundwork for understanding ancient traditions such as Qigong (the Taoists certainly understood the concept of the energetic body) in addition to exposing the widespread pollution we are now exposed to.  One wonders when people will wake up and realize that the electromagnetic pollution is no doubt doing at least as much as the chemical pollution in causing changes to the planet's biosphere.<br />Excellent book in addition to the newer &quot;Cross Currents&quot;.	2003-03-25

Cleary has done an excellent job of putting a number of essential Taoist texts into one volume.  The book begins with some Tao Te Ching and leads straight into some translations of Ancester Lu - not everything, just the essentials.<br />There are numerous other texts here and, quite framkly, the book stands quite well as a new start in the tradition of the old classics.  That is, there appears to be a lot of 'method' to Cleary's 'madness' of taking only sections of the texts in conjunction with the general development of the material.<br />This book contains enough of the classics that it is essential to anyone seriously practicing Qigong.  If you have this and a couple of Eva Wong's excellent translations you probably don't need much else for your library.	2002-10-07

This slim volume is a collection of Varela's lectures where he attempted to expand his philosophy of self-organization and cognition, detailed in &quot;The Tree of Knowledge&quot;, by exploring its similarity with other traditions.  He also expanded on some of the more pragmatic questions about 'how' it might work to logical conclusions.  This book definitely assumes that the reader has some background knowledge and I would suggest the previously-mentioned work as the best place to start.<br />There are some interesting aspects to the lectures, particularly when Varela attempted to show similarities between his theories and some of the Eastern &quot;wisdom traditions&quot;, notably Buddhism.  However, it seems obvious that Varela became infatuated with aspects of his philosophy and then ended up in a rather untenable state by taking it to its logical conclusion.<br />Varela, unfortunately, seems to have been unaware of Rosen's work on anticipatory systems.  I say this since anticipatory systems would appear to be what Varela's theory is all about and would provide some level of conceptualization beyond mere words.  On a deeper level, Varela has a certain &quot;stink of Zen&quot; to his work - it is apparent that he has an intellectual's view of Buddhism and not one of experience.<br />Varela simply becomes caught by the very web he has been trying to avoid - he ends up 'anchoring' experience back on the shaky foundation of empty concepts.  It is too bad he never spent time actually practicing something like Zen or read further afield.  In the end the book is interesting as a footnote to a small step in the right direction but that is all.<br />I would recommend someone interested in this topic to find Rosen's books and Ekdahl's latest papers where he combines anticipation with the concept of pure induction.	2002-09-20

Lowry's book, a collection of his articles, is surprisingly consistent in theme.  His outlook reminds of Merzel's &quot;Beyond Sanity and Madness&quot; for his fairly stern reminders that the Path lies within simplicity and that the early lessons in any of the martial arts (and many other Eastern disciplines such as Qigong and Zen) contain the essence that you, as a beginner, are unfortunately unlikely to recognize for a long time.<br />I also enjoy his viewpoint regarding the the 'need' for less ego and posturing; instead he consistently points out that 'Master' depends upon what is deep inside and is displayed through consistent behaviour at all times.  Certainly this viewpoint is sorely lacking in many so-called 'Masters' at this time.<br />Lowry also gives some valuable insight into aspects of Japanese culture that are quite fascinating including Noh and the tea ceremony.  He also includes many tidbits about visiting Masters that I found very informative.<br />Even if you are not that interested in martial arts I believe there are many lessons in this book that make it worthwhile to read.	2002-09-19

This collection of short stories continues the general theme conveyed in Murakami's non-fictional account of the Sarin attack in the Tokyo subway system, \\"Underground\\".  Murakami seems fascinated by today's sadly typical capacity for detachment in the face of an emotional crisis.  In \\"Underground\\" people walked like robots past dying commuters and continued on to their office desks suffering the effects of Sarin; in this volume the Kobe earthquake provides the pivot to illuminate the emptiness of existence.<br />Murakami's language never ceases to amaze me and Rubin's deft translation is once again breathtaking.  There is a sparseness and simplicity to the language that conveys the message of quiet despair in an even more poignant fashion.  For that seems to be a common thread running throughout Murakami's work:  the everyday anti-hero who simply becomes numb to the core from life's tribulations.<br />The Kobe earthquake resonates through the collection, a distant sub-sonic note that can only be felt, not heard.  Murakami's characters seem to know they should be feeling something but all ultimately realize they are sleepwalking through life.  ...<br />Not that the collection is depressing - for some reason one always feels that there is still chance for redemption for the cast.  It is as if the characters are reminiscing at some future point about their past emptiness, after having finally had the determination to fully integrate some emotion to intellectual observation. ...<br />Enjoy.	2002-09-18

Eva Wong has done a great service to any people who are seriously pursuing the Way by translating many of the classic Taoist texts.  Her translations are not the dry, scholarly versions but are based on the fact that she is a practicing Taoist.<br />In this slim volume she translates one of the original Taoist Qigong texts which covers many aspects of cultivation.  Included are some basic theory and excellent discussions of methods - including original illustrations from the text.  These illustrations are a boon since there is a lot of information to be gleaned from them even without an understanding of the commentary.<br />This book is probably best for someone who is cultivating intensively since, even though its language is not nearly as 'arcane' as many other texts, the so-called 'signposts' are not theoretical constructs but must be experienced.  That said, for the intensive practitioner there is a wealth of information here.<br />Excellent.	2002-09-11

Eva Wong has done an admirable job translating several classic Taoist texts for Western consumption;  in this book she continues to uphold the excellent work.  These texts were allegorical references for internal alchemy (Qigong) and I have yet to find better translations.<br />Wong starts the book with a general overview of some of the historical discrepancies around the text, particularly when and by whom it was written.  Her explanation, although somewhat short, is quite informative and sets the stage for the translation.  She also provides information to assist the reader in understanding the somewhat 'cryptic' discussion of such terms as &quot;yellow sprouts&quot; and &quot;true vapour&quot;.<br />The translation is actually very informative but the reader must leave behind the Western preoccupation with trying to put everything into direct terms.  The Taoist's spoke of internal alchemy in a very poetic manner - something which I feel is probably the best method possible.  That is, a lot is up to the intuition of the reader (with the help of a proper master) which is the best way to understand the subject.  For those who have been cultivating this book will be an invaluable asset.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-04

Wildish does an admirable job of trying to convey the history, development and basic principles of Taoism in this very slim book.  He has used Eva Wong's material as his main source - this is evident by his use of &quot;ching&quot; as opposed to the more 'standard' &quot;jing&quot; found in many Taoist texts.  He also uses dates found in Wong's books.<br />The book combines a useful blend of history and philosophy to convey the general ideas behind Taoism.  There are also some short sections on external and internal alchemy including some very basic information on Qigong.<br />This is far superior to &quot;Simple Taoism&quot; and would be a good starting point for someone who is curious about Taoism.  The next step would be Wong's work and perhaps Schipper's &quot;The Taoist Body&quot;. Grigg's &quot;The Tao of Zen&quot; has some great historical work as well.	2002-09-03

This is a similar book to Deng Ming Dao's &quot;Wandering Daoist&quot; only the story of Wang Liping's training is not embellished in the manner of Saihung.  Although I'm sure the average western practitioner of Qigong will likely shake his/her head regarding some of the 'training' methods used by the three old masters it is a good reminder of what one used to have to (and perhaps still should?) undergo before getting into serious practice.  It is interesting how, right from the start, Wang Liping demonstrated many qualities essential to following the Tao including great patience and humility.<br />The book follows his initial training including stints in a hole in the ground and under a large cast-iron kettle.  It then follows his journery with his masters into the mountains just as the Cultural Revolution began to sweep across China.  Along the way many lessons are imparted including some interesting methods of cultivating with trees.  The main portion of the story ends with Wang Liping's return to his village and subsequent marriage (!) as his masters admonish him to carry on the way in a form suitable for the new age.<br />The book finishes with some commentary on Wang Liping's present activities including some stories from his group training sessions - some of the first held in China as strict controls on Qigong began to be lifted.<br />I enjoyed the story as well as the information contained in here.  There are some great views on meditation, including the aforementioned tree style, in addition to the overview of his training.  There are also some very interesting tidbits about the location of the lower Dantien shifting in relation to the cultivator's distance from the equator.  There is also an interesting comment that there are meridians within the body that are not terminated - that is, they are open to the universe.<br />Recommended...	2002-08-20

Eva Wong has done a great service to all who practice Qigong and cannot read the original material in its native tongue.  This manual was originally given to neophytes who were starting to walk the path and it is still just as fresh and important as it was when first written.<br />The book uses the format of starting each section with an illustration of the original page.  These illustrations are very interesting and informative (such as the use of the original form of the taiqi symbol) in their own right.  Then there is the primary verse followed by the commentary.  No suprises here, format-wise, to anyone who has seen western books on Zen sutras and koans.<br />Wong's commentary displays deep insight into the lessons and there is much to be learned here.

This book is intended for serious students of computer science or those who have some similar training - it is definitely set up as a textbook.  However, that being said, if you have the background the authors' delivery is fist-class and very clear.<br />The reviews below give more than enough information so I won't belabour the Kolmogorov complexity here.  Suffice it to say you won't find the subject detailed more fully in any other reference work in existence today.<br />However, this book does need to be revised and updated.  There has been a lot of development in the field and the sections overviewing Solomonoff's work, in particular, could be expanded.  Also, I found it hard to believe that nothing about the 'philosophical' importance of the whole induction question - this is at the core of many very important questions and should not be treated trivially.<br />There should also be some overview of two other areas that, in combination with the theory outlined in this text, are starting to form the nexus of a \\"new kind of science\\" (definitely not Wolfram's pathetic attempt).  I refer to some information regarding non-classical logical systems as well as anticipatory computing systems.  Both will, I predict, become core areas in addition to extensions to Kolmogorov/Chaitin complexity in the future.<br />All textbooks should be as clear and concise as this example.	2002-08-13

This is a fairly serious overview of Samurai swords intended for someone who is interested in collecting them (or perhaps has inherited one).  That is, this is quite a 'theoretical' book intended to convey, in a quite concise manner, the myriad of details needed to identify Samurai swords.<br />The book goes through a very brief overview of Japan's sword history including some very rough information on the swords produced in various time periods.  Mixed in here is a tiny amount of non-technical information in the form of some tales of how the special clay-coating heat-treating process was invented.<br />The book then presents detailed information on such subjects as blade curvature, temper lines, tip profile, tang markings and finishing.  This section has a number of line drawings that do help convey the information in a clear and simple manner.<br />This leads into a very in-depth section with the Japanese characters that could be found on a sword tang.  This section is quite long and, considering the book's purpose, not really very useful to the majority of people.  That is, without understanding Japanese you really aren't likely to be able to use this section - it would be much better to consult with someone who does understand Japanese.<br />I really had hoped for more of an overview of the history with some details on the more famous crafters.  There is also very little information on the manufacturing process other than some very cursory paragraphs and drawings.  I agree that this subject deserves many books but I also think that since it is not really highlighted in this volume, a beginner will have no real reason to understand WHY certain eras and smiths were regarded so highly.  That is, without more background on the process one is left asking the question &quot;what is wrong with a stainless-steel blade?&quot;.<br />One for the serious collector but you will definitely need other books on the subject to really get an appreciation of the remarkable nature of the Samurai sword.of the Samurai sword.	2002-08-13

I have read many of papers contained in the three CASYS conference proceedings and have been quite impressed with the direction anticipatory systems research is heading.  Anticipatory systems research is derived from Robert Rosen's seminal works &quot;Anticipatory Systems&quot;, &quot;Life Itself&quot; and &quot;Essays on Life Itself&quot;; these were basically ignored (much like Rashevsky's work prior to Rosen) but slowly its value is being realized.<br />Anticipatory systems acknowledge that real processes, particularly life, do not obey causal laws required by our present 'religion' of reductionism.  This can be seen in all aspects of science whether one looks at attempts at cybernetics, algorithmic information theory, physics or biology (to name a few).  We have consistently run up against the same roadblocks to progress since our present way of thinking excludes the possibility of ever answering some very basic questions.<br />There is a lot of interest here from Dubois' works in hyperinclusion (although I do not agree with his interpretation of Rosen) to Ekdahl's excellent research on the link between induction and anticipatory systems.  Nadin's work is quite good for someone just beginning to get interested in this area.  Many aspects of science that are complete mysteries now begin to make much more sense whether it is the Feynman-Wheeler theories of QED, understanding Shnoll's results or learning theories in general when one sees that the problem is our clinging to linear causality.<br />It is quite interesting to contrast this to Wolfram's pinnacle of ironic science, &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot; - he has no 'new' science, just more of the old stuff.  Unfortunately his money has helped him generate lots of hype about fluff when there is much more exciting and genuinely new work being done as it has in the past:  quietly and thoughtfully.	2002-07-31

This book is along the lines of Deng Ming Dao's \\"The Wandering Taoist\\" series - it tells the tale of how a contemporary Taoist Master learned his art.  In this case, it tells the story of Wang Liping's journey from ordinary youth to Master.  Along the way the reader is treated to an overview of some of the trials and tribulations people used to undergo _before_ Masters would even consider teaching them the most simple technique.<br />The story mostly concerns the initial training (some very interesting techniques here...) and then subsequent journeys of Liping.  As the story approaches its close the Cultural Revolution begins and the tale takes a twist similar to that in \\"The Wandering Taoist\\" - a complete break from tradition.<br />I have read this a couple of times since it came out and the trials endured by the young Liping never fail to amaze me when compared to the easy access we now enjoy.  I suspect anyone who cultivates will enjoy the tale too.	2002-07-26

Recently I saw a book called &quot;Zen and the Art of Driving&quot; and ever since I've had a sinking feeling of 'McDonald's Zen(TM)' somehow taking over.  This book certainly cuts through some of the intellectual overviews of koans that people seem to feel provide &quot;answers&quot;.<br />Kapleau works with only a few of the most 'common' koans, providing the koan and standard commentary.  He then moves into a true discussion that cuts to the heart of the koan but all the time walking the razor's edge of conceptualization.  That is, there is enough here to help someone who is, perhaps, starting to get interested in this 'new age' thing called Zen but not too much that the person thinks they understand it all by simply reading a book.<br />Kapleau has some interesting Western insight to bring to the discussion but it is also obvious that his Eastern knowledge runs deep.  An excellent book for both the newcomer and long-time practioner.	2002-07-25

And there will be lots more to come.  Why?  Well, spirituality is about being, not dogma, and we are all individuals.  Just as we all have different narratives about, for instance, our journey of self-discovery and learning of language, we will all have different stories for our discovery of spirit.  Or at least I hope the _majority_ of us develop such stories or we will be another short footnote in the history of life on this planet.<br />What books are useful or perhaps even groundbreaking?  Some stories involve three-day courses where people are given 'authentic Indian names' at the end and told they are great shamans or yogis.  Unfortunately there is no such thing as McDonald's spirituality - the process of uncovering being is, in 99.99999% of the cases (just look at how many 'great' spiritual leaders we have had in the history of our race) a rather arduous and painful one.<br />Tolle had a revelation (which he does not give details about) quite a number of years ago.  He has lived since then in relative seclusion in Canada, Vancouver to be exact.  This book is the culmination of his spiritual growth - written because he feels strongly about trying to get out a message to Westerners.<br />This is where this book excels.  There is little new here for anyone who has deep experience in Eastern spirituality such as Zen or Taoism; nor is there little new for anyone who has completed deep practice in shamanism.  The key is deep practice:  there is no free lunch here!  Tolle makes this point frequently by interspersing the book with symbols representing 'pauses' where you are supposed to do some work.  A great idea.<br />Tolle's focus is to give a more Western path for confronting the insanity of the ego.  He goes through the 'why' portion and then moves into some general overviews of the 'how'.  I thought his blending of different religions was done in an artful manner and several friends who have borrowed the book have had the same comment.  Much like Stephen Mitchell, Tolle manages to tweak the best out of the mostly-corroded shell of Christianity.<br />For anyone considering starting this very important journey, this book is a good place to start.

Well, after years of the Western tradition doing 'comparative' studies of other cultures it finally gets analyzed in the same manner by someone from a different culture.  Deloria is a well-known member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe who is also an author, scholar, philosopher and lawyer.  Utilizing precisely the same methods practiced by the Christian-based, scientific-minded culture perpetuated in our present Universities he deftly slices open Christianity from his point of view.<br />Deloria's main thesis is to remind us that &quot;we are a part of nature, not a transcendent species with no responsibility to the natural world.&quot;  He makes this point in numerous ways, often in a very witty manner.  I have no doubt this makes those entrenched in our Western condition very uncomfortable but it is healthy medicine for the insanity of the times.  I also have no doubt his views make those with 'authentic Indian names', no doubt given at a three-day retreat, very uncomfortable.<br />Welcome to reality.  The reality of forced sterilization, funded by the churches and government, and the the reality of children who were &quot;rescued&quot; to residential schools and force-fed Western culture.  This book aptly exposes the hypocrisy and malaise affecting Christianity at this time.<br />It is only somewhat scholarly in style - compared to many such books, particularly Said's classic, this is an easy read.  Enjoy even if it makes you squirm.	2002-07-22

Well, since I've been on a bit of a 'systems' binge lately, I might as well review this old gem...<br />Checkland's book was the first to introduce the differentiation between 'soft' and 'hard' systems analysis.  Soft analysis is much more akin to a general, somewhat philosophical approach to the methodology whereas hard analysis is the development of usable engineering models.<br />First off, this book is actually two books - the first is a fairly long paper that neatly sums up the systems approach over the 30 years it has been explored.  The consensus?  Things looked really promising at the beginning but unfortunately the approach simply got hung up on the very thing it was trying to escape:  science's current preoccupation with reductionism.  That is, the hard systems approach attracted the most attention and it quickly succumbed to the very trap it sought to escape starting with its use of rigidly-defined symbols right up to the detailed diddling with mathematical models that, similar to earlier approaches, did not model reality at all due to assumptions and oversimplification.<br />Checkland is much more interested in the soft approach and he consistently laments the fact that systems methodology is not being taught even though it holds so much promise to solving many of our pressing problems.  The overview presses this point home and should be required reading for anyone in management or engineering.<br />The second section, the original book with a few revisions, is still very relevant.  Checkland's focus, soft systems, never was given a chance given our preoccupation with reductionism.  Given the recent failures of reductionism, particularly the genome-mapping fiasco, cast systems theory in new light.<br />Checkland starts out with an excellent overview of the history of science from a (mostly) philosophical perspective.  This very readable overview leads directly into his discussion of the history and early development of systems theory.  He then focuses on systems methodology (soft systems theory) with some general applications.<br />The approach is very readable and should be easily understood by anyone - in fact, Checkland stresses the importance of having a wide base of knowledge to help solve real-world problems and points out that much work has been done by people who 'migrated' from other fields.  Smuts, one of the pioneers, was actually a politician and only wrote a systems book after losing an election...<br />It is unfortunate that there are no references to Robert Rosen here since his work, more of a 'hard' approach to systems theory, fully supports Checkland's ideas.  In fact, there is a lot of material that should be included as 'backup' for why the systems approach is important as a new direction away from reductionism.  Perlovsky's work in cybernetics, Jopling's recent work on self-knowledge, Prigogine's work in thermodynamics and even Kauffman's attempts in biology now point to hypotheses that are only compatible with a systems methodology.<br />This book, as mentioned above, should be required reading these days.  Certainly for anyone contemplating management or engineering it is a very important reference.  In fact, the book could basically be used in high-school with a bit of help from Weinberg's systems books.  For those looking for more application-specific information I recommend von Bertalanffy's original, Rosen's work, and perhaps a side helping of Weinberg and Gharajedaghi for more ideas.systems methodology (soft systems theory) with some general applications.<br />The approach is very readable and should be easily understood by anyone - in fact, Checkland stresses the importance of having a wide base of knowledge to help solve real-world problems and points out that much work has been done by people who 'migrated' from other fields.

Jopling does an admirable job of tackling the philosophy (and, to a certain extent, the psychology) of self-knowledge.  The book's introduction lays out the general scope of his arguments and background, both of which are quite diverse.  Jopling draws on many sources of inspiration but mainly focuses on some of the more recent works in this area.  More telling is the section in the Introduction titled &quot;Four Philosophical Psychologies&quot; - finally, a philosopher similar to Faber (&quot;Objectivity and Human Perception: Revisions and Crossroads in Psychoanalysis and Philosophy&quot;) who is unafraid to confront the nexus of thought and being.<br />He first looks at different approaches to the self and how the different modes of self-inquiry lead to some problems.  Then he leads into a discussion on self-detachment and self-knowledge including transparency and reflective detachment borrowed from Hampshire's work.  Jopling includes some excellent references to psychology while also developing the philosophical overview.<br />Jopling then moves to the grittier questions of being versus identity.  His discussion of Sartre's work, particularly the contrast with previous philosophers is very informative and interesting.  Then Jopling moves to the post-modern view epitomized by Rorty.  The problems associated with the infinite spiral of narratives is laid bare.<br />Jopling's final chapter focuses on dialogic self-knowing.  Interestingly enough, Jopling uses Margaret Laurence's &quot;The Stone Angel&quot; to draw in the threads of self-knowledge theory and psychology.  I enjoyed the use of literature to illustrate the fact that self-knowledge &quot;takes the form of injunction, attestation, and avowal&quot;.<br />An excellent companion to Faber's work.	2002-07-09

Considering the age of this book it is still very relevant and interesting.  That is, Elsasser did not have the benefit of more recent advances in several areas including Algorithmic Information Theory, artificial intelligence, and genetics.  In particular, I suspect he would have had a lot to say about the genome-mapping fiasco and the spectacular failure of mechanistic genetic theories to come anywhere close to predicting reality.<br />Elsasser introduced the term 'holism' in this book in order that biology could return to something more useful than playing with simple chemical reactions.  He realized the inherent limitations of the reductionist view, later expounded by Robert Rosen.  Elsasser's background in physics and mathematics let him see the inherent limitations of the current fascination with the narrow reductionist view and gave him ample ammunition to expose the fallacies of this mode of exploration.<br />This book is very readable and contains almost no math - Elsasser references many papers and other works that do contain the theory.  This book is required reading for anyone wishing to continue exploration in Robert Rosen's excellent books.  It is highly recommended.	2002-07-09
US	49437056	R2JYZ98SD89EF5	0345359321	486440079	Travels	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Surprisingly good...	It's always fun to randomly pick something off of the shelf and discover, after about 20 pages, that it is quite good.  I've  never been a fan of Crichton's other books - pseudo-science thrillers that most seem to be - so it was just luck that for some reason I picked this off the shelf in a used bookstore.  Again, I usually don't find much pleasure in reading paranoia-inducing pseudo-science thrillers and the authors of such novels usually seem to me to be after money and nothing more.<br />However, Crichton appears to have quite an interesting story.  The book starts out with some of his experiences as a pre-med and medical student that helped form some of his opinions about science.  The tales culminate in his decision to leave the medical profession due to so many conflicts with the methodology of treating humans, well, basically products.  Interwoven into the 'early days' is some information on early travels in addition to some background on his rather spotty relationships and family problems.<br />After moving to California to try to make a new career writing and working on movies Crichton begins to dabble in, shall we say, somewhat 'new age' spiritualism including psychics.  It is only after a several years of such dabbling, in addition to some other large events that occur during his travels, that Crichton gradually comes to accept that there is much much more to the universe than all that we are taught in science textbooks.<br />This is the major theme that gradually is revealed over the course of the book:  what we experience is relative to our state of mind and that state can range from all-encompassing to completely self-centered.  I believe the final pages, where Crichton presents some quite apt commentary on our new religion of science, have so much impact simply due to Crichton's unflinching presentation of his personal growth.  For that really is what makes the book such a great read:  Crichton never backs away from showing the reader his frailties and foibles.<br />Great fun and much more relevant today than when it was first published.and foibles.<br />Great fun and much more relevant today than when it was first published.	2002-06-24

The book starts innocently enough but then begins its descent into a weird universe as the main character flips back and forth through time trying to answer a question.<br />The characters are certainly not 'normal' in any sense of the word - think PK Dick or perhaps J Lethem - and the situations are certainly run-of-the-mill.  But the questions Carroll is trying to wrestle with are not easily asked, let alone trying to come up with answers.  Starting from a quite mundane state the main character, McCabe, begins his descent into weirdness that culminates with time-traveling aliens.<br />Carroll always treads a razor-like line between the mundane and the weird, much like Murakami.  I still prefer Murakami's stylistic touches, or perhaps I should say, lack of stylistic touches.  That is, Carroll appears much less neutral in his role as storyteller than Murakami.  Both writers certainly seem to share a fascination with what is always lurking below apparently bland surfaces.<br />It would appear to me that Carroll is trying to allude to some sort of involvement in an Eastern tradition such as Zen.  Certainly his novels have a strong current of mysticism and strong warnings about tempering the ego's drive.	2002-06-20

Wittgenstein hastily wrote &quot;On Certainty&quot; in his last days - several places he seemed frustrated that he was unlikely to be able to get his ideas across.  However, this work distills most of his work on the foundations of knowledge in a manner that is quite accessible.  In fact, this book should have been entitled something like &quot;cutting through centuries of misguided notions&quot; - you only get clarity of vision such as contained in this volume if you are lucky enough to get samadhi from &quot;show me your original face&quot;.<br />Wittgenstein used Moore's (in)famous paper that started with &quot;knowing&quot; his hand and then deduced the universe.  Wittgenstein showed the inherent fallacy of this attempt and in the process paraded the naked emperor of metaphysics around in all its dualistic glory.  For Wittgenstein really attacked the 'mapping' of what is really psychology into the analytic framework of philosophy.<br />Wittgenstein pointed out that doubt is a 'game', in the sense that doubting must follow logical rules.  The game runs aground when it attempts to doubt the actual framework - such as doubting your own existence.  This is no longer part of the 'game' but instead is simply nonsense or, better, psychology.<br />Wittgenstein wrote the book in his familiar style utilizing short semi-paragraphs to map out his arguments.  I find the format quite similar to Eastern philosophy such as Tao Te Ching and the Zen koans and feel it is quite readable.  Other people may want to buy Avrum Stroll's excellent &quot;Moore and Wittgenstein on Certainty&quot; for a more 'standard' overview of the argments.<br />This is essential reading for anyone interested in the future of philosophy.	2002-06-18

Schipper is one of the few of European descent to ever become an ordained Taoist priest.  This gives him a unique view on some of the history and practices of Taoism but there are some caveats to be noted.<br />The book provides a good contextual overview of many facets of the culture that gave rise to Taoism.  Schipper makes a number of interesting points regarding the general culture and Taoist practices including the so-called 'bedroom manuals'.  Also included are some good points about gender issues and Taoism as well as his take on some of the Taoist legends and past masters.  There are short chapters outlining Qigong and the practice of cultivation which include some very good (although short) translations of some of the more famous Taoist canons.  There is also a great overview of the whole cereal abstinence debate as well as some thoughts on Taoist external alchemy that I found quite interesting.  There is a good (although too short, IMHO) overview on Taoist hermits and why the took to the mountains.<br />All of this is presented in quite a scholarly manner, more in line with a true reference book than many others available right now.  This is both good and bad, in my opinion.  That is, we should remember that &quot;the Tao that is spoken of is not the true Tao&quot;.  Schipper needs to be taken with a large 'grain of salt' since obviously his 'version' of the Tao is dependent on his master's lineage.  There is a reason there are so many 'flavours' of Taoism and that has to do with the fact that, ultimately, cultivation is an extremely personal past time!<br />So there are many aspects that are missing and possibly misleading here.  Bigu (or even fasting) is not really mentioned, probably because it is not part of his sect's way.  His overview on 'bedroom manuals' is interesting but that is not to say it is the 'truth' - answering something like that is ultimately a personal journey and all the spoken and written material is ultimately just a finger pointing at the moon.  The same goes for everything else in the book - just one man's opinion.  If he is truly practising the Way and cultivating daily then I suspect he will need to rewrite this book every year (or few months).<br />Anyway, definitely worth reading and some good ideas.

I tracked down a used copy of this book in order to complete a collection of Robert Rosen's work.  His essay, presented at a Sante Fe conference on the 'limits of science' is probably the most concise distillation of his ideas I have found to date.  He neatly captured all of the major methodology and resulting implications from &quot;Life Itself&quot;, &quot;Anticipatory Systems&quot; and the later &quot;Essays on Life Itself&quot; within the short paper in a very clear manner.<br />However, when one reads the other papers here it is evident how the other presenters were still lost within their self-imposed prisons.  That is, none seemed to fully grasp why their methodologies had run aground and instead presented various myths.  Myths that have now been shown to be just as limiting as what they were trying to escape.<br />It is still more disheartening to see Casti's paper and then look at some of his recent books.  He obviously did not (and still doesn't) grasp what was obvious to Rosen.  Rosen voiced concerns about the inability of many of his peers to dispense with their 'religious' beliefs in their frameworks and return to a more pure form of science; one where we acknowledge that all results are tentative and open to revision.<br />It is certainly worth tracking down this paper but the remainder of the book is little more than a sad footnote to what is wrong at the heart of science at this time.	2002-06-07

Weinberg distills the essence from von Bertalanffy's classic and manages to present it in a very accessible fashion.  The book has been out of print for quite a while so it is great to see a new edition.  The message and information contained in here, although originally published in 1975, is now more relevant than ever.<br />Weinberg covers many aspects of systems theory beginning with the main stumbling block with the present scientific paradigm:  the idea that the universe is mechanistic.  His treatment is much more general than Robert Rosen's in &quot;Life Itself&quot; but still conveys why the mechanistic notion is flawed.<br />He then outlines the general systems theory approach before leading into the idea that a system is simply a way of looking at the world.  He then outlines the principle of indifference.  This leads straight into two sections outlining various aspects of making observations.  Finally he discusses behaviour and then some general systems questions.<br />Throughout the book he uses many examples from disparate fields in conjunction with questions for further research.  It is great to see someone who doesn't preach systems but actually uses the ideas.<br />Definitely a must-read as we decided how to solve the myriad of issues before us.	2002-06-05

Dipersloot has been practicing various forms of the 'soft' martial arts for quite a long time.  This volume covers his discovery of the importance of Qigong standing meditation from three masters.  He then discusses some finer points of Taiqi's 'Grasp Bird Tail' which is the only moving form now practiced by the senior master he trained under.<br />Dipersloot has quite a lot of good tips for standing meditation which is great since too many authors seem to imply there is nothing to it.  It is true that, like sitting, you just need to stand _but_ it does help to have some pointers.  That is, if you start standing meditation then eventually your body will find the correct Qi position but this could take a long long time for many.<br />His points about the correct posture and breathing from the Dantien are communicated quite clearly.  So are the guidelines from Master Cai about the energy points and general alignment.  There is a great section, taken from one of Master Cai's discussions, that very succinctly covers the important aspects of meditation in general and standing meditation in particular.<br />The real weakness here are the very crude computer-modified &quot;photos&quot;.  Diepersloot apologizes at the beginning about the quality of the photos (he was busy writing down everything the masters said) but that is not an excuse for what is used in the book.  Spending some extra time with some volunteers to get quality photos would help the give the book the image of quality it requires; they would also help make some points much more clearly.<br />A good reference for anyone with some questions about standing meditation.  Should go up on the shelf with Mantak Chia, &quot;Qigong Empowerment&quot; and &quot;The Roots of Qigong&quot;.  better yet, find out when WISH is holding a class near you and go meet a real master for proper instruction.	2002-06-04

Many different applications of non-linear dynamics, from physics to biology, are overviewed and many detailed examples are provided.  In all, this is a great reference.<br />The only shortcomings are the lack of discussions about frameworks, particularly mechanistic systems, and how they influence the applicability of the models.  That is, some understanding of systems theory (von Bertalanffy in particular and the work of cybernetics as well) should have been included to point out the fact that the linear causality implied by many models immediately limits their applicability.	2002-05-30

Subtitled:  Welcome back to the ether.<br />To paraphrase Wittgenstein, where to start without going further back?  Well, some comments on the `packaging':  very pretty.  Lots of trees are going to die for this monumental ode to the problem at the heart of science and unfortunately their deaths are not going to advance the state of knowledge at all.  Yes, the quality of the book is impeccable and the typeface, general layout and profuse use of illustrations make it a bargain for the price.  One must realize that approximately 1/3 of the book are the additional notes that Wolfram has decided to include to demonstrate how his thesis can be applied to \\"everything\\" that has been done in science.  But more on that later...<br />Wolfram has managed to neatly epitomize all that is wrong with science right now.  It is unfortunate he appears not to have heard about Robert Rosen in his flurry of referencing and decade of `researching' since otherwise he might have decided to move on to something actually useful.  Or perhaps if he had read Perlovsky or Solomonoff he might have come to some different, and again, useful conclusions.<br />Wolfram, amongst the very numerous self-references, advances two main ideas that he sees embodying \\"the new science\\".  The first is the idea that simple programs can have very complex outputs - the concept of the complexity of the output of something like Rule 30 cellular automatons baffling all attempts at compression.  The second is his \\"new\\" theory of computational equivalence.<br />Well, there is some news from those sad `hacks' on the sidelines:  the first \\"idea\\" is nothing new and, in fact, is simply a logical extension of the framework chosen for the analysis and the \\"theorem\\" is perhaps the best illustration of what philosophers refer to as the \\"gem\\":  tautology.  That is, Wolfram's glorious theorem results from his choice of axioms and should not be at all surprising unless one is either too stupid to realize this or else is bent on a program of solipsism.<br />The universe is not mechanistic.  If it were then Wolfram's theory must be taken as an axiom.  The first idea, that simple programs can produce results just as complex as very complicated programs, is a logical extension of what we already know about mechanistic frameworks.  All of this can easily be demonstrated in a number of ways but perhaps a quick look at the \\"problem\\" of induction in formal systems best illustrates why.<br />Solomonoff's work on Kolmogorov/Chaitin complexity points out that \\"for practical [computable] induction it is necessary to use computable approximations\\" (comment added by me).  That is, real induction, as practiced by living organisms, is non-computable.  AIP, Algorithmic Probability, readily admits that true induction cannot be computable for the moment that one imposes any syntactical-only solution one has already constrained the ability to perform induction.  This is the real problem in a mechanistic universe:  you are stuck with deduction and a very limited version at that.  Now the AIP folks have done lots of work here using rather complex programs to try to escape the problem, like Wittgenstein's fly in the bottle.<br />So it should be no surprise that at the other end of the extreme, a very small program, one should find great richness in output since one is attempting to impose fewer constraints from the start.  But there is news from the outside world that Wolfram should have checked before launching this sad footnote:  it won't work.  I suggest Perlovsky if one wishes to understand why.<br />In fact, the AI people realized this limitation a while ago and have feverishly been trying to find ways of \\"stepping outside\\" of the mechanistic framework.  The crux of this is the simple fact that you need to be non-computable if you want to join the ranks of the living.  That is, entailment (causality) is impoverished in a mechanistic framework:  how do you ever stop asking \\"what entails X\\" without invoking magic?  Go and find a copy of Rosen's \\"Life Itself\\" and really learn something new.<br />And this is evident throughout Wolfram's book.  We have the ether coming back (he proposes some type of nodal network as the fundamental building block for the universe) and a complete lack of discussion of any of the major problems facing science, particularly physics, such as what is life, why inertial mass equals gravitational mass and why we have so few genomes when mechanistic theory says we should.  Even consciousness does not get discussed anywhere in his section on the nature of analysis and perception other than the ugly word \\"representation\\" slipping in.  A cellular automaton representing to what (go read your Tallis)?  One feels we have beaten this horse enough already to even believe it can still be presented by anyone with any serious pretensions to discussing the topic.<br />This is the worse part of the whole enterprise.  There is no new science here, only the same problems with some new band-aids.  One hopes we will finally begin to suspect why we are not making more advances and come back to what is crucial:  the choice of the framework limits the solution set of the problem.

This collection of papers and presentations, published posthumously, is a companion to Rosen's earlier books &quot;Life Itself&quot; and &quot;Anticipatory Systems:  Philosophical, Mathematical and Methodological Foundations&quot;.

Not that this should prevent people from reading the earlier work since there are many sections that will be quite clear; I just feel that unfortuntely the crucial points of &quot;Life Itself&quot; might be lost due to the seeming technical nature of the explanation.<br />This is truly paradigm-shifting, moreso than anything else you are likely to read about in science.  The Sante Fe crowd such as Stuart Kauffman obviously did not even grasp what Rosen was talking about when they met back in 1994 and that is even more tragic.  So much time has been wasted with such money-wasters like the genome mapping fiasco when it could have been going into exploring new axioms for science.<br />For you see, this is what Rosen so eloquently points out in his work:  the present axioms of science are much too limiting to explain anything we really would like to know about the universe.  It is very interesting to see that Rosen grasped the implications of what also caught Einstein and Schrodinger's attention:  the problem of inertial and gravitational mass.  Rosen also points out the myriad of other areas where science has been busy putting band-aid after band-aid on the present set of theories to try to make them predict real phenomena.<br />For this is the problem with the present-day paradigms:  they are only useful for predicting the N+1 state for some dead (and therefore uninteresting) mechanistic universe.  The evidence has been staring us in the face for quite a while and I am not sure why Rosen should have been the first to analyze where the problems lie; it is even more surprising why his work appears to be so little known.<br />I also like the fact that this book is much more polished than his previous work.  The index is mostly complete and there is also a list of references.  I didn't note very many editorial erros and the language is quite friendly. This is a very high-quality science book and I suspect the first editions will be going for large prices in about 20 years when the &quot;establishment&quot; finally figures out where they went wrong.<br />Buy this and read it.  And read it again.  Then wonder why we are rushing pell-mell to &quot;engineer&quot; the world when we don't understand it at all.the fact that this book is much more polished than his previous work.

I haven't been that impressed with Dr. Yang's other Qigong books but this one captures a good amount of essential ideas in one place.  The book goes through the 5 element theory in a very basic way (for a very thorough view of this see &quot;Between Heaven and Earth : A Guide to Chinese Medicine&quot;).  The book then goes through a very detailed and excellent discussion of Qi, Jing and Shen.<br />There are a few exercises in here but this is really a reference dedicated to the more &quot;theoretical&quot; aspects of Qigong.  There are many important tips for all aspects of Qigong including some good ideas for helping you achieve a deeper Qi state during meditation.  There are also some good points about things such as Qi stagnation and how to relieve it.<br />Dr. Yang also keeps pointing out that it is important to find a good master - something I agree cannot be overemphasised.  There are many people in North America claiming to &quot;masters&quot; and it would appear that the vast majority are better labelled as enthusiasts.  If you are really interested in what Qigong can do for  you I highly suggest finding out if WISH (USA or Canada) have a class nearby.  I would avoid many of the other books since most promote activities that can be very harmful if not done under expert supervision.<br />When you come down to it, Qigong (and meditation in general) is not something that is suited for books.  It is about doing it and being dedicated to cultivating yourself.  Spend your money on a good introductory course and start practicing!	2002-05-10

Casti, better known as part of the Sante Fe research group, has extended his original book 'Paradigms Lost' in this volume.  He uses the rough idea of a trial to introduce the 'defense' and 'prosecution' for various scientific paradigms as of the year 2000.<br />The book starts out with trying to provide a rough overview of the scientific process including the grand old claim of \\"Of course there's more to the scientific enterprise than just concocting a theory.\\"  To top it off he drags out the Sokal \\"affair\\" where a pseudo-scientific paper was published in a literary journal and later another paper was published in a separate journal pointing out the inconsistencies in the first.<br />But Casti simply propogates the whole mentality wihthout seeming to acknowledge or understand what is going on.  But let's start with the 'big' questions that Casti wants to tackle:<br />- Life arose out of natural physical processes<br />- Human behaviour patterns are dictacted by the genes<br />- Human language stems from an innate property of the brain<br />- Computers can think<br />- There exist intelligent beings in our galaxy we can communicate with<br />Well, a pretty heavy list but Casti really avoids doing much work to hold a proper court and instead \\"demonstrates\\" how the rationality of current scientifice paradigms can easily defeat the straw-men of any other ideas.  And this is very obvious to anyone with some scientific background.<br />The first thing to realize is the simple fact that almost all genetic theories postulate we should have in excess of 100,000 genomes.  Of course we have now completed the genome mapping fiasco and have discovered we have about 30,000.  Now, one would suspect that if scientific theories were so \\"true\\" they would have pointed out this major inconsistency and some scientists did produce other theories that said this (Barry Commoner being one person who has repeatedly pointed out the problems with the present theory).  But, as usual, the \\"scientific process\\" basically launched an ad hominen attack against those who actually know better.<br />So the first few chapters of this book are absolute nonsense (as Post would have said).  Worse, Casti comes to the conclusion that the theories are the truth and keeps plowing ahead.  Perhaps he should have gone and spent some time in serious research on these subjects before looking like an idiot - a quick search on the internet will find references such as Commoner, Post and Rosen.  Oh well...<br />The whole speech section is woefully inadequate in a similar vein since Vygotsky isn't even mentioned.  Once again, a quick search should have turned this up and one wonders if Casti spent any time looking up different viewpoints.<br />And then there is AI...well, the easiest place to start is Perlovsky.  Is he here?  No, of course not.  In fact, this section has a quaint air of something written by a really really bad science fiction student.<br />Not that this book doesn't have some use - it is a prime example of what is wrong with the scientific process (as it currently stands) and the entire social structure it has spawned.  Yes, Casti has produced a book with less value than Sokal's joke paper and the worst part is it is likely he believes he has presented the \\"truth\\".<br />Do you want to learn about where we are?  Read Perlovsky, Vygotsky, Barry Commoner's article on genetics and Robert Rosen's \\"Life Itself\\".  Then you'd better go back and brush up on some Wittgenstein and perhaps a quick skim of Post.

This book uses 'Johnny' von Neumann as a central theme to discuss the development of game theory and how it interacted and influenced the Cold War.  There is a very basic description of game theory which is likely to give some understanding to those without any mathematical background.  More interesting is the history of von Neumann including glimpses into his family life when he was a child.<br />It was quite interesting to read how he grew up in an environment of anti-Semitism in Hungary yet his parents seemed to promote a funny type of mish-mash of beliefs such as having Christmas presents!  In fact, many aspects of von Neumann's personal and spiritual side, including his early conversion to Catholocism and later call for a priest as he lay dying are unfortunately only hinted at.<br />I point this out because the other aspects of von Neumann's character, his prodigious mathematical talent and his fervent belief that the US strike first with atomic bombs against the then-developing USSR, are quite evident here.  What comes across is a general sense that von Neumann was very arrogant about his knowledge and ability to solve everything within the theoretical world.  It appears that von Neumann truly believed he was the most intelligent mathematician at that time and one gets the feeling that anyone who might have come close (John Nash comes to mind) was downplayed as working on something 'trivial'.<br />Luckily, we also get a glimpse into von Neumann's marriage where his mathematical abilities certainly didn't help him to acheive much happiness.  Judging by the many references to his constant fights and stream of rather childish letters his emotional development lagged far behind his other abilities.  This is also seen in his one-upmanship demonstrated during the many parties he and his wife threw for colleagues during his years at Princeton.<br />But it is the interplay of his arrogance with the development of the atomic bomb that is the most interesting.  It is scary to see how close the world came to all-out war due to the constant preaching by von Neumann (and some of the others in RAND) that game theory absolutely demonstrated that the US must strike first or there could be no resolution to the developing political conflict.  I suspect von Neumann's seemingly purposive (probably due to his ego) ignorance of Turing played a deeper role here since one wonders why he didn't develop the theories, later put forward by Chaitin and Kolmogorov, about the limitations of knowledge.<br />That is, it is surprising how arrogant he was based on the fact that Godel was there at the same time!  Oh well, it is lucky for us that we can look back and read about the history with the knowledge that people didn't take von Neumann as seriously as Dr. Strangelove - since it certainly appears that von Neumann could have been used as the basis for that character.<br />Anyway, this is certainly worth reading for a fascinating glimpse into the times.  One just hopes that the arrogance and ego will one day fade so that we can move the hands of the 'doomsday' clock back.scary to see how close the world came to all-out war due to the constant preaching by von Neumann (and some of the others in RAND) that game theory absolutely demonstrated that the US must strike first or there could be no resolution to the developing political conflict.

US	49437056	R1VQ4TDU3EB7NH	0231075642	566736380	Life Itself	Books	5	21	25	N	N	Groundbreaking...	It is hard to believe this book is not better known considering the nature of its views.  At least, one wonders why so few who are \\"experts\\" in the area seem unaware of it since it appears to stand unrefuted.  But then again, we are talking about a book that points out the serious limitations inherent in our whole scientific framework that has become today's religion.<br />Rosen starts by discussing concepts of life:  what is it?  He then runs through the reasons why it is considered a \\"hard\\" problem with the present Newtonian-based framework.  He covers the difference between syntax and semantics, Godel, causality and complexity in a very informative yet also accessible manner.<br />He then gets to the meat of his thesis, the discussion of the fundamental axioms inherent in our present scientific viewpoint.  This section has enough of an overview that I believe most people will grasp what he is driving at.  That is, the concepts of modeling and entailment that are to be formally dissected in later chapters are very well explained so that there limitations may be understood.<br />It is the true nature of our models and their methods of encoding the world that Rosen is primarily exposing.  Rosen goes back to Taylor's Theorem and demonstrates how Newton's \\"Laws of Nature\\" built in fundamental constraints on the nature of the whole scientific enterprise.  Unfortunately I suspect the math here may be beyond some people although it really is only slightly more advanced that what is typically learned in high school - this is, in fact, the way it should be taught in the first place.<br />After laying this groundwork Rosen returns to his discussion of why the type of entailment specified through Newton's fundamental constraints limits any applicability to the \\"real\\" world.  He introduces Rashevsky's ideas and then develops excellent methods of notation in order to delve more deeply into relational biology.<br />Then he moves to Analytic and Synthetic models which are compared and contrasted.  The uses these ideas to introduce the concept of a machine (loosely based on Turing's ideas).  And finally he delves into the relational limits of machines.  All this work leads to:<br />\\"The picture we have painted looks bleak indeed, if we insist on identifying science with mechanism.  But we must recall that there is no basis for such an identification.\\"<br />And there we have it - just what many have been saying for quite a while just without the full technical details provided by Rosen.<br />There probably is enough evidence to finally convince the die-hards that this view is correct now that we have the spectacular failure of the genome-mapping project (well, it isn't a failure in some ways but it is for those fanatics of Dawkins and Crick) and the even more spectacular failure of the new priests of complexity.  It should be more obvious that we need a new framework, not more shaky models built on axioms that are the problems in the first place.<br />Let us hope more people read this book so that some of the arrogance may be dispelled...red and contrasted.

This book is quite a disappointment even accounting for the fact that the scientific endeavors it outlines were just becoming &quot;hot&quot; when it was published.  The disappointment has a lot to do with the ego of the author and his apparent lack of knowledge outside of his field.<br />Gell-Mann, winner of the Physics Nobel Prize, has obviously let this go to his head.  That is, one wonders whether he would write anything resembling some of the views in the book without being able to point out that he won the prize and, therefore, his view is important.<br />The book begins with some personal anecdotes that tie in to some very general information about complexity.  Gell-Mann then goes through a lead-in to Quantum Theory and proceeds to outline the general area of his own specialty:  Quantum Chromodynamic Theory.  All of this overview is generally acceptable but there are better books for learning this information, notably Bohm's old primer (which Gell-Mann notes was even well-received by Einstein).<br />Then Gell-Mann launches into a rambling discourse trying to tie parts of complexity, evolution and economics together.  It was here that I began to get rather frustrated since there is a lot that is missing.  Notably it is apparent where the Sante Fe &quot;high priests&quot; of complexity have determined who is &quot;in&quot; and who is &quot;out&quot; of their exclusive club.  And it is evident that Prigogine, Wolfram and Chaitin, to name a few, are not members of the club.<br />And it is not hard to figure out why they aren't noted here:  the Sante Fe group are really some sort of materialists at heart.  This is rather an odd philosophy for those involved in complexity but it is obvious there is a belief that they are in pursuit of a &quot;true science&quot;, to quote one of their founders from another book.  But if you admit that science is creating ever more compressed theories and you cannot ever determine if something is optimally compressed then how do you state there is a &quot;true science&quot;?<br />Well, welcome to world where a few thousand years of philosophy are thrown out the window, no doubt since philosophy is not a &quot;true science&quot;.  Yes, arguments based on tautology (the good old &quot;gem&quot;) abound here but sadly, no matter how smart these guys may be, they miss this small fact and proceed to make sweeping pronouncments from the pulpit instead.  The real fun is how many times the Sante Fe group can note Zipf's law (power law) in data and make sweeping conclusions about the relationship of some model to reality  yet then admit, quite sheepishly I think, that no one has any idea what the power law means.<br />Anyway, the more I read the more disapointed I became.  The final chapters, very thin I must add, are supposed to be Gell-Mann's contribution to the general well-being of the planet.  Oh yes, we have some major problems with the whole concept of &quot;sustainable development&quot; but I doubt that anyone with Gell-Mann's philosophy is going to contribute in a positive fashion to fixing the problem.<br />That is, we need less of this preaching and more caution.  This is all the more evident with the genome mapping fiasco - Sante Fe has spent years relating models of human evolution to a genome count of 100,000.  If the models (in other words, the science) were so good why didn't they point out that really only have 30,000?  Well, could it be your science is plain wrong?  We'll see if any of this crowd has the guts to actually admit that.<br />If you want something worthwhile, read Prigogine's work.  Or Chaitin.  Or Jantsch.  But don't bother with this soon-forgotten book.state there is a &quot;true science&quot;?<br />Well, welcome to world where a few thousand years of philosophy are thrown out the window, no doubt since philosophy is not a &quot;true science&quot;.

This is good collection of reference papers on various aspects of Quantitative EEG.  This is an attempt to make EEG more \\"scientific\\" by trying to set up a framework of data to use as reference by the medical community as opposed to the more qualitative aspect of just looking at brainwaves.<br />This thesis is apparent in the first paper which is probably just gibberish for anyone not interested in the basis for the database.  However, the remainder of the papers contain some very interesting observations and are worth reading.  There is a good paper detailing the success of a group using QEEG for children with ADD and ADHD which would be a great reference.<br />That is, although the benefits of meditation have been noted for thousands of years there are many who feel that this is all magic now that we have science to rely on.  Unfortunately for these folks they don't usually know enough to question scientific endeavors and blindly accept any sort of a study as the \\"truth\\".  Well, now there is scientific evidence that meditation can have a positive effect on many problems including ADD and ADHD; hopefully this will keep a few kids off of drugs.<br />In the end, this book is a useful reference to those seeking a more comprehensive view of meditation.  In addition to Freeman's work and Austin's \\"Zen and the Brain\\" (among other books) we of the Western scientific background are slowly beginning to legitimize what others have been saying for quite a long time...Better yet, find a master and buy a zafu, you won't regret it!	2002-04-08

Well...where to begin without going further back?<br />This book is a compendium of papers, most from members of the Sante Fe institute.  That is, the papers are by the self-proclaimed &quot;experts&quot; in the field of complex adaptive systems (complexity as it is termed by some).  Although published in 1999 it is mostly out of date as a reference but it stands as testament to something I think is more interesting than pure science.<br />What we have here is a prime example of how dogma (religion) begins and sadly, impedes any chance for progress.  At this point, perhaps I should suggest that anyone reading this who hasn't heard of Kuhn, Wittgenstein and Prigogine to go and read a bit.  And then you need to understand that we have completed the whole genome-mapping fiasco and &quot;discovered&quot; something that goes against what the high gods of complexity, genetics and evolution have been preaching:  we don't have more than 100,000 genomes we have 30,000.<br />Ok, now back to the book.  The papers, as I stated, are out of date.  All interesting results here are tied back to the &quot;magic&quot; number of 100,000 genomes.  That is simply due to the fact that according to the diverstity of cells and specific proteins in our bodies combined with present theories we need that many.  So one would think, right away, that any new theory that is &quot;more correct&quot; than the old ones would quickly point out this large discrepancy.<br />Well, no one did find this.  Instead they just muddle around withsome nifty math and even more exciting computer simulations and then settle back to make pronouncements.  And what bombastic statements the high priests of complexity pronounced!  The best part of this book are the transcripts of discussions about the papers from the big names, notably Gell-Mann, Anderson and Kauffman.<br />One would think that a bit of reading in philosophy would really have helped this lot to see beyond their noses.  That is, how can there be a &quot;true science&quot; (uttered by one during a discussion) when science is simply a compression of knowledge and the whole idea of &quot;truth&quot; implies more compression?  This is laughable when your own theory says that you can never tell if something is optimally compressed (just read Chaitin and Kolmogorov); I ask again, how do you know you have a &quot;true science&quot;?<br />Yes, egos are rampant here and it is enough to make you alternately laugh and then cry now that we see how far off the mark the &quot;science&quot; is.  There are slights on Freeman but really, Freeman has more &quot;science&quot; (&quot;theory that matches observation&quot; to quote Gell-Mann) than anyone in this collection.  In fact, Anna Wise has more science in her books about brainwaves than this group.<br />Disappointed?  You bet.  I fail to see how winners of Nobel prizes and &quot;Genius&quot; awards could end up being so far off the mark.  So in the end, I can only rate the intended content (science) as &quot;2 stars&quot; but the high comedy and drama make the historical content worth 5 out of 5.

Vygotsky, who was a contemporary of Piaget, unfortunately never received nearly as much attention while still alive.  Probably due to the fact that he was working in Russia and had a relatively short career his work seems to have taken a very long time to even get published for 'western' consumption.  His theories also go against the grain of the dogma currently in vogue in psychology.<br />This book gives a brief overview of Vygotsky's life and career.  Then it launches into Vygotsky's original manuscript which begins with a critique of some of the central themes of that time; oddly enough those themes are still being pursued by psychologists today.  Vygotsky's critique is very interesting and demonstrates a very broad range of understanding of psychological, physical and philosophical knowledge throughout the section.<br />The second part of the book then advances Vygotsky's theories of thought and language development.  And that is the crux of Vygotsky's theory:  thought and language each develop in a manner that one might characterize as partially self-catalyzing in addition to behaving as one.  Vygotsky also advanced some important ideas about child potential with his &quot;zone of proximal development&quot;.<br />Vygotsky pointed out that development hinges on the social structure surrounding the child and is not similar to the idea of some computer operating system simply requiring some type of &quot;load&quot; instruction.  That is, Vygotsky's work seems to dispel some of the hot air surrounding Chomsky's ideas about &quot;deep grammar&quot; structures existing and just waiting for the instructions to start working; instead thought and language develop, sometimes separately and sometimes requiring each other to act as catalysts.<br />Given recent advances in primate language studies, complex adaptive systems and Wittgenstein's contributions to the philosophy of systems I believe Vygotsky's work becomes all the more important and relevant.  We are only just starting to grasp the importance of thinking about development in a systems mode as opposed to the old way of reductionism (and the weird dogmatic offshoot of this:  strict materialism).<br />This is a must-read for anyone interested in learning about how we develop.

This is what overviews of scientific fields of research should be like.  The book begins in a gentle manner with an introduction into non-linearity, chaos and complexity.  Many somewhat detailed technical steps are shown in text boxes and there are many illustrations to try to convey the information to a casual reader.<br />In fact, this book bridges the gap between general overviews (something like Gleick's &quot;Chaos&quot;) and much more scholarly presentations (&quot;Complexity : Metaphors, Models, and Reality&quot;).  I suspect some non-technical readers won't make it very far but that is more likely due to the fact that they spend too much time on things they don't understand.  Many important aspects of complex adaptive systems in biology are reviewed using many different examples.  Both theoretical and real-life examples are typically used to help make the point.<br />It is evident that the authors not only really understand the subject, they are also passionate and have excellent writing skills.  Kauffmann is cited frequently but I suspect that most who have read &quot;Investigations&quot; will likely get a much better idea of his thesis when they read this book.<br />The only minor point:  why no commentary on where we appear to be rushing?  Or better yet, why nothing about the philosophical implications of complexity?  Perhaps the authors wanted to keep this book as non-controversial as possible and thereby potentially have it as an &quot;official&quot; reference but I cannot see why people should be upset by drawing some conclusions.  Unless, of course, it is simply because some of the conclusions are so scary.<br />This book should be standard reading!	2002-04-03

I enjoyed Pears' works on Wittgenstein (The False Prison) but this book really was more irritating than informative.  The topic, to be sure, is of prime importance and is also not very well handled considering how the term &quot;rational&quot; is tossed about these days.  However, this book really appears to miss both the crucial points by simply staying within the tight boundaries of a very dry discussion.<br />That is, Pears doesn't really advance the concept of irrational behaviour very far.  He spends the first part of the book exploring 'akrasia' (that's right, we're right back to Socrates even after a few thousand years) and some of the side arguments related to this explanation of irrational behaviour.  Then he criticizes Freud and Davidson for their expansion on this idea.<br />But all the way through the book there is really little to be learned and the language, straight out of a thesis paper, is not really a pleasant read.  This could be forgiven if there were some good ideas but ultimately that is not the case.  This is rather odd, too, since one would think that Pears would bring some of his expertise on the limitations of thought to bear on this subject.<br />Ultimately I believe there is a lot more to be understood here before we even start asking the correct questions.	2002-04-02

Anna Wise has basically taken her guided meditations from her books and saved you the trouble of making your own tapes, a boon to those of us who don't own tape players in this cd age.  I think the guided meditations make a great change from Zen type awareness meditation and Qigong guided meditations.<br />There are a wide variety of meditations available on the cd's that cover the gamut of brainwaves and &quot;destinations&quot;.  Her voice is well suited to the task (after all, she does for her job) and I thought the music and vocals are mixed appropriately.  That is, you don't need to worry about her voice booming over top of the music nor do you need to worry you'll just be listening to music to catch the instructions.<br />I didn't note any sound quality issues, perhaps the other reviewer has a bad sound system or, more likely, has it turned up way too high.	2002-03-28

Well, Anna Wise has basically taken her previous book &quot;The High Performance Mind&quot;, polished all the rough spots, added some more information and, thankfully, come up with a relatively good title.  This book uses the previous as its core and adds a number of additional meditations, more examples and references to other disciplines.<br />She has removed some of the material found in the previous book, notably the graphs about brainwaves which, although they are a bit useful from a theoretical point of view, are mostly useless to those who don't own an EEG.  In their place are a lot more guided meditations and many more personal stories.  In particular, I think the addition of the anecdotes rather good since they help show that there are many possible paths besides just EEG; this should be obvious since many of the other disciplines (Zen and Taoism/Qigong for instance) have been around for a very long time.<br />This is a great advancement in the continuing quest to start to reconcile the differences between Western medicine/scientific method and Eastern disciplines.  Wise notes that some Qigong masters she monitored during healing exhibited Delta brainwaves in excess of 50 times a &quot;normal&quot; person; she takes this as further evidence of great movements of energy since this could not likely be produced by the brain alone.  Wow, well, this is what the Qigong masters have been saying for thousands of years!<br />The only weak points of the book concern holistic views.  That is, Wise focuses on the brainwaves only when no solution is going to come only from work in one area.  That is, meditation based on a diet of softdrinks, chips and other junk is probably not going to help you that much; you need a holistic view and methodology.  Of course, this has been preached by many Eastern traditions for quite a while and I think Wise probably should have commented on this aspect.<br />Anyway, despite a couple of weak points this is an excellent place to start for anyone starting to work on his/her lifestyle.  Check out the old classics &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot;, &quot;Zen Training&quot; and perhaps &quot;Scholar Warrior&quot; and start on the road to centering yourself.or anyone starting to work on his/her lifestyle.

This book is a very basic overview of many topics on the borderline between classical mathematics and computer science.  Since the book's title prominently uses the word &quot;fuzzy&quot; one would expect more than just a general overview of the field yet that is really all that is presented here.  After several chapters intermixing history and some (very basic) theory, the author moves on to other topics such as the halting problem.<br />A general overview of the &quot;new math&quot; is not necessarily a bad thing but there are numerous glaring omissions from the book.  I fail to see how anyone who is providing a basic review of fuzzy theory and then, later in the same book, neural networks could fail to include mention of Perlovsky.  Or, better yet, how anyone talking about the evolution of mathematics to include problems and solutions that involve computing could leave out Wolfram who has numerous papers and was the developer of Mathematica software used by many.<br />But the worst omission occurs with the discussion of the halting problem.  I fail to see how you can discuss Godel, Church and Turing without including Chaitin unless you either don't like him personally or are a really really poor researcher.  Considering this book is likely destined for some high school shelves then this omission is even more unforgiveable given the fact that Chaitin's work is quite accessible.<br />Then there is the fact that there is no mention of Kolmogorev or algorithmic information theory.  Again, even a simple overview should have appeared here since it appears the book's intent is a teaser about the new avenues of work being explored in mathematics.<br />Oh well, most of the information presented is relatively clear although I must say that Klir and Yuan do a better job with fuzzy theory in their book.  All in all there is not much to reccommend this one.	2002-03-23
US	49437056	R31EAYCZ7WJMWN	0802138195	988773974	A Symphony in the Brain: The Evolution of the New Brain Wave Biofeedback	Books	2	73	106	N	N	A waste of paper...	Well, I don't usually bother typing up a review if it's not somewhat positive but...in this case I feel that some important points about this book need to be brought to light.  This book represents the worst of a type of genre and was really, really disappointing.<br />Robbins has obviously read other books such as Gleick's &quot;Chaos:  Making a New Science&quot; and decided he could do something similar for biofeedback.  Specifically, I think Robbins believed he could generate some hype and ride a &quot;wave&quot; of publicity for biofeedback.  Unfortunately, Robbins &quot;pseudo-science&quot; book represents the worst of this genre and is not likely to help the cause of biofeedback.<br />First, if you're going to write one of these books, you need a peppy title and this one has it.  Second, you need to make your story sound scientific (although it is obvious you know nothing more than some terms) and finally you need to toss in some human controversy to make it more &quot;interesting&quot;.  Well, Robbins has put them together in a way that would make it a simple cut-and-paste from the book to a newspaper.<br />First, if you're going to do a book that popularizes a subject and want to talk about science then you need to do some reading to gain an basic understanding of the area.  Certainly talking only to the self-proclaimed &quot;experts&quot; and taking their word as gospel is not the way to proceed; you need to be able to judge a bit for yourself.<br />Well, Robbins appears to have talked to a few people and left his research at that.  To start with, he continually mentions things like &quot;double blind studies&quot;.  This debate has raged on for years in various fields and it is acknowledged that this paradigm creates a lot more problems than it solves in a similar fashion to the issues surrounding null-hypothesis analysis of statistics.  Then there is the mixing of theories of how brainwaves are connected to thought as well as how the brain's structure is connected to thought.<br />Worse still are his discussions about data collected from animal trials.  It is apparent that there is a mentality that only reason animals exist is provide a good platform for studies; this is really rather sad.  I cannot fathom why so few seem to acknowledge the debt we owe animals for the various tortures we have put them through; even more so I find it hard to believe that people still think this is the ONLY true &quot;scientific&quot; method available for studies.<br />Ignoring these problems, one is still left to confront the fact that Robbins has taken such a breathtakingly thin skim of the material and people involved in biofeedback that it almost feels like the book is years older than its publishing date.  A quick search on the internet produces many people within North America alone who are not even mentioned in Robbins' book.  And that is really the root of the problem here.<br />There are a number of practitioners out there who are not even mentioned in passing here.  There is also a long history of biofeedback in Europe that is not even mentioned (after a certain point).  These omissions would be forgiven 10 years ago but with access to the internet, in particular, there is no excuse now.  If only Robbins had interviewed a few more people and checked a few more references then the book might actually have some value.<br />To top it off Robbins commits the most typical error that a number of the &quot;scientific&quot; biofeedback community seem to perpetuate:  ignoring the rich history of Eastern meditative traditions.  Considering that the entire field got its start from people monitoring meditators then it seems obvious that it owes much to meditation.  Unfortunately the is only passing reference to meditation; as if this field has now progressed to somethine new and &quot;scientific&quot;.  The arrogance is incredible and the lack of knowledge even more amazing.<br />With over 2000 years of history one would think that those dabbling in &quot;scientific&quot; biofeedback would spend some more time with the real tradition; this is sadly not the case.  There really are few who acknowledge the meditative traditions (Zen, Taoism, shamanism to name but a few) and their rich history.  This is, in my opinion, a very serious oversight.  There is a reason that these traditions have their methods and only after biofeedback has been around for that length of time is it likely to uncover some of the same depth of knowledge.<br />Spend your money on Anna Wise or Max Cade if you want a useful book.  Otherwise you are better off trying a few of the traditional methods and finding one that is right for your personality.  If you want science then Evans' &quot;Introduction to Quantitative EEG and Neurofeedback&quot; is a much better choice.ose dabbling in &quot;scientific&quot; biofeedback would spend some more time with the real tradition; this is sadly not the case.

The story is similar in theme and style to another of the crazy wisdom writers out there today:  Haruki Murakami.  Carroll links some suburban fantasy with some interesting Eastern ideas about reincarnation and the good old Brothers Grimm in a manner somewhat related to Philip K. Dick and Kurt Vonnegut.<br />The story gradually unfolds to reveal the core issues we all cringe from:  fate and love.  The main character gradually comes to terms with his own rather interesting history while trying to keep his magical relationship with his newly-discovered love.  Along the way he encounters a very interesting range of characters from Hollywood movie moguls to a Jewish shaman who lives in the suburbs.<br />Then there is the setting:  that magical city of Vienna.  Carroll has a lot of fun with his American-in-Europe character and there are some very humourous segments included in the tale.  Overall Murakami has done a slightly better job from a stylistic viewpoint but I can't deny that Carrol's book was a lot of fun.<br />Enjoy.	2002-03-11

I'm not sure why Anna Wise gave this book its rather inappropriate title but it is very misleading.  The books sounds like some sort of low-grade improvement guide meant for high-power executives searching for ways to increase their ability to outwit dumb consumers and investors; nothing could be further from the truth.<br />There was a lot of interest in biofeedback in the 1960's and then interest turned to more &quot;scientific&quot; endeavors such as genetics; we're only just beginning to realize our folly.  Luckily a few researchers continued what was begun and their hard work and determination can now be seen to have a lot of value.<br />Wise owes a lot of her background to her mentor, Max Cade, and some rather personal problems she outlines in the book.  She combines experience and theory from Eastern meditation with EEG biofeedback work, something Pelletier and others have alluded to for a while.  However, Wise really puts a lot of valuable tips and information together and that is the beauty of this book.<br />The book outlines some basic information about brainwaves and then gets into a great overview of some typical patterns and their apparent link to various personal states.  Of course there is no purely theoretical link between what EEG measures and what is happening in your head but there can be no doubt that there is a connection.  And this book details some of the important connections.<br />There is an excellent overview of meditative &quot;states&quot; and their subjective &quot;landmarks&quot;.  Wise offers some great insight for people who are starting on the path to meditation and are getting stuck at certain points.  This material has been available through other sources, notably from the Zen tradition, but these days it can be difficult to make sense of the multitude of books and so-called &quot;masters&quot;.  Wise's suggestions are straight-forward, simple and clear which is great.<br />There are guided meditations, again taken from EEG studies, that allow anyone to make his/her own tapes.  The visualization exercises have been used successfully in beta-theta biofeedback studies and anyone who has participated in Qigong or Zen will recognize many common elements.  But the best part of this book is the clarity and the way information is presented in a manner better suited to those of us from the scientific framework.<br />That's the funny thing, the information has been available for thousands of years but science is only just beginning to acknowledge it.

This book is the literary analog of the \\"Visible Human\\" website where you can look at the 1mm slices of a former death-row inmate.  Only in this case we have the flayed remains of a midwest family spread before us in all their pathetic glory.<br />And that, really, is the crux of it - there's little to redeem any of the characters other than the chance of death at the end of all the groping in the dark.  Franzen must have a long list pet peeves or perhaps just a very dark history to have produced such a hopeless account of modern middle-class life in North America.<br />The story is told in standard (for this era, anyway) non-linear fashion with many hisorical moments segued into as the climax, a \\"final Christmas family gathering\\" is approached.  We are treated to all of the (mostly depraved) details for the family as the dysfunctionally attempt to work through the anguish of their father's impending descent into dementia.<br />And what stories there are...Yes, if you stick with the book there is everything here from amourous encounters with sofas, talking turds, complex psychological manoevering between a couple and the cheating of one character with both halves of another couple.  As I stated above, if Franzen's therapist thought a book would help his problems I think he might be in need of stronger medication.  One wonders not only why the reader is subjected to some events but also how Franzen simply thought the events up.<br />Long-winded, rambling, poignant in tiny glimpses and mostly navel-gazing.  The typical American novel and likely to upset most and impress a few.  I would have been impressed if the story could have been captured in less than half the paper but perhaps there is hope in future books.	2002-02-11

Killing time before a movie I came across this book while browsing through the SF section.  I was intrigued by the concept since the Foundation series certainly stands the test of time with its novel ideas and great story.  After just about missing the movie because I couldn't put the book back on the shelf I decided to buy it...<br />Ever come across a book that you really have a hard time putting down?  Well, this one has an interesting concept (extending and detailing the psychohistorians sketched by Asimov), good characters and a really well thought out future.  Kingsbury's background in mathematics is evident in the manner in which he handles subject within the book (something I think Asimov was missing a bit) and it is also obvious that Kingsbury has some deep insight into chaos and how life rides the knife edge of change, both positive and negative.<br />I particularly enjoyed the sections detailing archeological digs on an ancient earth in addition to his way of not going into massive amounts of description to explain everything.  That is, there is willing suspension of disbelief due to his writing skills without the need to try to flout psuedoscientific mumbo-jumbo to beat your brain into submission.<br />The story follows the life of a renegade psychohistorian through his childhood and initial &quot;corruption&quot; by an underground rival group (to the dominant psychohistorians).  Kingsbury has some great concepts, particularly &quot;fams&quot; (manufactured neural add-ons), that work very well with his interesting characters and social milleau.  He's also obviously familiar with how scholarly institutions work as well as typical student ghettos and hangouts.<br />Enjoy, the only thing lacking with this work is a more catchy title!	2002-01-06

On one hand it allows one to see old ideology that is likely repugnant to anyone who is not chained to some Newtonian universe - trapped much like a fly in amber.  But anyone with an iota of intelligence will likely be seriously offended by most of Stove's central themes making it hard to give a &quot;good&quot; rating to the book.<br />Stove, perhaps best known for his essay on why women are intellectually inferior to men, captures the essence of all that is (after reading the reviews here, one hesitates to use the term 'was'...) wrong with the idols of the age of modernism.  Stove attacks the so-called &quot;Jazz Age&quot; of philosophy yet at root it is apparent that not only does he miss the point of the postmodernists but that his arguments are nothing more than blisteringly hot air.<br />No doubt the writing is amusing but anyone who can dismiss Plato in a sentence and Popper in a paragraph has erected a soap box made of old toilet paper rolls.  I believe his essay on the &quot;Jazz Age&quot; should be required reading to demonstrate exactly how 'idols' and anger obviously cloud intelligence.<br />Stove reveals his ignorance for science in the final paragraph:  &quot;No doubt this is partly to be explained by the remoteness of their work from everyday applications.&quot; This is Stoves explanation for why theoretical scientists have seen the validity of Kuhn, Popper and Feyeraband's views on the irrational nature of science - not so much an explanation as a cry to those who understand to give up and regress to the safe old world of Newton.  One wonders if he actually knew anything about science - without the theoretical scientists we would not have anything beyond Newton and certainly people like Godel, Prigogine, Einstein and Chaitin (to name very few) would not qualify as &quot;pure&quot; scientists under Stove's criteria.<br />Stove also has some interesting and childlike conceptions of cornerstones such as truth and knowledge.  His essay on Idealism is interesting in that he points out the problems of arguing from &quot;the Gem&quot; (starting an argument from a tautology) yet seems to conveniently ignore the fact that the entire concept of truth is built upon tautology.  Oh well, or, as Stove frequently wrote, &quot;Ha ha.&quot;<br />Stove makes passing mention of Wittgenstein but one wonders whether he actually read any of it.  Certainly he didn't understand but that doesn't seem to stop Stove in any of his work; perhaps this is one of the best points in the collection.  It is better to attack (and ad hominem is certainly acceptable) with shadows and pompous gesturing than with any substance when one feels threatened.<br />The real reason to read Stove is the fact that he was the perfect foil to the other holy grail of his age:  Darwinism.  If ever one requires a yin to Dawkins' sanctimonious pandering then Stove would be my choice.  He slices and, at times, bludgeons Dawkins' idiotic arguments and puffy prose to expose the rotten core.  Read these essays and then return the book to the library.knowledge.

It is unfortunate that Sartwell's book has received so little attention since he really did an excellent job of demonstrating what modernism has done to aesthetics and life in general. And really, what doesn't come down to aesthetics for meaning?<br />Sartwell develops the concept of art in many contexts including Zen, Taoism, Hinduism, Native American, African and African-American traditions. He then moves into reintegrating aesthetics into its true position in life - the core - as opposed to the scrap heap where modernism would like to have it stay.<br />Sartwell's chapter, &quot;The Art of Knowing&quot;, is, I believe, the pinnacle of the book. He carefully demonstrates what has been done to &quot;knowing&quot; and how modernism (and scientific realism) have attempted to slide a number of incoherent positions into our general framework and proclaim them to be some sort of truth.<br />Highly recommended along with Bogdan's &quot;Minding Minds&quot;, Faber's &quot;Human Objectivity and Perception&quot; and Flemons' &quot;Completing Distinctions&quot;.<br />I'm surprised it has never been reviewed before now...	2001-09-24

Well, there really is a spate of decorating books out there that run the range from Martha Stewart to the idiot's guide to Feng Shui.  This book charts a different course:  Pasanella is irreverent, funny and pushes the reader to stop looking for solutions by decorators and think for him/herself.<br />That's right, Pasanella certainly won't get any kudos from &quot;professionals&quot; since his message is pretty simple:  reduce your stuff down to the essentials and concentrate on making sure your space is about YOU.  He does borrow ideas that are similar to what many Zen and Feng Shui decorators espouse but he also presents a very wide range of general ideas for the reader to try.<br />I have really enjoyed reading this simply for his often rather humourous comments, some of which are likely to upset many trying to convince clients they are incapable of decorating without the assistance of a professional.  Important points are already underlined in red and the layout of the book, in my opinion, is quite fresh and interesting.

Belnap and Gupta delve deeply into the theoretical framework of their theory and some of its implications.<br />Although this book is good for those interested in the theory a reader more interested in the general concepts of truth being pursued within the philosophical community will be better served by borrowing a copy of Kirkham's excellent \\"Theories of Truth\\" from a local library.  Also recommended are some of  Varzi and Casati's papers, notably \\"True and False:  an Exchange\\", available on-line from their websites.<br />Good reference for a graduate studying theories of truth and logic; not much use for anyone else.	2001-07-13

There are few trail maintenance books around, just lots of little pamphlets such as those put out by IMBA.  This book is worth the money for the many ideas and pictures even for those thinking about designing and/or maintaining mountain bike trails.<br />The opening chapter, which discusses safety, should be a must-read for those needing Emergency Action Plan info for work days.  The tool list is quite good for most areas where you would likely ever be constructing trails.<br />Although some sections (constructing steps and moving rocks around using rope sling set-ups for instance) are not relevant, I found many good ideas in here for designing mountain bike trails.  The section on drainage techniques is excellent and the whole section discussing proper trail design is a must-read.<br />A good book and hopefully the mountain bike community will have one of its own (IMBA, are you listening?) soon.	2001-07-10

This book on Feng Shui really gets into the nitty-gritty of working on qi problems for homes and land.  Wu is one of the first in the recent spate of Feng Shui authors to really give some good details about working on your own internal energy in order to be able to sense and hopefully fix qi problems in your home.  That is, this book is not just about rearranging some furniture or clearing some clutter, it is more about how to train yourself to detect qi and then be able to work out possible solutions for many types of problems.<br />Highly recommended; you just need to do some Qigong to start working on fixing your internal &quot;clutter&quot;.	2001-07-09

The book starts with a general overview of the brain, using a salamander's brain structure as the building block from which to start the discussion.<br />Freeman's main area of study revolves around the olfactory sense which is not a very common area within the &quot;mainstream&quot; of currently in-vogue neural work.  This might explain why his views are rather different from many of his colleagues as well as those who stand on the &quot;edge&quot; of the whole mind-brain debate such as the Churchlands and Dennett.<br />Freeman details how we usually represent problems in a linear fashion and how this type of philosophy is not at all appropriate for the study of the nervous system.  Freeman does a great job of delving into circular causality (feedback systems) and why this naturally leads to some interesting conclusions about the interrelationship of the brain and mind.<br />Freeman refers to himself as a &quot;pragmatist&quot; in the book although I found this to be a bit confusing based on some of his views.  He is clear that he is not a materialist (like the Churchlands and Searle) but also not a dualist (such as Penrose and Chalmers) but I think he should have gone a further step and really stepped outside of the constraint of calling himself a &quot;pragmatist&quot;.<br />He has some good and easy-to-digest information about chaotic systems and how they tend to seek islands of stability (that is, there is emergent order in a sea of unpredictability) but he never really gets down to the nitty and gritty of tackling how the physical realm ultimately manages to link causally to the mental.  Tallis' book has some better leads on this &quot;problem&quot; and it would be interesting if these two and Austin (&quot;Zen and the Brain&quot;) could get together to discuss some ideas.<br />All in all a pretty good read that won't hurt anyone who doesn't have a background in science.  But we have a long way to go understanding the &quot;hard problem&quot; still...that won't hurt anyone who doesn't have a background in science.

This has some good photographs of Scandinavian homes; particularly country homes in Norway and Finland.  The styling of the homes is rather rustic so don't expect to see lots of examples of Danish and Finnish design from the 60's.  I found the photography to be a little 'claustrophobic' and not really giving a good view of the whole room; too much focus on details.<br />The book is not bound very well and mine has started to separate from the cover after only a few readings.  I'd only buy this if you are really interested in Scandinavian living.	2001-07-09

I'm a fan of Murakami's fiction so I decided to try out Underground for something different.  I came away rather shaken and convinced that the man is a definite genius.<br />The book centres around the Tokyo subway gas attack that was perpetrated by members of the AUM &quot;cult&quot;.  They created a special &quot;Science&quot; division with some rather prominent people that, under the cult leader's directions, produced Sarin for the attack.  Sarin, originally used by the Germans in WWII, was placed into plastic sacks that were then wrapped in paper.  AUM specialists were trained to puncture these packages with specially-sharpened umbrellas on the subway line during morning rush hour.  They then escaped at predetermined locations leaving the sacks (rapidly leaking their contents across subway car floors) in the subway.<br />A scary amount of effort by some rather intelligent people; a very interesting commentary on the complex interweaving of a moral-less science with a horribly-twisted psyche.  The death toll was a lot less than it could have been considering the circumstances...<br />Murakami's genius lies in the fact that the reader is presented with the rather &quot;simple&quot; stories taken from interviews.  Only a few interviews does Murakami actually intervene; everywhere else you have only the first person.<br />The emptiness of modern Japanese life that Murakami potrays so brilliantly in his other books hits home with disturbing force in these oral histories.  People walk, much like robots, passed dying people in order to make it to work on time.  People who are obviously suffering from the gas (partial blindness, breathing difficulties, etc.) &quot;must get to work&quot; and carry on as if the day was like any other.  Scary.  I'm not sure who I would pity or who I would feel angry at based on this book since the ordinary citizens seem to be at least as warped as the AUM cultists.<br />An excellent book that fully exposes the rotten core of modern society.  Read it and pass it around....  Read it and pass it around...	2001-06-27

I envy you if you have not read this; there is something magical about that moment you begin this tale and realize how Murakami just keeps getting better with each novel.  In fact, if you haven't read any of his novels, I'd suggest setting aside a weekend, buying a few such as this one, &quot;Wind-Up Clockbird&quot;, &quot;Dance Dance Dance&quot; and &quot;South of the Border, West of the Sun&quot;, stocking up on some good wine, snacks and cat food, unplugging the phone and then settling back for pure pleasure.<br />His prose is stripped down to an almost zen-like state; I don't understand how it survives translation so well.  Beautiful, like an Arvo Part of literature.<br />The story?  Well, I won't spoil it, there is enough written here already.  Just your basic tale of loneliness and artificial separation that so many experience in this cold and non-emotional twenty-first century.  One can only wish that some people read these and actually learn something - that true contact involves emotions, is messy and is why we exist in the first place.<br />Enjoy!	2001-06-01

Well, with the plethora of Feng Shui books out these days it is nice to flip through one that doesn't shout in your face.  The photography in here is excellent and there are many great ideas for living simply.  That is, this is a \\"clear your clutter\\" without any preaching; the pictures should provide reason enough to get rid of your piles of (crud).<br />That said, there are some illustrations of definite \\"no-no's\\" and some spaces in here do not really look liveable.  I wonder if the 'dressers' did a bit too much styling and removed all signs of life from some houses; either that or one wonders what the closets look like since you do need a certain amount of stuff to live.<br />It also bothers me a bit that \\"zen\\" has become little more than a buzz-word.  Go get a zafu, take a weekend session and start meditating.  Then start fixing your space and you will have a \\"zen\\" living space.  Following instructions and/or copying layouts from somewhere is about as far from zen as you can get!  I think the author could have stressed this point a lot more.<br />Still a fun coffee-table book...	2001-06-01
US	49437056	RXBFZ1BR2E064	0618073272	894291394	Monkey Beach	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Read it one afternoon...	Robinson's book is a great &quot;modern&quot; fairy tale that deftly weaves the sad truth about Native Americans such as reserve life, alcohol, poverty and residential schools with an interesting twist of old mythology.  There are liberal doses of hard reality such as broken lives due to substance abuse and hard living mixed in with flights of fancy about the &quot;sasquatch&quot; said to be living in the coastal area in the Queen Charlotte islands.<br />The book captures the crisis moment for a native family when they are told their son's (who is portrayed as somewhat of a golden child) boat has disappeared off of the coast.  The family's story, along with most of the village, is told in a series of intertwined flashbacks that really demonstrate Robinson's excellent narrative skills.<br />I won't spoil anything else in the fine tale but would highly recommend the story.  Anyone who has read Silko, or even De Lindt, will likely enjoy this tale.  Those who have recently taken &quot;authentic Indian names&quot; and are looking to exploit more &quot;Indian culture&quot; will likely be disappointed by the fact that Robinson's book really fits in with more &quot;mainstream&quot; works such as Pynchon and Nicholas Christopher.  Perhaps we need a new &quot;cubbyhole&quot; called &quot;Native American Dark Urban Fantasy&quot;?<br />Buy a copy and support real talent!	2001-05-01

Stroll's book is a must-read for anyone remotely interested in the present status of present-day philosophy, particularly with the plethora of authors trying to make a quick dollar on new-age neurophilosophy.  Stroll aptly cuts to the core of Wittgenstein's opus &quot;On Certainty&quot; and lays the main thrusts of his arguments open to the general public.<br />Stroll begins by walking the reader through Moore's two papers that advanced his famous &quot;This is a hand&quot; arguments.  Stroll demonstrates Moore's errors that then lead the reader straight into Wittgenstein's exploration of certainty; this is a rather seamless and painless experience for many who have ever attempted to read Wittgenstein and become hopelessly lost.<br />Stroll then expands on Wittgenstein and fully develops his truly important revelations regarding certainty and the true nature of doubt.  I have yet to see any from the sceptical tradition develop a good answer to the Wittgenstein's arguments and Stroll makes them even stronger with his further analysis.<br />A must read that is also quite &quot;readable&quot; compared to many philosophical works.  See Tallis' book for more intelligent discussions along similar themes.	2001-05-01

Silko carries on her tradition of producing excellent literature in a Native American &quot;bent&quot; with &quot;Gardens...&quot;.  The story is a mixture of interesting historical anecdotes that perfectly contextualize her characters.<br />The main characters are a native girl (Indigo)and her sister (Sister Salt) who are both members of the Sand Lizard Tribe.  Their tale becomes intertwined with a rather educated woman, Hattie, who has recently married a prototypical American man.<br />All of the female characters are well-developed and one is treated to very interesting character traits to develop Silko's story of government's sad attempts to &quot;integrate&quot; Native Americans into the newly-formed American culture.  Silko has a real skill for maintaining a rather &quot;objective&quot; view while simultaneously showing the hypocritical stance of the conquering white people.<br />The male characters are rather weak but the various historical anecdotes (building of a dam and the methods of collecting orchids from South America being my favourites) woven through the central story make up for any deficiencies.<br />A very enjoyable tale that really should appeal to the mainstream.	2001-03-26

I really enjoyed Christopher's earlier novel, &quot;Veronica&quot;, and have been looking forward to reading &quot;A Trip to the Stars&quot; since I saw it was released.  I was not disappointed.<br />The novel intertwines the tales concerning two families whose grand patriarchs are warring with each other over ancient issues.  The story alternately weaves the tales of Enzo (the kidnapped child) and Mala, his aunt who is also his adoptive mother for a very short period of time.<br />I won't go into further details to avoid spoiling the complex interactions between all characters except to say Christopher extends his theme from &quot;Veronica&quot; of the major role synchronicity and chance play in human relations.  In this novel I believe he has carried off this theme in in a very poetic manner.<br />I suspect those who didn't enjoy this novel did also not enjoy &quot;A Winter's Tale&quot;, &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot; and just about anything by David Foster Wallace or Charles De Lindt.  That is, Christopher plays up the &quot;strangeness&quot; of ordinary life that so often makes it magic; those synchronistic moments that make living so rich.<br />I particularly enjoyed Christopher's style and had a hard time putting this book down.  I'm sure if the above-mentioned authors appeal to you then you will likely enjoy this novel.	2001-03-26

In fact, depending upon your Qigong background you might find you have actually been performing &quot;Tai Chi&quot; exercises instead of &quot;pure&quot; Qigong.  I find that the combination of exercises contained in this book are the perfect balance between moving and stationary Qi exercises and will facilitate quick results for anyone interested in Qi movement.<br />I think Mantak did a great job with the illustrations and although they are simple line drawings they convey a lot of useful information.  Mantak's experience in dealing with the Western mind is evident in both the style and manner of presentation - very clear compared to many of the books by other so-called masters.<br />Mantak also does not promote anything that could possibly cause problems; something that some of the other books in print these days should consider.  There was a reason many exercises were not publicized and one should be careful performing exercises without some form of supervision from a master.<br />The bottom line:  a great book for a beginner and an excellent reference (to be loaned to those just starting) for people who have been practicing for a while.  Good value for your money.	2001-03-12

It is unfortunate that Tallis' views seem to be rather obscure compared to the large piles of tripe put out by people such as Dennett, Dawkins, Foucault and the Churchlands.  In the series of essays contained in this book Tallis mehodically dismantles many aspects of both modernism and its antithesis, post-modernism.<br />Both have needed to have their fundamental frameworks laid bare but few have been able to cut through all the self-grandizing hyperbole to really go for the jugular.  Tallis' essays demonstrate his wide range of knowledge and very perceptive views.<br />The first essay, &quot;Explicitness and Truth (and Falsehood)&quot; is worth the price of the book alone since it brings to the fore how the nature of truth itself has been obscured and twisted to suit modernism and post-modernism.  Not only does Tallis' argument lay bare the problems but this is one of the few philosophical works that is quite readable.  That is, Tallis' tone and style make this book quite enjoyable to read.<br />The &quot;A Critical Dictionay of Neuromythology&quot; neatly debunks the interesting variations on definitions readily invented by authors such as the Churchlands and Dennett.  I suspect they will bluster and perhaps produce some responses but the true nature of their arguments, incoherence, shines forth after reading this work.<br />I enjoyed Tallis' references to Wittgenstein and the critique of de Saussure in addition to the other essays.  Throughout the book Tallis displays a quiet brilliance that will hopefully be recognized by others in the philosophy of mind.<br />Enjoy.	2001-03-05

You don't appear to have had any new ideas for quite a while but the books just keep popping out - what about all the trees you're killing just to keep re-hashing what you said best in &quot;A Brief History of Everything&quot;?<br />For those not familiar with Wilber, he is best known for promoting the idea of mapping knowledge/being/spirituality/etc. onto four realms: individual/spirit, society/spirit, individual/physical and  society/physical (this is a very basic overview).  He borrows a term, 'holons', to describe things as always having a spot in all four realms simultaneously.  He then explores the problems associated with modernism's march to reduce everything to the individual/physical (scientific) realm that is rather divorced from anything spiritual.<br />In &quot;A Brief History of Everything&quot; this whole scheme was developed relatively well, particularly his style and manner of writing.  This latest effort not only just rehashes his structure but does so in a very incoherent fashion.<br />In fact, not only is this latest book rather incoherent but there is actually very little content minus the pages and pages of charts he has put in - charts that almost all very slight variations on each other.  Really, there are only about 180 pages of writing.<br />And then there is the style.  I'm not sure if Wilber actually did spend that much time pursuing some type of Eastern spirituality but, if he did, he needs to go back for a major refresher.  Ego, Ken, ego - why all the self-referencing in this book?  I think he now believes he just needs to surround himself with mountains of references with the occasional pat on the back by putting in someone's reference to his own work.<br />There are precious few pages in here that are worthwhile; the only pages being found the short section on the development of consciousness (and most of that in an expansion note at the end of the book).  But Wilber does not provide a rigorous exploration of the development and anyone who has read Faber's &quot;Human Objectivity and Perception&quot; or Bogdan's recent &quot;Minding Minds&quot; will be very disappointed to read Wilber's posturing.<br />For that is what this book really boiled down to:  ego-driven posturing.  I think Wilber believes that throwing up references implies some sort of intellectual achievement; possibly to make up for not being accepted by any mainstream researchers.  With the excellent books mentioned above as well as those by Bateson (&quot;Steps to an Ecology of the Mind&quot;), Flemons (&quot;Completing Distinctions&quot;), Austin (&quot;Zen and the Brain&quot;), Watzlawick (&quot;Change&quot;), Crispin (&quot;The Art of Knowing&quot;) and Perlovsky (&quot;Neural Networks and Intellect&quot;) the &quot;establishment&quot; bypassed Wilber quite a while ago.<br />Borrow from a friend or the library if you must but otherwise you're much better off with the earlier material or somebody else.and anyone who has read Faber's &quot;Human Objectivity and Perception&quot; or Bogdan's recent &quot;Minding Minds&quot; will be very disappointed to read Wilber's posturing.<br />For that is what this book really boiled down to:  ego-driven posturing.

Frantzis, who has written a few other good books on Taoist arts, gives a good overview of the &quot;water&quot; method for meditation.  This style of meditation is basically Chan (Zen) meditation that is closer to its Taoist roots than the pure Rinzai and Soto schools.<br />Water meditation is basically just a variant on the Vipassana Buddhist type of following-and-becoming-one-with-the-breath. Frantzis emphasises awareness and following energy within the body; there is no attempt to direct energy.  This is in contrast with the normal Qigong style of &quot;fire&quot; meditation that may involve actively circulating energy through the meridians and microcosmic orbits.<br />I think Frantzis does an admirable job interspersing the simple progression of lessons with text on other subjects.  I enjoyed his section on cults and gurus but suspect that his warning will likely fall on deaf ears given the sheer quantity of &quot;masters&quot; and people with &quot;genuine Indian names&quot; running around handing out &quot;certificates&quot; of achievement for meditation.<br />Anyone who enjoys this will also like &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot; and &quot;Zen Training&quot;.

Bogdan's thesis is the fact that, &quot;operating in mental rehearsal, interpretation served as emulable blueprint for reflexive thinking&quot;.  That is, self conscious thought both evolved and continues to evolve from early interpretation abilities.<br />Bogdan brings together both his philosophical insight into his exploration of how and why we are able to think about thoughts as thoughts as well as a significant amount of psychological literature going back to Vygotsky.  The question of metamentation (thinking about thoughts requires understanding of thoughts as thoughts, as mental structures that represent in his words) and how it could possibly 'bootstrap' itself is still very much unexplored by present-day philosopher's; I suspect this is put in the &quot;hard&quot; question bin along with many other aspects of consciousness.<br />Bogdan's book is fascinating since it, at least to me, demonstrates that philosophers are finally beginning to abandon their ivory (in many senses of the word) towers and get their hands dirty with some empirical evidence.  That is, as opposed to Chalmers and his zombies Bogdan actually maps his ideas to some concrete observations.<br />Bogdan argues that our ability for self-reflexivity develops due to our helplessness as an infant.  Because we need a high level of care we must, out of necessity, develop an ability to interpret other minds in a social context.  Our prodigious language skills simply develop out of this base interpretation layer as icing on the cake...<br />This is not a light read by any account; I needed a couple runs through to digest all of his points.  However, I believe that may have something to do with the framework I (and those of us ensnared in Western ideas of what philosophy is supposed to do) possess, not his writing.  In fact, this is quite a &quot;readable&quot; book while still maintaining rigorous arguments.<br />Hopefully this book will provoke a lot of new exploration in psychology, philosophy, AI and neurology.  Also recommended are Austin's &quot;Zen and the Brain&quot;, Perlovsky's &quot;Neural Networks and Intellect&quot; and Wilson's &quot;Spikes, Decisions, and Actions&quot;.

Once the golden-haired child of science it has, these days, sort of wandered down a path similar to AI.  That is, although the field has produced a number of interesting developments it has ultimately failed to deliver anything really deep.<br />Investigations starts with a lot of promise, similar to Capra's &quot;Web of Life&quot; with Kauffman demonstrating both his knowledge of the complexity of genetics and some good writing skills.  In fact, I learned quite a bit reading the first 4 chapters although I suspect that readers expecting something similar to Gleick's &quot;Chaos&quot; will have their eyes glaze over when they hit the more detailed sections of genetic complexity.<br />However, as Kauffman continues I found the same old story as Capra fell victim to:  no meat to the math.  What do I mean?  Well, if one looks at the equations for something like quantum theory there is much information they impart to give hints about &quot;why&quot;.  Complexity has produced equations but they don't seem to have any depth - they may describe some phenomenom but don't give any deeper knowledge about it.<br />In other words, I don't really get excited about another thermodynamic &quot;law&quot; since that is simply sweeping our ignorance under the proverbial carpet by taking an observation as an axiom.  In fact the final chapters, in which Kaufmann tries to tie quantum theory (and string theory) to his thesis, really made me wonder if he just wanted to get this book out before Wolfram's opus.<br />I suspect Kauffman should have spent some time talking to Ilya Prigogine since any theory trying to explain why things go in one direction (entropy) yet also seem to get more complicated obviously needs to incorporate time.  Given that time is an &quot;illusion&quot; (in the grand words of Hawking) if one looks at current physics theories then we still have some distance to go.  Prigogine's work in attempting to incorporate time into quantum theory gives a first step forward and Kauffman's theory could build on that.<br />Not only is the subject matter towards the end of the book very sketchy but so is the language used.

This is an excellent book that combines so many different elements.  Schwiebert has enough biology information that this was the reference for a long time; but it is really his famous literary skills that make this book.  I guess it would date me but I can remember the first Schwiebert story I read in an ancient Flyfisherman magazine - you could always tell them because people spoke in italics, not quotes!<br />The book is chock full of stories and suggestions; in particular you can read Schwiebert's ideas on the ideal fly rod, fishing during a big stonefly hatch and the art of matching the hatch for nymphs.<br />The colour plates are gorgeous and the paper was very high quality - my copy still looks brand new.  If you see a copy I highly recommend buying it.	2001-02-02

Sometimes it seems like philosophy has been caught in amber since the days of Aristotle and Plato with the same tired arguments simply being restated.  Or perhaps it is simply the fact that to be anywhere outside of the &quot;box&quot; in philosophy immediately makes one a crank.<br />Casati and Varzi have bucked the trend to rehash old ideas and have broken a lot of new and very interesting ground in mereotopology.  That is, they have put the study of parts and wholes (mereology) on some firm footing by starting with some ideas from topology and creating a first level theory.<br />Funny as it seems, the area of describing the ontology of wholes and their parts has been very fuzzy since the days of Aristotle.  Only in a very literary sense have this &quot;minor&quot; (only kidding, of course) area been explored in the history of philosophy; something the reader realizes very quickly a chapter into this book.<br />This book is not for the faint of heart or those without some background in formal expressions.  I believe the authors have English as a second language and, although the language is proper, it is also somewhat formal.  I kept hoping for some breaks for humour or at least some variation in language but this book is a bit relentless.<br />The authors develop many axioms for mereotopology for everything from &quot;standard&quot; topological relations up to holes and boundaries. Many relations we would consider to be basic (read: boring) and mundane are revealed in a new light when one attempts to formalize them.<br />The only possible nit I would pick with the book is the fact that many areas have now recieved further treatment from the authors.  In other words, I feel this book was released a bit too soon since, if one reads the papers at the author's websites, one sees the interesting developments.  Particularly fiat boundaries, which are very interesting for many reasons, recieve only passing treatment in the book.  One must read papers for more.<br />The authors also do not get into any epistemological arguments which I feel would not be out of place.  Given that many axioms owe a great deal to how one defines &quot;truth&quot; the authors need a little more included in the book; they also have some very interesting ideas in this area.authors also do not get into any epistemological arguments which I feel would not be out of place.

Watzlawick and friends give a quick introduction into their ideas of the philosophy behind change and it why we sometimes have problems with it.  They have taken Bateson's early work where he drew an analogy between Russell's logical types and the problems of communication between people.<br />I found the authors' excerpts from various therapy sessions to be quite interesting and they obviously have a great deal of practical experience in this type of therapy.  Their overviews of the context of some patients also helps strengthen their ideas regarding problems, change and the reason we often have difficulty changing situations even though we would really like to.<br />The only shortcoming is the lack of ideas for accomplishing change.  They present some possible avenues but after all of Wilber's books I think we could stand a new edition of this book that would encompass other methods of therapy.  The authors also could have done a bit more work contextualizing their results based on the fact that they were involved in &quot;brief&quot; therapy - that is, they had a definite time limit on sessions with patients so they had to come up with different ideas.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-02-02

One hardly knows where to start with Austin's book - with more than 900 pages and hundreds of chapters it is easy to spend months reading this book let alone trying to review it.  And months are really required simply to get a grasp of the interrelated themes and ideas that Austin deftly weaves.<br />In the end I am very impressed with the level of scholarly attention that Austin has managed to mix in with personal observations and what many would term &quot;new age&quot; ideas.  He links many aspects of meditation and its effects to observed physiological phenomenon in a style that is on par with what one would find in Scientific American.  That is, someone with some biology background from upper high school should be able to grasp Austin's salient points.<br />Austin also compiles a number of other researchers' information in the book and, in conjunction with his work, finally links many aspects of Zen to other work such as Grof's holotropic studies.<br />Austin is primarily concerned with the brain in terms of the roles and interactions of the various large-scale structures such as the frontal lobe and brain stem.  Most of this work is based on animal studies with some observations from humans who have suffered either selective damage or had special operations.  As he states near the beginning, humankind owes the animal kingdom much for all the damage and pain we have caused to learn how complicated we are.<br />The basic lesson to be learned from the book is simply how incredibly complicated the brain is; for all our studies we only just seem to know enough now to say &quot;wow, this is really complicated&quot;.<br />The book's real weakness lies in the fact that it doesn't comment on the fact that the brain's basic building blocks, neurons, are non-linear &quot;devices&quot; for lack of a better term.  I recommend Wilson's &quot;Spikes, Decisions, and Actions : The Dynamical Foundations of Neurosciences&quot; for more information in this regard.  This would imply that Prigogine's work on non-equilibrium systems is very applicable to attempting to describe the interactions between the various components of the brain - more evidence for Maturana and Varela to uphold autopoiesis.<br />Going on a long trip or have several months on your hands?

Danaos' story of &quot;John Chang&quot; is very similar to Deng Ming Dao's &quot;Wandering Taoist&quot; trilogy only in an updated fashion.  Danaos takes the reader through his search for Chang (after seeing him apparently light paper on fire with Qi in a video) through Bali and then into some of the details of his apprenticeship to Chang.<br />Chang apparently practices Nei Kung, what he describes as an internal form of Qi circulation that is different than Qigong.  Chang had sworn to his master that he would never pass on his knowledge for money or to someone not a full apprentice.  What does this mean?  Well, Danaos uses this as his explanation for the lack of any concrete exercises in the book.<br />In other words, this is a story with even less information than that put forth by Castaneda's famous Don Juan series.  I also found Danaos' constant &quot;I'm an engineer who worked for a big American company&quot; proclamation's to be very irritating - one just feels that the question &quot;so what?&quot; is appropriate.  There is an interesting short section by Danaos outlining some of his views of personal philosophy; this saved the book for me.<br />I think if anyone who has read extensively about Taoism will find Chang's views rather humourous (he didn't get any background from his master other than the lessons) particularly those on the differences between Qigong and Nei Kung.  However, he does provide some good information regarding Qi and the dantien.<br />All in all, a fun read for a rainy afternoon.  Just don't hope to get &quot;enlightenment&quot; from this one...	2000-12-17

I've had Faber's book for a while and have gone back to read sections on many occasions.  Part of the problem is the style of the book - Faber constantly intersperses his sentences with quotes which doesn't help the flow of reading.  I would have preferred he simply distill what he read, acknowledge the ultimate source and help the reader have a cohesive picture of his ideas.<br />That said, Faber presents excellent overviews of many aspects of psychology.  His section discussing early childhood development, although somewhat dated now, is excellent.  His discussion of philosophical development is quite good as well, particularly the section on Merleau-Ponty.<br />His book, after so many by Wilber, is somewhat weak by comparison in the linking of the individual to society.  I suspect a revised edition of this book would be quite different for these sections based on recent new ideas from people like Prigogine, Jantsch, Chaitin and Perlovsky.<br />All in all, an interesting read that was a good start towards some new horizons.	2000-12-15

Prigogine and Kondepudi have done an excellent job developing the basic concepts of thermodynamics through an overview of the historical developments - very postmodern for a science textbook!  They present all relevant material to then develop non-equilibrium thermodynamics through the use of many examples.<br />I found their manner of developing the concepts and equations to be very clear and concise.  The mathematics are well-developed although a thorough background in engineering calculus is required.  In fact, for many of the classical equilibrium concepts they have the clearest development I have ever read; certainly the section on Maxwell's relations is far superior to my old book by Callen.<br />Many different applications including chemical and electro-optic, are developed for non-equilibrium methods.  For all sections the authors have listed references and suggested readings to make it easy for further explorations.<br />I wished this textbook had been around when I went through engineering...	2000-12-15

This book was really meant as a textbook for Toogood's class in CAD, given at the University of Alberta.  As such, it is really apparent that he took his hand-written overheads and just typed them out in book format; that is, this book is not much help to those with real questions about Pro/E.<br />The lessons will be familiar to anyone who has taken the three-day course from either PTC or Rand - your binders have a lot more information than this book!  The book is made even worse by the fact that there is no index; in this day of simply clicking the mouse to create an index this oversight is not forgiveable.<br />Toogood does not give any details on many of the more fundamental issues associated with Pro/E such as ensuring that the config.pro file is set correctly.  There is also very little information on working on anything more complicated than basic models since the sections on drawings and assemblies are very weak.<br />The cd that comes with the book is not very good either; that is, if you can even view it.  It should be in some other software and/or format since both of my computers come back with errors about &quot;low system resources&quot; when I try to run the program.  In the end I had to find a rather old pc in order to run the disk.  If you are the type of person who learns from listening to a disembodied voice drone on while an animated mouse points and clicks through Pro/E's many menus then this is the cd for you!<br />For the rest of us, I'd suggest spending your money on the PTC manuals or else taking one of the official courses.

Considering that Capra acknowledges the debt he owes to Jantsch early on in this book, he doesn't appear to have read the seminal &quot;The Self-Organizing Universe&quot; very thoroughly.  While it is true that Jantsh's work needed to be updated but Capra's shoddy attempt really doesn't fill the gap.<br />Capra's book will also irritate anyone who has ever read Ken Wilber since Capra seems to be loudly proclaiming a view very similar to Wilber's &quot;holons&quot; without the depth of Wilber's insight.  That is, Capra seems to be stuck on the ideas of the Gaia theory without really getting into the social aspects of the theory at all.<br />Jantsch and Wilber are very cognizant of Maturana and Varela's work (see &quot;The Tree of Knowledge&quot;) while Capra seems ignorant.  This might explain why he doesn't do a very solid job of tying the social side to the material side of life.<br />This is the same treatment all other points in the book receive including his linking of Prigogine's work on dissipative structures and evolution.  Although Behe and Hoyle may seem fairly &quot;far out&quot; in their theories, Capra does not offer any ideas or arguments about exactly how evolution and dissipative structures combine to produce such interesting things as cells that at some point &quot;decide&quot; to specialize and form a human body let alone how the information contained in DNA gets translated into the structure.<br />I'm really saddened by this effort since there is a lot of relevant information lying around right now for a good attempt at a very strong &quot;theory of everything&quot;.  When one looks at Prigogine, Chaitin, Jantsch, Wilber, Wilson's &quot;Spikes, Decisions and Actions&quot;, Perlovsky, Maturana and Varela, or Austin's &quot;Zen and the Brain&quot; then one begins to glimpse that there are some very salient common points finally beginning to emerge from Western Civilization's foray into science.<br />In the end, I'd recommend a book by one of the above authors if you really want to learn something.e authors if you really want to learn something.	2000-12-13

First, a comment on the format and style of this book.  The book has a combination of both English and Chinese, with frequent &quot;paragraphs&quot; of Chinese included in the text.  I'm not sure why this was done but I found it both irritating and confusing since I don't understand Chinese.  The English is poorly worded and often seems, to me, to be missing information. The book is also lacking an index.<br />The drawings are rather simplistic and, compared to many other Qigong books, poorly drawn.  The &quot;exercises&quot; are often depicted in only one frame with arrows supposedly indicating the movements; this is quite confusing and doesn't really show the intention very well.<br />The book is oriented around dividing Qigong into four &quot;distinct areas&quot; with &quot;specific&quot; exercises from each discipline.  Not only have I never seen this type of division before but, again, the division is very arbitrary and little is done explain the relationships between these divisions.  I found errors in the &quot;history&quot; sections as well.  I suspect they have been plagarized from other books and I would recommend the reader to investigate other sources such as Grigg and Deng Ming Dao.<br />Then there are the actual exercises.  Some of these can be found in many other books (although without the arbitrary divison of this book) and an interested Qigong practitioner probably has them already.  However, many exercises in this book, particularly in the Martial section, are extremely dangerous if practiced without proper supervision.<br />In the history of Qigong there are numerous stories of master's who didn't transfer 100% of their lessons to disciples with the end result being crippled students.  Many of the exercises in this book, particularly those utilizing sticks to pressurize points and blows to the body can lead directly to serious injury.<br />The book does not, in my opinion, satisfactorily explain this fact, nor does it outline a progression of study to lead into the exercises.  It also doesn't even appear to mention many of the &quot;standard&quot; Qigong exercises such as &quot;hugging the tree&quot; that have a long proven history of providing benefit.<br />All in all, I was very disappointed with this book and certainly don't recommend it.

I'm quite impressed with the clarity and style of Klir's introduction to fuzzy set theory.  The book starts with the absolute basics of classical logic and then builds to classical set theory.  This half of the book is actually far superior to any of my other logic books since it puts all the truely relevant material together in a very cogent manner.<br />The second half of the book goes into the details of fuzzy logic and set theory while maintaining the easy style and excellent examples of the previous sections.  This book, while intended as a textbook, is quite readable for those who just wish to have better knowledge of fuzzy logic.  I suspect that many of the Aristotelian-based classical logicians will be hard-pressed to surpass Klir's clear explanations for their home turf.<br />Klir delves into the philosophical basis for the existence of fuzzy logic and I feel he does an excellent job.  Haack should really read this again and then reconsider her grand statement that &quot;I believe truth does not come in degrees&quot; with some of the open-mindedness evidenced by Klir.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-12-13

First, it is quite pricey considering it is simply a collection of Haack's papers that have been published in various journals; one would expect better editing and perhaps even a glossary but this simply copies the papers verbatim.<br />For those who are beginners in formal logic or who have been out of the field for a while you will likely have problems beginning in the first chapter.  Who remembers the definition of &quot;wff&quot;?<br />No, Haack should have completely rewritten the papers to make the ideas and arguments approachable for all readers of this book or at least she should have included something like &quot;intended for the graduate level philosophy student&quot; to make her intention clear.  The book needs expansion of ideas beginning with some basics as well as some &quot;niceties&quot; such as a glossary of acronyms and some good editing.<br />That said, the basic premise of the book is rather a sad statement on the present level of thinking inside formal logic.  Haack quite plainly states &quot;I do not beleve truth comes in degrees&quot;...Indeed.  From a scientific/mathematical/engineering background, I find that quite a loaded statement and indicative of a completely closed pre-postmodernist mind.<br />Considering the work done in mathematics, computing and science since Godel by people like Turing, Chaitin and Prigogine showing the inconsistencies that may be found at the core of formal Aristotelian-based logic and its derivatives perhaps Haack should leave her foxhole.  Yes, there is no reason to keep defending formal logic's shortcomings has long since disappeared along with Newton's view of the universe.<br />In the end, I would highly recommend anyone thinking about purchasing this book to consider the validity of &quot;truth does not come in degrees&quot; and then go and buy &quot;Fuzzy Set Theory&quot; and Perlovsky's latest.	2000-12-12

Perlovsky has published a large number of papers exploring limitations associated with today's main approaches to AI.  This book captures the essence of those papers with the addition of developing and expanding Perlovsky's philosophy of AI.<br />Perlovsky takes the reader through the development of AI from its behaviouristic beginnings through Minsky's &quot;revolution&quot; of purely symbolic AI.  He then goes through some more recent methods of combining both methods with some adaptive learning techniques. For all cases Perlovsky clearly demonstrates the inherent limitations of all methods through analytic means.<br />He then presents his view on a possible way forward though adaptive networks employing fuzzy logic, illustrated with some examples such as work done on SAR image analysis.  Throughout the book he provides many examples and certainly this will make an excellent advanced textbook for the field of AI.<br />I am particularly impressed by his good overview and development of his philosophical views.  After years of books by people like the Churchland's, Chalmers, Searle and Hofstadter this is finally a great example of someone who is not afraid to cut through the fluff and expose the real problem to further progress.  This should be required reading for anyone looking into philosophy, in particular the philosophy of mind and science.  The references are very valuable and Perlovsky and done an excellent job of listing many.<br />That said, there are a few points I would suggest for the next edition of this book.  First, I find it odd that Perlovsky seems unaware of Chaitin's work in algorithmic information theory, particularly his book &quot;The Limits of Mathematics&quot;.  Considering Perlovsky's many references to Godel and Turing this is a glaring omission.  Also, he is missing a reference to Wilson's excellent &quot;Spikes, Decisions, and Actions : The Dynamical Foundations of Neurosciences&quot;, possibly because it is also a very recent publication.  These three books belong together!<br />Perlovsky also needs to answer the issues posed by Susan Haack (&quot;Deviant Logic, Fuzzy Logic : Beyond the Formalism&quot;) regarding the viability of fuzzy logic and better-define the methods that are the &quot;correct&quot; interpretation when applied to neural networks.  I would hope to see an expansion on this theme in the future.<br />There are some irritating small problems, the most major being the spelling of &quot;Plank&quot; throughout the text; someone's spellcheck was acting up I guess...The index is a bit thin as well.<br />An excellent book and, as stated in the other reveiw, &quot;must&quot; reading for anyone interested in the future of AI.

This book, and Kingston's &quot;Clear Your Clutter&quot; complement each other very well.  The two books give a good understanding of the principles of Feng Shui and how your living space relates to your body and mental state.<br />There are two &quot;schools&quot; of thought in Feng Shui:  the compass school is mainly oriented around complicated calculations that may involve things like your birthdate (much like doing a horoscope chart) while the &quot;Black Hat&quot; method is a more holistic approach based on Buddhism.  I personally don't find much of interest in the compass school but the reader could check out Lillian Too's many books for examples of this style.<br />SantoPietro's book develops the &quot;Black Hat&quot; style starting from the fundamentals and progressing to some rather complicated &quot;trancendental&quot; cures.  I suspect many readers will have difficulty believing that crystals hung in certain spots in their house may change their lives.  However, if you start to explore aspects of Qi (chi, sort of like life force energy) then I bet you change your mind and look into fixing and/or augmenting Qi flow in your living space.<br />SantoPietro does not get into any of the related Qigong (Chikung) aspects of Feng Shui but there are many books available if you are interested in reading about this ancient healing art.  I'd also recommend &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot; or &quot;Zen Training&quot; for clearing the clutter in your head...<br />I particularly enjoyed reading her case studies and, again, I suspect that if even the &quot;non-believer&quot; starts with some of the simpler parts of Feng Shui he/she will probably see the immediate results and then progress to a deeper understanding of Qi later on.<br />Enjoy.	2000-11-27

This is probably the most popular heat transfer textbook for mechanical engineers and with good reason.  Material is presented quite clearly and the concepts are presented in an orderly fashion.  The authors do not go too deeply into detail so they don't confuse those just learning the basics.<br />There are good reference lists at the ends of the chapters; this could be used by those wishing to learn more.  The materials reference is relatively complete and is, surprisingly, fairly easy to read compared to many properties lists.<br />That said, this book should be updated with more recent applications including those from the electronics packaging field.  The section on numerical methods is quite weak and there is no discussion of recent technological advances in heat transport.  There probably should be more material added in the heat exchanger/heat sink area for the book to stay relevant to modern problems.<br />I think this is a good reference that you can pull off the shelf years later when you forget some of the basics.	2000-11-23

For Electrical Engineers I suspect what you have in your &quot;High Speed Digital Design&quot; (Johnson and Graham) will be more than adequate.<br />The real issue is simply too much information.

Fine, aerospace is a &quot;sexier&quot; application; but with the large number of engineers (ever growing) now looking at trying to keep 15W ASICs cool while avoiding EMC issues and/or manufacturing problems this book misses the boat.<br />Anyone who has taken the TTI course (Dick Leatherman) or one of the other professional institutes around North America won't get anything from this textbook since it simply captures what's in your notes.  For everyone else just wondering about this book - it isn't worth the money.<br />The negatives: - the units (US imperial) are only useful in the US.  The rest of the engineering world intelligently uses SI... - only two sections that are applicable to packaging engineering or other non-aerospace. - outdated technology. - no details on design fundamentals of cooling units (fans, blowers) - only two references to acoustic noise in the entire book!  This is inexcusable for electronic equipment! - no discussion of integrating EMC solutions with thermal solutions.<br />Not recommended unless you like shelfware...	2000-11-23

Any packaging engineers, particularly those in the telecommunications field, who are looking at system-level thermal issues may find this book fairly useful.  There is a huge amount of information here that is hard to get from any other sources other than scouring a lot of journals.<br />This is not an easy read and you should be well-versed in the elements of heat transfer, particularly duct flow.  However, there is a wealth of experimental data that is still being &quot;mined&quot; by many researchers.  Except for some of the newer papers by Manglik and Bergles (see their work on offset strip fin heat exchangers) you aren't missing much information relevant to heat exchangers or heat sinks.<br />I would suggest another reference such as &quot;The Handbook of Heat Transfer&quot; and &quot;Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer&quot; to supplement the information in this volume.  Certainly I have used all three designing new heatsinks for specific applications.	2000-11-23

This book is a highly recommended reference for all mechanical (and, I suppose, some electrical) engineers working on packaging.  The book covers many topics with enough detail so that the engineer may have a good holistic understanding of everything from: - pcb design, layout and fabrication - component fundamentals including IC's - EMC issues - interconnect issues - reliability - testing<br />However, the book won't replace practical experience since the areas detailing typical manufacturing issues are very weak.  In particular, you won't get fundamental machine-shop information relating to design materials and processing.  That is, this book won't replace a thorough knowledge of basic machining-type information covered in the good old &quot;Machinery's Handbook&quot;.  Analysis related to mechanical issues such as FEA and CAD is not covered.<br />The book is rather weak in its thermal section and has nothing about fiber optic design or MEMs/MOEMs.  These areas should be addressed in future editions to keep it up to date.	2000-11-23

Kingston has done an excellent job of getting down to the fundamentals of Feng Shui without getting bogged down in dogma and/or calculations.  For those who are new to this ancient Eastern tradition there are basically two &quot;schools&quot; of thought - the geomancy background where everything revolves around complicated calculations and 'Black Hat' which is a more holistic and basic approach.<br />Kingston cuts to the core of both styles by concentrating on that all too modern problem of how we Western consumers collect a lot of junk that then just lies around collecting dust.  One cannot over-emphasise the negative impacts this has on all aspects of your life!<br />I suspect that even those who would be the most unlikely to &quot;believe&quot; in Feng Shui will still notice a great improvement in life if they would simply follow Kingston's advice and get rid of the layers of detritus found in many places in the house.  I suspect you'll feel like a great load has been lifted when you cart the 25 bags of recyclable items to various community second-hand depots and discover there actually was a table underneath that pile of old fashion magazines and dusty books...<br />If you enjoy this book, particularly the sections where Kingston gets into more personal areas then you really should look to Qigong (Chi Kung).  Kingston has appropriated many ideas from Qigong and her slim book does not expand nearly enough on what is possible for clearing the clutter from your mind.  Seek out master and check out some of the excellent books like &quot;The Way of Energy&quot; by Kam Chuen Lam, Wong Kiew Kit's &quot;Chi Kung for Health and Vitality&quot; and Frantzis' &quot;Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body&quot;.<br />For more reading about Feng Shui I'd recommend &quot;Feng Shui: Harmony by Design&quot; by Nancy SantoPietro as the best place to start.  Kam's book is pretty interesting as is &quot;Lighting the Eye of the Dragon&quot; by Baolin Wu.  Frankly, I am not very interested in the geomancy school which is typified by the many books put out by Lillian Too.sted in the geomancy school which is typified by the many books put out by Lillian Too.	2000-11-20

Both have similar style - that of being very clever but totally devoid of emotional content; their works seem to be similar to well-written hame appliance manuals.<br />I waded through the Mezzanine simply because I was intrigued by the idea of how much can run through one's mind during &quot;ordinary&quot; events.  What do I mean?  Well, the premise of the novel is the journey of the central character on an escalator from one floor to another in some nameless office building.  The reader is treated to the dizzying spirals of thought (and clever stylistic touches of things like footnotes that go for pages) inside the person's head; an interesting take on the Eastern (particularly Zen) ideas of ordinary consciousness.<br />But where some, like Calvino, have handled the idea of self-reference in an artful way, Baker just leaves one feeling it wasn't worth the effort of reading.  In fact, Lyotard has captured the post-modern idea of the referance most succinctly in &quot;Postmodern Fables&quot; which is usually listed as a non-fiction work!<br />Both the Mezzanine and Vox just don't seem to be worth the effort unless you've got a lot of time on your hands...	2000-11-17

And if you ever buy Harper's then you already own it - the story was first published there.  I'm not a big fan of Millhauser's style (particularly exemplified in &quot;The Mezzanine&quot; and &quot;Vox&quot;) - I find him to be clever but ultimately devoid of any emotional meaning.  In other words, Millhauser's writing reminds me of a well-written user's manual for some home appliance.<br />The Knife Thrower (the story) has some interesting ideas and would, as some have pointed out, make a good episode for the Twilight Zone.  Or you could go see &quot;Girl on A Bridge&quot; (&quot;La Fille sur le Pont&quot; since it is a subtitled French import) for a great version of this idea.  Perhaps this is some universal archetype since the idea seems to appeal to many.<br />Ultimately in the realm of short stories Millhauser does not, in my opinion, rank near the top.  If you enjoy his style you would probably like some of Bradbury's early work or even Ian Banks.  The rest of the stories in this volume do not leave any lasting impression, much like drinking some 'lite' soft drink.	2000-11-17

This book is a good start for anyone just starting to learn about Qigong.  There is a broad range of exercises depicted and the descriptions are clear enough that a beginner should be able to get some good tips to assist with his/her learning.<br />I like the fact that &quot;standing at the stake&quot; is emphasized and the drawings explaining the finer points of the stance are very helpful.  I cannot over-emphasize the positive effects of this exercise!  It seems many other Qigong books only depict sitting meditation which, in my opinion, misses out on a great opportunity for advancing health and energy.  Some of the other exercises are not perfectly clear since the illustrations could use a bit of improvement but overall there is a lot of information here.<br />Combine this book with one by Frantzis and a couple of meditation books like &quot;Mindfulness in Plan English&quot; or &quot;Zen Training&quot; and then find a good master - you won't regret it.	2000-11-14

There are a lot of books out there on zen; one may wander the aisles of any of the big book chains and see how the word has become a bit overused.  However, if I were to suggest one book on zen that should be found on your shelf, this would be it.  No fluff and/or preaching here, just solid information and discussion on the fundamentals of zazen.<br />I particularly like the fact that Sekida emphasizes breathing and energy flow from the tanden; for someone who practices Qigong this seems obvious but I think many who practice zazen take years to catch on.  The sheer amount of practical advice in this book make it well worth the money and the discussion of three nen make it indispensible.  In fact, I think this is a better place to start than many of the more esoteric zen books since really, this is all about the practice, not the theory.<br />Combine this with a book on Qigong, &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot;, and perhaps &quot;Zen and the Brain&quot; and then find a master; I don't think you'll ever regret the decision.	2000-11-14

Derrida, Foucalt and Lyotard have come to be some of the best-known examples of post-modern thought.  Of the three, I find Derrida to have the most &quot;logical depth&quot; to borrow a term from information theory; that could be due to some of his ideas in conjunction with the way in which he presents them.<br />In Margins the reader is treated immediately to an intersting idea of Derrida's - that the most important part of philosophy occurs in the &quot;margins&quot; of work.  That is, it is the contextualization of ideas that is fundamentally important, not necessarily what is in them.  This echoes what Bateson wrote quite a while ago in &quot;Steps to an Ecology of the Mind&quot;, a much more accessible work; Lyotard also develops the idea of contextualization within &quot;Postmodern Fables&quot; through much more literary methods.  Derrida's development of the differance and his views on Hegel are visionary and I enjoyed reading those sections in Margins; the rest I very difficult to digest even after several readings.<br />Derrida's ideas of context within infinite regress of contexts put him in an interesting philosophical position since the paradox cannot be resolved.  That is, by demonstrating the subjectivity of any literary (and what is the limit of the term literary - isn't everything literary?) work he basically undermines most of Western philosophy.  Hegel was close but not quite willing to go far enough as Derrida demonstrates.<br />In my opinion the more casual reader will be better off with the readily-available &quot;Derrida for Beginners&quot; type of books rather than trying to tackle this one.  If this is part of a course then I suggest reading it while armed with some other overviews for reference.	2000-11-03

It's unfortunate that Bateson died before postmodern thought really made it over the Atlantic since it appears he was quite concerned about many of the old views held by North American philosophers.  The chapters concerning contextualization and language use echo what Foucalt, Lyotard and Derrida have been trying to get across except Bateson really managed to put these ideas into somewhat more accessible form.<br />Bateson was around for the beginnings of information theory and cybernetics and again, he was probably very disappointed in their state when he died.  However, if one now looks at what people like Perlovsky and Chaitin have worked on one may begin to see that science is finding more and more problems with maintaining even the idea of objectivity.<br />In particular, if one looks at the work of Wilson (&quot;Spikes, Decisions, and Actions&quot;) and Prigogine then the theory of objectivity within the physical world comes falling down.  The only book close to giving a complete overview like Bateson managed is Jantsch's &quot;Self-Organizing Universe&quot;, now out of print.<br />This is well worth reading and pondering.  One can only hope more people begin to realize that we have a great opportunity for advancing ourselves (instead of rushing towards anhilation)if we can just change some of present system of thought.	2000-11-03

In fact, the math overview is probably better than that found in many calculus textbooks and the Matlab disk would certainly save a lot of time for many common problems.  Again, any readers with an engineering background (particularly mechanical or electrical) will find the math and results to be rather familiar.<br />I suspect someone looking for another &quot;popular science&quot; book like Gleick's &quot;Chaos&quot; will be highly disappointed.  This book is definitely structured for someone interested in pursuing study in the field.<br />I hope that Wilson now moves on to expanding on the hints of philosophical thought he has listed here.  Anyone familiar with nonlinear chaotic systems MUST have some understanding of the implications of their non-deterministic nature; certainly a quick reading of Jantsch or Prigogine would help too.  As Wilson points out on page 184, chaos and free will may easily be tied to each other.<br />Further study of Perlovsky's work (hopefully his book will be out soon too) will clarify many of the issues regarding neural net modeling and its philosophical implications.  Certainly one can only wonder at Churchland's child-like beliefs that neural nets will resolve &quot;folk psychology&quot; and the fundamental questions of consciousness when confronted with nonlinear chaotic systems on the order of 10 the 10th order!<br />Highly recommended.	2000-11-02

Since he seems intent on upsetting anyone with a religious and/or spiritual bent.

In fact, I don't think anyone's views, even the lowly eliminative materialists, are spared.<br />You would have to read a very big pile of philosophical treatises to get as many viewpoints as captured in this book.

A rather common tale these days but, in this case, made more interesting when both of the men are rather renowned authors of the time.  What does the voyeuristic public get?  Well...<br />Barnes' book explores some very interesting styling touches through his use of three narrators.  What is new about that, you ask? Well, in this case the three know that the reader has access to all of the stories so they attempt to &quot;set the story straight&quot; regarding what actually happened.  Yes, as in 10 1/2 Chapters, Barnes seems to enjoy with playing with the idea of what is history and exactly how objective can it be; only the reader is juxtaposed into events much like in Calvino's work.<br />So who got the woman in the end?  You'll have to read this one to find out.  Who wrote the better book?  I think Barnes' book is superior but you should read Amis' &quot;The Information&quot; to decide for yourself.  And then you could look into Barnes' latest since he apparently continues the tale there.	2000-10-29

Not that Coupland hasn't done that too but at least his characters generally show some form of growth; I kept hoping Heller's gang would be inside one of those falling buildings seen at the end of 'Fight Club'.<br />Well, I guess writing this has helped ease the pain of buying the HARDCOVER and I will now be dropping it off at the local used bookstore when the place is closed to avoid embarrassment.	2000-10-29

Having been practicing Qigong for a while as well as having seen a video demo of Frantzis at a Qigong conference I don't find his claims to be too far &quot;out there&quot;.  Certainly, the video I saw had some rather amazing examples of Frantzis' power for energy transmission.<br />This book, as many have pointed out, is not a &quot;how-to&quot; book.  But then again, anyone looking for a mechanics book of Qigong is either really naive or has missed the point entirely.  Qigong (or whatever you want to call the internal arts) is about doing and you can't learn that without a master.  This is not silly logic or math lessons but something that goes much deeper.  Just as sitting and meditating like the Zen master you read about will likely give you a bad back and no &quot;answers&quot; to any koans if you don't do it with proper instruction, expecting to read Frantzis' book and start hitting people with some extra super-power is only going to lead to failure.<br />Frantzis has attempted, in my opinion, to do what many other masters have done:  leave enough hints and enough stories of the potential others have realized to encourage interested readers to seek out their own master.  You can't put this stuff into a book and he didn't try, but the stories sure are interesting.  Frantzis had the amazing luck to meet and study with people like Morihei Ueshiba (founder of Akido)and the tales are worth the price of the book.<br />I enjoyed reading through this and have now loaned it to several friends who study martial arts; a couple have gone on to investigate internal arts.  I think this is a good place for someone to start their own journey.	2000-10-24

It's strange why autopoiesis has taken so long to be taken seriously when there is overwhelming evidence from many fields that we need to move away from our old paradigms of thought, particularly our reliance on Aristotelian logic.  Whether one looks at Prigogine, Perlovsky, Chaitin or Jantsch there is clear evidence that we (and I mean those embedded with the 'grand' tradition European thought) of  desperately need to change our way of looking at the universe.<br />This book presents a clear overview of how Maturana and Varela arrived at their conclusions.  There are many sidebars that fully explain important points; it is obvious these two are good professors and know where they need to go into more depth so the reader may grasp salient arguments. Their views on cognition and knowledge are very different from the child-like expositions put forward by the vast majority of Western philosophers and this book develops the groundwork for understanding autopoiesis.<br />Post-rationalist thought is just beginning to be a &quot;field&quot; in Western philosophy and this book should be on the shelves of anyone interested in trying to really understand the universe.	2000-10-19

Both the structure, with the stories interspersed with the bits of commentary, and the style seem far beyond any of his other work, in my opinion.<br />The Nick stories are particularly apt and the overall emotional impact of the book almost makes one forget Hemingway's irritating personality.  Yes, this is not a socially-correct work but I think it defines the general American (and probably Canadian) mentality of the time.<br />McGuane has tried to revive the Hemingway tradition - see &quot;To Skin a Cat&quot; - but doesn't quite come to the same level as this book.	2000-10-17
US	49437056	R3QRWDQZUUV8P9	0816625549	507190993	Postmodern Fables	Books	5	26	31	N	N	Excellent...	No wonder Lyotard (and many of the other European philosophers) have truly irritated most of the North American preachers of the TRUTH.  To begin with, his style is not the old Aristotelian-based method argument but more in line with the brother's Grimm.  In particular, his reply to Rorty just about made me cough up my cup of tea into the book it was that funny.<br />The argument of objectivity is getting very tired and, after all the work done by Godel, Chaitin, Perlovsky, Einstein and Prigogine, really seems to have been undermined by it's supposed saviour, science.  Time for new ideas and Lyotard's style should be one of the first.  After years and piles of books by de Bono one wonders why ideas are still being presented in the dry vacuum of middle-excluded logic.<br />Definitely worth reading and pondering.	2000-10-17

For those looking for modern commentary on the &quot;sporting life&quot; or a journey into the mind of men who have trouble with modern gender issues then this is a good place to start.  McGuane seems to be trying to fill Hemingway's waders (particularly &quot;In Our Time&quot;) with this collection; he certainly conveys a similar tone.<br />If you have a background in hunting and/or fishing then these stories will likely appeal to you.  If not, there is still one story worth reading simply because it aptly demonstrates why we need to abandon the myth of the male who expresses no emotions for fear of showing his weakness.<br />Unfortunately it appears to be out of print but it is worth tracking down.	2000-10-17

Over the years (and it's been something close to 60 of them) Prigogine has almost single-handedly defined non-equilibrium thermodynamics.  This book presents an overview of how he thinks quantum theory should be interpreted in order to give a direction to the &quot;arrow of time&quot;.<br />This book is not for those who don't have some background in thermodynamics and quantum theory, particularly in the solving of the Schrodinger wave equation.  Those expecting a Gleick-like &quot;Chaos&quot; will likely put this one down in frustration after about three chapters since Prigogine has put a fair amount of theory in this book.<br />For a slim volume there is a lot of food for thought here.  I had to go look up some old textbooks a read over some of my first-year quantum theory and math.  I think the views that Prigogine just starts to develop in the final chapter deserve a book of their own for discussion.  I know from hints Prigogine has &quot;dropped&quot; in interviews that he holds some interesting views on general philosophy.<br />People interested in the current state of Prigogine's theories then this book does an excellent job of centralizing them.  His development of critical elements is deep enough to force one to get enough of a theoretical grasp to have some sense of the philosophy that comes.<br />For those looking to further their knowledge of the general applications of dissipative structures, I highly reccommend Jantsch's &quot;The Self-Organizing Universe&quot; as a good place to start along with some of Chaitin's work in algorithmic theory and Perlovsky's work in cybernetics.	2000-10-11

Of all the writers of this crazy age Vonnegut stands alone for the North Americans, in my opinion.  There's just so much inside this novel that any attempt at deconstruction would only be futile.  Vonnegut looks like Einstein's crazy long-lost brother and his novels are like some insane Schrodinger wave equation that finds a different place to collapse depending on the reader's state of mind.<br />What you take from this trip depends on what's inside your head; I always find reading this leaves me feeling like the world has tilted slightly.  Vonnegut could almost be a reincarnated Zen master weaving modern koans for the disillusioned age.	2000-10-11

Wallace seems to be playing with all possible styles in this one; I get the distinct feeling talking with him would involve many sentence fragments punctuated by insane non-sequitors.<br />This collection is notable for a couple of &quot;must-reads&quot;:  the story with the poor guy who's eyeballs fall out at the worst possible moments and a very different crowd who attend a Keith Jarrett concert.  Worth the price just to indulge in these two excursions into Wallace's world...	2000-10-11

Wallace has a knack for creating characters who, at first glance, appear so normal you hope they live next door.  However, in Wallace's world your neighbor just might be eating himself into a state where he becomes the centre of the universe in the hopes of becoming one with all.<br />'The Broom of the System' was impossible to put down.  Both the characters and storyline move along at a good Gen-X clip without the nauseating whining usually associated with the genre.  Not as big an effort as &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; but just as rewarding an experience.	2000-10-11

Innovations in Systems Science)	Books	5	51	52	N	N	Why is this out of print?	This book and Chaitin's &quot;The Limits of Mathematics&quot; should be printed in softcover and distributed at supermarkets.  This is perhaps one of the most important books of the 20th century, simply because Jantsch has managed to finally put a very large amount of information (just the reading list is worth the price of the book) in one place.  Thermodynamics, cybernetics, mathematics, computing, physics...they've all been saying the same thing for years now and for some reason we irrationally ignore the message:  the TRUTH is not to be found in a formal system based on anything resembling the Aristotelian logic we of the Western world love so dearly...And the deeper we wallow in our mythical constructions the more likely we won't be around for very long.<br />This is not a &quot;lite&quot; book; perhaps that is why the copy I have (an inspection copy from a major university) has only been taken out seven times since 1980!  Pathetic considering the current hand-waving taking place in AI (particularly the work of Dennett and the Churchlands) and the philosophy of mind.  The only other place to find the overview is in Leduc's IEEE paper &quot;Human Knowledge:  can the planet survive human rationality?&quot;.  Perlovsky's work in cybernetics is also an excellent place to see similar results.<br />It is unfortunate this is out of print; perhaps you can find a copy in a library.  Better yet, start bugging the publisher to reprint it.	2000-10-06

Enough of these white-man's dreams like The Tunnel or Gravity's Rainbow, we finally are letting some other voices tell the other side of our sorry travels.<br />Dense.  Jumpy.

Deng Ming Dao provides a very thorough overview of the history, general techniques and theory of many aspects of Taoism.  The sections on Qigong and meditation are excellent and there is lots of food for thought here.  The recipes are rather humourous in my opinion but it does bring up the important aspect of healthy eating is balanced eating.<br />I believe there are better historical accounts (see Grigg's &quot;Tao of Zen&quot;) but overall this book is very informative.  I really like the quiet tone and ego-less method of trying to convey the information.	2000-10-05

I remember when I first saw this book - it caught my attention because I had read Van De Wetering's mystery novels - and decided to try it out.  Next to the classic &quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot; I think Van De Wetering's work is one of the best Western accounts of coming to terms with meditation and Zen.<br />I'm not sure you'll run out and buy a zafu after reading this but I bet you'll enjoy the tale anyway!  He has some great characters throughout the story and he doesn't come across as either condescending or frustratingly thick-headed like some Western accounts of the East.	2000-10-05

Several sections in this book are very useful and I enjoyed the historical background on the various types of Qigong.  However, I found the book to be too &quot;dense&quot; with exercises rather than going into the details of a few major types.  I also believe some of the exercises shown are NOT going to be beneficial to practitioners, particularly those in the martial section using things like staffs to pressure areas of the body.<br />As someone who has practiced Qigong for a while I also found the lack of warnings and/or instruction of the proper methods of developing into the exercises to be a little scary.  Many exercises can cause harm if not done properly, just as meditating with bad posture will do more harm than good.  The book is useful to someone who has been doing exercises for a while and might be looking for a big picture of what has been done historically but I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner.  Better to stick with Frantzis or Wong Kiew Kit and find a good teacher.	2000-10-05

I recently re-read this one after a few years and it's a toss-up whether you need it if you have &quot;A Brief History of Everything&quot;.  I find Wlber drags after a while although I do admit he has captured a lot of information for further exploration within both books. The question is: do you read the references for yourself or rely on Ken's interpretation?<br />I've loaned this to a lot of people and it appears to be a good &quot;starter&quot; book to initiate some of de Bono's non-lateral thinking in people.  Unfortunately I find some of Ken's views to be...well, a bit in an infant stage still, almost as if he needed to get them on paper just to prove he could.  Funny to get the feeling of an ego-trip from someone with such a strong Eastern background; perhaps the tone just comes from the impatience of trying to &quot;translate&quot; ideas and concepts into our rock-solid Aristotelian logical framework.  Anyone wondering about the validity of our conceptual framework should really read some of Perlovsky's papers.<br />All in all, a good book of ideas that could have, in my opinion, used a bit of softer hand on the tone.  If you have Brief History then I don't really think you must have this one.	2000-10-05

Murakami plays; he recycles characters, has kinky relationships and likes the just-a-bit-lost-ordinary-guy type of male leads.  I'm not sure how many times he'll keep trying to enlighten his readers (I hope for a few more novels at least) before he gets bored and probably just lives out in the country listening to jazz and cooking (oh, did I mention he has a theme of jazz and fine cooking in the books?).<br />Like Calvino, what you take away from the novel is what you have inside.  Some literature is more like a mirror than a force-feeding of ideas.  Let your patterns go and enjoy the pleasure of turning the pages over for the first time...	2000-10-05

Kumar has done an excellent job putting enough information into this book in an understandable way to make the book useful to those just looking into the internal arts as well as for those who have been long-time practitioners.  Not that a book could ever replace actual lessons from a master in Qigong, but Kumar has some very valid observations and ideas that can help even those who have been doing Qigong for a while.<br />I find the illustrations to be very good; they seem to capture the essence of the movements when many other books, particularly some full of photos, for some reason just can't convey.  Kumar's history is interesting and inspirational as one would expect of someone who has mastered the many arts he has studied.	2000-10-05

Tor has compiled an excellent reference for further exploration into the mind-body &quot;problem&quot; and that nasty thing that just won't leave science alone, consciousness.  The sections on the development of information theory and Libet's experimental work are worth the price of the book alone.  Not that Tor's take on Libet's work is the &quot;truth&quot; since the experimental work on the half second of delay is rather thin.<br />It's interesting to note his descent into despair as he learns more.  It would appear that consciousness does not fit into formal Aristotelian logic's boundaries (otherwise known as science) which is, really, no great loss.<br />I'd recommend further reading:  Perlovsky and, if you can find it, Erich Jantsch's old book &quot;Design for Evolution&quot;. Pelletier's &quot;Towards a Science of the Consciousness&quot; is also worth tracking down for some interesting studies done on Zen monks.	2000-10-04

Ah, more fun with Aristotelian logic!  Davidson once wrote that even irrational methods can be considered rational if they lead to a rationally-desired end...But what about irrational ends found by purely rational means?<br />Chalmers has some interesting arguments (although for those not really interested in wading through the details of supervenience arguments the Reader's Digest version of this book would be a lot smaller) but as the leading Mysterian demonstrates, there's a lot more to be learned.  I'm not sure how he reconciles his result of panpsychism with his apparent belief in the strength of formal logic.<br />Once again, I must point out that anyone interested in neural nets and/or symbolic manipulation for AI had better read Perlovsky's papers on combinatorial complexity.	2000-10-02

If you are an eliminative materialist then you need help!  Not that there aren't some interesting observations in this book - see the chapter with new data on &quot;filling in&quot; - but Churchland's tired example of Maxwell's discovery of electromagnetic waves only demonstrates how subjective the entire world of science really is.  A more interesting example might be Maxwell's equations and how they relate to entropy, but I suspect that Churchland's actual knowledge of physics is more on the level of Betty Crocker's knowledge of microwaves...<br />As for neural nets:  go read Perlovsky!  I find it odd that Churchland, who loudly proclaims nets as the future of AI, doesn't appear to have read any of Perlovsky's papers; but I suspect he's too busy waving magnets in his living room generating EM waves.	2000-10-02

Searle presents a good overview of the field of consciousness theories that is worth the price of this book.  I rather enjoy his tone (it would be fun to see Searle, Chalmers and the Churchland's debate their views) and many of his views, particularly as presented here, seem coherent.<br />I believe that his view of the non-existence of the unconscious seems to be incorrect based on the experimental work of Libet and Gazzanadi in particular.  He doesn't look at any concrete examples in this area to attempt to explain how many mechanisms that are clearly not accessible to consciousness seem to be communicated to conscious actions.	2000-10-02
