Of course, it's predictable -- in my opinion, all romances are.  You know the girl is going to get the guy (or vice versa) at the end.  I enjoyed the chemistry between Min and Cal, although I felt that a drop-dead gorgeous guy going for someone (presumably) so overweight seemed a bit unrealistic.  That said, the true lack of realism, in my opinion, were all the family members and friends.  David and Cynthie's behavior seemed not only not true to life, but utterly assinine.  Ditto the behavior of family and friends in the final chapter before the epilogue at Min's apartment... c'mon!  On what planet does THAT happen?!  I can just see my dad running over to my apartment just because I'm getting hot and heavy with a man... NOT!!   <br /> <br />Still, I don't regret the read, especially for a vacation.	2005-06-10

Saw this at an airport bookstore and, as I had a long flight ahead of me, bought it.  It was okay... not the worst book I've ever read, but not the best either.  What really drove me to distraction, though, were the numerous run-on sentences on every page!!  Either Binchy never learned good grammar in school, or her copy editor didn't.  It also seems unbelievable to me that Lena would give it all up for that loser Louis.  You could see what was coming a mile away.	2005-03-10

The author's passion is clearly food -- his writing is at its most vibrant and vivid when he's describing the cooking scenes, or Bruno's hunts at the market for the food he uses to prepare the next meal for Laura...  I could almost see/hear/smell the street markets as I read the scenes.   <br /> <br />Alas, I did not get the same sense about the characters in this book; all seemed wooden -- even cartoonish.  Laura, especially. The final meeting between Bruno and Laura came across as too contrived and unbelievable. <br /> <br />I also agree with another reviewer, in that I didn't see where the Mafia plot was necessary.  In fact, it detracted.  As did the whole thing with the chef Alain.   <br /> <br />Finally, I thought the author overdid it with his numerous Italian swear words and curses.  Especially in the beginning of he book, it was almost as though he trotted out every one that he knew just because he knew it.  Cussing is like hot sauce -- a little goes a long way. <br /> <br />	2004-10-04

This story is largely unbelievable, mostly because the author didn't develop her characters enough.  What was the point of Grandmother Violet even being in the book?  She was supposed to be a real b----, but I only got the sense of a cardboard figure.<br />And Lucy, who is portrayed as a real ditz, conveniently enough has sold a bundle of stock right before the market dropped (!).  Huh?!  And just loans a boodle to Anna, the narrator, so she can open up a salon.  That just strained credulity for me.<br />It's a rapid read, and I read the whole thing, but there is just too much deus ex machina.  I liked the narrator, Anna Abbott; I just wish the characters were more developed and the plot less fantastic.	2004-07-02

This book's main feature is its two chapters of questions you can ask about your characters in order to better flesh them out.  (In my humble opinion, these questionnaires are simply the best I've ever seen in a writing book. And, as Scott mentions, the rest of the book is really about how to START a story rather than how to &quot;thicken the plot&quot;.But since that's my need right now, I'm giving this book 4 stars.<BR><BR> On the other hand, I disagree with Scott's comments about the cliched suspense stuff.  My read of that paragraph (p. 123 in the hardbound edition or see Scott's review below) is that Lukeman is merely giving an example of increasing danger, one of a variety of ways to increase suspense.  In the start of the chapter, Lukeman also says, &quot;One can have undeveloped characters... and a weak plot, but if suspense exists, an audience will often stay with the work.&quot;  On the other hand, though, he points out that the suspense needs to arise from the characters and the situation itself, and should not be used as &quot;a means in and of itself&quot;.  Given that caveat, it hardly seems to me that Lukeman is recommending the (cartoonish) addition of crocodiles, roaring rapids and enemy soldiers patrolling the opposite banks just for the sake of a suspenseful river crossing.	2004-02-11

She makes no claim to cover everything, instead providing a listing of websites and print resources where the reader can go for more information.<br /><br />My quibbles are these: some of her website links are incorrect/obsolete, some refer to subscriber sites where a $99 annual fee is required to access. There are some glaring copy errors: on page 299, she refers to Africa as a country rather than a continent.  Finally, her views are somewhat left of center, and her predictions on results of a war in Iraq haven't happened (e.g. Israel bombing Iran) -- at least, not yet.<br /><br />All in all, though, a useful book -- similar to the way foreign language phrase guides are useful when you're traveling in a country where you don't know the language too well.	2003-05-19

However, if you already own or have read Northrup's &quot;Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom&quot;, or if you subscribe to her newsletter, or if you've read Dr. John Lee's &quot;What your Doctor may not tell you about Menopause&quot;, then you can save your money and skip this book.  Most of the information contained in this book can be found in the other sources mentioned.  Especially if you want more info natural progresterone -- read Dr Lee's books.<BR><BR>Northrup takes a stronger &quot;new-agey&quot; tone in this book than in her previous one.

And since Sills says it better than I can, I'll quote a few sentences from her first chapter:<BR><BR>&quot;Focusing on men has taken us as far as it can.  This book is written directly to women, and just about women, so that we can turn the corner.  The way we turn the corner is that we let go of the idea of getting to love by helping men to change.  In our all-too-understandable obsession with getting more of what we need and what we are reasonably entitled to in a relationship, we have overlooked a key psychological truth: ** relationships depend far less on whom we choose than on who we are.**....  You are the single most important factor in whom you choose to love, and in what you experience in return.  Love is a measure of your own inner stretch...&quot;<BR><BR>If that paragraph intrigues you, you'll find much of value here.  Throughout the rest of the book, she'll gently -- and a little philosophically -- show you how you can help yourself to stretch further.<BR><BR>And despite her statement that she is writing for women on the topic of romantic love, much of what she says about love applies in family and friend relationships as well.	2001-03-30

It's the story of a year in a 9-year old girl's life on her family's farm in Victorian-era England.  Little Susan Garland is an only child, highly imaginative, and used to keeping herself entertained.  The descriptions of life on the farm, her walks to school, the farm animals, the holidays, are intensely vivid, bringing late 19th century rural England  alive to a late 20th century American city girl.<br /><br />A sample paragraph from the chapter &quot;December&quot;: &quot;Holly decked every picture and ornament.  Sprays hung over the bacon and twisted round the hams and herb bunches.  The clock carried a crown on his head, and every dish-cover had a little sprig.  Susan kept an eye on the lonely forgotten humble things, the jelly moulds and colanders and nutmeg graters, and made them happy with glossy leaves.  Everything seemed to speak, to ask for its morsel of greenery, and she tried to leave out nothing.&quot;<br /><br />It's not for everyone: children who want a lot of adventure in their books, or who prefer books with a lot of interaction between characters may find it boring.	2001-03-30

Maybe my expectations were sky high, but I was not impressed.  I found the author verbose and somewhat overbearing in tone, sorta like a drill sergeant.  Y'know, all you need as motivation is a good kick in the seat of the pants.<BR><BR>On the plus side, the author does include a good description of various types of skills, talents, aptitudes -- some of which I had never thought of before.  For example, it never occurred to me that there is more than one kind of problem=solving ability. Lore mentions analytical reasoning and diagnostic reasoning as kinds of problem-solving abilities.  But the corporate world is far more comfortable with analytical reasoning (solving problems by organizing things/concepts/info in a logical sequence).<BR><BR>Diagnostic reasoning, on the other hand, is more intutitive, and Lore gives as an example Issac Newton's discovery of gravity when the apple fell and hit his head.  An analytical reasoner, he says, would have concluded one should not sit under a tree with ripe apples when the wind blows.  The corporate world is not so comfortable with diagnostic problem-solvers, as they may ferret out problems (and suggest solutions) to senior management, who may not even be aware a problem exists, and lead to the perception of this problem-solver as a boat-rocker.<BR><BR>Aside from a few juicy facts like these, I learned nothing that I didn't already pick up in other career book. ...	2001-03-29

So  companies should ignore their own &quot;bottom lines&quot;, stockholders  and mission statements to become glorified go-fers?  Would that really keep  women running to Office Depot rather than a competitor?<BR><BR>But my  favorite is on page 118: &quot;Consider the parking lot as the...last  uncharted territory...

Ms. Bender shows you her process of critique in the  samples of the student's first draft and second draft.<BR><BR>First, she  singles out those &quot;velcro words&quot; (the nouns and phrases in the  first draft essay that stick with her) -- and she encourages you to take  your own note of your &quot;velcro words&quot;.  She then walks through her  feelings as she reads the essay -- where she is intrigued, for example, or  confused by the images the student uses.

What I found more difficult to believe, though, was the &quot;realistic&quot; side of the story.  If the children  are so miserable being in Wales, why aren't they focusing on keeping in  touch with American friends back home?  And, for that matter, why are they  so miserable in the first place?  I was 12 years old when my family lived  in Scotland (due to my dad's job) and I had difficulty relating to their  bad attitude, particularly since the reasons for it weren't fully  developed.<br /><br />Also, their mother was recently dead, but the author only  skims the surface on this issue.  Surely, the children must have had much  more difficult a time adjusting to her death.  It made me question why the  author felt the mother had to be dead in the story at all, since her  presence/absence was clearly not crucial to the plot.<br /><br />Finally, the  author chose to refer to the father consistently as David.  I found this  distracting; it made him seem like he was one of the children, and not the  father.  And, in many of the family conversations, the 10 yr old girl  sounds at least as mature as the father.  That didn't ring true!<br /><br />Nor  did it ring true to have the 15 yr old girl take a whole semester off  school so she could cook and clean house!	2000-04-26

You'll never have to  struggle or work or worry to write, because the instructions are so easy.   Plus, the format allows me to be me -- a  teacher.

And it starts right off by teaching  you how to generate ideas, and to get those ideas out on the page.  And you  can use the exercises over and over again, as variations on a theme.

There are also MANY more photos on the various steps: blocking and  finishing, evaluating your designs, colors, etc.<BR><BR>3) Finally, the  author has further annotated the stitches section to include her comments  (in addition to the stitch diagram, photo and stitch properties chart (yarn  hog, good backing, etc.).  She had notes (e.g. &quot;this is a stand-alone  stitch&quot;) in the prior version, but she does this to a far greater  extent in this edition, which I find helpful.<BR><BR>One thing, however, I  would have liked to see in this book (perhaps alongside the bibliography)  is a resources list, perhaps listing the American Needlepoint Guild and its  classes for design and color, etc.  Perhaps also a point made that ideas  can be gotten in needlework classes at your local shop, etc.<BR><BR>All in  all, though, this book is truly an investment for anyone doing  needlepoint!	1999-12-30

This book's events occur before the events in Bingo; however, it roughly parallels parts of Six of One (which goes from  the time Julia is 6 yrs old to an old woman).  This book covers Julia from  about 36 - 47 years.<BR><BR>Mostly I was concerned that the basic plot of  the Husenmeir sisters' lives be unchanged from Six of One.  (E.g., Mary  marries Extra Billy Bitters, Celeste Chalfonte dies right before Nicole is  born, and so on.) So far, I don't see any sign of Brown tripping up in this  department.<BR><BR>I DO get a little tired of her scatalogical humor,  though -- the Baby Ruth &quot;turds&quot; and the like.  Yawn!  It's so  childish!	1999-12-21

I liked best the segments dealing with the Cohens children and how they responded to the various sights on their trip.  They paid little attention to natural scenery, had to be &quot;bribed&quot; to see the Louvre, but loved the safari and the museum with the implements of torture.  Reading of  their escapades reminded me of my own childhood when my sibs (ages 7-10)  traveled Europe (only) with our parents during a year living in  Scotland.<BR><BR>I am sadly disappointed in Amazon for choosing a reviewer  who apparently did not read the book through and through.  The Cohens were  NOT endangering their chidren.  Kids get wild and scamper about -- and  bones can get broken at home falling off a bicycle.  The older two Cohen  children will remember this trip all of their lives.  (25 years since our  year in Scotland, our memories are still vivid!) And we did things, too,  that would put fear in a parents heart.  Yes, kids can be heedless of  danger, but is that any reason for them to stay at home?<BR><BR>  The  Cohens did not recklessly choose to go a game preserve -- that was their  daughter Kara's request.  And they explain in the epilogue why they didn't  go the luxe route!<BR><BR>I admire the Cohens for doing what they did.  And  I heartily admire my own parents, too -- reading this book made me realize  just how much my own parents had taken on, and we didn't do half the stuff  the Cohens did.<BR><BR>  More power to all of you intrepid parents  traveling with your kids!	1999-12-06

Coming from a Catholic background, though, I have never taken anything in the Bible completely literally so was not  put off by the idea that certain things in the Bible may be just there to  tell a story to a certain audience (and, I might add, a 1st-century  audience, at that!)<BR><BR>It's ironic that the reviewer below says Raymond  Brown's THE BIRTH OF THE MESSIAH is the one to read, as Spong highly  credits just that very book in helping him come to his conclusions.  He  says, &quot;in many ways this volume leans heavily on Ray Brown's  insights&quot; and &quot;the very thoughts I seek to popularize in this  book [have their roots] in Raymond Brown['s book]&quot;.	1999-09-13
