However, the writing style is undeniably British.  None of the main characters are particularly sympathetic, nor are motivations well explored.  Some of the smaller characters are interesting and sympathetic, but my favorite of them just vanished in the middle of the book with no explanation whatsoever.  Even the ones that don't per se vanish, like Lord Byron, appear to be randomly thrown in to provide a bit of color to the incredibly dull protagonists and don't seem to really advance the storyline.  I read it all the way through because I couldn't believe that a book with the reviews that this one is getting wouldn't get better, but it didn't.	2004-11-09

However, I urge any new Vorkosigan readers to begin with an earlier book - either Cordelia's Honor (about Miles's parents) or The Warrior's Apprentice (to jump straight to Miles).  As with any epic fantasy series* starting in the middle may diminish your total enjoyment.<br />* I would classify this as fantasy, not sci-fi, because of its emphasis on character development and because the plot is driven by the conflict between the norms of Barrayar's \\"feudal\\" society and the rest of the universe.  The futuristic technology used is taken for granted by the characters and not explained to the reader and is therefore magic for all intents and purposes.  I classify it as epic because there are currently twelve separate books in the series.	2004-05-14

I mean really, really dull.  Especially if, like me, you have already read Ann Coulter's book Treason.  Both books have two themes, as far as I can tell (1) all liberals are treasonous lying weasels and (2) Ronald Regan was an inspired genius, and George W. Bush bodes well to follow in his shoes.  Actually, I can really only say this about the first half of this book, as I then decided that life is too short to read any more of it.   <BR>If you already believe the mantra above and want to feel justified by reading it in print, you will like this book.  Alternately, if want an example of how conservatives are simplistic thinkers whose heavy handed arguments lack any coherency, much less finesse, this book should work for you just fine as well.  Anyone else should just skip this book and read the Da Vinci Code; you'll get as much enlightenment.<BR>The sad thing is, I've voted Republican all my life and even I can't stand this stuff.

It has all the classic ingredients for a good fantasy read - the capture and torture of the protagonist, the final dnouement with the evil sorcerer, the invasion of Jorsk by enemies, and the death of friends and comrades along the protagonist's path.  Unfortunately, there is no characterization in this book and thus I had zero empathy for Devlin, his friends and comrades, or even his enemies.  I was particularly disappointed that Devlin's Duncaer heritage does not play in part in this story - he might be entirely of Jorsk for all it seems to matter.  Like other reviewers before me, I believe that Bray needs a fourth book in this series to really tie up the emotional loose ends she leaves hanging.  If that book comes out, go ahead and get this one as a bridge to understand what has occurred.  Otherwise, read the last chapter at your bookstore if you really want to know what happens and spend your money at Amazon on a better book.	2004-04-23

This is angst-driven fantasy; if the characters are not nobly suffering, the plot does not advance.  Berg tries, but it is hard to conjure up more angst than she did in Transformation. Seyonne, after all, has already been a slave for sixteen years, seen the love of his life wed to another, lost and then rediscovered his magic, given it his all in a battle with a demon to save Prince Aleksander - and that was only book one.  Berg tries very hard, introducing several new characters with whom Seyonne has tragic, complex relationships, but the story was just not as poignantly agonizing.  Still, this was quite a good read and I am looking forward to Restoration as well.	2004-04-23

Unfortunately, this book was so bad that even I couldn't enjoy it.  The characterization is bad - the one character I had any empathy for at all was a sea elf who appears in about six pages total.  The character motivation is bad - many characters do things for no explicable reason but to attempt to move the plot along.  The villains are bad - they don't grow or change a bit from Tangled Webs.  Also, and most importantly, the storyline is bad - it is so choppy that I often checked to see if I had accidentally skipped a page.  Do your pocketbook a favor and buy a different book.	2004-04-23

This means that neither Nell nor Luke, my favorite characters in the series, appear at all.  Instead, we have an almost entirely new cast of characters, including Molly, Justin's childhood friend and longtime crush, who might be quite interesting in subsequent books, but only if she's fleshed out a bit more.  We also get to see a bit more of Bishop de Quincy.<br />I understood from reading The Queen's Man that this was going to be a trilogy, but there are enough loose ends at the end that it is apparent that Penman anticipates at least one more Justin novel.  My only quarrel with that is that she seems to have made this into too much of a transition novel.  Too many new elements and characters are thrown in for Penman to do them all justice, which leaves many of them shallow and two-dimensional.<br />The actual mystery, as usual, is convoluted and unlikely enough to give Agatha Christie pause.  Either you like that sort of mystery plot or you don't, but if you do, Penman created a nicely tangled knot with this one.	2004-04-16

Basically, this is a book about the hero's relationship with others and how those relationships change his perspective of himself.  All the book's action sequences drive this narrative and not the other way around.  This is a really good example of the genre; I deeply identified with the protagonist and was enraptured by his spiritual journey.	2004-04-15

Dutiful, the prince that Fitz serves, has sworn to give Elliania, a woman of the Out Islands, the head of the dragon Icefyre as a betrothal gift.  However, the Fool, Fitz's greatest friend who is also a prophet, believes that Icefyre should not be killed so that the race of dragons may be allowed to continue.  In addition, the Fool has predicted his own death in the Out Islands and Fitz is determined to see this prediction made wrong.  As with all Hobb's stories, this creates layers and layers of intrigue, where everyone has dual and triple motives in everything they do, and it is up to Fitz to find the heart of the matter and make the proper decisions.<BR>As with her previous stories, this one is well written and engaging.  It did drag a bit in parts, especially where Fitz re-explored well-worn emotional ground with no new resolutions.  Also, especially for such a long novel coming out of such a long series, I found the end to be rushed and the rationalization behind it quite disappointing.  Thus, a rating of four stars rather than five.<BR>That said, if you have made it all the way through the previous eight books, there is no reason not to read this one as well.  If you have not read the previous books (including the Liveship Traders trilogy), you should read them before this one or most of the fun of a very enjoyable series will be spoiled for you.	2004-04-12

Laden with all of Hobb's characteristic intrigue and angst, I could not put it down.  However, Hobb's editors have done readers a disservice in the way they chose to market these books.  Although this is the beginning of a trilogy, to fully enjoy it you should have read six books previously.  <BR>First, the Farseer Trilogy, starting with Assassin's Apprentice, which gives you the story of Fitz's life to date.  Failing to read this trilogy will seriously impact the reading enjoyment of Fool's Errand.<BR>Then, the Liveship Traders Trilogy, starting with Ship of Magic.  It is not utterly essential that you read the Liveship Traders trilogy to understand this one, but this trilogy contains many spoilers, and it seems a shame to waste the reading enjoyment to be gathered from the Liveship Traders trilogy by reading them out of order.<BR>Finally, enjoy this trilogy.  It ties together many of the threads left hanging in the previous two.	2004-04-12

However, I've really enjoyed this series so far, and this book is no exception.  Yes, the theme of drow-redeemed-from-evil has been done to death, and so far I haven't seen anyone do it better than R.A. Salvadore, but this is, after all heroic fantasy.  It is possible to write great fantasy wherein all the characters are evil, but it's usually better when there is at least some conflict between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil.&quot; Yes, the other protagonists aren't doing anything spectacularly innovative or terribly unpredictable.  However, they are moving the series plot along with well written dialogue and a few nifty spell concepts. And this is not groundbreaking fantasy, nor does it pretend to be.  It is book 4 of a series in which several talented, lesser-known authors have taken an interesting premise with good marketing prospects and added their own ideas to the foundation already created. I would recommend it for any Saturday afternoon that you have free.	2004-04-08

It started going downhill about book 4, and slowly declined after that, but I kept reading because I had liked the characters so much in the beginning.  This book is about 7/8 pages and pages of scripture out of the mouth of Jesus and the angels to 1/8 of characters thinking to themselves how wonderful they feel.  <BR>From a fiction perspective, this book is interesting only to (1) keep score - see who actually makes it all 7 years and (2) discover that, if you didn't survive, you are not going to get to help repopulate the Earth for the next 1000 years.  <BR>From a religious point of view, well, I'm not a biblical scholar, so I don't really have any insight as to their predictions of what might occur.  Neither do I expect to need this information in my lifetime.  So I'm happy for those for whom this book was a moving experience, but it really wasn't one for me.  What moved me about the earlier books in the series was the reactions of the realistic characters imagined by the authors.  Since the second coming is, by definition, so awesome that human minds cannot possibly encompass it, the ending here felt forced and unnatural to me, rather than uplifting, because it was impossible for the characters with which I identified to react to it with any degree of understanding.	2004-04-08

However, the author is not interested in the tribulation and redemption stoirs commonly published (E.g. Life and Death in Shanghai,Red Azalea).  Instead it is more a catalogue of the bizarre, with the author selecting stories that he found uniqe and interesting.  Sometimes I also thought that the stories were interesting, but there were several stories where I could not really see the point.  The author also inserts a line at the end of each story, I guess to explain each one, but they did not translate well into English and were an annoying distraction.	2004-04-04

The series is catagorized as mystery becuase there is some kind of unexplained murder in every book.  Generally, Qwill is involved in solving them, while Koko provides invaluable assistance with his superior cat insticts.  In this book, the murder is entirely periphial to the plot, and Qwill's only real connection to it is that Koko yowls when it occoured.  Otherwise, this might be any of a number of poor Mitford knock-offs, where the interst is supposed to come from the characters, but the characters are so dull that the story is not worth reading.  The denouement at the end is forced and poorly written.  In short, the entire book is dull, with none of the charm that Braun usually injects into the series.  Save your time and money and buy a different book.	2004-04-04

I picked this book up mostly to see how the author reconciled open homosexuality with her faith.<BR>That said, I found it a very enjoyable read.  Her writing contains personal anecdotes and references to popular culture that I could relate to easily.  She gives good (although obviously not neutral) background on the history of the Islamic empire.  She does not require the reader to have a facile understanding of Islam to grasp her basic points (although it might have added some depth).<BR>I also found it a nice change that she suggested some solutions to the problems identified in her social commentary.  True, they are simplistic and idealistic, and she spends no time on how they might actually be facilitated, but at least she has devoted some time to positive solutions to the negative trends she identifies.<BR>The author's writing style is clear and made for an easy and fast read.  I would recommend this book to other people who enjoy reading political commentary.	2004-03-03

In reading it, I did not realize it was a romance.  Although there is a romance in the novel, Lackey almost always includes romances in her stories, and usually they are a lot more interesting.  Elena herself (the protagonist) has the same characteristics as many of Lackey?s previous female heroines, although she is more two dimensional than usual for Lackey.<BR>What is interesting about this story is her concept of fairy tales powering the magic of a world and the powers of the people inside it.  The secondary characters also held my interest well;  I particularly liked the brownies that inhabit Elena?s house.  This novel is better than I have come to expect from Lackey recently (e.g. Take a Thief, Joust), but not as good as her earlier work (e.g. By the Sword, Jinx High).  In short, a fun way to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday, but nothing I will need to re-read.	2004-02-24

This book is the story of her accomplishment of the first two goals (the book itself is obviously the third).  Kuffel is not writing about the physical mechanics of becoming thin; she is interested in discussing the emotional and spiritual journey that she took during and after her weight loss.  Her food and weight problems are so extreme that I don't think her system would be necessary or helpful for most dieters anyway. <BR>That said, I really enjoyed her descriptions of the various stages of her weight loss.  The problems were actually more interesting than the triumphs.  It is easy to predict that someone would be ecstatic to wear a size 18 for the first time in her life; incontinence due to thigh shrinkage is a problem that I would never have imagined.  <BR>All in all, an enjoyable read about someone who overcame adversity in the pursuit of her goals.	2004-02-20

Book One of the Sword of Change established Devlin as the Champion and a hero.  In this book, he quickly finds out that yesterday's heroes are, well, old news.  The King, tired of making uncomfortable decisions, is no longer listening to him. The opposition starts a campaign to force him to find the Champion's sword, lost in Devlin's homeland for the last 50 years.  <BR>Once Devlin realizes that he has actually seen the lost sword in his master's workshop, his geas kicks in and forces him to find it.  Along with his two boon companions, he returns to his homeland to find the sword as well as pieces of himself that he had long thought lost forever.<BR>Devlin's Honor is written with a style that invites a quick read (it took me about 2.5 hours).  Although the plot is pretty much a standard for the fantasy genre, the characterization is well done, and I found myself interested in the secondary characters as well as the protagonist.  There were fewer fight scenes in this book than in the last, and some of the minor characters needed their personalities and motivations fleshed out a bit, but I would absolutely recommend this book for an afternoon of light reading.	2004-02-20

However, because there are so few ingredients, you need really good quality ones to pull these recipes off, which makes them relatively expensive.  There are some cheap meals (Pasta in the style of Sardinia, one of my favorites, about $10.00 for a 3 person meal) but expect to spend between $30-$50 dollars for every entre serving 3-4, with appetizers a little less.  Nor does the number of ingredients guarantee speed or simplicity - most of theses recipes take 45 min - 3 hours.  However, if you have the time and money, I have made some fantastic dishes with this book.  They're so good they don't even taste healthy.	2004-01-28

I picked it over Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister because I found the premise more intriguing.  However, I found the characterization and dialogue uninteresting.  The plot was dull even in the places that it was unpredictable.  I think it might appeal more to those who identify themselves primarily as readers of romance, rather than as readers of fantasy, as the romance aspects of the novel were its best conceived parts.	2004-01-26

The writing quality, however, is poor.  I read Mr. Moore for the same reason I read Ms. Coulter - I enjoy seeing what they are going to say next.  Mr. Moore should have edited this book for less repetition and more self-depreciating humor, at least for those of us who do not agree with most of his political positions and whom he is (presumably) trying to educate.	2004-01-26

Since the Southern Vampire series, even the witch's low income job is not new.  The writing is well done, and I enjoyed the book very much.  However if, like me, you are a fan of this storyline, you will not be surprised by the plot at any point.  But if you are looking for gore, sex, and vampires, it's worth a read.	2004-01-23

It was a fun read once, but does not have the depth and complexity of the Wheel of Time series itself.  There are no read surprises or difficult decisions made by any characters.  My favorite part of the book was its description of a few of the rituals and magic practiced only by blue sisters.  Get this at the library or wait for it in paperback because you won't need to read it again or keep it for reference to the other books.	2004-01-23

When I started reading it, I was dubious about Science Fiction written by a Mormon.  Four years and all his books I could get my hands on later, I'm convinced.  Some of his moral judgements  are foreign to me, but no more so than Robert Heinlein's, and they don't  distract from Ender's Game.	1999-04-29

I started reading this series because the girl next to me in Waldenbooks told her companion that this was &quot;the best series she's ever read.&quot;  I'm not ready to go quite that far, but it's definately good  brain candy.  It has good vampires, but other neat undead as well.  Amazon  is a good place to but these books because traditional bookstores don't  usually have all the titles.	1999-04-28
