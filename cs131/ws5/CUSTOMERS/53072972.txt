I was fooled by the picture on the cover -- it is one of the few appealing images in this book.  Most of the pictures are uninteresting and snapshot - quality.  Many of them are unusually ugly images of beard stubble, moles, pores, wrinkles, a stitched-up wound, or people sitting around in their underwear.  This is one of the least worthwhile photo books I have seen.	2005-08-27

Oberdorfer knows his subject, and he is clearly a top-knotch journalist.  Unlike a previous reveiewer, I don't find his writing dry at all -- compared to most history books, it is gripping and entertaining, and does a good job of describing the key players and major events without bogging down in trivia.<br /><br />Having grown up during the 70's and 80's (and having lost a relative to the Korean conflict), I'm fascinated to learn more about the events that were unfolding at the periphery of American consciousness during the administrations of Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr., and Clinton.  Despite recent developments in North Korea's nuclear standoff, the book doesn't feel out of date, as the situation today is little different than when this book was written.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those with an interest in East Asia, international affairs, or geopolitics.	2005-04-20

Michael Lewis is not a great writer, and his theme -- that baseball teams can be better managed by objectively weighting the contribution of various player attributes, such as on-base percentage and slugging percentage -- is informative but not earth-shattering.

Unfortunately the characters never feel very real or believable.  Key characters like Eburovic (Breaca's father) figure prominently in some sections and then disappear from the story even though they haven't gone anywhere.  The second most important character, Ban (Breaca's brother), never develops a personality of his own and never feels remotely convincing.<br />Buyers should also be warned that sections of the book include episodes of homosexuality, rape, and sexual mutilation.  Some sections are gratuitously perverse, while at other points the book reads like a gay romance novel.  This book is definitely not appropriate for children.	2004-04-04

Each chapter is written by a different person; the book is really just a collection of dry academic articles slapped together, with no organizing structure.  The alleged editor is also one of the contributing authors, and it doesn't appear that he did much editing at all.  The overall quality of the book is substandard, with amateurish and badly printed black and white photographs taken by the editor.  <br />Worst of all, judging by the first two selections, the writing is pretty awful.  Here's a sample of the obtuse academic style you will find in this volume: <BR>&quot;The Chinese hegemonic project of making Taiwanese aborigines part of the Chinese nation was incompatible with the developing counterhegemonic aboriginal project of affirming their distinct identity and political rights as indigenous people.&quot;  (page 37)  <BR>Hard to believe that such a passage could have been written by a native English speaker, much less that it actually got published!<br />Instead of this volume, I recommend Denny Roy's book, which is quite well-written.	2004-01-02

Instead of writing a section on Chinese art and a section on Indian art, Lee organizes his material by stage of development (Stone Age pottery) or by cultural movement (Buddhism), for example tracing the development of Buddhist styles in India, the adoption of those styles in China, Japan, and S.E. Asia, and the eventual synthesis of the Indian influences into local styles incorporating indigenous themes.  Lee writes eloquently and even passionately about his subject, letting us know which cultures, styles, and artworks he admires. He covers a vast amount of cultures and time periods, easily enough material for dozens of books.<br />The book does have significant flaws, however.  Most frustrating are the black and white photos (presumably a cost-saving measure). Roughly 90% of the images in the book are black and white, and they cannot do justice to most of the subject matter. A second weakness is Lee's writing style, which is sometimes more eloquent than comprehensible.  At times I had to reread a section several times in order to figure out what Lee was trying to say. He sometimes seemes to be addressing himself to an audience of art critics who are already familiar with the material, rather than students encountering it for the first time.  He will tell us that a particular art work is hieratic in style, or is an example of Daoist style, without explaining why.  Also the thematic, rather than chronological, approach means that some topics are fragmented into parts of different chapters.  The material on Korea, Southeast Asia, and the Tang Dynasty seemed especially disjointed.  The sections on China in particular need more development: Lee provides only a single page of text on the historically pivotal Qin Dynasty, and does only a fair job explaining the influences of Confucianism and Daoism.<br />One alternative text that deserves consideration is The Art of East Asia, edited by Gabriele Fahr-Becker.  Almost of the photographs are in color, and the text is both more comprehensive and more comprehensible than Sherman Lee, in particular the section on China.  The text is written by several different authors, one for each region, which has both advantages and disadvantages -- it avoids the fragmentation of Lee's approach, at the expense of integrating it all into one consistent framework.  The key disadvantage of The Art of East Asia (compared to Sherman Lee's History of Far Eastern Art) is that it doesn't include India, which contributed some of Asia's most impressive sculptures, and whose religions had tremendous influence on the rest of Asia.Qin Dynasty, and does only a fair job explaining the influences of Confucianism and Daoism.<br />One alternative text that deserves consideration is The Art of East Asia, edited by Gabriele Fahr-Becker.

The Art of East Asia is eloquently and insightfully written and stunningly produced.  The authors do an excellent job of bringing the art into the historical and cultural contexts of the time periods when it was produced.  The color photographs are plentiful, large, and beautifully printed -- this is an important point, as black and white photos fail to capture the details of either fine brushwork or three dimensional pieces.  This book is a tremendous value; it is far superior to other volumes costing almost twice as much.  The only limitation to be aware of is that it does not include the art of India.	2002-01-24

Unfortunately, the lavish praise for Band of Brothers is not deserved. The writing is surprisingly flat, colorless, and devoid of detail, emotion, or perception. The problem seems to be that few of the members of Easy Company were particularly expressive or literate. Most of the accounts are as flat as an entry in the typical business person's DayTimer. Some examples of Ambrose's writing, picked more or less at random:<br />&quot;Speirs led an attack on the final gun, which he took and destroyed, losing two men killed.&quot;<br />&quot;Hill raised his head to look. A bullet hit him in the forehead and came out behind his ear, killing him instantly.&quot;<br />&quot; 'Fire at will,' Williams called out.<br />It was a duck shoot. The Germans were fleeing.&quot;<br />&quot;Contact was reestablished. Easy moved out again.&quot;<br />And so on -- the book appears to have been written for a grade school reading level. Band of Brothers represents passable storytelling, but falls far short of literature.	2001-09-09

As an amateur underwater photographer, I particularly appreciate dive guidebooks with high quality underwater images that show the reader what to expect in terms of both marine life and scenery.  Unfortunately, Jack Johnson has relied on his own underwater photographs for this volume, and they are some of the worst I have seen published anywhere.  Several of Mr. Johnson's underwater photos are over-exposed and washed out (pp. 4, 31, 51, 56, 95), several are marred by backscatter (reflections from particles in the water -- pp. 117, 133, 156), and only a few of are well-composed and in sharp focus.  It's hard to imagine a competent amateur underwater photographer spending even a week in Malaysia and having so little to show for it.  While the images may not be as important to most readers as they are to me, it does raise questions regarding the care and effort that Mr. Jackson and his publisher put into this volume.<br />As for the text, it appears to be thorough and fairly well-written, so I would recommend this book for readers who are not interested in high quality underwater images.	2001-03-25

It's not very well written, but just entertaining enough to keep one involved.  Crichton did it much better in Jurassic Park: Timeline is little more than  a rewrite of Jurassic Park with castles instead of the theme park and  vicious knights in armor instead of vicious dinosaurs.  Unlike Jurassic  Park, Timeline is not very well written and frequently absurdly  implausible.  Having spent my career in Silicon Valley, it's painfully  obvious to me that Crichton hasn't the faintest clue of what high  technology companies are like, and his plot contortions to set the scene  reminded me of a bad high school creative writing assignment.  The frequent  injections of grotesque violence are clearly written with a future film  version in mind: they provide little impact on the written page and add  little to the story.	2000-01-02

This volume is one of the most popular and widely  available choices, but buyers should be forewarned.<br />The volume covers a  very wide-range of topics, from the invertebrates to the fishes, giving the  appearance of a thorough and comprehensive guide. Unfortunately both the  text and the photos do little more than scratch the surface.  Each family  is covered with just a single page of text.  Each fish is covered with just  a photo and label identifying it, without any discussion of the species  behavior, identifying marks, or similar species.  Worst of all, in my  limited South Pacific diving experience I've encountered many species that  are not included in this book at all. I suspect it probably includes no  more than 75% of the commonly encountered coral reef fishes, not enough to  be an authoritative source for fish identification.  The section on sea  turtles includes photos of just two species, plus a drawing of all six  species without any labels to tell you which is which.  All in all, an  attractively packaged but unfinished effort.	1998-08-23

The book has no photographs,  only drawings (or paintings), and the resolution and accuracy of the images  is much too poor to  distinguish similar species.  I was unable to identify  the particular species of anemonefish, lionfish, or scorpion fish that I  encountered from the pictures in this book.  I also found that including  both the South Pacific and the Caribbean in one volume is more of a  disadvantage than otherwise, since it is unlikely one would cover both  regions in the same trip.  It's a little like writing a guide book on New  York and Tokyo--it makes the book look more comprehensive, but doesn't add  much value.  I would recommend almost any book with photographs over this  one.	1998-08-23

It doesn't seem like anyone has done a comprehensive reference for this area comparable to Humann's works on the Caribbean.<br />However, I did find Paddy Ryan's fine volume in the lending library at the resort where I was staying.  To my surprise, I find it to be much more than the typical, superficial &quot;snorkeler's guide.&quot;  It's a small but beautifully produced volume with excellent photography and a well-written text.  It's a good balance of photos to help identify the most common South Pacific reef fish combined with informative text on the behavior and biology of reef fish, other vertebrates, and invertebrates.<br />I didn't buy a copy when I had a chance in a local shop, and I regretted it on the long flight home.

It is not, however, a page turner.  The writing style is dry, and a most of the book consists of lengthy lists and descriptions of buildings and artifacts discovered at every major Mayan site, with little analysis or discussion of what the artifacts actually signify.  Those who are short of time or patience would do well to skip ahead to the last three chapters, where the author *at last* provides a discussion of Mayan culture and beliefs.  This book is still a good use of time for people who want to get a  scientific view of Mayan civilization, instead of the myths that the local tour guides will perpetrate.
