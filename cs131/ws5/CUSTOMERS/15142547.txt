Before I write my review I will just give a disclaimer, which is that I enjoyed this book and you probably will too.  It was entertaining.  You will particularly enjoy it if you don't know anything about Marie Antoinette.  I already knew all this stuff and still thought it was fun.  If it's all new to you, you will like the dishy and accurate details of, e.g., the King's inability to consummate the royal marriage for seven whole years.  Great stuff, very dishy, and the author knows how to write a page turner.  So, on that level I say go buy it.  It gave me some hours of fun.  Although, you might find it downright insane that the Diamond Necklace Affair, one of the most infamous court scandals of the 1780s and the one believed to have played a major role in fatally defaming Marie Antoinette, was not mentioned at all!  Not once!  It was important enough to be a recent movie with 2 time oscar winner Hillary Swank, but this author decided not to include a single mention of it.    So, on another, more deeper level, I'm actually a historian so I have to say that this kind of friviolous, uninformative and selective-omission type writing irritates me to a degree. We already know so much about this woman, and while I do not believe she deserved her fate (I'm against the death penalty period!) I think she is a poor subject for literature.  It's interesting that such an ordinary man (Louis the Last) and woman (Widow Capet) with such uninspiring personalities would end up being thrown into such a situation by an accident of fate, but that only goes so far.      After awhile, when you realize there is real history of import out there, you have to wonder why there are thousands upon thousands of books about Marie Antoinette.  It's very elitist.  Let's face it,it's like Princess Diana being on the cover of all those magazines.  Yes, she seemed like a nice lady and yes, it's sad that she ended up in awful situations.  But what about people like Nelson Mandela?  They're a lot more interesting and tell us a lot more about the heroic potential of the human spirit than some woman who, at the end of the day, really was frivolous.  She may not have said \\"Qu'ils mangent du gateau\\" (let them eat cake), but she did spend much money on finery while people starved to death.  A modern-day dictator would hardly be celebrated in fluff literature for such choices.  And if they would, we have to question our values system.      Which brings me to my absolute least favorite part of the book.  It was relatively accurate despite some of the fictious characters-until the end.  It really bothered me that the author takes a Dickensian approach toward revolutionary violence...well, she takes the approach of of all conservative writers from the time of the revolution to now (i.e., Simon Schama).  I don't defend violence, but she made no attempt to understand or portray what drives the desperately poor and needy to acts of intense inhumanity then, and this still happens now.      I understand the author is trying to \\"be\\" Marie Antoinette, so her \\"insights\\" are limited, but I think it's a little ridiculous and contrived to make up a stupid personality for Robespierre and an even dumber meeting between him and the Queen.  The author's Robespierre is based almost entirely on Mme. Roland's memoirs, the famous and bizarre aside Mme Roland made about the Incorruptible having greenish veins which was later turned by Carlyle into the infamous \\"sea-green Incorruptible\\". Madame Roland was about the only source ever claiming Robespierre was \\"green\\".  Most people said he was quite pleasant looking.  I ought to know.  I've read about seventeen biographies on the man.  (Don't ask).    She exaggerated everything about him and completely obscured his actual personality. He was misguided, but not in the way she portrayed it.       It was a total recycled, post-Thermidorian cartoon of the man, which is not good history, it's not even decent historical fiction.  He wasn't out of control in the way she wrote it.  Also, he stands in for every other revolutionary.  Only Marat and Mirabeau are mentioned, and barely at that.      Keep in mind that it's awful history and think of it more as \\"Jackie Collins in 18th Century France\\".  Which is fine, but I still think they could've made it a little less ridiculous.  I don't like real historical figures to be simplified down to cartoon characters.  The cartoon gets remembered and nothing else-which is the dumbest form of history out there.	2005-10-10
US	15142547	R25MDCN5XDM27C	0312305060	785940945	The Hours	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Very Well-Written	Some people found this book painful or boring but I thought it was a very well-crafted story that was beautifully told and evoked a number of universal human emotions we can all identify with, especially fear and uncertainty as we get older. There were some beautiful scenes and imagery in the book, and while once in a while it bordered on the pretentious, it didn't feel at all contrived, it felt genuine.  I found it very readable and very interesting and wasn't bored for a second.  And I haven't even read Woolf.  Of course it made me want to, because it was amazing to read a story about women's lives linked through literature, which I think is a great theme.  I didn't find it dark or depressing either, although I know a lot of people did.  <br /> <br /> I felt it was thoughtful, respectful of its characters too.  It was a quiet book that didn't bludgeon you with its messages but let them emerge with subtlety-everything happens within a day's time, which is quite an achievement because it gives you a real sense of a more substantial passage of time spent with these three women, whose inner lives are fascinating.  It isn't about action, it's about the internal world of the heart. <br /> <br />Definitely recommended, I think most anyone would enjoy it.	2005-10-10
US	15142547	RLU8NMKMLVCE8	0435908960	705562688	Black Docker (African Writers Series)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Excellent	This is a very well written short novel addressing the mid- twentieth-century experience of a young Senegalese man in France.  Although French colonial administrators and propagandists promise an inclusive empire designed to culturally and politically assimilate Africans and Asians, the hero of this book finds a far different situation awaiting him in Marseilles and Paris.  Forced to slave away on the docks, Diaw spends his nights pursuing intellectual questions and working on his novel.  In France, he does not find the liberty, equality, and fraternity he was promised, but rather is an exploited worker who is compelled on a daily basis to face humiliating stereotypes about blacks. <br /> <br /> After he authors a brilliant book on slavery, he has trouble finding a publisher.  After entrusting a white woman to promote his book, he is betrayed when she takes credit for his writing.  No one will believe him that he is the true author of the book, and ultimately this leads to a terrible tragedy that puts him, and the promise of French inclusiveness, on trial.  This is a great book, beautifully written, and anyone interested in the situation confronting minorities and immigrants in Europe and beyond will find it enlightening. <br /> <br />It remains relevant and hardly seems dated, except for two major aspects.  First of all, written in 1956, it reflects that era's widespread condemnation of homosexuality.  Although this condemnation is not expressed in a hateful way, (rather homosexuality is seen as yet one more aspect of a decadent, capitalist society's excesses), if one uses this book in the classroom one would have to find a way to put it in context.  <br /> <br /> I do recommend assigning it to students because it is so powerful and effective, and I intend to myself, but I will have to find a way to teach the book without alienating anyone.  It also takes an unfavorable view of abortion, another controversial aspect of the book that teachers will have to tread carefully around.  Again, abortion is seen as symptomatic of a diseased society.  One character, a young white woman who is the lover of a black character and becomes pregnant with twins, dies of  a botched abortion; her mother forces her to get the abortion to prevent a scandal.  Although in this specific case Ousmane is condemning bourgeois hypocrisy, racism, and materialism, he does also give a blanket condemnation of abortion as a practice.  He does not condemn those who receive them, and neither abortion nor homosexuality are central to the story, but be forewarned that they are dealt with if you plan on using the book in a classroom setting. <br /> <br />Whether you're a teacher or not, this book is highly recommended!  Hard to put down-this slender volume's compelling plot and biting social critique make it a wonderful read for anyone!	2005-09-22

(I was in Europe and they were the only English titles available at the time).  Actually, not one of these three books is necessary reading.  But if you're going to read one, which you shouldn't, read this one.  It is the closest one to a \\"love\\" story as Miller pursues his obsession with a mysterious beauty who appears to be a pathological liar.  It is the most genuine of all his relationships. <br /> <br />All three books are entertainingly filthy, but that's about it.  I don't object to the book due to its frank and graphic discussions of sexuality, I should make that clear.  Plenty of wonderful novels contain such material.  Miller should certainly not have had to endure all the censorship battles he did, and we could say the same of plenty of other writers.  <br /> <br /> However, the sensationalism surrounding the books' content may obscure the fact that these books are plagued with the author's absolute contempt for women and his dehumanizing of them.  The strongest parts of the book were the colorful way in which Miller recreates pre WWII New York City life.  I did enjoy his eccentric ethnic friends.  However, the cruelty with which he treats his wife and child were really unappealing and if this is an autobiographical book the person it is describing is absolutely wretched.	2005-09-21

I love nineteenth-century history-theme wasn't the problem.  I love long nineteenth-century Russian novels-genre wasn't the problem.  I have read a lot about Napoleon, military campaigns, etc-topic wasn't the problem.  So why was it so difficult to get through this book?  I don't understand it.  I've never given up mid-steam after hundreds of pages like this.<br /><br /> It's very well-written, but I think that the problem, or perhaps the beauty, of the book is that it takes so long for the plot to develop.  I am sure that if you can get through the book, it is probably incredibly rewarding.  I want someone to post a review advising me on where to go from here.  I started the book because I had found Anna Karenina so beautiful, spiritual, and meaningful.  I figured,  this is supposed to be the greatest novel ever.  It will be like Anna Karenina, but better.<br /><br /> Also, I read a magazine story where a woman decided to read this book before her 30th birthday, then wimped out.  Weeks away from my 30th, I thought, \\"I never wimp out.  I can read 500 page novels in a matter of days.  Plus, I love these kinds of long stories.  I'm not even bored by war novels. I just read a long-19th century novel about the Franco-Prussian war and loved it!\\"  (Emile Zola's \\"The Debacle\\")<br /><br />I don't know what happened, but I increasingly dreaded this book.  Every time it was time to read it, I didn't want to.  The plot was also disturbing.  Why doesn't Andrew love his wife with the mustache?  Don't answer: \\"the mustache, duh\\", if you haven't read the book.  Because it's not the mustache, she's considered gorgeous by all, and apparently mustaches were not a minus in those days, according to Tolstoy who keeps describing her \\"adorable mustached lip\\".  (At the very least, we can guess from this, female facial hair wasn't considered a minus by the 19th century Russian elite.  I have no facial hair, so what hope would I have had with those kind of unfair cultural ideals of beauty?!)<br /><br />  So, we must ask, why is Andrew fed up with his adoring, beautiful, adequately hairy wife with her sexy shadowy upper lip? She's expecting his firstborn child after all!  Andrew's father suggests to his son, by way of reassurance, that all marriages become disenchanted, this one in less than a year.<br /><br /> That's just not true, so what's up with Andrew and his father?  I think, misogynism.  No one seems to respect women in this book, their company is implied to be frivilous, at least in the beginning.  And why did the Count such-and-such legitimize his son that he can't stand?  How are all these people connected?  Why is this war, so devastating, so pointless, also so boring?  Finally my husband said, \\"Why don't you just admit you don't want to read this book?\\"  I didn't want to admit it.  I was too pretentious.  There's no such thing as a classic I get bored in the middle of.<br /><br />But then I thought, life's too short. I can either pretend to myself I'm enjoying the next 1200 pages, or run away from this book.  I chose the latter.  All I can say is, either I \\"read it wrong\\", or this book just takes an enormous investment that even the most literate and curious people might not want to take on.  In which case,  I can't reccomend it.  Don't view this as a challenge!  That's the mistake I made.  I realized, I could have finished it, and I probably would have liked it, but if a book doesn't have you hooked 300 pages in, maybe you're just not ready to invest any more time.  I didn't.<br /><br />  Maybe I'll come back to it one day, but my official position as of the moment is that although parts are intriguing, and it is beautifully written, and has profound insights into universal truths of human nature, etc. etc., blah blah blah, overall it was very slow, and very boring.  Maybe it was the translation.  Maybe the my mood wasn't right.  I'll be back, War and Peace!  You haven't seen the last ofme!  And if I complete you, I'll edit this review.  I don't declare defeat that easily.  Advice to readers: don't take on this novel unless you have a lot of time and motivation and are crazy  enough to take the time to go to war with \\"War and Peace\\".iew.

The writers are compassionate and have a quirky, enjoyable Australian sense of humor.  It's a bit corny to us who live stateside, but endearing nonetheless.   <br /> <br />Try to imagine the Crocodile Hunter explaining your period to you, and you'll get a good idea of how these girls sound.  But more importantly they know what they're talking about.  I've read a lot about women's health and they know their stuff.  Plus, I learned some things, too.  Overall it was just very reassuring.  I think women have to get to know their bodies and what to expect and when to seek help.   <br /> <br />I know I was comforted to know that there's no such thing as a \\"normal\\" period.  I liked how they pointed out that no woman is like that textbook girl who gets her period every 28 days on the clock and has a flow that lasts 3-5 days.  I think we all sort of expect that, but most women do NOT follow that pattern, so it's actually abnormal.  I also appreciated their in-depth discussion of PMS symptoms and the best ways to deal with them, plus advice on vitamin suppliments to help you and so on.   <br /> <br />A definite recommend.	2005-09-15
US	15142547	R29MFWDNFBGVXW	0312957955	721205438	Falling Angel (Dead Letter Mystery)	Books	5	14	16	N	N	A Horror Classic-a Shocking Ending	Like some of the other reviewers, I tracked this book down after I had seen Angel Heart.  Angel Heart was such a thrilling, frightening movie (I'm not easily scared, either) that I had to read the book. The book was even better than the movie, which is saying a lot because I believe the movie was top-rate as well. <br /> <br /> I won't give away the absolutely shocking ending to the story because I hope that potential readers will enjoy the surprise as much as I did.  However, I will say that if you loved the movie you will not be disappointed by the book.  The book's gripping plot is the same as the movie's, however, as might be expected, there is more character development in the book.   <br /> <br />Namely, and most importantly, the character Epiphany Proudfoot, played in the movie by Lisa Bonet (better known as Denise Huxtable, and after growing up watching her play that role it was strange to see her in such a drastically different one) is far more interesting in the book.  In both versions she is a beautiful teenage girl of mixed ancestry, but in the book she is brilliant, kind, funny, and surprisingly wise for her years.  Her book character is more emotionally present and has more invested in her relationship with the main character, Harry Angel. <br /> <br />  She has been educated in Latin and religion at a Catholic School and helps Private Detective Harry to unravel the mystery of the missing person he is looking for. <br /> <br />In the movie, however, her dialogue is somewhat vapid and we don't care that much about her character.  Also, they gave her a child of uncertain parentage in the film, which I found an odd decision, especially since the author of the book worked on the screenplay.  I understand of course that there is less time to establish character in screenplays, but there was enough time to make the Lisa Bonet character more interesting.  She is an intelligent actress and would have been good at conveying the sophisticated Epiphany.   <br /><br />For some reason, the film decided to make Epiphany a native of New Orleans.  Presumably this was to have the aura of both Louisiana and Harlem, NY in the 1950s.  The effect was cool, but I wish something else had brought Harry to Louisiana, because Epiphany seemed so New York in the book.  No one even goes to Louisiana in the book.  Everything happens in New York. <br /> <br />Another thing about the book was that the character Cypher, played very well by De Niro in the film, was more developed, if that's the right word, in the book.  He said more revealing things.  I wonder if I would have guessed his nature earlier if I'd read the book first? <br /> <br />Definitely pick up this fascinating read-truly a chilling book and perfectly written horror tale!	2005-09-12
US	15142547	R31YJOXY19X2A4	0312306261	643244690	Eleven on Top	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Better than Ten Big Ones...	Those of you who were disappointed by Eleven On Top's immediate predecessor, \\"Ten Big Ones\\", will be happy to know that this book is much, much better.  Fans of the series will find it worthwhile: it made me laugh out loud, as usual, and I enjoyed the plot: Stephanie trying to quit Bounty Huntering, as she calls it, and trying to make a respectable life for herself in a variety of humorous professions.      Those were the strong parts of the book-it had a new idea-Stephanie planning a career change-and I especially liked reading about Stephanie on new jobs from Cluck-in-a-Bucket chicken fryer to button factory worker. I won't reveal anything about it, but her run-in with \\"Mama Macaroni\\", and its aftermath-was hilarious. Stephanie's Jersey wit was as enjoyable as ever and she was back to her lovable and plucky self.  I also liked the Valerie/Kloughn subplot.    However, some of the weak parts of \\"Ten Big Ones\\" were repeated in \\"Eleven on Top\\" and Ms. Evanovich needs to address them.  I still think she's an amazing and rare comedy talent and this is not to diminish her contribution-we're lucky to have a writer who makes us laugh and smile all through her books.  I don't like nitpicking as it seems ungrateful.  But there were a few things that drove me a bit crazy, so here I go!      For one thing, I am extremely sick of the Stephanie-Ranger-Morelli love triangle.  It's getting boring, repetative, and stupid.  Ranger keeps calling Stephanie babe, all the time.  We get it, he's the dangerous person you're not supposed to marry.  He's sexy.  It's cool that she had a fling with him but it's over.   Ms. Evanovich, if you are reading this, stop the triangle!  A great plot twist would be if Morelli and Steph got married and all the capers that would ensue.  You have to move the plot along.       Another bone I have to pick, (if the author or publisher or anyone who can tell the author about this is reading this, please pay attention) is the ethnic stereotypes, which your books are chock full of, whether Italians, Middle Easterners, Pakistanis, etc. etc.  Can't you have a character who breaks with stereotypes?  Yes, I realize you are an equal opportunity stereotype-no one is singled out.  But still, not everyone has to constantly \\"perform\\" their ethnicity as a running joke.      I get it.  Lula is a no-nonsense wise-cracking black woman.  How original.  Can't she have some opportunity to show her full humanity as more than a two-dimensional cartoon? Send her to school or something, I beg of you!      Another thing is, what was with the ending of the novel?  It seemed abrupt, not to mention it left unanswered questions.      Finally, introduce some more characters.  Most of them are getting pretty stale.  You can combat that by livening up some of them (e.g. Lula!), but bring in some new people.  Have Stephanie enter some other high risk job where you can get her into scrapes but she gets to travel internationally or something.  I don't think being a bounty hunter is really that exciting.  How many books will involve her being stalked by lunatics who have to die at the end?  Come on, you can't keep doing that.     So, overall, a definite recommend to fans, I really enjoyed it, but future editions will need some livening up if this series is going to stay fresh.	2005-09-08
US	15142547	RTSUYGQXIPQQP	0743493869	517556785	April Shadows	Books	4	7	10	N	N	NOT a Traditional V.C. Heroine...	Longtime fans of V.C.Andrews' books will be shocked to find that the adolescent narrator of this story is NOT a stunningly gorgeous young woman whose amazing beauty and budding sexuality make her prey to the pruient interest of men far older than she.  They will also be surprised that the focus of the story isn't going to be this fair maiden's first physical relationship with a member of the male gender.  Also, the heroine is not a graceful dancer, talented singer, gifted artist or promising pianist.  She is not in any way connected with a fabulously wealthy family in possession of an enormous estate with a goofy name, and she is also sure who her parents are and not attracted to anyone in her family.  Truly, this book strikes new V.C. Andrews ground!  <br />  <br />Instead, April, heroine of the book, is overweight, short, not particularly talented at anything, and confused about her sexuality.  I liked this book and thought it was original and refreshing.  It confronted the reality of being a teenager: that many adolescents go through awkward phases where they are confused about their identity and who they really are.   <br /> <br />Although the book treds familiar V.C. Andrews' ground by having April be beset by successive family tragedies, the story does break with the familiar V.C. formula by introducing themes such as lesbianism, cocaine use and...um, ventriloquism.  Ok, it was a little weird at parts, but it somehow dealt with things like homosexuality in a mature way while trying to introduce some of the gothic \\"horror\\" elements we expect from these books.  <br /> <br />It treats its heroine in a surprisingly sensitive way.  April is a lovable character who is more recognizable than many other girls who have been in V.C. Andrews books.  She isn't accepted by her peers but we root for her to find her way in the world because she is a kind and caring person.  I think the book took a realistic look at issues such as weight-loss and teenage sexuality.  April doesn't magically take off her excess weight at any point in the book; she struggles with eating as a coping mechanism and relapses, gaining back more than she had lost originally.   <br /> <br />When she is worried that she might be gay, a common worry that most straight adolescents have at some point or another (after all, their closest relationships are often with members of the same gender), the book does not insinuate that the worry alone means anything about her future.  <br /> <br /> Her sister, who actually is gay, is one of the strongest V.C. Andrews characters in a long time.  Brenda is a survivor and her character was well-developed and believable.  She loves her sister but tries to suppress her own needs by putting on a tough front when confronted with a crisis.   <br /> <br />Overall I really liked the book and thought it was brave.  It did deal with issues I've never imagined Andrews would.  Although the book was bizarre, it was a page turner and kept me interested.  And despite the lurid and ridiculous nature of some of the plot twists, the major themes were dealt with in a mature and responsible way.  I think this book would be comforting to adolescents.  I think gay teens or teens who struggle with weight would particularly appreciate this new plotline.  And although I didn't have April's particular set of problems, I think every teenager can identify with feelings of isolation/ being different/wondering if you're normal/attractive enough.  So that would appeal to anyone. <br /> <br />  However, I kind of miss the formula, too.  Part of why we like these books is the fantasy aspect-I think we all like to imagine that we will find out that we're actually a lost part of some aristocratic American dynastic family and will soon be dressing up for the society balls, that as young teenagers we might be having an affair with a sophisticated older man, etc. Of course in retrospect I'm glad I wasn't 16 and dating someone more than twice my age, but the fantasywas fun.  So bring back the fantasy after this series.  In the meantime, I look forward to finding out what happens to April...	2005-09-08
US	15142547	R3SQL4CGGR1TH1	067102535X	130721196	Last Dance, Last Chance (Ann Rule's Crime Files)	Books	3	3	8	N	N	M.D.: Mass Destruction!	This is my first experience with Ann Rule.  I actually borrowed the book from my mother and read parts of it to her!  We both like True Crime books.  First, I would like to recommend the book, simply because the story is compelling.  There are actually several stories but the major one, which takes up over three-fourths of the book, is fascinating.  It's about a pompous, arrogant, sickening \\"doctor\\" whose criminal progessional negligence and deliberate personal cruelty will shock and infuriate you.  <br /> <br /> Dr. Anthony Pignataro will be familiar to those who like the crime genre as a narcissistic personality. (And Ann Rule doesn't hesitate to tell us that diagnosis repeatedly!)              <br />Truly, though, men like this must follow some kind of standard guide on how to be an evil controlling father/husband/authority figure.  In a pattern familiar to self-absorbed meglomaniacs, Tony thinks he is above the law.  In several gruesome episodes he practices unsound and unsanitary surgery on his patients and in one case kills one of them.  It's terrifying that this man wasn't stopped sooner, as he had an awful record many years prior to going to jail for negligent homicide.  He could never get board certified and had a frightful reputation for incompetence, leading me to believe he should have had his medical license revoked long before he caused the death of a young wife and mother of two. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, in another page out of the book on how to be a typical self-absorbed evil jerk, he cheated on his wife, insulted her appearance and intelligence on a constant basis, and ultimately decided to kill her.  He also, as is typical of these types of men, ignored his children unless he saw some way to get them to address his needs, rather than the other way around, which is the way it should be.  In one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the book his thirteen-year-old son confronts him and tells him that \\"even he\\" knows at his age that deception, drug use, and adultery are wrong.   <br /> <br />All the while, Tony whines and pities himself and attributes any legal actions against his unprofessional conduct as  conspiracies against him motivated by jealousy.  Even after it was clear he had slowly tried to arsenic his wife to death, he tried to pin the blame for the crime on any number of people: first asserting it was the husband of the woman he had killed through surgery, then that his wife had done it deliberately to herself, then that it was a neighbor.  He also tried to order a hit on a man who could testify that he had wanted to murder his wife, all while developing a heroin habit. <br /> <br />Miraculously, his wife survived the poisoning and this is her courageous story.She had to fight to get custody of their children and to overcome the paralysis caused by the arsenic. <br /> <br />My mother and my sister had read Ann Rule and explained to me her background and association with Ted Bundy.  She certainly seems like a nice person from everything I have read about her, but her writing style is just atrocious.  Her sympathy for the victim is genuine and touching, but her phrases are awkward, and some of the words look like she was writing with a thesaurus at her side.  A lot of sentences made no sense or were just amazingly cumbersome and chose the oddest turns of phrase or words to make a point.  The ironic part is that she accuses Dr. Pignataro of doing the same thing when he wrote his autobiography (which he sent to her!) called M.D.: Mass Destruction. <br /> <br />Although what Dr. Pignataro did is nothing to laugh at, the title of his bombastic autobiographical account of his trials and tribulations during his first trial (on charges of negligent homicide after doing the fatal breast augmentation surgery on the young mother) is hilarious.  <br /> <br /> He refers to himself in the first person in this book and tries to attribute authorship to his long-suffering wife.  At any rate, Ann Rule does in fact tend touse the same thesaurus words and awkward sentences that are apparently trying to sound like clever phrases but are actually really jarring in their clumsiness.  UNLIKE Tony P,she does come of as warm and caring and I did like her.   <br /> <br />I would read her books again and recommend this book and others, but I do think that her editor has to do something about some of her melodramatic writing etc.  Not that the story isn't naturally dramatic, but she made everything dramatic and awkward, no matter what it was.  Phrases would be something like, \\"so and so was the epitome of what blonde jokes personified\\".  ?   <br /> <br />	2005-09-08

You'll find all five in abundance in this book, I kid you not!    I love Zola, and I'm trying to get through all the Rougon-Macquart series.  For those of you that don't know, Zola wrote a 20-novel saga about a family under the Second Empire.  So far I have read about six.  They are all thrilling, exciting, lurid, and wonderful. This one is no exception.  It is amazing and I loved it, although it was my least favorite so far among the Zola books I have read so far.  (However, in its defense, it was undoubtedly the dirtiest!)  The main character is one Jean Macquart, really a very nice and ordinary guy (later to fight in the Franco-Prussian war in Zola's The Debacle, the penultimate of the Rougon-Macquart, which I'm reading now) who becomes a farm hand in the most perverse, twisted peasant village you could ever imagine.      Why is this my least favorite Zola novel so far?  Because it's very hard to care about the characters, whereas in some of his other books, such as \\"L'Assommoir\\", featuring Jean Macquart's sister Gervaise, or \\"Germinal\\", featuring Gervaise's son and Jean's nephew Etienne, the characters were sympathetic and the stories tragic.  But almost no one was sympathetic in this book except for Jean.  The evil characters were so awful you could barely read about them.    I can't give away all the plot twists, but you will delight in the larger than life and humorous characters.  They are so wretched!    Everyone is obsessed with one thing-land.  (Except the characters that run a brothel and claim they're better than their poor relatives).  But land's the thing.  How to hold on to it, how to keep from losing it through marriage or disinheritance.  The entire family is presided over by a hideous, cruel, and rich matriarch, called La Grande, who is in her late eighties and was born during the Terror, in 1793.  She often smiles to herself about how much she enjoys setting her family at each other's throats and inciting their murderous rage. She's deliberatelydesigned her will to cause countless lawsuits between her benefactors!  But the major plot centers around the Fouan family, La Grande's brother's family.    Jean falls in love with La Grande's great-niece, Francoise, but there are problems.  I can't give anything serious away in case you read this book, which you should if you haven't!  You'll love it.  It's as exciting as anything from our own time.  Don't read the intro, by the way, until AFTER you read the book because the introduction gives away all the major plot points.  I truly regret having read it.  Read my introduction instead!    Without getting into too much detail, suffice to say a bunch of land disputes come into play, because the nastiest and scariest member of the Fouan family has married Lise, Francoise's sister.  He doesn't want Francoise to get married to Jean or anyone for that matter because A., he would lose some of the land he inherited from Francoise's late father, and B., he is obsessed with Francoise and believes his numerous attempts to rape her will eventually succeed.      Meanwhile, everyone is sleeping with everyone, from cousin to cousin to brother and sister; people are slaughtered for their land, everyone is terribly cruel to everyone, and you find out a lot of things you didn't know about the nineteenth-century.  For instance, did you know that people found flatulence as funny then as we do now?!  Quite the history lesson.      One of the best characters in the book, the eldest Fouan son (called Jesus Christ because of his long hair and beard) can fart at will and always has some stashed up no matter what the occasion.  You can't hope to win if you bet him that he can't fart, let's say, six times in a row.  He can, no matter what time of day, and keeps getting free drinks on account of it.     There are a lot of graphic sexual scenes.  This is foreshadowed by the opening scene, where Francoise mates a bull and cow!  Later, animal stories are symbolically repeated with the people.They are \\"of the earth\\" and it's \\"all natural\\".  Here, some of Zola's metaphors were a bit heavier handed than in his other works, and while elsewhere he made me feel terrible and shed tears about the plight of the working class in 19th century France, here he made peasants sound very unsympathetic.      Although one can understand their fears over foreign competition and their desire to have the government protect their produce, it's still hard to understand how that translated into the nastiest people I can ever remember reading about.  In Zola's other books he somehow made the poverty more vivid, he made me feel it was directly responsible for people losing their dignity and their ability to live decently.    Here, it's not clear what is going on or how on earth family members would be driven to rape each other, kill each other, and steal from each other.  At first their bickering is realistic, then it turns insane.  Apparently Zola based his account on reports by priests from the time in these villages, and peasants who had read the book, according to Zola's son in law, tended to recognize their neighbors in the book!  (If not themselves, he added, the introduction tells us.)     But it still seems exaggerated to me.  I still think most peasants wouldn't do what the main characters in this book did.  It's an extreme example.    Don't get the wrong idea.  You will still love this book although I think if you're going to read one Zola book only read Germinal or l'Assommoir.  This book will keep you both laughing and reeling from how crazy and disgusting these peasants are, but it's highly unsympathetic, although I'm not sure Zola intended it to be.      I think, based on what I've read, that he felt that these were the people who were the lifeblood of France, and tried to \\"naturalize\\" their lives and make them somehow outside bougeois morality.  I'm not sure it quite worked, despite his genius, but it's a great story.  I think I'll read more about what he was trying to do later, because it's not always clear.  As fans of his novels know, he tries to put forth \\"scientific\\" explanations for human behavior but ultimately he is a great artist and his work transcends his pretenses.    Despite the problems with the book, he's still one of the best writers ever: Vive Zola!	2005-08-07

This book has everything fans of the 19th century novel, such as myself, love-melodrama, romance, secrets, plot twists, mistaken identities, rising fortunes, and, of course, a tragic ending.  I can't give much away because the novel rests on a series of shocking revelations-each more shocking than the last!<br /><br /> However, since the book begins with the most startling event of all, and since it is given away on the back of the book, and happens at the very beginning, I will only deal with that event, which is what drew me to the book in the first place.  This will set the stage and make you want to read the book as much as I did when my friend told me about it!<br /><br />The main character is a certain Henchard who SELLS HIS WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER. That's right, he sells them!  To a sailor!  Granted, he is drunk.  It's an intriguing study of alcoholism, although some men wouldn't have to be one to want to sell their wives for some beer if they could get away with it.  Henchard's wife is understandably furious, and leaves with the sailor.  After this, Henchard vows to never again drink-although the introduction to my edition suggests that he remains a \\"dry drunk\\".  I don't exactly know what that that entails, but the introduction assured me that it was one of the first books on alcoholism which is important enough.<br /><br />Henchard then redeems himself and in Jean Valjean fashion would like to both atone for, and hide, his shameful past.  He tries to find his wife and daughter, and that's where all the fascinating plot twists come in.  It's very well-written and kept my attention throughout.  I have also read \\"Tess\\" by Hardy and I like his writing style.  I cannot say that his works moved me in any profound way as other literature has, but I'm not sure why that's important.  There's a lot of humor and farce in this book which is first-rate, and I just enjoyed his protagonist-it's not easy to create one so believable and yet so interesting at the same time.<br /><br />Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life?  I'm sure all those who panned this book may have known someone who found a way to surround themselves with drama even in this day and age.  All the book's drama is caused by Henchard and his mercurial personality-if at any time he'd played things differently he could have had a better life.  But no, he had to be a lunatic.e time.   <br /> <br />Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life?

Finding books with that much humor that were that fun to read in cheap, popular, paperback form is very rare, and a treasure to find, and it made me a big fan.      The books were fresh and original and funny in a way very few books of this kind are, and I think everyone should read the first books in the series.  There was something quintessentially American about them and when I was lonely for my husband, family, and friends while doing research in a foreign country they cheered me up and reminded me of home while I froze to death waiting on a long line to be allowed into a poorly heated library.      I read and loved the first several books and recommended them to family and friends who also became big fans.  And, like me, they also felt the series began to decline around the 8th book.  This book was the absolute worst, though.  My friend and I were discussing it and it was so bad it almost defies description.  My friend said \\"I still love Stephanie Plum, but WHERE WAS SHE?  This whiny person doesn't resemble the resilient Stephanie we've come to love AT ALL!\\"    The reviewers who say that this book gives undue attention to Ranger's shower gel and Ranger's sheets are not exaggerating!  But most of all my friend and I and other reviewers were horrified at the ending.  (Do not read on if you don't want a spoiler...but I don't recommend reading the book anyway).    For one thing, it showed a FRIGHTENING DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE!  Ok, the \\"Junkman\\", the \\"gang leader\\" who is supposedly obsessed with Stephanie is a sadist who had to be killed in self-defense.  We can accept that.  But my friend and I were horrified at the casual manner in which a laughing Stephanie, Ranger, and Morelli, and Sally Sweet, simply walk over the dead bodies of a bunch of KIDS with no regard for them.  Some kids get involved with gangs/drugs and aren't bad-IN THE OTHER BOOKS STEPHANIE ALWAYS SHOWED RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE, AND COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE WHO NEVER HAD A CHANCE!  That was one of the great features of Evanovich's books previously.  She always had Stephanie regret death, even if it was in self-defense and even if the person was a jerk.  She made Stephanie lovable and here she just makes her callous.      Not to mention, she was saved by Sally showing up in a bus.  That was so contrived and silly.  And I am sick of this ridiculous Ranger/Morelli triangle.  Ranger is cool but not providing a future.  Stephanie isn't 19, she's 30!  As someone about to be turning that age in a few months, by this age I, and I daresay most young women my age, would not string along forever a guy they truly love who loves them so they can occasionally hook up with the dangerous guy.  In the first few books Steph is attracted to Ranger, but he is a side note and Morelli is the main focus and the tension between them is great.  I miss that.      Anyway, I'm going to get \\"Eleven on Top\\" at the library in hopes that Evanovich's editor had a talk with her and she will go back to writing the great books she used to.  I hear Stephanie temporarily quits her job and tries her hand at some new ones in \\"11\\" which sounds funny and I hope it has the humor and warmth of the earlier books.  I also am getting a little sick of Valerie, I wish they'd ship her off again.  And I agree with everyone who said Lula is good in small doses, but cannot dominate the story.  Nor can Grandma Mazur (I love her of course) etc.  Nor can Connie, or Valerie, or her endearing but annoying husband, or any of the other side characters.  Only Stephanie and Morelli can.  And show more of Stephanie's nemesis Joyce, I love all the revenge she gets on her!    Ms. Evanovich, we do love you, and you are talented, but this book was so bad I could barely get through it and in fact had to skip portions, when I used to savor every word.  What a tragedy!	2005-07-11
US	15142547	RQGH9J6JAHSOB	0140447423	368367935	Germinal (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Haunting, Amazing	This was such a wonderful and engrossing story that I couldn't put it down and had to get through all 524 pages in two days.  I already knew I loved Emile Zola from \\"The Dram Shop\\" and \\"Nana\\".  But this certainly deserves to be hailed as his great masterpiece. I was so caught up in the plight of these miners that I couldn't tear myself away.  It was very strange, I'd be doing something else but my mind would be on 19th Century miners in Northern France!  How many girls are at the supermarket worrying about that?<br /><br />Although the book takes place so long ago, it still has resonance and relevance today (which is shameful), and not just in the poorer countries, but within wealthy ones.  I don't think wage poverty has ever been so powerfully depicted.  The miners live enslaved in generational poverty, which results in undernourishment, disease, and the inability to cling to any dignity or self-respect.<br /><br /> Promiscuity, hunger, and suffering are evoked vividly for readers, and the wretchedness of the miners just increased our affection for them and we share all their emotions, which constantly change: resignation at a slavish, animal like existance; anger and fury at the wealthy, invisible shareholders who grow richer and richer at their lives of leisure while generations of children are fed to the mines to die early deaths and live wretched lives, and admiration that they manage to keep any familial affection amongst so much deprivation.<br /><br />Zola does an incredible job of juxtaposing the self-indulgent lives of the financially well-off, who are content to let miners starve while they feel self-righteous about giving them paltry handouts while they live off what is essentially slave labor.  It's pretty easy to see how the people would be caught up in a socialist fervor, and we feel the contempt the miners do at these useless leeches of society who look down their noses at people dying from dangerous fumes and unsafe working conditions, malnutritionand overwork.<br /><br />The story centers around a fatal strike by the miners, lead by the young Etienne Lantier, son of Gervaise, the alcoholic from \\"The Dram Shop\\".  It was truly horrifying and almost unbearable to read the way that the Company held their cruel and unwavering resolve to not give the miners a living wage in the face of so much grim suffering, and understandable that ultimately the miners become violent and depraved.  For more than two months they have almost no food and some starve to death, and I as a reader was haunted as I remembered that although this book is \\"fiction\\", episodes just like these really happened.<br /><br /> I won't give away the details of who dies and who kills whom and who has an affair with whom, because the edition I had tells you in the introduction, and I really think it's better to find out while reading the novel and not have it given away.  I will say there are many genuinely vivid, touching, evocative scenes, which despite their high drama are believable, in many cases based on actual events.<br /><br />This is a great novel from an artistic standpoint, but I also think we would all do well to learn about these kinds of workers' struggles from a century and a half ago, because we still have a lot to learn from them in a world where the gap between rich and poor grows ever wider.	2005-06-29

I have loved all the books in this series but this was a special favorite.  I know this sounds rather incredible, but everything one needs to know about the most redeeming aspects of human nature and how one should conduct oneself toward one's fellow man or woman is in these books!  Smith truly understands all the nuances of the human soul and his characters are so lovable, believable and heartwarming that these are the kinds of books you want to cherish forever.  They are spiritually uplifting and comforting in a way you can't imagine until you read them.   <br /> <br />Now, you may still not believe such people exist as the Mma Ramotswes of this world but they do. You will learn quite a bit about Botswana in these books, and Smith truly understands the dignity, humor, common sense and profound humanity of so many Africans-all we ever hear is the disaster stories, but I know several Africans intimately, and his portrayal is not a romanticizing, or an exoticizing, but quite accurate.  But more than that, these are just such humble characters anyone can identify with because they are just so human and kind and vulnerable.  <br /> <br /> This was one of my favorites because it had so many of the touching stories we've grown to love, and seemed to have a theme of redemption and forgiveness which was so beautiful.  The Ladies Detective Agency hires a man with a criminal record, Mr. Polopetsi, in yet another example of Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi's and Mr. J.L.B Matekoni's generous spirits.  Mma Ramotswe also has a terrible run in with a man who is very cruel to her (I won't give his identity away) but shows amazing forgiveness and charity.  And one of my favorite parts is when a girl is catty to the homely but adorable Mma Makutsi. <br /> <br />  Mma Makutsi's dignified response to this girl's taunting could be an example to us all.  It's so easy to want to respond to pettiness with pettiness but Mma Makutsi's response is nothing short of heroic!  Not to mention we seea new side of Charlie, the irresponsible mechanic. <br /> <br />And, of course, there are many hilarious scenes and you will chuckle out loud at them.  Mma Makutsi's dance partner with the two-left feet (a very touching story), the loving jokes and teasing between all the friends, and all kinds of humorous observations, such as Precious Ramotswe's musings on \\"things men like to think about\\" and other priceless insights into the male psyche.  <br /> <br /> My husband and I love this series and love the books, and I always tear up at the end-this book had a particularly happy, happy ending and you will be so pleased if you are a fan with this book's heartwarming conclusion.  These books are realistic, charming, and absolutely amazing for someone of any age-we're in our late twenties, but our parents also loved these books, and I really think anyone would, from fifteen to eighty. <br /> <br />  But they're not mysteries!!!  I have no idea why they are billed as such, and the classification may turn people away, who aren't  mystery fans.  These books are for...let's say, people fans!  People who look to celebrate the best in the human soul, when there's so much out there glorifying the worst.	2005-06-20

Dreiser truly knows how to weave a page-turner, as he proved with Sister Carrie.  You will find, despite this book's intimidating length and less than admirable subject, that you cannot put it down, nor can you help feeling sorry for Clyde, even if he's unbelievably callous.  This sympathy Dreiser evokes for Clyde, a very unsympathetic character, is one of the writer's great achievements. <br /> <br />The novel works on a second level, of course, which gives the novel historical importance.   <br /> <br />Basically, this engrossing tale of social climbing shows us the viciousness of a status-obsessed, capitalistic, back-biting, pre-Depression America.  Although (thank God) few of us could identify with Clyde, who will remind modern readers of Scott Peterson, with his unthinkable deed toward the pretty young woman expecting his child, most of us can identify with Clyde's hapless pursuit of the good life and his feverish attempts to escape his humble roots.   <br /> <br />It is a really fun read, and a really entertaining one.   You won't notice the length-you won't be able to put it down.  A very sad story, one that still has relevance today, as the gap between the poor and rich widens as I write. <br /> <br />	2005-06-03

I rarely listened to her, (I do now, always listen to your mother!)  so she read me the first few lines, and I had to pick it up: something about a girl of eighteen and how she might fare alone in nineteenth century Chicago intrigued me. There was a hint that she might go bad!  So of course I had to pick it up.  Besides, I'll read almost anything, which you can see from my various reviews.  I found I couldn't put it down. <br /> <br /> This is a great melodrama about a harsh and sprawling metropolis at the turn of the century, and like Dreiser's other work, it's also a story of the viciousness Darwinian nature of capitalism.  In this case, he looks at the story through the eyes of a pretty young woman who comes to the city by herself-young Carrie, called \\"sister Carrie\\" in homey fashion by her rural family, to show the sweet origins of what ultimately becomes a not-so-respectable woman. <br /> <br />Carrie, trying to become an \\"actress\\", relies on sexuality to survive.  It's suggested that she doesn't have much of a choice, and that everyone is for sale in the city.  Preyed on by more sophisticated men, she ultimately becomes successful in her own right.  This leaves us with a sort of confusion-we've grown to symapthize with Carrie and understand her behavior is a survival mechanism, but she is also callous and begins to change from victim to conniver.  At the end, we aren't sure whether to cheer her triumph, or feel bad for those she's left in her wake.   <br /> <br />Another entertaning, great Dreiser story that will teach you about American urban history, not to mention keep you turning the pages in great suspense as to what will become of lovely young Carrie.  Thanks, Mom!	2005-06-03

I can't tell you how many times I have used these recipes!  <br />This was one of the first cookbooks I got when I was married five years ago and my husband and I really didn't know how to cook.  It is a great cookbook for beginners, but really for anyone who wants a quick, tasty, healthy meal on the table very quickly.  <br /> <br /> Most recipes have very simple instructions, require few ingredients or equpiment, and are extremely user friendly.  Plus, there is quite a bit of variety and plenty of great ideas.  One thing I really liked was that the book provided cooking charts of ideal times to cook chicken, beef, and pork.  As a beginning chef, this is very valuable, because you're pretty intimidated with meat and afraid you'll food poison yourself!   <br /> <br />Not to mention, there is nutrition information for all the recipes, which I always find important.  If you are health or weight conscious, you'll appreciate that most of the recipes in here are actually quite low in calories, and very healthy.  You can simply replace some of the ingredients with low-fat dairy ones to make them even more so.  Most recipes serve about four people, so you may want to double them if you have a large family. <br /> <br />  Also, there are do-ahead recipes which I'm always on the lookout for, so you can cook a few up in advance and freeze them, and I've found these to be very reliable.  It's a great cookbook for busy people, amateur chefs, and just anyone who likes tasty and quick meals.  It's paid for itself many times over.  You know those cookbooks you get home and there's only one recipe you can use and even with that one it asks you to use items you don't own and buy some spice you can't find?  This is NOT one of those cookbooks, thank goodness.  Most things can be made effortlessly.	2005-06-03

It's extremely well-written, sensitive, and demonstrates a wealth of knowledge about African cultures, politics, religions, economies, gender relations, and, in one of the best chapters in the book, literature.  You don't often see such a skillful sketch of the impressive African novels and poems that have been written in the past few generations. <br /> <br />  This is the perfect book to assign to students who have no exposure to anything African (which, unfortunately, is most undergraduates).  Although it's an introduction to the topic, those who know a great deal about it will find that almost all of it resonates with the other literature they have read, whether historical, political, or otherwise.  It's a very compassionate and progressive look at Africa.  All modern challenges to the continent are presented so that students get a multi-dimensional look at Africa's struggles.  Environmental and agricultural problems are presented in tandem with economic and political ones, so that students will have a real context in which to put all future readings about Africa.  But unlike so many African books, the text provides sections such as the one on literature, to show that Africa has many achievements, instead of focusing only on negativity, as unfortunately many books on the topic do.  At the same time, it does not gloss over the tragedies on the continent and their causes, and difficult topics such as the AIDS crisis are treated in a sensitive manner. <br /> <br />It is a great book and I can't imagine there's one better out there.  However, were I to make suggestions to the editors they would be the following: <br /> <br />1. The historical section could be slightly larger.  The historical context is dealt with in one chapter, and yet a more extensive discussion of certain historical events would help students better understand some of the continent's present difficulties. <br /> <br />2. The literature section could be extended to include popular culture, music, every day entertainments, festivals, etc.  Students would enjoy some additional stories showing the richness of so many African cultures.  Although the literature section does this, it could do so more thoroughly.   <br /> <br />3. The economic section would benefit from more success stories.  Although it has an excellent discussion of the crushing debt burden and the role of international financial institutions in African economies, which students must know about, it would help to see some dicussions not just of how local business and initiative is stifled, but descriptions of these businesses. <br /> <br />  I've read some fascinating things about African entrepreneurship and ingenuity in industry against all kinds of odds.  Although many of these efforts were stifled by the state, I think students would benefit from knowing about dynamic efforts such as these. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />3	2005-05-20

I am not going to pretend that I didn't enjoy this book, (actually, based on its length and the time it took to read it was more like a pamphlet) but I'm not going to pretend it wasn't a pile of poop, either.  I guess that's the paradox of some of the latest V.C. books the ghostwriter churns out every six months.  (And I, like an idiot, spend $7.99 on when it'll all be at someone's garage sale next month.) <br /> <br />   Nothing that happens in this book is even remotely possible in anything vaguely resembling the human world as any of us know it.  Although I'm touched at Willow's mother's vulnerability and feel bad for her, and although I allowed myself to suspend disbelief for the duration of the pamphlet and be sad about her tragic love affair with Claude, come on.  That relationship NEVER MADE SENSE!  It was so implausible, even by V.C. Andrews' bizarre standards.  Here are the reasons: <br /> <br />Number one, although psychiatrists do sleep with their patients, I just cannot believe that those with any professional integrity do!  Claude is continually presented as this beacon of virtue, a man who loves his work above all else.  Would a man like that sleep with a severely disturbed young woman under his care (and, incidentally, not ensure she is using birth control)?  Is that the best treatment available for her?!   Is that smart?  He tells us that he just loves her so much, he can't help it.  That's unbelievably silly.  Adults know that sex isn't some uncontrollable thing-you actually can hold back if it's unprofessional, exploitive, adulterous-this one is all three. <br /> <br />2. Why, why, please tell me why, is Claude married to such a wretched woman?  I just cannot have any respect for such a man.  While he's \\"working overtime\\" at his clinic, there's an evil wife at home.  WHY?  I really also can't respect Claude for having stayed with this woman when he knew he didn't love her, cheated on her instead of having the courage to get a divorce, and ultimately subject his innocent daughter to an abusive stepmother who was constantly and inexplicably cruel to her.  Why would you do that to someone you love?  They act like he had no control over that, when clearly he did. <br /> <br />3. How could he abandon Willow's mother like that?  I'm sorry, that part ALSO has never made sense, since the very beginning of the series, from Willow, book #1.  There's just no good excuse why you would impregnate your supposed \\"true love\\" and then decide, because you \\"value your career so much\\" (so much you violate its principles in a way most psychiatrists would find abhorrent), you will abandon her and go back to an evil wife.  But, take the baby with you?   <br /> <br />It's still an entertaining book though, I can't tell you why.  These books are like crack to me.  I want to stop buying them and enjoying them, but I can't!  Help!	2005-05-20

It's just so creepy, so engrossing, so much fun.  It also has an odd and compelling beauty and powerfully evokes the passing of time, the dynamics of a deeply dysfunctional family, and the fractured character of a young woman who must come to terms with the bizarre reality of her life-if she can find out what that is.  Audrina is a strong, sympathetic, interesting character, and all the characters in the book are well drawn and very intriguing.  Audrina is one of the most admirable characters Andrews ever created-she is compassionate, courageous, and a true survivor.  I think she's also the nicest of the Andrews' characters.  I really like her. <br /> <br />  I first read this book at 13,and I didn't guess the ending, and was utterly shocked, but I've reread it since and I think adults would.  Actually I know adults would-I lent it to some, and they figured it out, but still enjoyed the story.  I won't give it away here though. <br /> <br />This book tells the story of Audrina, who is a beautiful child born to a ruined Southern aristocratic family (they never explain how it was ruined), living in a run down mansion with her older cousin Vera, her father Damian, her mother Lucietta and her aunt Ellsbeth. These are the characters in the beginning, although more come into the story over the course of 400 pages.  As usual, most of the characters are in possession of movie-star looks, except aunt Ellsbeth, who is somewhat frumpy, but mostly by choice. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is Vera, which may surprise readers.  Hey, I'm not excusing her actions, and I would not want to know her in real life, but I love her!  She is the most perverse, bizarre, cruel, violent, unrealistic character in all of Andrews' books.  For that matter, in a lot of books.  There cannot possibly be anyone like this in real life.  Come on.  It was a little silly.  <br /> <br />But the fact that she's not credible doesn't take away our interest in her.  How can there be anyone like this?  You enjoy watching her obsession with sex, (she definitely gives us some of the weirdest sex-scenes to grace an Andrews book), her inexcusable torturing of Audrina, her gory miscarriage scene, her vicious acts against just about everyone she meets, but also, somehow, Andrews' also makes us feel bad for her.  That's a real accomplishment.  And, Vera's kind of funny.  In a disgusting way. <br /> <br />  She had been completely neglected and abused from her earliest days and made to feel inferior to Audrina in every imaginable way, so as Audrina says, her father \\"made her what she is.\\"  We don't blame her for resenting Audrina, although as I said, most of what she does as a result is just too dramatic for me to buy.  But, I still feel sorry for both her and Audrina.  No one is paying proper attention to these girls and they are living in a mad house!!!  <br /> <br />After Vera, I most enjoy the character of the bitter yet sensible and ultimately kind-hearted aunt, Ellsbeth.  She, like Vera, also has a weird gallows humor, but we admire the way she stands up for Audrina.  At first she appears to be only self-interested and scheming, but then can't help but admire the persevering Audrina's attempts to disengage from her father's pathological and smothering control.  I don't think we've ever seen anyone like her in Andrews', and it's hard not to sympathize with her getting the short end of the stick in life while her sister, the greatest beauty on the East Coast, gets all the attention. (this symbolically duplicates the Audrina/Vera relationship-although Vera is described as very pretty and sexy, Audrina has the \\"unearthly\\" beauty that all Andrews' heroines do, plus, she's acknowledged by the family, while Vera is constantly told she's unwanted.) <br /> <br />Lucietta, another likeable character, fights with Ellsbeth a great deal, though she too has been cheated out of what she wanted most-in her case, a music career.  Her \\"Tuesday Tea Times\\" are some ofthe funniest episodes Andrews' ever created.  During these times, Audrina's mother and Aunt get dressed up, channel their dead sister, and \\"invite\\" her photo to tea while they insult each other and get drunk.  Pretty fun, eh? <br /> <br />Then there's Arden, Audrina's long suffering suitor.  A lot of people don't like Arden, but I do.  He makes a lot of mistakes, but they are all human and understandable under the circumstances.  He truly loves Audrina, but isn't sure how to help her. Although, we all have to wonder why everyone doesn't just tell her what's up and get her some real therapy.  However, since no one will do that, Arden does what he can.   <br />Arden's handicapped mother, Billie, is also an extremely lovable character and one of the warmest in the story.  She's a nurturer and we're glad someone is treating Audrina to some real attention. <br /> <br />Sylvia, Audrina's developmentally disabled younger sister, is another likable character.  Although her problems seem so drastic that they doubt she will be able to ever take care of her own most rudimentary needs, she turns out to be a fiercely loyal and willful character.   <br /> <br />Damian, Audrina's father, is also a very well-drawn, very well-developed character.  He's also the only character I really despise.  A controlling narcissist, he is a womanizer who neglects his responsibilities, feels the need to completely control the women in his life, stifles their hopes and aspirations, beats Lucietta, and may be responsible for Sylvia's disabilities.  Physically, he is a handsome, tall, commanding man; he is also charming and seductive.  Ironically, he is the most \\"crippled\\" of the family, although his problems don't manifest themselves overtly like Billie's, (she lost her legs), Sylvia's, Vera's (one leg is shorter than the other due to repeated fractures), etc.  <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Damian's character, though, even though I was pretty disgusted with him.  A lot of women like jerks,(I'm not one ofthem), so his control over the women around him seemed plausible.  But after awhile, everyone's obsession with getting Damian's approval gets tiring-Ellsbeth wants him to praise her cooking, Arden wants him to admire his business skills, Vera wants him to praise her, Billie wants the same, blah blah blah.   <br /> <br />That's why Audrina is the true heroine of the book, because ultimately she doesn't care about pleasing her father, just about healing herself.  Whether or not she physically separates from him is irrelevant-emotionally, she has fought for real knowlege of herself, and won it, and she has learned to stand on her own two feet.  It's the most complex character study Andrews' has ever done. <br /> <br />	2005-05-20

It was just so funny.  In this book, Dawn, who already strikes me as an idiot, becomes even more moronic.  Sent to a theater school to develop her supposedly extraordinary singing talent (this was pre-American Idol days),  Dawn decides that she will put out for her voice instructor Michael. <br /> <br />  I have to say, this is the most ridiculous relationship that ever made it to a book under the V.C. Andrews' name.  V.C. always had her heroines only sleep with men who were utterly obsessed with them.  But here, the ghost writer has teenage Dawn give it up for the most transparently sleazy guy I could imagine.   <br /> <br />It's kind of gross just thinking about it.  Dawn should have been able to see through Michael's trite phrases and unbelievably cheesy lines about how special Dawn is and how she's his muse and a bunch of other crap.    Ok, teenagers are dumb, and I was too, and fortunately I didn't have a handsome, world-famous singer repeatedly trying to get into my pants.  (Only because none were around, not because anything was wrong with me!!!!!)  <br /> <br /> But usually Andrews' characters are pretty smart even at that age, so I was really disappointed.  Well, not when I read it.   I was about Dawn's age at the time-I thought, \\"why don't I know a world-famous singer I can have an affair with?\\"  But now, as an adult, I think, Dawn was an idiot.  That's why I feel so bad for pregnant teenagers.  It really isn't their fault, but their naivete is so painful to witness.   <br /> <br />Dawn has a few ridiculous nights of passion with Michael and they have Thanksgiving together.  Then, being an idiot, Dawn gets pregnant, because apparently birth control wasn't something she thought a highschooler would want to use.  Michael, predictably, abandons her.  So she ends up prisoner with a religious fanatic relative being tortured.  It's all reallyfun, except unbelievably stupid.  So after hearing this, decide for yourself if you can stomach its plot.  It's not exactly a touching love story! <br /> <br />	2005-05-19
US	15142547	R2JFQBSPC6BPDN	0671670689	837339470	Dawn	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Inferior	Let me first say that I'm not one of those people who hate the ghostwriter who wrote this book, as so many other Andrews fans are. As a matter of fact, although I prefer the books Andrews wrote herself, I've enjoyed a lot of the books Niederman wrote under her name. <br /> <br />   I've read them all and been entertained by them all, even this one. When I first read it I was in 9th grade. I read it right after it came out and I remember being capitvated by it on the bus ride home.  Then, of course I reread it (that's what teenagers do with Andrews' books). <br /> <br />However, this was one of the most insipid that he wrote, which is not to say that you shouldn't read it, just that its stupidity will anger you.  Actually, it was the first of the new series that he created-supposedly \\"inspired\\" as the disclaimer says, by \\"incomplete stories\\" V.C. had somewhere before her death.  I don't know about you, but I've always found the vageness of that claim a little convienient.  Where are these stories?  How many were there?  Be specific!   <br /> <br />Anyway, this story is about a weird Cathy (Flowers in the Attic)/Heaven mix.  Bacially, trying to not disappoint fans, Niederman thought a composite of all the heroines Andrews had created would satisfy.  (Except Audrina-I don't think Audrina comes up.  I love Audrina BTW).  But it doesn't work because Dawn doesn't have a developed story/character of her own that's believable, it's like someone just cut and paste from \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", \\"Heaven\\" and \\"Dark Angel\\" to make her story.  <br /> <br /> In some cases, sentences are taken word for word from Flowers in the Attic-for instance, creepily enough, when Dawn is raped by her brother, Niederman uses the exact same sentence to describe it as Andrews had Cathy use to describe HER rape by HER brother!  (Something disgusting about \\"my resistant flesh tearing and bleeding\\" ).  Niederman thinks that if the same experiences happen to Dawn that did to the other characters, we'll somehow be convinced.  But the magic of Andrews was that she invented new demented abuses/relatives for each heroine!   Be creative! <br /> <br />Like Cathy, Dawn is blonde, has an evil grandmother, has a brother obsessed with her-wait, two brothers obsessed with her-her \\"foster brother\\" and her biological brother.  She's in love with the former and attracted to the latter for a time period.  Until she knows it's her brother!  Unlike Andrews', Niederman does not want to take that crazy step where people KNOW it's their relative-and don't care!!!  (Cathy and Chris and Heaven and Troy kept at it despite knowing they were blood related). <br />Like Cathy, she also has religious fanatic relatives. <br /> <br />Like Heaven, Dawn is raised by poor white rural people who turn out not to be her biological parents.  And I don't remember exactly, but I think Dawn's foster parents took money to raise her from her biological parents, which is reminiscent of when Heaven's father sold the kids, except in reverse, because money was given to poor people to raise a rich child, for stupid reasons that will later be revealed. <br /> <br />Dawn's biological mother is a duplicate of \\"Dark Angel's\\" Jillian, Heaven's maternal grandmother, whose shallow obsession with her own beauty makes her a ridiculous character.  Like both Dawn and Heaven, Dawn finds out she is actually part of some insanely wealthy family that lives in an enormous estate that has a name.  (This is also like Audrina, actually.  Do you know anyone whose house has a name?  Me neither, and I've met a lot of rich people.  But that was always something fun V.C. did that Niederman continues.  Very Gone With the Wind). <br /> <br />Anyway, as you can tell from all this convoluted nonsense this is a ridiculous book with an undeveloped character.  But that's just my opinion! <br /> <br />	2005-05-19

This was the first book I read by him and I'm going to go get whatever else is available.  This excellent story, written in 1958, is still tremendously amusing-and oddly poignant-today.  Somehow, Greene combines the absurd, humor, suspense, romance, and some reflections on the pointlessness of unthinking nationalism-all in less than 200 pages.  This was one of the funniest books I've read recently, and in ways that the reader won't anticipate.  <br /> <br /> The hero, Wormold, is living in Havana with his daughter selling vacuum cleaners.  In one of the many priceless scenes in the book, he is hired to be a British spy in a bathroom in a hilarious episode that's part Kafka and part Monty Python. Wormold doesn't particularly care about the Cold War, but he really loves his beautiful and charming daughter, Milly, whose mother abandoned them both years ago.  Milly could use a horse, among other things, and so Wormold agrees to be a spy-of a sort.  But then he starts reporting elaborate lies back to his boss, and the fun-and disaster-ensues!   Somehow, over the course of the book, Wormold unexpectedly turns from a pitiful middle aged man into someone we really like. <br /> <br />Truly a great read!	2005-05-17

This story is the tragic tale of a pathetic, old, doting father and his martyrdom.  Goriot spoils his awful, frivilous, vain, and ungrateful daughters throughout this book while they ignore and manipulate him.  The daughters are so terrible you can't help laughing a little at Goriot's pitiful way of fawning over them and putting them above even his most basic needs.  <br /> <br /> They demand all the best in life while allowing their father to live in poverty and need.  They ask him for luxuries when he barely has enough to survive on.  His concept of paternal duty is nothing less than inspirational, and even though he is pitiful, we can't help loving him and admiring him despite his irritating messanic complex. <br /> <br />  Balzac is just such a fun, rich, witty writer and his characters are so engrossing.   He's so adept at pointing out the self-absorption and frivolity of so many figures from his time, and making you feel bad for their victims.  I think any modern reader would enjoy him as much as they would-really more-than most contemporary writers.  I think there should be a revival of the popularity of books like these because they're just so much more intriguing than so many present day stories.	2005-05-06

Anyway, after watching the show in repeats and live for years I was very interested in the cast, particularly my favorites (whether they were my favorites on the show or later through their film/comedy careers): Bill Murray, Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy, Al Franken, Phil Hartman, Michael Myers, Dana Carvey, Dan Akryroid (sp?) and many others.    <br /> <br />I really did enjoy the book, and so will anyone else who is a fan of the show/cast.  It's rather amazing how much drama was going on behind the scenes, and fun to learn about what the guest stars were \\"really\\" like, and about the creepy mystery that is Lorne Michaels, a man who finds it nearly impossible to give any real approval or positive feedback to his employees, and yet has to inspire your respect because he *is* SNL.  As Chris Rock says, it's his show. <br /> <br />  There were sensitive and moving parts, like Chris Rock talking about how he felt when Chris Farley died, or Bill Murray talking about how much he loved Gilda Radner, or Jan Hooks talking about how she felt when Phil Hartman died, or Jim Belushi talking about his late brother.  Yes, the show has seen a lot of tragedy and the book doesn't try to hide that. <br /> <br />  There were also great dishy moments, like when we found out Chevy Chase is a jerk and made homophobic and sexist comments on the set, and that Stephen Segal is even more of an idiot than you might think (the segment on his guest-hosting is priceless), or how whiny Janeaine Garofalo was on the show.  I liked her in \\"Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion\\" and some other stuff , and maybe she was just at a bad point in her life, but she did have a terrible attitude when she was there.    Other people that want to blame SNL that they weren't funny on the show are Jon Lovitz, for example. I know a lot of people who like him from the Critic, like my husband, but I think he was terrible.  <br /> <br />Some of the parts of the book upset me, though, because listening to some of these guys talk you realize that many (not all, especially not my favorites that I listed at the beginning!) of the writers/cast members/guests are shallow, self-absorbed, and bitter.  They seem to really enjoy having the opportunity to put everyone down here and air their dirty laundry rather than share positive experiences.  Some of the commentaries are by complete jerks and that is why this book loses a star.  One of them claimed that women are simply genetically less prone to being funny, which really made me steam.  Maybe he was just trying to annoy women, whatever, but it worked.  (I blame the presence of Janeane on the show when women as funny as I am are around and could have been used!) <br /> <br />There was also the part where we found out how bitchy everyone was to Victoria Jackson, which made me mad, and other general unnecessary nastiness and broken ruined friendships.  Not to mention jealousy.  There was a lot of obvious jealousy that some people left the show and had Adam Sandler's/Chris Rock's/Bill Murray's career and some people left the show and we don't know their names anymore, or the only  thing they did recently was \\"Master of Disguise\\", one of the worst-reviewed movies in memory. <br /> <br />So it was a bittersweet experience and I wish I didn't know some of the details (e.g., Dana Carvey started to resent Michael Myers, presumably because despite Dana's arguably equal talent Myers became more successful; my knowing this taints Wayne's World!) but overall much recommended, and a lot of fun to read.	2005-05-06

It was successful both as a thrilling story and as a devastating commentary on the plight of the Parisian working class in the nineteenth century (although I am sure that it still has a lot of validity).  You can't help getting drawn into the story-and you won't be able to put the book down-I don't think it aged at all.   <br /> <br />Gervaise is a heroine you can't help rooting for.  She's poor and hardworking, and like the other proletariat in the story, often referred to by her profession-laundress.  She wants a better life for herself after her lover abandons her with their two sons.  Pretty and industrious, she soon gets a suitor, who works on roofs.  She doesn't want to give in to his advances because she doesn't want any more illegitimate children to deal with on her own. <br /> <br />However, her suitor has noble intentions and marries her.  They so want the dignity and security of middle-class life that you ache for them.  At at first they seem able to achieve it.  They work hard, save, and begin to have a nice home and a happy marriage.  However, when Gervaise's husband has a tragic accident, we soon realize how precarious working class life is-then, as it still inexcusably is NOW.  Without his income, Gervaise will be living very precariously. <br /> <br />The real tragic pull of the story is that they almost made it-but then this accident plunges them into all kinds of problems-financial ruin, and ultimately alcoholism, adultery, broken health, and misery.  It was so sad to see this family once desperately clinging to decency when all odds were against them, and then surrendering to poverty and humiliation, filth and addiction.  I loved this book so much, and found its ending so sad and haunting.   <br /> <br />I had to get the sequel, about Gervaise's ill-fated daughter \\"Nana\\", who becomes a courtesan, which is kind of predictable since she was so neglected and happened to be beautiful so she had a way out of her poverty-at least temporarily.  (Gervaise's son is the hero of Germinal).  It was good, but not as good as this.  I think this is a magnificent book, and Zola at his best.	2005-05-06

Wretched Bette dies loved and valued.  You will have a lot of fun reading this book and enjoying-and getting disgusted with-all the characters.	2005-05-06

This book seems a major betrayal of its predecessors, \\"Heaven\\" and \\"Dark Angel\\", perhaps because it was the first one written by the ghostwriter.  The plot revolves around 1) Troy not \\"really\\" being dead, 2) Logan cheating on Heaven with Fanny, 3) Heaven and Logan moving into Farthy 4) Heaven trying to resolve her issues with Luke by adopting his son with his third wife. <br /> <br />None of these four things should ever, ever have happened.  For one thing, reviving Troy is so soap-opera and so ridiculous it strains credulity.  \\"Dark Angel\\" ended with Heaven realizing she wanted to marry her childhood sweetheart, Logan, who loved her back when she was hill scum and not an heiress.  It was a sweet realization and we were all happy and content that her saga ended well.  Now, she's presented again with her Troy, the silly, girly character from Dark Angel who we wished really was dead. <br /> <br />Second, why did Logan sleep with Fanny?  That was so unnecessary.  Andrews makes it clear in \\"Heaven\\" that he is uninterested in her exhibitionism and avoids her.  It seemed such a betrayal of their marriage and of the sweet relationship between the two which had been previously established.  There was another unfaithful husband created by Andrews herself-Arden in \\"My Sweet Audrina\\"-but in Arden's defense, Audrina wouldn't sleep with him.  Logan wasn't that sort of character and had more inner strength besides.  <br /> <br />Third, why would Heaven, knowing Tony raped her mother and is a crazy old pervert, move into Farthy?  Why would sensible Logan?  They were asking for problems.   <br /> <br />Fourth, why did Heaven need to adopt Luke's son?  I thought that was out of character for her, odd, and unattractive.  Her \\"buying\\" the kid from Fanny didn't reflect well on her, either.  <br /> <br />A big, big failure.  Stop after \\"Dark Angel\\" because this book will really disappoint.  Its sequel is even worse, and I made the mistake of reading that, too.  Stop while you're ahead!	2005-05-05

At first, I was drawn into the story.  The narrator of the story (this book is based on the experiences of the author, according to the back of the book anyway) is a college-age girl who takes an au-pair job with a \\"minorly aristocratic famiy\\" in the U.K. <br /> <br />This family, and their friends, are the most wretched, elitist, sniveling, snooty, classist, pompous, ridiculous excuses for human beings I had ever encountered in my entire life.  <br /> <br /> I could hardly bear to hear about them without becoming furious.  The matriarch of the family was incessently berating the young narrator for nothing, putting her down for being American, for being gauche, for not knowing you don't peel \\"new potatoes\\", for wanting to urinate in private, giving her dirty cold bathwater four other people had used first, insulting her lineage, exploiting her and underpaying her, etc. <br /> <br />  It was so disgusting.  Even the kids, except the youngest one who sounded adorable (whose mother tells the narrator she wished she had known would be deaf so she could have aborted her), are awful.  Even characters you think you'll be sympathetic to, like the cockney Nanny, buy into the repulsive and oppressive class rules of British society to such a degree that they berate the narrator for not knowing and embracing them. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book at first because I kept waiting for the narrator to finally say something.  When she is deliberately slighted for no reason other than being an American by the friends of the family she works for, she says nothing.  When \\"Nanny\\" says something startlingly racist, she says nothing (does this mean the author of the book endorsed these views?  She portrays \\"Nanny\\" as lovable, and doesn't seem to find this a character flaw.  That really bothered me.).  She finally says something once to her employer when her employer is abusive to her little deaf girl, but it's too little too late.   <br /> <br />The spinelessness of the narrator was appalling.  I suppose she thinks writing the book is the best revenge, but I doubt it.  The worst part of the book started around the middle where we're supposed to care about inane subplots.  <br /> <br /> One, narrator has a fiance she doesn't really want to marry.  She falls in love with a nerd devoid of any charm or personality, and I think we're supposed to be excited about it, but it's just gross.  \\"Simon\\", her new boyfriend, takes her to watch monkeys mate in a cage and she's turned on by this.  Maybe this is how British men court women, but I couldn't respect an American who succumbed to it.  Two, she takes up cooking and gets fat.  Who cares? <br /> <br />The one good thing about this book was that it made me realize that for all our faults, Americans could NEVER be as superior and condescending as the British.  <br /> <br /> We would never dream of actually looking down on someone because they can't trace their lineage back to the eleventh century.  It's so completely opposed to our cultural values, and yet in this book, something that irrelevant to someone's present-day character is used to berate the narrator with by a Brit who feels superior because of his lineage.  Yuck!  This book takes place NOW!  I can't believe people still think like that.  But now I know where to find them. <br /> <br />Thank God we had that Revolution is all I can say!	2005-05-05

For one thing, her research is impeccable.  It's amazing the amount of reading she did to prepare this book; so many of the details she includes are from obscure memoirs that she must have spent years preparing. <br /> <br />Amazingly, she combines all her erudition to make a book that shows so much empathy for her famous main characters-Robespierre, Danton and Desmoulins-and is so entertaining that you hardly feel you're reading a work of real history, although I would say it is, despite being called a novel.  Obviously there is poetic license taken, but overall it is astoundingly insightful to the nuances, mores, personalities of the times.  This is a book that truly understands the eighteenth-century mentality, the passion and torments unleashed by the Revolution, and the fact that it was a very scary time to live in indeed.  <br /> <br /> I especially want to thank Mantel for giving the much reviled Robespierre some real humanity.  Yes, he made some pretty big mistakes-but he is a sympathetic figure, and Mantel skillfully demonstrates this.  Perhaps more than any other figure of the Revolution he deserves contextualization-a man of his times, he was subject to its glories and its constraints.  Deeply idealistic yet deeply flawed, he is best understood as deluded rather than evil. <br /> <br />But more importantly...I love this book!  It does read like a novel even if it is history, and even if you know or care nothing for the Revolution you will want to know the fates of these fully developed characters.	2005-05-05

His labored attempts at understating everything, his affected grittiness, his belief in himself as adventurer and someone who truly experiences life all make me want to throw up.  This book is the perfect example of how terrible he is.   I'll give you some examples from within the book so you can think about it a little more. <br /> <br /> Number one is Brett.  The \\"heroine\\" of the book, she is a heartless 34-year old nymphomaniac who is self-absorbed and callous, not to mention elitist and stupid.  The \\"hero\\" of the book, manly man Jake, \\"loves\\" her.  What a great love story.  Jake is too \\"injured\\" to make love to her, so she sleeps with a number of other people during the book.   Number two is Cohn.  This character, created out of the author's anti-semitic imagination, is a simpering bookish fool who, the narrator lets us know, is too cowardly to enjoy things like bullfights.  Only a manly man would enjoy the spectacle of a matador being gored by a tortured animal, of course. <br /> <br />Cohn is apparently equally contemptable because he wants to hang out with gentiles (How DARE he?!), but Jake is magnanimous enough to let him.  Brett is magnanimous enough to sleep with him, but looks down on him for being a Jew.  (Lovely people, aren't they?).  Hemingway wants us to revile Cohn because he took the affair with Brett too seriously and actually got jealous when she slept with someone else.  We're supposed to laugh at Cohn's emotionality and inability to be a wasp.   <br /> <br />I can't tell you how pointless this book is.  What's the moral?  Is there one?  I don't think there is.  If a book isn't engrossing, or exciting, or beautifully written (therefore art for art's sake) it has to have a message.  This book fails on all counts.	2005-05-05

This is a good book for non-specialists, which explains with good writing and apt analogies to other troubled nation-projects (namely in Eastern Europe) how Africa did in fact have many indigenous nationalisms prior to colonial rule, which were thwarted and distorted by the imposed shackle of the national boundaries drawn by outsiders who knew nothing of Africa's own traditions, people, or nations.<br /><br />Many I've spoken to who do not have even the most rudimentary knowledge of Africa (most people that is!) are shocked when I tell them that the boundaries of all modern African nations were drawn at a conference in 1884 in Berlin with no Africans present, based on the geo-strategic concerns of the imperial powers, NOT on any linguistic/cultural unity in the territories created.  But this basic fact, so crucial to understanding the fundamental problems facing 20th and 21st century Africa, deserves repeating, and nowhere have I seen any author treat it with as much concern and care as Davidson.<br /><br />Davidson's contribution to African history cannot be overstated; he has over the years earned the affection and trust of many Africans, who trust him perhaps more than they do any other European to write their history.  More than most Europeans, Davidson emphatically and repeatedly asserts that Africa has the history and tools to build successful political entities based on their own values, not those imposed on them from outside.  They did so prior to colonial rule, and they can in the future.  Davidson is a treasure and this book is as well.	2005-05-05

It was as soothing and unchallenging as an episode of Law and Order.  There was a villain you could feel very good about wanting to get caught-he was so evil you really wanted him to be, too.  And it's always fun reading about the crimes of an honestly wretched character. <br /> <br />The best thing about this book is that its hero was memorable, which is pretty rare with these sorts of thrillers.  Abe Glitsky-half-black, half-Jewish, hardened police detective of San Francisco-is really likable and unique.  That's definitely the key to making a successful franchise-creating a recurring character people like.  So, please buy this book and dive in, it's perfect for the airplane, train ride, or whatever other thing you have to do that you'll need to be distracted from.	2005-05-05

One of the main ones is that it's immensely readable and enjoyable, and it definitely holds your attention and makes you want to know the ending, although the book is quite sad.  Another of the qualities that recommend it is the sensitive portrayal the author devotes to depicting the changed position of many African women after the labor and family transformations that took place during colonialism.  <br /> <br /> The degraded heroine of the book is contrasted with her mother's fiery independence.  Emecheta's main character suffers because her husband feels degraded by the \\"effeminate\\" labor his colonist employers foist on him (laundry) and takes it out on her; she is also oppressed because her entire worth is based on her child bearing capacities-or at least that's what she's told.  Although she eventually has an enormous family, they repay her with ingratitude and she dies miserable.  Ironically, women suffering with infertility pray to her after her death-they think she can help them because of her fecundity-and they are unrewarded. <br /> <br />However, I do have some problems with the book.  This is not a subtle portrait and does read like a melodrama.  The characters are not very nuanced and that there might be diversity in women's experiences is not suggested, although Ibo women (Emecheta is Ibo and so are the characters in this story) and men had and have a variety of different roles and relationships.  Here, women are victims, men are oppressors.  There IS a way to portray women's marginalization without one-dimensional characters.  <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of this is due to Emecheta's feelings, which she has expressed at various times, of a certain degree of contempt for her own culture.   While some feel she is a \\"traitor\\" for revealing injustices that Africans commit against one another, I certainly don't think that's a valid criticism.  Wonderful books have been written by Africans dealing with African perpetrators committing crimes against African victims.  However, her one-sided approach detracts from the strengths of her novel and from the realism it attempts.	2005-05-05

This was such a laughably bad book, though.  But not in a good way.  Someone wrote here in one of the reviews that it was good because it was only supposed to be a mindless trashy read and accomplished it. <br /> <br />NO, NO, NO!  Anyone who picks up this book WANTED a mindless trashy read and we wouldn't be insulting the book if we had gotten it in the first place!  No one goes to Joan for great litterature.  Come on.  But it failed miserably, and I'm speaking as someone who enjoyed one of her other books.  For one thing, the brief book tries to cover \\"four generations\\" of women. <br /> <br />There is not enough time spent on any of the characters for us to care too much about them.  Nothing happens to them that makes us care, either.  There's no love story, nothing.  I could barely pay attention.  And by the way, no sex scenes of any note, just brief and clinical descriptions of stuff.  Basically, four beautiful women become famous and have problems.  But no interesting love affairs.  I can't tell you how boring and bad this book was.	2005-05-05
US	15142547	R2CC9E4BD27Y4O	0671729454	447092407	If There Be Thorns	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Good, but...	This book should have ended the saga (the prequel should have come right after it) because it resolves the fates of all the major characters (do we really need to have a Seeds of Yesterday to find out what happened to Uncle Joel and Cindy?!) <br /> <br />It is a good read like all the Andrews' books, however, I have to give some warnings to potential readers out there.  It is not written from the perspective of a woman!  I know, that is really a shocker because it is the only V.C. Andrews book that is not narrated by a female.  It's a bit weird when you're so used to reading her books told from the female perspective-this is told by Cathy's sons who are 14 and 9.  Jory is the \\"good\\" son and Bart, conceived in \\"evil\\" circumstances, is a demented young boy who seems to want to embody all the creepy traits of his late great-grandfather. <br /> <br />I think it was a necessary tale because we need to find out what happens to Corrine, who did not die at the end of the previous book.  We can't just leave her in the mental hospital.  We need Chris and Cathy to have closure.  However, despite the book's success at being engrossing and entertaining, we wish Cathy was telling it.  I still think it should have been told by her, I didn't like this stylistic deviation.  It's her story.  I'm not sure Andrews' is as good as getting inside little boys' heads as she is little girls'.  Understandable, of course, given her gender, but she should have stuck with what she knew. <br /> <br />  However, I was happy with the conclusion and I think you will be too.  Corrine has a chance to redeem herself which I think is important.	2005-05-03
US	15142547	R2THCDBOQISPNK	067100767X	187648547	Rain (Hudson Family)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Recommended	I liked this book because it took on new ground.  V.C. Andrews had demonstrated in books like \\"Petals on the Wind\\" that she was very much opposed to racial discrimination.  I thought it was a wonderful aside Cathy makes in \\"Petals on the Wind\\" about how Henny taught her that all human beings had the same feelings, fears and hopes regardless of color. <br /> <br />  Therefore, readers can be confident that the ghostwriter is taking on issues that were important to Andrews.  Furthermore, it's refreshing not to have a blue-eyed, blonde, southern white belle for once.  It was also a well-written story and much of it was surprisingly sensitive and intelligent.  I'm glad the ghostwriter decided to engage race relations.  Furthermore, what better modern setting for the V.C. Andrews fairy-tale: girl grows up poor, finds out she has a rich relative.  This time it's recast in a racial light, which is a very intriguing twist, and the V.C. Andrews themes seem made for it: rich relatives won't accept poor relative born out of illicit liason because of class mixing.  Race can easily be added on.  Rain has a black father and a white mother. <br /> <br />That being said, however, some of the topics were treated a bit superficially and there were some stereotypes.  The early scenes where Rain is growing up in the ghetto are full of them.  It's sort of a mish-mash of things we see on TV and doesn't ring true of any personal experience.  Rain's foster mother is the quintessential long-suffering poor black woman desperately trying to keep the family together; her brother, although one of my favorite characters, is the \\"angry young black man\\", her father is the \\"absent black man\\", her sister is acting out.   <br /> <br />However, things get better when her \\"real\\" mother comes into the picture.  Then we get to be furious at a Jillian-type (see Dark Angel, Casteel series) selfish, self-absorbed Heiress.  I also liked Grandmother Hudson, Rain's waspy grandmother forced to admire Rain's intelligence and personal strength despite her own prejudices-because her talents are so obvious.  It's a more meaningful read than the typical ghostwriter fare.  (I read anything w/ Andrews name on it-which is of course why there is a ghostwriter in the first place-no matter how bad they look, but this time I was pleasantly surprised).	2005-05-03

Come on, it's on the cover!  A lecherous old guy is leering at her.  We know what happens when teenage girls are beautiful and vulnerable in these books!   <br /> <br />However, it was a fun book and I do recommend it.  It was frustrating, however, because a lot of things were not resolved.  For one thing, we never really get to find out what happens to \\"big\\" Celeste-does she ever recover from her bizarre childhood?  Does she ever develop a relationship with her daughter?  What is her take on everything that's happened.  Forget about finding that out.  It's barely related to the previous two books.  Also, does the \\"adoptive\\" family ever face charges?  What happens to those wackos?  Why did Celeste throw her \\"innocence\\" away on some dork from school?  The ghostwriter is too into reality.  Andrews' girls only sleep with men genuinely obsessed with them.  This boy doesn't stick around very long, does he? <br /> <br />However, little Celeste's story is enough to intrigue on its own.  I think you will enjoy how she is groomed in a very creepy way to be a breeder for a depraved family.  It's very entertaining.	2005-05-03

I think progressive Christians will find this book speaks to them in their attempts to reconcile a very real faith with an outward-looking and inclusive world-view.  Being engaged in left-wing causes does NOT require abandoning religious faith, and we need more men and women to assert that there IS a religious left, too.  In fact, for many, religious faith is the inspiration that leads us into politics.  I can't beileve a man this kind and sincere and gentle was ever president, it seems so bizarre considering today's realities.	2005-05-03

I was required to read this book a little more than ten years ago in my AP English class in highschool but was immediately drawn into the story.  I think that one of the most enduringly appealing aspects of this book is not just its imagery and perfectly crafted story but the fact that although Flaubert mocks his subjects (with much wit and humor), he also identifies with them.<br /><br />Much has been made of his comment \\"Madame Bovary, c'est moi\\", but I think we all have a little Madame Bovary in us, no matter how much contempt we have for her hurtful and selfish actions.  Her passionate nature and inability to accept the banality of a middle-class life filled with hypocrites is certainly as current now as it was then.  We don't just identify with Madame Bovary, however-I think Flaubert also creates a sympathetic character in the pathetic Charles, who despite his buffoonery is loyal and loving.  This is a classic as exciting and well-written as they get!	2005-05-03

The most powerful part of the book was the moving friendship between Gilda and Hosanna, who meet as maids for a hotel.  Hosanna is a poor black woman; Gilda is a holocaust survivor, and they soon start selling cosmetics together.  (Gilda's family had owned a cosmetics company in Europe before the Nazis took it and Hosanna was interested in finding cosmetics black women could use).  The women become close, and despite Hosanna's initial trepidation at befriending a white Jewish woman, she soon finds out they have much in common, not least of which is their uncommon beauty, not yet accepted by mainstream American standards as pretty. <br /> <br />However, Gilda betrays Hosanna by abandoning their joint business and taking all the money they'd saved.  Although she is mostly forced to by a controlling husband at the time, and tries to find Hosanna to make it up to her, we are still angry that Gilda would leave Hosanna and take advantage of her white skin and her advantageous marriage to leave her cleaning job when we know well that Hosanna will be there forever.  Campbell does a good job of showing the friendships, commonalities, and tensions that have plagued the special Jewish-Black American relationship for years, and makes Gilda ultimately sympathetic, since she wants to make amends for running off with her and Hosanna's business earnings. <br /> <br />However, that's where the story starts losing a lot of its power.  Hosanna's daughter then decides to get revenge against Gilda.  Although I did really like the characters Campbell created in both Hosanna's daughters, their children, husbands/boyfriends, and their friends, I'm not sure that the revenge motive seemed that powerful.  It wasn't exactly the Count of Monte Cristo, because it's made clear that if Hosanna's daughter just said from the outset that she was out to get justice for her late mother, Gilda would have done so. <br /> <br />But no, Hosanna's daughter becomes an executive in Gilda's cosmetics company and keeps it a secret, allowing old Gilda to make comments about how she reminds her of an old friend, etc.   <br /> <br />The book is worth reading and it's a fun read but you'll see what I mean toward the end.  I think it needed more tweaking than it got, but Campbell is certainly a good storyteller, no argument there. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-03

It's really an amazing testament to Kazantzakis' faith, and of Christ's love for us-and his sacrifice.  The story of his life is fleshed out and made real in an emotionally compelling way.  <br /> <br /> It stresses the most important aspects of his teachings and it's truly an amazing novel.  I also really liked the way Judas was portrayed, as a revolutionary who could not think beyond the conditions and injustices of the earth, and who could barely tolerate Christ's pacifism, though he agreed with so many of his thoughts.  Mary Magdelene was also an extremely well-done portrait of a woman who Kazantzakis makes very human and very sympathetic. <br /> <br />I guess my only objection would be the very end where things lapse into a long symbolic fantasy of what Christ's life would have been like if he hadn't decided to dedicate it to God, who is a constant presence calling him to duty throughout his life.  It gets too weird for me; Christ is living in a polygamous fantasy land and its a bit incoherent.  I probably am just not trying hard enough to comprehend its symbolism, but I found it tedious and detracting from the rest of the book.   <br /> <br />But it is a beautiful and highly recommended book, which both believers and non-believers have told me they loved as well.	2005-05-03

I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that it only presented stereotypical portraits of African life.  I agree that the collection would have been enriched with more portraits of urban life, but I don't think that this was a typical \\"National Geographic\\" variety volume.  <br /> <br /> It did have diversity, and it did show that many Africans live in modern homes.  However, the sensitivity of the portraits was so deep, and their beauty so stunning, it certainly transcended \\"look at the natives starving/doing something weird/suffering from disease\\" type photography.  Rather, it showed many of the marvels of Africa-from the artwork thriving in so many areas, to areas where ingenuity and industry thrive against all odds, from the thriving markets of Lagos, to the beauty of the desert.  This book is so gorgeous that it is rather a testimony of love for Africa and its people-not in some patronizing way, but a true celebration of its spirit.  It shows tragedy, but it shows beauty and people loving life and affirming it as well.  Isn't that a balanced and fair picture?	2005-05-03

However, it takes on a life and depth of its own, and is remarkable for its sensitive portrayal of how racism destroys both victim and perpetrator. <br /> <br />One of the most compelling aspects of Campbell's narrative is that she does show compassion and a deep understanding for the lives of poor southern whites.  She tries to penetrate their consciousness without excusing their acts of violence.  This leads to a greater understanding of why such atrocities could take place.  The villains are mostly motivated by fear-fear of being seen as weak, for instance.  It would be easier to not see them as human, but healing and prevention of future tragedies can only come from greater understanding.   <br /> <br />Campbell's insights and skills as a storyteller make this a wonderful read, and her retelling of one of the most horrendous miscarriages of justice in the civil rights period (Emmett Till's murderers never did jail time) make this a book no one should miss.	2005-05-03

Although the premise is a familiar one of the period (beautiful married woman finds love in an affair that ultimately ends in tragedy and self-destruction), Anna Karenina's tale, while entertaining, was less important than Levin's spiritual journey, which I think was the most compelling and moving part of the book.  The conclusions he reaches give us fulfillment, whereas if the story was just about Anna it would be a masterpiece still-although far less profound and meaningful.  The conclusions Levin reaches about life and God are ones that I still think are relevant today.	2005-05-03

We all enjoy stories about fictional characters without a conscience, because it creates all kinds of interesting possibilities.  But after a while, the heavy symbolism of Cain and Abel, the repeating family tragedies, and so on, become tedious and the book just drags on and on until you just can't wait for it to be over.  This is not an indictment of Steinbeck (or Oprah, whose book recommendations are usually very good), because I've liked other writings of his and he is certainly an American treasure in his depiction of so many early twentieth-century experiences, social situations, etc.   <br /> <br />This book didn't really have much of a moral in my opinion, which is fine, but the writing style wasn't good enough to compensate for a lack of it and to stand alone based on the beauty of the writing.	2005-05-03

I read and loved and laughed out loud at the previous seven adventures of Ms. Plum.  However, suddenly things became tiringly repetitive, but worst of all, Stephanie betrayed Morelli by finally giving in to temptation with Ranger.  I know, they were broken up at the time, and Ranger certainly sounds cool, but I still think it was a betrayal.  It's obvious that Steph is meant to be with Morelli.  In the beginning of the series I applauded Stephanie's resilience, humor, and independence.  <br /> <br /> By the time you get to the eighth book I felt like Stephanie's mother.  Why won't Stephanie settle down with Morelli?  Fact is, she is continually putting her hamster, her grandmother, and all who love her in constant danger with her blundering bounty-hunter mishaps, and while that's cute at first, you start wondering why she needs to torture those who care about her after awhile.  The series gave me great fun but I think Janet should wrap it up real soon with a happy ending-Morelli, marriage, (Lula as a bridesmaid, that would be something), and then start a new series.   <br /> <br />Clearly the lady has talent and an amazing sense of humor, but I think this character's outstaying her welcome.	2005-05-03

I actually think Troy is one of the weakest Andrews' creations ever. <br /> <br />  Although Dark Angel delivers as much fun and excitement as any of her other books, and Troy doesn't manage to ruin that, he is just so silly you won't believe it.  He's this tragically brilliant man who's convinced he's on the verge of dying and therefore can't pollute Heaven's life because he'll only bring loss to it.  Please!  Of course Heaven being of an unearthly beauty he finds it impossible to avoid sleeping with her. <br /> <br />That's the worst part of the book.  The best parts are when Heaven tries to resolve her problems with her \\"Casteel\\" family, which include some heartbreaking scenes with Our Jane and Keith.  Fanny and Tom aren't doing too well either.  Among the other memorable scenes are Heaven's adventures with the snooty girls in the snooty school (this becomes a staple of Andrew's successor), and us getting to know her rich grandparents, who are quite unappealing people.  All secrets are resolved by the end of the book, and the series really, really should have stopped here.   <br /> <br />	2005-05-03

I always think about how Lisa Simpson book this book down to her long-lost grandmother when I think of this book!  A great Simpsons episode, but unfair to Knowles.  I was struck by how well this book captured some of the feelings that are so intense in adolescence-friendship, jealousy, the loss of innocence.  Knowles' evokes all of the nolstalgia and pain many of us still feel when we look back on those years.  The guilt and horror of the narrator regarding the jealousy and love he felt for his golden friend are very tangible.  I think it's worth reading and very emotionally engrossing.  So don't listen to Lisa or Mother Simpson, read this book!	2005-05-03

Was that really necessary?  Did Chris have to die the way Chris Sr. did?  Did Jory have to sire Carrie 2 and Cory 2?  It just got a little silly.  I didn't understand why Andrews' had included some of the plot lines, for instance, old Uncle Joel coughing up that tired psycho-religious condemnation of incest and children of sin stuff.  It felt recycled, like they had to have the Grandmother come back in some form and torture any future generations of beautiful blond twins for no apparent reason. <br /> <br />Also, Bart.  What was the deal with him?  Of all of Andrews' villains I actually find him the least sympathetic.  While the Grandmother, (Flowers in the Attic) was love-starved and neglected, Vera (My Sweet Audrina) made to feel unwanted from birth, Fanny (Heaven) poor and often starving, etc., etc., Bart is rich, handsome, loved and spoiled.  What is his problem anyway?  His nastiness toward Chris, Cathy, Cindy, and Jory are really obscene.  Ok, I admit I wouldn't like it if I found out my \\"stepdad\\" was my uncle, but they were such loving parents to Bart and he showed precious little gratitude for that, or sympathy for the extraordinary circumstances that led to their incestrous relationship. <br /> <br />I also wasn't sure why we were supposed to care about Cindy.  Not that I had anything against Cindy, but I wasn't given a reason to care about her.  Plus, Bart's obsession with her sexuality was extremely, extremely creepy, even for Andrews. <br /> <br />  However, if you loved Flowers in the Attic and can't get enough of the original characters from that first book-and God knows anyone who picks up this book fits that description-you'll enjoy it anyway.  I did.	2005-05-03

It was a great concept-insane mother loses son, her favorite child, forces his twin sister to impersonate him in a bizarre case of cross-dressing.  It did remind me quite a bit of Flowers of the Attic, particularly because it involves a smothering mother we grow to resent for imprisoning her children-in Flowers, literally, in this book, figuratively. <br /> <br />What is poor Celeste to do?  She's extremely young, only 9 years old, her father and brother have died, and her whole life is her mother.  She grew up home-schooled, isolated, and lonely.  There is no one to turn to, and her mother is her caretaker.  She also blames herself for Noble's death.  So she becomes him.  It's really a unique story and different in so many ways than a lot of the other post-Andrews ones.   <br /> <br />I also liked the suggestion of the supernatural, the first time this has ever happened in an Andrews book.  However, the question is never really resolved in all three books of the Gemini series.  It's suggested that Celeste, her mother, and daughter, all have a gift, but never verified, so you're left wondering if they're crazy, (the mother certainly seems to be) or cursed (Celeste's daughter, in \\"child of darkness\\", seems to have accurately foretold the tragic death of a schoolmistress, so I'm not sure). <br /> <br />  There's a lot of contradictory stuff in this series, and the timeline doesn't always add up, but it's worth a read.  You'll have fun, I promise.	2005-05-03

This is an intimate memoir of the Beatles and reads like a novel, which I think makes it accessible and interesting to anyone.  The portrayal of all of the four Beatles is quite sympathetic, and tries to understand rather than condemn some of their more controversial actions.  <br /> <br /> It's quite accurate, and although occasionally it lapses into literary recreations of real events (be warned-the authors write that something DID happen with John and Brian on that trip to Spain, and describe events like this as the omniscent narrator that \\"sees all\\"-which despite being friends of the Beatles, they did not see everything), almost everything described in the book did take place, which I know because when I was 13 I took the time to read any account I could get my hands on, both first-hand and otherwise!	2005-05-03

It is such a startling and jarring portrait of the despair and anger that accompanies disenfranchisement and urban poverty that it remains relevant after sixty years.   <br /> <br />Somehow, Wright's talent is great enough to make you completely identify with Bigger no matter where you come from in life-you feel his anger, his nihilism, his frustration at a world where a poor black boy lives in fear most of the time.  Despite Bigger's acts of violence, we realize through the reading of the book that he is our creation and our responsibility.  It is a terrifying and emotional read, however, as Bigger's inevitable ruin is constantly presaged and approached.  Modern readers will find it remarkable that it was written in 1940 when it seems so modern and current; and they will despair that so many of the problems described in wartime Chicago still plague us today. <br /> <br />	2005-05-03

Despite the bad reputation popular fiction like this often gets, I think it was a feeling portrayal of the deep poverty that still plagues some areas of West Virginia, and the social discrimination suffered by those who experience it.  And yes, of course, being a V.C. Andrews book there is a beautiful adolescent heroine who does not know her \\"real\\" identity.  In this case, a girl whose rich Boston mother fled to the woods of West Virginia, married a Casteel (called hill-scum by the neighbors), only to die tragically giving birth to her (at the frighteningly young age of 14). <br /> <br />Heaven, the heroine of the book, lives with this shadow of her mother over her head.  Her brothers and sisters have a different mother, and her father resents her, apparently because she \\"killed\\" her mother.  However, she manages to find meaning in life through her love for school, her siblings and her kindly grandparents, despite the grinding and humiliating poverty she must face every day.  Eventually, things get really crazy,and she is separated from her family and forced to live in an insane foster home with an evil redhaired foster mother (although I love V.C.'s books, I must mention that her anti-redhead discrimination is quite apparent in many of her books and I don't like it!) <br /> <br />It's a really fun and engrossing read and you'll love it, and it's oddly moving. <br />I still remember how much I cried when Heaven was separated from Our Jane and Keith.  And you must read the sequel, unlike Flowers in the Attic the story really needs Dark Angel to be completed.	2005-05-03

It's hard to believe the play takes place so early in the twentieth century when its relevance has not diminished.  It is a stunning portrait of addiction and the self-deception that so often accompanies it.  It's tragic, but it's also hilarious in many parts.

I don't know how Mandela wrote a book that remained so consistently engaging despite its length-he has an intimate style that makes you feel he is confiding in you personally.  When you finish this book, much sooner than you would have thought you would because you won't be able to put it down, you'll realize what an amazing treasure this man is.  He is the true definition of a selfless leader, a man who gave up what could have been a peaceful and relatively prosperous life for a life without family, comfort, or security.  You will also learn a great deal about South African society and history.   <br /> <br />Although the book deals with tragic events, you will be impressed with how well Mandela maintained his humanity and his sense of humor even throughout twenty-seven years in jail.  To give you an example of the unexpected gems you will come across: Mandela and the older jailed leaders of the African National Congress gave \\"courses\\" to the younger prisoners in the history of the ANC while on grueling work detail.

It's not as good, but it's a very entertaining read.  After the abuse that the surviving Foxworth children suffered, readers will want to know if they can ever lead a normal life.  It's a good examination of how a family might deal with the legacy of abuse if they've finally escaped from the perpetrators.  Will they try to forgive and continue with their lives?  Will they become obsessed with revenge?  Or will they find themselves completely incapable of continuing with their lives because they were utterly emotionally destroyed?   <br /> <br />Each of the children deals with the trauma in different ways.  While Chris appears to have recovered the best, his obsession with his own sister is the most startling and enduring result of his isolation during the \\"Attic\\" years.  He does not \\"give up\\" waiting for his sister to respond to him romantically.  Predictably, Carrie, who never really had a chance to enjoy life on the \\"outside\\", and who lost her twin at such a young age, is the most drastically scarred of the children and her story is the saddest and most tragic.  She remains emotionally and physically stunted.   <br /> <br />For her, Cathy, and Chris, we remain riveted to the story and want to know what happens, because we suffered with them in \\"Flowers\\" and cried for little Cory.  Now we want to know what happens to them even if a lot of the plot and secondary characters are boring and one-dimensional.  I liked Henny,the warm nurse who cannot speak; even if one literary critic suggested the large black woman was reminiscent of \\"Aunt Jemima\\", I don't think that's fair.  I think Andrews wrote her as a sensitive and intelligent woman, and including her gave us some respite from everyone in the story having \\"flaxen hair and cerulean eyes\\".   <br /> <br /> Much weaker characters are Paul, who we are supposed to like because he takes in Chris, Cathy, and Carrie, but it's hard to like someone because he tookin a beautiful fifteen year old girl who was orphaned out of the goodness of his own heart.  I'm sorry, but the affair between him and Cathy was somehow even worse than that between Chris and Cathy, and very exploitive.  The abandoned Cathy's gratitude toward Paul for taking in her and her siblings is something she feels she must repay sexually and Paul is ok with that despite being more than twice her age, rewarding the teenager with negligees etc.  I'm not sure if Andrews wants us to find this exploitive or if we're supposed to sympathize with Paul.  Her Ballet life is also an unwelcome diversion as are Julian and his mother.  You can't figure out why someone as strong as Cathy, and as willful, would waste time with the abusive Julian, whose arrogance is ridiculous.   <br /> <br />The real center of the story, which make sense because she was the focal center of \\"Flowers\\" and the narrator of these two books, is Cathy's plans to resolve past injustices committed against her.  She is mad with plans of revenge, which is understandable since Corrine, after what she did to Cory and then Carrie, is enjoying the life of luxury that was more important to her than her own children.   <br /> <br />This is the most thrilling aspect of the story and what we're reading it for, and these are the best scenes of the book.  Everyone who read \\"Flowers\\" will enjoy when Cathy has an opportunity to confront her grandmother and mother.  The best scene in the book is undoubtedly when Cathy, who is in her late twenties (Corrine was in her mid-thirties when this happened) dresses exactly as her mother did for the Christmas ball and looks, not surprisingly considering the lack of diversity in the Foxworth gene pool, every bit the double of her mother several years earlier. <br /> <br />There are those at the party who saw Corrine years prior and immediately realize that something is terribly wrong when Cathy appears in that most dramatic scene, a great guilty pleasure.  The ending is veryhaunting and sets the stage for the next book, suggesting the \\"legacy of evil\\" cannot be overcome.	2005-04-23

It is so accessible and written in such an intimate style that no one needs to have any previous knowledge of African culture to be immediately drawn in and feel as if they are part of the world Mariama creates.  It is entirely written in the form of a letter from one Senegalese woman to another, her dear friend.  In the letter the narrator, a very strong woman, discusses her life, her feelings about her husband, about polygamy, about her children, and about her independence in such a beautiful way that I didn't want the letter to end!  It wasn't long enough, despite the title.  I'd love to reread it.  I wish Mariama Ba hadn't passed away because her style was so pleasing and so involving that I would have loved to have read more by her.  One of Africa's greatest female writers.	2005-04-23

Do we really care?  We do care, and although there's no acceptable excuse for Olivia's behavior in \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", so we don't really expect one, at least we get some insight into her character.  Interestingly enough, this is the only female narrator Andrews created while she was living who isn't so devastatingly, supernaturally beautiful that her brothers/foster fathers/uncles feel compelled to break the laws of God and man (and credulity, and good taste!)to molest her.  But, like all the other Andrews'women-(before the ghostwriter), her first encounter with love and or sexuality will be traumatic and abusive.    Olivia is homely, extremely tall, and awkward.  She lives with her widower father and has never really had a social life.  She occupies her time being grim, serious, and developing practical talents.  She also wishes she was beautiful and could find love, but at the tender age of 24 (this was a long time ago) figures she's an old maid and it's all over.    Then her kindly father invites a handsome young man to dinner.  He's done this before, but the men are always uninterested in plain Olivia.  This time, the man shows interest.  Whoa!  Warning bells should be going off for anyone who's ever read a VC Andrews book before!  Men only fall in love with women who possess beauty so stunning it \\"doesn't look real\\" in V.C. Andrews' world!  (This is true with the ghostwriter, too.)    Olivia's father is stunned and a little weirded out too.  He knows his giantess daughter's boring personality matches her looks.  Malcolm, her suitor, seems to like her precisely because she is NOT sexually attractive.  Then we find out that Malcolm is a misogynist who takes out his Freudian love/hate relationship with the mother who abandoned him on all women.  He picked Olivia because she reminded him least of his beautiful, flighty mother, but nonetheless, can't make love to her unless he can call out \\"Corinne's\\" name.    Olivia is supposed to be a breeder and an efficient helpmate with accounting and so on.  Shunned for her gloomy demeanor and homely appearance, she soon realizes her husband has no romantic feelings for her and that she has bombed socially in Virginia.  (She's a Yankee).  She throws herself into the two children she was able to conceive through Malcolm's brief rapings of her.  However, they are a failure too-sickly, effeminate, and pathetic, Malcolm calls them.    Then Malcolm's father, who unlike his evil and contemptible son is light-hearted and charming, suddenly returns to Foxworth Hall after a long absence with a child bride (Alicia) young enough to be his grandaughter.  She is predictably everything Olivia is not-beautiful, gregarious, fun-loving and kind.  Her fairy-tale relationship with Malcolm's father Garland is like a knife twisting in Olivia's back.  Malcolm, who has no real capacity to love anyone, becomes obsessed with Alicia because he's enthralled with-and hates-beauty in women.  It brings up all his mommy issues.  He starts stalking Alicia, and you can probably write the rest of the story if you've read Andrews before.      Corinne is the fruit of Malcolm's and Alicia's ill-fated (and, I might add, not mutually consenting) union, and things go downhill from there.  Alicia is a sympathetic character who we pity, having done nothing to deserve her fate, and Olivia grows more and more judgemental and fanatic as time goes on.  It's a good story and a great portrait of two wretchedly cruel people, Olivia and Malcolm Foxworth.  Perhaps Olivia would have been different if Malcolm had showed her affection, and Malcolm if his mother had, but by the end we're still angry about the way \\"The Grandmother\\" and the \\"Grandfather\\" treated the Dresden Dolls.      Worth picking up if you loved \\"Attic\\" and want more info on the Foxworths, but as a stand-alone book it doesn't really work I'd imagine.  It also makes the Foxworth gene pool even more toxic than we'd originally thought, aswe discover Chris Sr. and Corinne were brother and sister!!!  NOTE: There is no reason to assume that the ghostwriter wrote this book.  In fact, many believe he started with the end of \\"Fallen Hearts\\".  Anyone who knows V.C. Andrews' style knows this is so close to it, and some of Niederman's books so far from it, that it's hard to believe she didn't write this.  There are some inconsistencies (for instance, in this book Olivia's mother is presented as kind, Corrine tells the children in \\"Flowers\\" that she was abusive), and other minor things.  But that doesn't mean Andrews' didn't write it.  Lots of authors do that.)	2005-04-23

I've read a few of Ngugi's books and this is my favorite: lyrical, sad, and yet optimistic and celebratory at the same time.  It has a number of strengths.  Its poetic verses and style were reminiscent of Kikuyu oral literature; despite  this version being in English there was a great translator.  I can't read Kikuyu but Ngugi writes in it and says it can convey some of the richness of the stories better than English can.  I can't imagine it being better than it was though!  It was a great story of true Kenyan heroes, a love story, a scathing condemnation of corruption, materialism, poverty, neo-colonialism and self-hatred in Kenya and all over the world, and a truly feminist story as well.   <br /> <br />I loved how Ngugi praised women who sought untraditional careers like engineering,and the women who had been the national heros in expelling the British. African women's roles in ousting the colonial powers and the need for them to help develop young nations is often neglected but Ngugi gives special attention to African women and embraces their contributions, equality, and their natural beauty, while expressing deep sadness over how they mutilate themselves by bleaching their skin, among other things. I met Ngugi and he was such a warm and wonderful man.  This is a beautiful story. <br /> <br />	2005-04-23

Don't be intimidated by the length of the book-it goes so quickly that I was sad when it was over-I missed Paul!  I picked up this book only vaguely knowing who Paul was but having heard from my mother that my grandfather who died before I was born loved his music. (We're  white but my family was always in sympathy with the civil rights movement). I learned so much about American history and about this brilliant, talented, complex man through this sensitive rendering of Paul's life.  Paul's courage and talent, (he was valedictorian of Rutgers University and had to fight all kinds of prejudice there, such as not being able to attend parties for college students because everything was segregated) as well as his unwavering support for progressive causes such as civil rights in America and an end to European colonial rule in Africa, were inspirational.  He supported these causes at great expense to himself, since he was highly popular and if he had played a \\"non-controversial\\" role his career would never have faltered.  <br /> <br />    Yes, he expressed \\"communist sympathies\\" but unfortuantely and regrettably (this is admitted by even conservative historians nowadays) this was the superpower willing to take unequivocal stands on such issues. He wasn't actually a member of the communist party, but his refusal to declare whether or not he was a communist-his constitutional right-had the FBI, the press and the public following him and harassing him until the rest of his life.  As he said, America was his nation and he wasn't leaving for the USSR-his father was a slave and he intended to enjoy the fruits of his father's labor.  And his voice-get one of his CD's-was so beautiful and the slave songs he sang so sad!  Reading his story as told by Duberman showed what it was like to live from 1898-1976: son of a slave, talented, fighting segregation and prejudice every step of the way, and then to become a victim of Cold War hysteria.  It was tragic the way this finally destroyed him.  However, Duberman shows us what a philanthropic, big-hearted loveable man Paul was, but doesn't gloss over his flaws.  He shows the dimensions of his character which a true biographer isn't afraid to do, and no one's story is all pretty.  Among other things, Paul didn't care much about fidelity to his formidable wife Essie (who I loved as well, this was also a kind of biography of her), he didn't openly condemn Stalin when he should have, and he could be self-absorbed.  But, overall, he was an amazing and wonderful man who I wish I could have known-and an amazing American every American, black or white, should know about.   <br /> <br />PS-on a superficial note, Paul was gorgeous when he was young! Some of the photos of him don't do him justice but in this book you'll find out what I mean!	2005-04-20

However, I want to thank the reviewer who noted that in high school he or she did not appreciate the book as much as they did in college. I could see someone in high school being turned off by the book, particularly if they were not taught about Achebe's own intentions in creating the book's plot and characters.  <br /> <br />For one thing, some reviewers seem not to understand that Achebe is not endorsing some of Okonkwo's character traits and see Okonkwo as some kind of chauvinistic cultural ideal of the pre-colonial African man. Rather, as Achebe has often said in interviews and essays, Okonkwo, and the entire portrait of his village was evoked to show both the beauty-and the flaws-of pre-colonial African society. As in all human societies, injustices were perpetrated.  <br /> <br />Okonkwo, then, is someone Achebe feels for-and wants us to feel for-but who he feels is tragic due to his rigidity and other problems. He is not intended to be a figure for emulation at all. Indeed, at times Achebe demonstrates the narrowness of Okonkwo's thought and the reality that other cultural models of masculine behavior existed in Ibo society at the time. For instance, Okonkwo is shocked when he hears one of his friends note that a great Ibo village leader has died and that the man would never do anything without first consulting his wife. Confronted with the fact that not everyone took the narrow view of male/female relationships he did, Okonkwo shows incredulity. Achebe shows with carefully crafted, elegant and subtle language that Okonkwo has become so wedded to one vision of Ibo cultural identity that ultimately any change introduced into that society destroys him. He clings to one vision of masculinity in order to feel he has lived a life opposite to that of his father, who had a completely different disposition but died in poverty. <br /> <br />Some readers don't like the book, therefore, because they confuse Achebe's sympathy with Okonkwo for his endorsement of Okonkwo's behavior, which is completely different. That does not allieviate the pain we feel when Okonkwo is defeated by a society that refuses to acknowledge that the Ibo have a great history and society and demands he conform to the Western encroachment. When Okonkwo feels his society is so degraded that it can no longer exist he can no longer exist, either. Achebe knew that a cultural purist could not survive under colonialism, so he treats the case with deliberate ambiguity. We are as upset as Okonkwo's friend when he dies (I cried for days) and furious at the petty and ignorant summary the Englishman expresses at his death, his dispassionate arrogance that mistakes Okonkwo's national pride for some \\"primitive\\" superstition, but at the same time we know he couldn't have survived in a new world and he could not accomodate change, something Achebe thought was dangerous. <br /> <br />Achebe once said that if he could convince his fellow Africans through his novels that their history had not been \\"one long dark night\\" but rather a rich and complex tapestry of sophisticated cultural, religious, and artistic expressions he would have succeeded at his goal. He certainly succeeded-although precolonial Africa had many kingdoms, the Ibo were supposedly without a leader and therefore people assumed it meant that they were a \\"disorganized tribe\\". However Achebe's book demonstrates the meaning, internal organization, poetry, ritual, and traditions that all human societies have and this book, which shows a world of beauty gone forever, fulfills Achebe's noble goal of wanting to demonstrate the validity of African history and does so more than many history books I have read.  Those history books are accurate, of course, but although they demonstrate what Achebe does they often do not pull you in emotionally, which is far more effective and I believe that is why everyone should read this book-perhaps not in high school, however.  I don't know, I didn't have it assigned to me then, so I don't know if I would have appreciated its nuances as a teenager.  But it's not worth alienating people who might otherwise pick it up.  For adults, it's a read you can't put down and a work of singular beauty.  FOR ADULTS IT IS NOT A DIFFICULT READ: I don't want anyone to get turned off by those who said it was, or to assume that it will be dense, hard to get through, or anything like that-its simple but potent language is one of its most amazing qualities. <br /> <br />It is the classic of the African continent, a tragic book that will lead any reader into a deeper understanding of colonialism, the colonial lie about \\"peoples without history\\",and Africa. Its richly rendered scenes are also some of the best written in the English language. <br /> <br />Read this book, it will change your life!  (For the better). <br />  <br />	2005-04-20

Anne is an enduring and beloved heroine for so many reasons. I also think she's a great role model for girls.  For a variety of reasons.  First of all, even though she lived and was created in Victorian times, Anne was a rarity: a girl who was not afraid to openly demonstrate her intelligence, to let everyone know she had a backbone, to compete with boys for academic awards, and to have ambitions and to want her independence.<br /><br />But Anne embodies other qualities that are so important to encourage in children: her love of books and all things literary, her vivid imagination, her sense of humor, her vast ability to love others, and her willingness to openly express affection to those who matter to her.<br /><br />Girls who read this book will also be touched by Anne's vulnerability and the social prejudice she experienced as an orphan.  Her generosity of heart and kindness, as well as her love and gratitude toward Marilla and Matthew and her utter sincerity will never become old-fashioned.  Her devotion to Diana will remind all girls of the precious friendships that are so important and dramatic during our childhood.<br /><br />Gilbert Blythe's interest in Anne-based on her intelligence and sense of humor rather than her adorable appearance or the beautiful red hair she's always so sensitive about-will teach girls that there are men who will love them for being themselves-even if it means being fiercely independent, willful and high-achieving like Anne.  You will fall in love with Anne like everyone else in the story did, and with Prince Edward Island (the most beautiful place in the world).<br /><br />As long as there are little girls with a lot of imagination, spunk, and enthusiasm for life there will be people who love Anne.	2005-04-20

US	15142547	R3NZWV0LTYJ2EY	0312300425	184918718	Frantz Fanon: A Biography	Books	4	14	15	N	N	Fascinating!	This book, though enormous, was an easy and entertaining read.  I have really only one objection.  The book was a great history book but there weren't enough details about Fanon the man.  I do think that historical contextualization is essential in biographies and in fact they're one of my favorite ways to learn history.  <br /> <br /> However, you do expect to read a narrative of someone's life, whereas most of the time, I was reading a history of the Algerian Revolution.  Which I wanted to anyway and have no problem with, that's just not what I thought I was getting into.  I was greatly moved by Fanon's tragic early death and by his humanist ideals, and I think Macey was right to emphasize, as the famous academic Homi Bhabha recently did, that Fanon's advocacy of anti-colonial violence is not the most important or enduring aspect of his legacy.  First and foremost Fanon wanted to see a better and more just world, and his unrelenting passion to empower the poorest of the poor-the wretched of the earth-is a justly lasting, powerful, and evocative sentiment. <br /> <br />However, there just wasn't much about him.  I didn't learn all that much about him.  The details on his personal life or intimate relationships were very scarce.  I understand that not many records remain that describe his relationship with his wife or family but when you pick up a biography you expect intimate personal details that help make a person fully human.   <br /> <br />If not enough of that exists anymore, then Macey, a talented and sensitive writer, should have called this book an analysis of Fanon's WRITINGS, not his life.  Because most of what Macey tells us about Fanon he gets out of Fanon's \\"Black Skin, White Masks\\" and his other writings-he provides few interviews and even fewer insights.  Maybe it's too late to write that book, but if you want to call this a biography, you have to make it one. <br /> <br />I still recommend the book if you are interested in Fanon's writings and the Algerian Revolution, which I was and am.  But if you want to learn about Fanon the man, forget about it.  Nothing in the book made me feel as if I knew anything other than Fanon the theorist and revolutionary.  You get no sense of any other dimension of him than you would get if you read all his books.	2005-04-20

This book doesn't seem to have lost any of its appeal since it was first published almost seventy years ago.  If you don't know the secrets of this book, they still have shock value and you will still be intrigued and surprised by the plot turns.  There are a number of strong points to recommend this book: it very effectively creates suspense, fascinates you with the mysterious Rebecca, widow of glamorous Maxim (although she is already dead when the story begins her presence looms over every page and you wish you knew more about her), unexpectedly touches you with the relationship between the unnamed narrator and Maxim and effectively provides two points of suspense: the first portion of the book rests on a completely different sort of mystery than the second.  I won't give away the ending, or any of the book's secrets, except to say that the excitement doesn't stop until the end,even after critical details have been revealed.  As a young woman I can assure readers that, overall, the book ages well and will be just as exciting to young readers as older ones.  However, there are a few points that don't hold up as well which prompted some of the later feminist critiques/rewritings of the book (e.g. the idea of \\"bad\\" versus \\"good\\" women etc.,)and although the critiques are valid this is still a wonderfully written novel, a classic of the gothic genre, and I defy anyone to pick it up and be able to put it down!	2005-04-20

Well, I'm nothing if not open minded.  What I got was something so filled with hatred and bile that it shocked me even though I was just a teenager at the time.   <br /> <br />What can you say about someone who says feminism was born so ugly women could have access to the mainstream of society?  I remember one of my high school teachers, who incidentally was always saying how pretty I was (apprently not knowing I was a feminist), said she agreed with that statement!   <br /> <br />Ok, he also denies the genocide of Native Americans and presents the theory that gays deserve to have their civil rights recognized as some kind of wacky liberal theory.   There's lots of other examples but this guy is clearly a demagogue who preys on people's worst prejudices in order to gain an audience-of angry white men.   <br /> <br />I don't know why anyone would buy the book unless they want enjoy feeling their feelings of hatred.  All I can say to all you Rush fans, particularly those with an ounce of human compassion is, try working on your anger a little bit.   <br />Hatred is not a political position. <br />	2005-04-20

Obviously, my belief in God and my preference of good over evil mean I went into this with a bias.  I still think all of you who are morbidly curious like I was should read what I'm about to write before buying this book:<br /><br />I was hoping from a literary standpoint this book would be terrifying.  I picked it up and felt a little dirty touching it.  What evil lurks in the hearts of men?  (and women?)  What would they advocate?<br /><br />Actually it was just a bunch of sappy self-help corniness that could've come from Good Housekeeping, about how to get rid of \\"toxic\\" people who drained your energy and whatnot.  Some of it were things reasonable people would agree with, some of it I didn't approve of because it fetishized self-indulgence over meeting the needs of others, but all of it was BORING.  How disappointing is that?<br /><br /> I actually think that this secular book advising athiestic self-love is dangerous precisely because it has some reasonable stuff in it: basically, if fanatic fundamentalists of the right-wing religious Christian or Muslim or Orthodox Jewish varieties want to indict something they call \\"secular humanism\\", they need only look in this book for a real example of that.  Instead, they label liberal Catholics, mainstream Protestants and Reformed Jews as \\"secular humanists\\" because they don't want to burn all the books in the library.<br /><br />  This stupid and boring book immorally presents a catalogue of traits, some good, some bad, and conflates them all into some pseudo-philosophy for people who want an excuse to be selfish and self-absorbed, and in the process gives fuel to those who want to equate certain values like tolerance with \\"satanism\\".<br /><br />Again, don't get it for the thrill value-boring!  Is there an actually scary evil book out there that would be more entertaining?  If so, someone please do me a favor and recommend it in the recommendation section.	2005-04-20

One of the things I love about Gould (I am saddened by his recent death) is that although a lot of scientists felt engaging with neo-eugenicists like the authors of the Bell Curve was beneath them, that to refute them was to somehow legitimate them, Gould realized the import such pseudo-science had on popular culture and, as a brilliant and respected scientist, devoted himself to showing the obscene, dishonest, and often distorted and fabricated research that has been done on race for hundreds of years.<br /><br />Not only does Gould force us to examine some of the simplisitc concepts we tend to take for gratned (intelligence is a \\"heritable number in the head\\") but shows the flawed and compromised research and the dubious politics of the men who would try to prove some portion of humanity inferior.  By the way, this book wasn't just about race, but about class:  all those who argued for a hierarchy of human groups also argued the lower white classes \\"deserved\\" to be there.  So this isn't only a book that would interest those who care about race, but those who care about class and the argument, which Murray and Herrenstein repeated in the odious \\"Bell Curve\\", that \\"poor white trash\\" are genetically and permanently disabled.  ?  I guess Hillary Swank should never have been let out of that trailer park to win those Oscars!<br /><br />Gould shows the mythologies that men like these base their writings on and also demonstrates how they IGNORE data conflicting with the prejudices they went into their research with: e.g., studies that show when black children are adopted by middle-class white families there is no disparity in their IQ when compared to the white population, significant and drastic IQ increases when proper nutrition, environment and education are provided, etc. etc.  The men who write these psuedo sciences are determined to end any kind of social program that might narrow the now enormous gap between rich and poor and give all Americans an equal opportunity to suceed.<br /><br />Racism is the most terrible plague to hit modern society and this book is the perfect answer to those who would continue to maintain that some groups possess superior intellects to others.enormous gap between rich and poor and give all Americans an equal opportunity to suceed. <br /> <br />Racism is the most terrible plague to hit modern society and this book is the perfect answer to those who would continue to maintain that some groups possess superior intellects to others.	2005-04-20

He backs up all his arguments, which tend to use the technique of juxtaposing politicians'and ideologues' comments with their off the record comments or actions that prove they were lying. <br /> <br />Everyone should read Chomsky at least once so they can get a sense of the depths of deception that we've been exposed to in regards to the motives of our foreign policy over the past fifty years.  Don't go into this if you want to cling to some benign happy vision of everything.  Chomsky will completely revolutionize your way of thinking when you realize you can't refute his facts. <br /> <br />  He does it in such a striking manner, one I've seen few duplicate. <br /> <br />He's excellent at showing people how to critically interpret modern politics and shun credulity in favor of actively engaging power and demanding democracy and transparency.   <br /> <br />After you read him the one required (in my opinion) time, you'll be capable of critically evaluating political rhetoric, white washed history etc. on your own and you really don't need to read his other works.  I mean, they're good and interesting but it's not necessary.  I just think everyone should at least get a feel for his talent and method because it's so unique.	2005-04-20

And perhaps, like me, you wanted to know: \\"is this woman really that obnoxious?  If so, why?  Was her appearance always this genuinely frightening?  Or was she once truly beautiful?\\"    The answers to that are: yes, child abuse and working in an industry completely and necessarily focused on superficiality, no, and yes.    Let me elaborate.  While reading this very poorly written book, you will feel pity for Janice.  I still do.  She was terribly abused by her father and this is often (not always) the result: an utterly self-obsessed woman who lashes out at others to make herself feel better, who seems to be unaware of her narcissistic behavior, who prattles off long lists of famous people she slept with as if that will make us think more highly of her (actually, it just makes me question the emotional stability of the men she supposedly bedded for going to bed with this highly unbalanced woman) who cannot accept the effects of time and distorts her once beautiful face into a truly alarming one.      She did that with compulsive and repeated plastic surgeries.  She went on Dr. Phil to get help for her need to get repeated surgical cosmetic procedures done, but Dr. Phil needs to work with her some more because whatever he said didn't take!    So, because Janice won't get the help she needs and refuses to develop any worthwhile character traits or skills outside of trying to look pretty, you get this very pathetic story of an aging model clinging to her glory days, who seems to have screwed up 2 marriages and two children and relieves her feelings of inferiority by telling the beautiful thin young girls on America's Next Top Model that they're ugly, fat, and too old for the business.  She's going to turn 50 this year, and wants to feel good about herself while she remains in an industry that worships youth and sees women over 25 as ancient.  I'm twenty years youngerthan her and can see how futile her plight is, why can't she?    Janice, if you're reading this, I do feel for you and I do want you to be happy, but you are NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY if you keep basing your self-worth on physical appearance, notches on your bedstand, putting other people down or claiming to be the world's first supermodel.  You have to get help.  I do wish you the best and can tell you're suffering, but you need to stop taking it out on other people.      Your book was boring and sad.  Why do you think people want to know about all your one-night-stands?  Do you have anything else to offer the world or the publishing industry?  If you want to write an honest book about your insecurities and about the modeling industry and how it affects women, I'll read it.  Otherwise, your books is doomed to end up on the shelves of Mace's Closeout City for $1.99 along with wacky conspiracy theory books.    -Justice    P.S. You're not the first supermodel.  Gia was.

Which is of course extremely funny, but a lot of Rock's talent comes from his unique take on all kinds of issues and his ability to enlighten his audience when they think they're just getting comedy.  If you buy the book you'll see what I mean.  <br /> <br /> This is pertains to some portions of the book.  Most actually.  Other aspects of his comedy are just funny, and although they are generally not as strong, they're still really good.  If you doubt Chris Rock's formidable talent, this is the book that will erase that doubt.  His remarkable contribution to American comedy is very well demonstrated in this compilation of his best material.  Even though some might argue that Rock's delivery is what makes him so funny, seeing how funny his words still are in print makes it hard to believe that his talent is in performance.  It's mostly in his material.  His performance is just icing on the cake. <br /> <br />I've re-read it many times, so it's worth buying.  I'll wait a year or so and then reread it and it's just as funny as it was the first time.  Definitely worth it for Chris Rock fans and those who aren't-but will be after reading the book.	2005-04-20

I was laughing out loud during most of this book which, as I'm sure you all know, is rare when you're reading a book.  Al Franken is a truly gifted political satirist, humorist, and he is also a compassionate and humane man who used a painless and extremely fun read to demonstrate the hypocrisy and nonsense spewed by neo-conservatives these days.  Although I love Al, some people on the left (like me) might get a little weary of his gratuitous Clinton butt-kissing.      While we all may have our ambivalent feelings regarding him to work out (he was charming, smart, a billion times better than the current president) the fact remains that he was so wrong in so many ways I can't even get into them all.  What you have to understand, Al, is that contrary to the beliefs of the right-wing Clinton (either one, Hillary or Bill) is not the patron saint of the progressives!  They are not happy with his immoral intern conduct, failure to stop the genocide in Rwanda, abusive measures toward the poor (welfare to work, read about it, it ended up being ridiculous and punative) etc. We are also not happy with Hillary's war vote and her other problems.    (...) No more Clinton butt-kissing.  Just because he's better than Bush doesn't make him good.  Cozying up to him just makes us look like idiots.

Also, I thought Elizabeth Bathory would be painted as a kind of deliciously wicked woman who's fun to hate and who you kind of have to grudgingly admire.  No, she was just perverse and absolutely grotesque lacking in even basic human compassion and almost psychotic.

You will be rolling with laughter at Wole's adventures and you will grow to love his family.   <br /> <br />Although most of the book is a joyous and humorous personal account of a Nigerian boy who grows up the son of the school principle around WWII, in an intelligent, colorful, and loving family, the ending of the book has some very interesting accounts of the Soyinka family's friendship with the Ransome-Kuti family (which produced the famous African musician Fela Kuti).  <br /> <br /> As part of the educated Yoruba elite in Africa, Wole's mother was friends with Kuti's mother and together they educated women, stood up to the colonists (in some of the best scenes in the book) and fought for female emancipation.  This may come to a shock to those who know Fela Kuti's cultivated machismo, but these strong women are celebrated and assisted by the men in the village.  African women had a unique position under colonialism in that they could stand up to colonial officials in a way African men could not have-British men (not always, but often) preferred not to use violence against women and saw that as part of their gentlemanly identity.  Therefore, when  <br /> <br />Mrs. Ransome-Kuti tells a colonial official who has ill treated her that \\"you were born but you were not bred\\" it is one of the most powerful moments in the book.   <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book any more highly.  Go get it right away!  I promise you you won't regret it.  This is the kind of book that makes you realize the power of reading: the power to open up a new world, a new culture, and feel you are part of it; the power to laugh along with the characters, to spend a few hours of your life delighted.  It's an experience more than a book.	2005-04-20

Born into an elite aristocratic American family, Eleanor could have remained hemmed in by the insular values with which she was raised.  Women were supposed to stay out of politics, Anglo-Saxons were supposed to run the country and only mingle amongst themselves, and the poor deserved their lot. <br /> <br />Eleanor grew up with a lot of the prejudices someone of her class and generation might be expected to have but then she transformed into a woman who fought tirelessly against poverty, racism, sexism, and injustices of all kinds.  I think that is her true legacy and what makes her so remarkable.  In a society that wanted women to be purely ornamental, Eleanor could have done as so many women of her age and class did, remain prisoners to their narrow views and beliefs. <br /> <br />But Eleanor did more.  Because she was not conventionally attractive, she was supposed to hide away from society.  Because she was a woman, she wasn't supposed to get involved in political affairs.  But she got involved!  She told FDR what she thought about everything, urging him to pass anti-lynching legislation, include more women in his cabinet, and earning his profound respect-if not always his complience!   <br /> <br />Sometimes she could be a bit naive, (like when, in the fifties, she told a soviet leader how much Americans had done to improve the \\"life of the negro\\", but Eleanor's empathy, compassion, humility and personal strength comes through so strongly in these profoundly human writings of hers that I really think anyone would enjoy them.  What a wonderful woman!	2005-04-20

I read a lot of heavy literature and history so I wanted something that wouldn't emotionally or intellectually drain me.  I can't tell you how much this book fit the bill!!!  (My friends and family agree).  This book is so funny and entertaining.  There's something so quintessentially American about it. <br /> <br />  Stephanie Plum is a great modern heroine, her love interest vice-cop Morelli is very sexy, and the other characters Janet Evanovich creates are similarly wacky and endearing.  Sometimes she goes a little overboard with ethnic stereotyping, but her heart's in the right place and I don't know how she turned the story of an inept female bounty-hunter from Jersey into a book that you can't put down, but she did.   <br /> <br />I'm quite positive the vast majority of readers will be delighted!!!	2005-04-20

Jared Diamond has done the world an extraordinary service by proving with his incontestable research that the differing levels of technology reached by diverse human societies throughout history can be attributed to environmental causes. <br /> <br /> This argument, so effectively proven by Diamond, rejects the argument that there is a yardstick of human achievement and that each people's progress on a Western model of development proves their worth.  I love how he shows that some societies \\"progessed\\" from the \\"stone age\\" etc. but then \\"reverted\\" when they found themselves in new terrain.  Many stories like this demonstrate the fragility of the old argument that \\"nation building\\" and movement from \\"hunting/gathering\\" to \\"industrial society\\" were the true measures of a given people's innate abilities. <br /> <br />So, while I feel humanity is in Mr. Diamond's debt for this invaluable service, I have to say this book is so densely written that it was not a pleasure to read.  If you are reading this, Jared, or if your publishers are, consider rewriting the book to not hurt so much.  I'm not one who finds most books difficult at all-I almost never struggle to get through any sort of book, but this book was so dry in places, which was sad considering the power and import of its argument.  <br /> <br /> It gave me a headache, and that's just not acceptable for a book with a thesis so important.  That's all I can say.  I want people to read this book: college students, scientists, historians, average Joes and Janes.  That will not happen if you don't attempt a rewrite of your central thesis in a more accessible style-I'm a grad student and certainly read more dense stuff than the average reader, so you can trust me when I say this book has to be fixed in terms of literary style. <br /> <br />If you truly care about making your views available to the public at large you will take that advice. <br /> <br />But for its overall value to humanity I highly recommend it.	2005-04-20

Extremely well-written, passionate, and erudite, C.L.R. James's classic is still the starting point I would recommend for anyone interested in Haitian history. I would also recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the French Revolution.  The narrative reads like a great novel, despite being a well-researched history book. Years before mainstream U.S. or European historians saw Carribbean history as relevant, the West Indian James showed its import for both Western and Global History.  <br /> <br />First, James shows the utterly heartbreaking treatment the slaves of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) were subject to. Then he demonstrates the contradictions in Western Revolutionary thought which used emancipatory language but refused to address the issue of colonial slavery. Then the leaders of the slave revolution emerge in his story as true sans-culottes, Jacobins and patriots in their own right; men and women who refuse to let Napoleon reenslave them and forge a nation.  Their act of \\"rebellion\\", the creation of the first black republic in the Americas and the only successful slave revolt in history, would strike fear into the hearts of slaveowners everywhere.  They would pay for taking the heady egalitarian language of the 18th century seriously-in both the 19th century and the 20th and beyond, they would be subject to pay enormous indemnities to Europe for having \\"taken\\" the plantations of the whites, be subject to embargos, be forcibly invaded on several occasions, have dictators foisted upon them, and much more. <br /> <br />But none of that could take away the fact that their courage, bravery, and love of freedom had earned them their freedom from slavery and that their history deserved to be recorded, admired, and preserved.  No one has ever done that more skillfully than C.L.R. James. <br /> <br />A truly triumphant story.	2005-04-20
US	15142547	R3J3AD4N7VJR4I	0671729411	173166968	Flowers in the Attic (Dollanganger)	Books	5	25	26	N	N	Adolescence Revealed!	Some people are taking this great read too literally.  The thing is, I don't actually think that the details of the story are as important as what it evokes: the terror and uncertainty of being a teenager.  The bizarre horror of  maturing physically and yet being powerless before adult authority.  It's all a metaphor for feeling trapped, which all teenagers feel.    If you think about it, that's what all Andrews' books are actually about, and the ghostwriter carries on this tradition, if not as well as Andrews, than competently.      Yes, some of the details are hard for an adult reader to accept as credible, but why do you think we loved this books as teenagers?  Because many teenage girls-and I stress girls, because I most of what Andrews' covers doesn't apply to boys-go through all the things Cathy goes through-testing sexual attractiveness for the first time, looking at our changing bodies in the mirror, first period, challenging parental authority,the trauma of first sexual experiences, etc.  All those changes are scary and weird. Of course the added elements are demented and perverse but that just adds to the fun.      Andrews just takes common female adolescence, scary enough on its own, and projects it onto a melodramatic stage we can emotionally act it out on.  Most of us don't have incredibly wealthy families, haunted by legacies of \\"sin\\", possess nearly supernatural physical perfecton or get locked up in the attic, but many a girl can project their uncontrollably blossoming self onto Cathy; many a pretty girl can remember what it's like to first have people comment on your beauty, many an abused child can remember the powerlessness of childhood, etc.      The perverse details of this Andrews' books, as with all of such as brother-sister incest (easier to stomach when, like me, you don't have a brother!), abuse of small children, much older men with teenage girls (see Petals on the Wind for this, yuck), rape, starvation, whippings, etc, etc., are not for everyone, so be warned.  If my mom knew everything in here I don't think I would've been allowed to read it!  Recently we talked about the book and she laughed at the premise, and so did my husband, and I think adults do have a hard time understanding how someone would keep four intelligent kids locked up in an attic-but the fact that the premise is credible to kids is precisely why kids could be kept in the attic!  You tell them to stay there, and they do!  They were locked in, and one of their only alternatives would have been to attack their mother or grandmother and take their key when they came in.  Adults would have thought of such an alternative, which most children would never entertain.    That's why they're so easily emotionally abused.  Besides, they eventually left.     Also, the melodramatic prose might turn some people off, but Andrews has a real skill for creating mood and an engrossing read and that is as much of a legitimate talent as the high-brow literary giants I also love.  I'm 29 but I'll never remember when I first picked up this book at 12 and couldn't stop reading and felt like someone connected with all my confusion.  V.C. Andrews is like  Judy Blume if she was crazy, perverted, and obsessed with sexual deviancy!  God I miss that woman.	2005-04-08
