Since this is his best known work I knew I had to check it out. It is a very engaging book about Cuban brothers trying to make it in the US during the 50's Mambo craze. The story is very entertaining as many memorable characters both fictional and real Cuban musicians from the period are introduced.<br />The story while full of colorful epsiodes is ultimately tragic as the brothers age and life takes it's toll on each of them in very different ways.<br />Hijuelos uses sexual imagery and descriptions of food to create a steamy  intensity to the story with great effect. That said the lurid sexual descriptions cited by many other reviewers may turn off some readers. While I was enjoying the book enough to overlook this, there are times when he does rely too much on this device and the novel starts to feel like a guilty pleasure. If you are OK with that type of writing then there are rewards to be had in the characterizations and plot. If you cannot stomach the hard-core sexual references that are integral to this book then stay away and try one of his other novels.	2005-10-13

The book is a short -one sitting read with great photos of both men at different stages of their careers. The bonus is the DVD of outtakes from the series that is very amusing and makes one long for the series itself to be released on DVD. For any fan of the show this book is a must and would make a great gift for the Odd Couple addict in your life.	2005-10-09

One of the encounters results in a tragedy and the event and it's aftermath drives the story to it's quick conclusion.<br /><br />Maugham writes dialogue that is quick, witty and obviously adaptable to the stage or screen since he was primarily known as a playwrite as well as a novelist.This short work is no exception.<br /><br />The action proceeds quickly and this makes Up At The Villa a short but very satisfying book to read.	2005-10-01

As a fan of much of De Niro's work, I also realize he has made some poor role choices but Baxter has little to say that is positive. I learned some details regarding De Niro's  early life and training that were somewhat interesting so I give it 2 stars for that but it seems that a better biography with more balance might be a better choice for the general reader. Actually then later chapters seem rushed as if Baxter was more concerned about hitting a deadline than producing a good and balanced book.	2005-09-13

Having been portrayed as a conniving usurper to power by Thomas More during the early Tudor era he is actually savaged by Shakespeare and his legacy in historical terms has become one with the characterization that the bard gave us.<br /><br />Richard is a muderous liar who kills anyone who gets in his way and he is contrasted with the righteously portrayed young Henry VII who returns from France to set things right.<br /><br />The play is a wonderful read and study in Machiavellian manuevering for powers sake.<br /><br />From the setting up of his brother Clarence to the murder of the young Princes in the Tower Richard who takes the audience into his confidence gradually becomes as appalling a character as Shakespeare ever created.<br /><br />Much of what is later revealed of the capacity for people to scheme against their fellows in Claudius and Iago in the respective tragedies of Hamlet and Othello is begun here in Richard III.	2005-09-13

I agree that there is not a single wasted line in this relatively short play but the slowly building intensity and confrontation will stay with you for a long time.

These two are soulmates that are caught up in a tragic web that is partially forced upon them by the social conventions of their time. Equally tragic is the unrealized ambition and yearning for a formal education that Jude carries as a cross throughout his life as he ultimately becomes resigned to his station as a working class laborer who will never be accepted in the halls of higher learning which he so reveres.<br /><br />Hardy's writing typically is critical of late Victorian values and his characters frequently suffer tremendous burdens that result from being at odds with what were considered societal norms. None of his characters suffer more than the cousins in this book and the tragedy is one that will haunt the reader for years.	2005-07-09

His jealousy over being passed over in favor of Cassio engenders a revengeful scheme that turns jealousy into a weapon used to destroy the noble Othello. Here innocence and trust is contrasted with pure manipulation and evil in what is one of Shakespeare's most revealing tragedies. The characters  act exactly as they would be expected to based on the overriding quality that they represent. Othello is wonderful Shakespearean drama that ranks among his greatest works.<br /><br />The Folger Library editions are my favorite. Each page has a facing page that explains obscure terms and helps as a handy reference to make reading the plays pleasurable and educational. These paperback editions of Shakespeare's works are a great value and fit in your pocket.	2005-06-26

Having lived there during the time described in Mahler's book I found myself remembering just how grim things did seem at times. Mid-town was wall- to - wall hookers. The subways smelled incredibly bad. Streets were basically falling apart. I loved the city then as I do now and sometimes the new tourist driven atmosphere of mid-town makes me long for the old days. Mahler's book is the next best thing to time travel. He really captures the insanity of New York in 1977 and uses the \\"Bronx Zoo\\" Yankees of Billie, Reggie and Thurman as a great backdrop to examine broader political and social issues confronting New York at the time. Everything from Son Of Sam, the blackout and subsequent looting, to the mayoral campaign of Ed Koch is included.It was a wild era for sure. One that many of the young people lining up in Times Square to see TRL or the millions of tourists strolling down 42nd st between 8th and Broadway have no idea existed only a short 30 years ago. This is great popular history and I highly reccommed it.	2005-06-03

From native-american iron workers who commute from Canada to work on skyscrapers to fisherman , these are people who are an integral part of city life that can easily be forgotten in the hustle and bustle but LeDuff's portraits bring them into full relief.<br /><br />A very entertaining book that can be opened almost at random and capture your interest. My only critism is that some of the sketches are too short and don't have enough development. LeDuff reminds me of Joseph Mitchell and continues in that tradition of exposing characters in NY that aren't readily visible.	2005-05-31

This is a thoroughly enjoyable brief biographical and analytical sketch of John Coltrane's development from a good sideman to the most influential jazz musician of his era. Coltrane's intensity and his approach to his art is wonderfully portrayed. There are anecdotes from various performances and recording sessions as well as brief forays into his personal life and struggles with addiction. Nisenson writes with the appropriate level of reverence for a man who has given so much through his music and includes numerous quotes from other musicians ,especially Miles Davis on Coltrane and what made him unique. My only complaint is the book is too short. I finished it wanting more.	2005-05-15

Beevor alternates his focus from the Russian troops and armies to the civilian struggles to Hitler and his entourage in the bunker seamlessly.

Phil's story starts off with the typical childhood stuff but rapidly moves to the music scene in Palo Alto and later San Francisco that ultimately coincided with the Summer Of Love and gave birth to the Grateful Dead. The Dead were certainly unique in all of rock in the way their music blended so many influences and Lesh's story clearly demonstrates how those strains of jazz, blues, country,and even classical influences came into play in the extended instrumental explorations the Dead were famous for. I was particularly intrigued by how he describes the influence of John Coltrane on his own muiscal development.<br /><br />Garcia emerges from this as the Jerry we all know and love. A true musical explorer of the first order.<br /><br />Anyone who loved the Dead will surely enjoy reading this. Anyone who didn't \\"get\\" the Dead should read it anyway because it will give you some insight into what the music was all about.	2005-04-17

There is no question that the author's views align with Lewis on most subjects. That inherent bias did not diminish my enjoyment of this book at all.<br /><br />Along the way there are numerous biographical sketches of the two men which I found fascinating ,well documented and well researched.<br /><br />This is a book that invites thoughtful reflection on the differing viewpoints represented by these two great thinkers and in some ways the contrast between them defines the schism between the spiritual and secular realms which occupies so much of our public discourse today.	2005-03-06

The obvious anti-semitism that underlies much of the plot and language and the forceable conversion of Shylock to Christianity near the end of the play is difficult to reconcile in our own age.<br /><br />Nevertheless  Merchant is categorized as a comedy and despite some of it's darker elements retains the classic comic devices of disguises , crossdressing and the denoument of festivity and multiple marriages.<br /><br />What seperates this from some of the other comedies is the relatively unsympathetic characters of the major protaganists. As they celebrate their weddings and the fact that all is set right in the world the reader is left to wonder about the fate of the ostensibly evil character of Shylock. While the Merchant Antonio's fortunes are restored, Shylock is left without means. A statement perhaps regarding the practice of usury , but to me Antonio's enterprise and his willingness to commit to a bond with the moneylender when it suits him implies that Shylock has earned a rightful place in the economic world of Venice. It is his insistance on the strict adherence to his bond that ultimately leads to his undoing.<br /><br />As Portia provides an idyllic description on the quality of Mercy, she and her circle dispense no mercy to Shylock in their judgement of him. Would Shylock , in an alternate ending, realizing his stubborness and forgiving the bond and being restored to his place in the community provided a more satisfying result in a comedy?<br /><br />Merchant is as a result of Shakespeare's choice of ending one of if not the most controversial of his major works and is a play that leaves one in doubt regarding an appropriate reaction to it's ending.	2005-02-20

The book is written in a style that most reminds me of sitting at a lecture by a stodgy old professor in a tweed jacket and a pipe who refuses to compromise his language to suit his students but instead insists on them adopting to the academic rigour of his delivery.<br />St. Thomas emerges as the pivotal historical figure that we accept him to be through the fog of Chesterton's writing but also as someone whose relevance to all that came after is indisputable. The parts of the book that contrast the Dominican Thomas with St. Francis are especially entertaining as well as enlightening.<br />A good choice for those with an interest in ST.

As someone who grew up near Times Square I found the photos from the 50's and 60's particularly striking since they reminded me of buildings and landmarks that are now gone.

The main character. Mr. Ives , is a man who has from earliest childhood been given reason after reason to lose faith and yet he is a man who perserveres and finds beauty in life while living a life of faithfulness to his family, friends, coworkers and even many strangers and random characters that he encounters. He is dealt a serious blow with the loss of a child and yet as he struggles to comprehend, and has his moments of severe doubt and depression he remains essentially good and faithful. This man is no mystery though, Hijuelos has created a character of flesh and blood and spirit who reacts to life in ways that ring true and the reader will relate to real people he/she has known.<br />Overall this is a beautiful life affirming story that follows Ives and his small circle through the years and in short episodes at different intervals in time conveys their humanity and struggles so vividly that we come to know them like family by the time we finish.<br />The story is set in Manhattan and the various scenes are also realistically depicted by a writer who obviously knows and loves the city.<br />A remarkable and unforgettable book.	2004-12-27

It's not a chronological first I did this and then I did that type of story but more of an autobiographical musing that jumps around in time and gives some reflection on distinct periods of Bob Dylan's life and what he was thinking and doing at specific points in time.<br /><br />It starts with his arival in Greenwich Village as a young folksinger and is filled with great character sketches and descriptions of places that no longer exist. With language that can be as sparse and yet pregnant with meaning as those of his best lyrics Dylan combines the real experiences with his impressions in a way that puts the reader right there.<br /><br />Another section deals with family life and the downside of fame and celebrity for a man who is obviously very private about his personal life.<br /><br />Yet another section deals with a period where Dylan is recording in New Orleans and it just drips with the atmosphere of New Orleans and Louisiana that he tunes into and describes so well.<br /><br />There is an amazing parade of charcters both well known and obscure and some surprising revelations regarding influences and people Dylan admires, some of whom would not be obvious.<br /><br />For people who love Bob Dylan's music this is a great read that just flows beautifully and is like listening to some of his best tunes.	2004-12-13

It is a unique reading experience that allows the reader to participate in the discovery of new worlds in this manner.	2004-11-27

Prior to reading this my exposure to the issues inherent in some of the biotechnological initiatives discussed here was what is presented/argued about in the mainstream media. Mr. Smith has done an admirable job in describing the details associated with cloning and stem cell research , embryonic as well as adult. His arguments regarding the scientific and ethical dilmma that these potentially powerful technologies represent are thought provoking and logically presented. There is a tremendous amount of misinformation out there regarding these issues on both sides of the argument.

Here is a young girl who is stuggling with family issues, feelings of abandonment and the other normal stresses of adolescence as she at first moves from rural to urban setting in Puerto Rico and then is finally ripped from the life she knows and is transported to an entirely new one in New York City.<br /><br />This memoir of childhood is written in a beautiful almost poetic style and is an absolute pleasure to read. As an adult reader I loved it but I am also giving it to my teenage daughter to read as well since I think the story is inspirational as well as a realistic view into another culture. If I were a teacher this would be on my assigments list.	2004-09-14

At the same time the characters involved both in the statistical sense and in the game itself are colorfully described.<br /><br />This was a wonderful book that entertained and educated on a subject that legions of baseball fans are absorbed in every day. The stats and their development are weaved into the history of baseball creating a unique historical view of the game we love.	2004-09-13

He has blessed us again with this warm and well written memoir that contains a wealth of anecdotes regarding a who's who in American music in the later haalf of the 20th century. George Wein started out as a jazz pianist but his exposure to so many legendary jazz performers brought him to the realization that his talent for the business side of music may have exceeded his actual musical ability. He devoted himself to promoting jazz performances and performers ultimately becoming the driving force behind the famed Newport Jazz Festival. Along the way he has countless stories to share regarding the great legends of jazz with whom he became acquainted. Branching out to promote folk music festivals and having some intersting experiences with the newly emerging Rock culture , George adapted his approach and enjoyed some additional successes. The book includes characters such as Ellington, Basie, Armstrong, Monk, Coltrane, Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, etc, etc.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining book for music lovers of all stripes but will have special significance for the jazz lover since George Wein is clearly a jazz lover and speaks the language. A great book.	2004-08-28

His pace matches the pace of day to day routine that makes up most of the book. The overall impression of how he was transformed gradually by the &quot;JOB&quot; is the most powerful point that the book makes. Conlon's style is perfectly suited to this task. This is not a shoot em up cop book by any stretch although it does have exciting episodes that are described quite well for those seeking that type of book. I found Conlon's work to be a literary journey through the day to day life of a streetcop interspersed with historical and personal insights. The book is a bit slow and the pace of it is a potential drawback to many readers.	2004-08-06

The book is not without it's merits for the jazz lover who enjoys the recordings described. there is some inside info here but not much that couldn't be gathered from reading the excellent liner notes on the cd's themselves. The music captured on the Blue Note label is one of the great joys of my life. The RVG series of reissues on CD are consistently outstanding and capture a cultural period that was almost unbelievable in terms of the talent and creativity being expressed. I bought this book because I couldn't resist the desire to know as much as possible about the period and the personalities involved. The treatment here is adequate at best and at times quite dull. Sorry, but I can't give this more than 3 stars and that is based on the subject matter more than the style in which it is presented.	2004-07-19

That may be true however I believe the book captures the spirit of Billie Holiday as well as the tenor of the times in which she lived and consequently it is an important and very interesting book.<br />The tragedy surrounding Holiday's life and struggle with addiction is well known and yet here it is dealt with in such a gripping and personal way that the story is moving and emotionally wrenching. Billie Holiday emerges from this book as a warm living human being with a remarkable amount of wisdom regarding her own struggles and failings. One would expect an autobiography to seek to afix blame elsewhere or excuse shortcomings. None of that is found here. This was an inteligent, wise and obviously talented though flawed woman whose story deserves to be told.<br />Reading this has rekindled my interest in her music and that alone was a great benefit I received from this book.	2004-07-07

The interviews focus on the behind the scenes controversies as well as the on the field exploits of Dodger teams of the 50's through the 2000 season. For a Dodger fan much of the material is familiar but the book provides a chance to hear the players and front office guys tell their versions in their own words.<br />The Yankees may be the Bronx Zoo and the all-time leaders in colorful characters but the Dodgers certainly are not far behind in that category.<br />I highly recommend this to baseball lovers and particularly to Dodger fans. I learned some new things about the team and I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about Dodger history.	2004-07-04

Drawing on Max Weber, Rubenstein argues that the combination of unrestricted capitalism and protestantism helped to create the conditions necessary for the ultimate form of slavery as expressed in the Nazi death camps. Additional factors include a European trend toward viewing certain segments of a given population as expendable.<br />The analysis is thought provoking and intelligently written. My reservation is that while I agree that viewing the holocaust in this way leads one to the conclusion that under the right circumstances genocide on this scale could happen again , I also believe that there was something uniquely evil in the Nazi leadership that contributed to the Holocaust. Rubenstein's analysis focused on historical/economic/social forces at the expense of the personal responsibilty of Hitler and his inner circle. Despite that this is an important book that should be mandatory reading in any study of the Holocaust.	2004-06-24

The questions may ultimately not have definitive answers but reading this and having Rosenbaum guide us through the various viewpoints is a worthwhile exercise in intellectual and philosophical investigation. The question of whether Hitler was essential to the Holocaust or if in his absence someone else would have set the same events into motion is one example of an unanswerable question that gets considered.<br />The questions surrounding the origins of Hitler's anti-semitism are also explored in detail.<br />There are scholars quoted who adamantly believe that any attempt to understand is misguided because understanding Hitler's motivations is considered by them to be the first step toward rationalization and diminishing the horror of the Holocaust to just a human crime on a larger scale.<br />This is not a biography of Hitler although many critical episodes in his life are referenced. Instead this is a fascinating look at how different perspectives on the nature of Hitler's evil have developed and how in the end there is no comprehensive answer as to the how and why of the suffering he unleashed. THere is a quote used from Primo Levi's book Survival in Auschwitz. Levi suffering from thirst reaches for an icycle. An SS guard knocks it away and Levi asks \\"why ?' The response..\\"there is no why here\\".  I think that story captures some of the spirit of Rosenbaum's book.	2004-05-31

Rather suddenly he found himself in the position of caretaker and personal friend of his musical idol. Powell's circumstances were tragically sad. Barely competent to care for himself at this point in his life he was being verbally and certainly financially abused by a horror of a woman named Buttercup. Largely abandoned by his American friends Powell was living in deplorable conditions when Paudras and he became acquainted. Paudras' devotion to his new friend is a remarkable example of human compassion and love toward another human being. Through his efforts Bud Powell was able to experience some joy in his final years although the shadow of his tragic past was always close at hand. Powell's musical accomplishments are legendary and Paudras' writes with passion and understanding of the depth of Powell's talents and of his incredibly far-reaching influence on so many jazz musicians.<br />This book combines a warm human interest story, albeit with tragic elements, with an examination fo Powell's musical career that results in one of the finest jazz profiles ever published. Highly recommended to anyone remotely interested in jazz. For fans of Powell it is indispensible reading.	2004-04-08

By first laying the groundwork of presenting a parallel examination of Harlem before this period and the black migration to New York he manages to create a fascinating and very readable historical document. The economic forces in play at the time are presented as being equally important to the development of Harlem as the social and political climate of the day. Real Estate speculations and a boom and subsequent bust coincided with the building of mass transit that made the upper reaches of Manhattan more accessable.<br />The book would benefit from the inclusion of some historical photos. However as a pure historical treatise it is extremely informative and readable. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in the history of New York City or Afro- American history. I was traveling down 125th street just yesterday while reading this and the buildings that date from this period held new signifcance for me.	2004-02-23

It is thoroughly researched and doesn't bog down in trivial detail the way many iconographic bios do. About one third of the book consists of a comprhensive discography which is notable for it's objectivity in reviewing all of Monk's recordings. This would be very helpful to anyone looking to begin or expand their Monk collection. The musicians that played with Monk in various sessions are all covered and the circumstances surrounding most of the recordings are adequately described.<br />All in all I think this is a wonderful reference for the jazz lover and a good overview of the life and work of one of the all-time great jazz musicians.	2004-02-23

The shadow of impending doom in the shape of Fidel's revolution slowly but relentlessly advances over this idylic scene and ultimately results in his secure world and his family being torn apart.<br />This book brilliantly combines a distinctly Cuban coming of age tale with a view into Cuba at the time of the revolution as experienced through the eyes of a comfortable middle class child.<br />Eire's writing is so evocative of the feelings he associates with the various episodes in his early life that the reader is drawn into his experience in a very visceral way.<br />I thought this book was beautifully written and at times emotionally wrenching. A wonderful eye-opening read . Highest reccomendation.	2004-02-13

The Alienist is undoubtedly a page turner that has appeal to fans of any of the above styles of fiction, A serial killer is on the loose in turn of the century New York and Caleb Carr takes that premise and utilizes it to great effect incorporating a tour of late 19th century Manhattan life that references many historical personalities and allows the reader to experience the suspense of the investigation through their eyes. At first I was skeptical and the introduction of certain characters such as Theodore Roosevelt seemed contrived but after the first 50 pages or so I was completely absorbed in this fast moving story. There is gore,sexual depravity and violence so if that is not necessarily your thing stay clear. However the Alienist delivers a suspenseful psychological thriller and despite a few gratuitous sidebars (the introduction of Roosevelt's family and children was the worst example, as were the numerous detailed descriptions of Delmonico's menu), to give the story it's historical context the novel is hugely entertaining.	2004-01-13

Citing examples from many of my favorite Allen films and following through on his major premise Baily delivers a fine book that challenged me to look at this films from a new perspective.

It starts innocently enough with the type of sophisticated turn of the century Parisian characters that populate much of his fiction. The characters are lucidly established and we are slowly drawn into their relationships and longings in typical Maugham fashion. Then we are introduced to the strange eccentric character of Oliver Haddo and with each of his subsequent appearances the theme of lurking evil is masterfully developed. The plot then takes over in a way that I felt was unique for Maugham and this novel turns into a suspenseful page turner. It is in someways reminiscent of Dracula. The climax builds relentlessly and the last half of the book is virtually impossible to put down once it's begun. Wonderfully blends a horror tale with the cultural sophistication of all Maugham's writing.	2003-11-09

This &quot;life-force' for lack of a better term is what drove his musicianship to such heights that he is the most revered American musician of the 20th century. While this is no scholalry biography it is written with the feel of an oral history and reading it is much like having Satch relate these tales over a few drinks. Not only does it shed much light on the real person that Louis Armstrong was but it also reflects an era in old New Orleans that is absolutely fascinating to read about in the words of someone who lived there. This is a hugely enjoyable book on numerous levels and for fans of Armstrong it is indispensible.	2003-11-04

Frankly this is a movie waiting to happen.<br />It amazes me that someone would make such a personal sacrifice and take the risk necessary to do this type of undercover work but at the same time Cowan's tale makes you understand to some degree how a detective can get caught up in such an assignment.<br />This is a fabulous read.	2003-10-29

Undoubtedly the A's have had some excellent seasons recently and are once again in the hunt. However the reasons for their success may not be as attributable to the emphasis on OBP and offense built on the analysis presented here as it has been on solid starting pitching. Lewis presents a great case for linking the cold analysis of data to performance and establishes that Bill James and those that followed turned much of conventional baseball wisdom on it's head. It's a great story and any fan of the game will be completely absorbed by it.<br />It amazes me that the rest of the baseball establishment hasn't caught on to Billy Beane's management style and there lies my main problem with this book. Lewis is so enthralled with Beane that he makes it seem that the rest of the baseball world is comprised of a bunch of rubes just waiting to have their pockets picked by the A's. I think the A's have done a fine job and there is no doubt that Beane is the GM of the hour but time will tell if a team run with his system will be able to hang in there with the big-money boys.<br />That said I recommend the book to all baseball nerds because it is entertaining as hell, well written and it will make you think about some of the long held assumptions about the game.	2003-08-11

Set in Kiev in the early 20th century , the novel is both an indictment of racism and a testament to human endurance. Yakov Bok , the fixer is accused of a horrible crime and many seemingly innocuous events are twisted by his accusers to fit their need to persecute a jew for political purposes. As Bok's mental and physical condition deteriorates the language subtly changes to capture his state of mind. Bernard Malamud utilizes this literary device to great effect. We feel Bok's despair and his occassional glimpses of a hope that refuses to die out completely despite the evident hopelessness of his circumstances.<br />This is a wonderful and important contribution to 20th century literature.	2003-07-21

McDonough writes of his experiences in Viet Nam in such straight forward language with little embellishment and an honest and humble attitude. This is one of the best written depictions of combat I've ever read. His experiences commanding a platoon in the heart of VC country surpass anything that has been portrayed by Hollywood in terms of the difficulty of the mission and the horror of day to day survival in a combat situation. This is one gritty and tough account of day to day life in the Viet Nam war that should be widely read. Ranks right up there with Philp Caputo ,Michael Herr, Tim O'Brien and Tobias Wolff as a contribution to the definitive written record of grunt life in the war.	2003-07-03

To the modern ear some of Strachey's language may at times be a bit dry. That aside this is an excellent study of the development of Victoria from infancy to old age. The entanglement's of family and the influence of key ministers is well covered and documented . Especially interesting is the treatment of Prince Albert and the Queen's relationship.<br />I found this to be quite an informative book and would highly recommend it to anyone with a curiosity regarding this period of British history.	2003-06-21

The daughter Catherine is not considered particularly attractive by her father so that when a handsome young man begins to court her the father is imediately suspicious of his motives since Catherine is his only heir.<br />The tension between the father and his daughter is offset by the bond that the Aunt develops with the young man .<br />James allows us to perceive the motivations of each of these primary characters and we come to recognise that Catherine is in fact in danger of being deceived. The father who is not a very sympathetic character is insightful enough to do what is necessary in his view to prevent this.<br />The characters are all well concieved and remain true to type throughout the story.<br />A bonus is the setting of old New York and the scenes of a growing city are vividly drawn. Imagine a time when moving &quot;uptown&quot; meant moving to what is now the Village.<br />Overall I really enjoyed this and would highly recommend it	2003-06-09

This particular book contains several stories that will pull you in and cause you to want to explore more. This is a book that can be opened at random to any of the selections and read with great enjoyment.	2003-06-05

That said it is a rare opportunity to &quot;hear&quot;  Groucho tell some hysterically funny stories and voice his opinions on a variety of subjects in the process. It is valuable as a document regarding the vaudeville years and the early days of Hollywood. So if spending a few evenings reading Groucho's musings isn't enough incentive there is something to be learned here as well. Groucho's writing style is very much like his public personna and he always goes for the laugh in every circumstance. After reading this I visited my local video store to rent some Marx Bros. films. The young lady behind the counter didn't know who the MArx Bros. were !! Either I'm getting really old or she should find a different line of work.	2003-05-21

I can't vouch for the recommendations yet but I will certainly try several of the featured places when I'm there.

This book combines a clear explaination of archaeological methods with the building suspense of a good detective novel. As The author and his team uncover the existence of an early Virginia colony and utilize an astounding range of techniques and research to slowly piece together the lives of the inhabitants you will be drawn into the past. More than that you will be excited to read on and discover with these archaeologists what really happened. I.N. Hume writes eloquently on all aspects of organizing and proceeding with a project of this scale and mixes those details regarding administration and method with the fascinating story of the settlement of Martin's Hundred flawlessly. I could not imagine a better introduction to the discipline of archaeology for the layperson.	2003-05-02

We are drawn into their obsession as they reveal detail after detail about the girls. Despite the seeming revelations the girls remain a mystery and as such continue to haunt the boys into their adulthood. The suicides have the effect of freezing the girls in their youth and consequently the boys can never satisfy their desire to know them other than through the bits and pieces of neighborhood gossip and remnants of the life they left behind which the boys continue to preserve as a shrine to their own unfullfilled youth.<br />The book is a testament of young hormonally driven obsession that is never satisfied and lingers into adulthood.<br />The girls are treated as the objects of that obsession and we only get glimpses of them on their way to their tragic ends.	2003-04-05

This is a very difficult book to put down. Swofford writes with the flair of a novelist using language that is at times poetically vulgar. His depiction of a military life and his indoctrination to it alternate with painfully candid memories of childhood and family life.<br />Jarhead captures the military culture from the bottom up and records the day to day events of the life of a Marine leading up to the first Gulf War. The actual combat like the war itself seems almost anticlimactic after the tremendous buildup. His descriptions of the corpses of Iraqui soldiers that are seemingly everywhere at the close of the war are graphic and shocking.<br />Swofford has a great abilty to blend historical and factual experience with literary talent. This book will be considered a classic of the military memoir genre for years to come.<br />Reading this now as another war rages in the same terrain brings home the reality in a way that news broadcasts even with embedded reporters does not.<br />Swofford writes with the insights and skeptisism of an insider and does show the Corps. warts and all. However unlike some of the other reviewers I found nothing offensive in that. His writing also reveals an implicit pride in having been a Marine and an acknowlegement that the training and equipment of the US military is unsurpassed.	2003-03-29

Nisenson does capture the feelings that I associate with seeing/hearing Sonny Rollins perform live. As other reviewers have said below this is not a comprehensive biography but it is written with a deep appreciation of the music that is Rollins' contribution to the culture. Sonny Rollins is the greatest live performer I've ever seen and this book captures some of that spirit so for me it was a worthwhile read.	2003-03-18

His candor about himself and other luminaries of the jazz world is indispensible reading to jazz fans and anyone with an interest in music. He reveals many unflattering characteristics but also freely praises other musicians with whom he played and clearly describes why they deserve such praise. One can learn a great deal about the creative process and the environment that drove these musicians to explore and expand musically. Miles Davis is equally honest about heroin addiction and his and others struggle to overcome it. Some succeded, many more failed. Characters like Charlie parker, Sonny Rollins, Max Roach, Dizz Gillespie, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane , Monk and countless others float in and out of the story as Miles Davis and others were forming and reforming combinations due to a variety of circumstances. The music scene in New York in the late 40's and early 50's was overflowing with soon to be legendary performers. Davis had a vision of what his music should sound like and he relentlessly pursued that sound through the decades and evolved as an artist moving one step ahead (if not several steps ) of everyone else. I've always loved Davis' music but after reading this it is impossible not to admire the man's artisitc integrity. This guy was clearly a Giant of American music and nothing in this book will diminish his stature artistically. I feel that I understand the records and the context of the music much better for having read this. Highly recommended.	2003-02-03

We meet a diverse group of characters who are revealed through the device of setting them in a game of cards on board ship.<br />Brown, the primary character and narrator is returning to Haiti to reclaim a hotel he inherited and through his eyes we see the political changes occurring in the country and are made aware of the ominous threat of the Tonton Macoute secret police that hangs over the entire story adding dramatic tension.<br />Jones , his fellow passenger is revealed to be a con-man who gets by on his ability to make others laugh (one  of the comedians) . Smith a failed presidential candidate from the US is naively seeking to establish a vegetarian center in Haiti seemingly oblivious to the turmoil all around him.<br />Brown's romance with the wife of a diplomat provides a subplot that mirrors the theme that everyone is deceiving someone. The comedians all prove to be  actors playing on a stage filled with political violence and the everpresent threat of more to come.<br />This was a very engaging novel and if not Greene's most well known book it may  be one of his best. I enjoyed it and highly recommend it for it's memorable characters and stunning evocation of a country approaching chaos.	2003-01-07

The dramatic tension is palpable as the story progresses from the introduction of the various characters and their backgrounds and motivations to the climactic courtroom scenes.

Giddins clearly lays out the reasons why Pops was the greatest influence on modern music that this country has produced. His love for the man and the music comes through on every page. This is a wonderful almost poetic homage to a great and deserving artist. I loved the Bergreen biography and rated that 5 stars as well. That book is a fine chronological story of a fascinating life. This book is a musical biography that truly captures the essence of Louis Armstrong as well as anything written posthumously can be expected to. If you're a fan of Louis Armstrong you cannot afford to miss this. If you are curious as to why Louis Armstrong has become such  an American icon this book will provide the answer.	2002-12-04

The characters are unforgettable and the story unfolds at such a perfect pace. We are introduced and then guided through this intimate family history by Clay-Lee the daughter who shares with the reader the perspective of a child as she describe events and people that are encountered by her parents and their immediate circle. The childhood recollections are structured in such a clever way that the reader anticipates and percieves motivations that are not clearly evident to the young Clay-Lee as narrator. Her &quot;innocence&quot; doesn't prevent us from seeing something more sinsister implicit in the scenes she witnesses.<br />In addition to the wonderful characters and plot the novel has the added quality of just dripping with New Orleans flavor. If you love the city  and are familiar with the settings described the novel provides that added dimension of placing you right there.<br />After finishing this I immediately ordered Bosworth's other novel Slow Poison. She is a fabulous writer.	2002-11-26

Bjorkman asks excellent questions that keep the discussion flowing in a chronological sense yet allow for Woody Allen to address many interssting topics related to his work.<br />The focus here is really the body of work and not Allen's personal life.

Jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness. In him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the Patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation.<br />Conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery, cowardice,guilt and the alternative destinies that an individual may be driven to by these qualities.<br />The narrative can be a bit confusing at times as Marlowe relates the tale by recalling his encounters with Jim. The book reminded very much of Somerset Maugham's THE RAZOR&quot;S EDGE&quot; in style. However I believe that Maugham did a much better job of incorporating the narrator into the flow of the story. Overall LORD JIM is a wonderful classic novel that I highly recommend.	2002-07-17

The story is told through the technique of alternating viewpoints from the the Arab and Jewish sides. The major players in this historical drama are made to breath because their characters are written about with the style of a great historical novel.<br />Absolutely essential reading for an understanding of the foundations of the current situation in the region.<br />The book shows two peoples who are both captive to historical and political forces that set them on a path toward beligerence with each other that seems today to have no end in sight.<br />Both bravery and brutality is displayed by each side as the struggle for control of Jerusalem develops.<br />What is especially disturbing is the inevitability of the conflict that was accepted by both sides from the very beginning. Reading this book now with the events of each day in the news sounding incredibly similar to those that took place in 1948 gives this history remarkable relevance and enabled me to synthesize what is occurring today into a broader historical context.<br />The book is well researched and documented and written in a brisk style that makes it difficult to put down. Highly recommended for a deeper understanding of a troubled region of the world.	2002-04-28

His life in music spans decades and musical styles that makes him unique among American musicians. From Lionel Hampton to Frank Sinatra To Michael Jackson to a seemingly endless list of film and TV scores----Q has seen and done it all musically.<br />The book is very well written and touchingly sentimental in his recollection of deceased family members and friends. At one point I began to wonder if Q ever met a man or a woman he didn't like. He has so much that is positive to say about almost everyone he came into contact with in what is a notoriously sleezy business that I began to wonder if he was just trying to be inoffensive. I concluded at last that this guy is just blessed with a generous heart that allows him to see the best in people. His genuine love of the music and the people who make it with him just jumps off the pages.<br />This is an inspiring story of a man who has overcome considerable obstacles both social and physcial but has retained his essential  positive energy.

The wisdom of this man is clearly reflected here and in other selections that are included. These thought provoking essays and letters contain much that is still relevant. Along with Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, Cicero's writings are a window into the ancient world that helps us to understand how human nature and the problems of living a good life transcend the ages. These are books to return to again and again. The penguin paperback editions are an excellent resource for the general reader and belong on the shelf of anyone interested in philosophy ,history or living well.	2001-12-10

There is much in that regard to entertain fellow road warriors. The down side is that the author tries too hard to humorously satire the world of business consulting and corporate culture. He has less success here and some of the writing leans toward pretentious corporate babble. Binham's inner dialogue runs the gamut from very witty and insightful to just plain boorish. The worst example...&quot;I&quot; I say. &quot;I&quot; I continue. &quot;I&quot; I offer. I pause. (page 267). I kept reading though and found some redeeming moments in the scenes set in Vegas.

Voltaire exemplifies the age of reason in his questioning of both authority and the prevailing beliefs of his day.

It also clearly demonstrates the extent to which terrorism networks have developed and coordinated their strategies with the active participation of Iran and other government sponsors. After reading this it would be hard to support anything short of a multi-front comprehensive campaign to rid the world of ALL the players involved. Bin Laden is portrayed as one cog, albeit an important one , in a much vaster and dangerous movement.<br />Well researched and written by an author who obviously knows the territory.	2001-11-20

The story contains countless episodes of intrigue and salacious details of the Brothel business that make for a very entertaining read. There are other passages that get quite bogged down in detail regarding ancillary characters that don't add much to the narrative flow. Overall Norma Wallace is portrayed very sympathetically and sounds like someone who would be fabulous to have a few drinks with and listen to. However she ends very badly as a victim of her own vanity and insecurity.<br />The descriptions of the French Quarter during the 1st half of the 20th century are great reading for lovers of New Orleans. I'll be sure to walk down Conti St. on my next visit and see if I can find some of the places described in this book.	2001-11-08

He writes most poignantly about the murder of his own daughter and the subsequent trial. A large part of what follows deals with the O. J. Simpson case and contains nothing that hasn't been covered elsewhere. Perhaps enough time has passed since we all overdosed on OJ coverage that it actually is interesting to re-read some of this with the perspective of distance.<br />Some reviewers below have criticised Mr. Dunne for his consistent references to his affluent lifestyle which includes innumerable dinner parties thrown by up-scale people at up-scale restaurants. I don't hold that against him but he is guilty of name-dropping and at times seems overly fixated on the property and lineage of moneyed people. For me this took away some of the potential power of what I believe was a well intended indictment of how ridiculous the American justice system can be at times.	2001-09-18

This book so captures the dreams and longings of people coming of age and finding themselves in terms of careers and loves and then having the rug pulled from under them that it could stand as a testimony for all generations shattered by war. In sometimes heartbreaking and often very poetic language the writer takes you along on a journey of discovery under horrific conditions and the reader is made to understand the remarkable transformations that these young people go through. The fact that the book was written by a young woman and is one of the few war memoirs that reflect a feminine sensibility and perspective serves to make this a unique book in the literature of either World War. Required reading for anyone interested in 20th century history.	2001-08-13

Placed in an appropriate historical context the &quot;rule&quot; is remarkable for its attention to physical and spiritual detail in the structured life of a monastery.

The book effectively describes her progress in establishing convents and monasteries against rather formidable political oppostion but does little to illuminate the nature of her mysticsm. In addition the constant introduction of Spanish phrases seems gratuitous at times as does the introduction of new personalities with little or no background on their connection to Teresa.

The book explores a chapter of WWII history that is not very well known and does so from the perspectives of ordinary people caught up in the swirling events and joined together by a desire to survive as well as by a common hatred of the Nazis. There is an incredible life affirming wedding scene in the midst of countless grim episodes that demonstrates the human capacity of endurance.

The character of Flory who despises the racist hypocrosy of his fellow expats yet is too weak to do anything about it is very well written. Flory is full of contradictions and ultimately these contribute to his tragic downfall. The English &quot;club members&quot; drink and spout racist nonsense while essentially wasting away in a country they really don't understand. A young military officer appears briefly and causes quite a stir since he is judged &quot;worthy&quot; based on title and appearance though in reality he is a lout. The plot builds slowly and Orwell weaves his views on colonialism and racism into the story with great skill.  This is a great novel with a social conscience that I thoroughly enjoyed.	2001-04-05

While clearly this is partially true it isn't necessarily the whole story. For a more balanced life of Bobby Kennedy check out Evan Thomas' more recent biography. This book while interesting grew tiresome for me as a result of the consistent focus on the darker side of Bobby's personality.

The plot weaves through multicultural and cross-generational landscapes that make up the urban environment today. Along the way the reader is given much to consider in terms of relative values. The novel is populated by characters that truly breathe and they include a wide range of types including Islamic fundamentalists,Jehova Witnesses, smug Englishmen,Russian soldiers,rebellious teens,hypocritical adults and a genetically engineered mouse. Each page is an adventure. The story moves from various settings in London to flashback sequences involving WWII, jamaica and Bengal. Yet somehow MS. Smith brings all of these elements together in a tale that entertains us while making us consider how our roots influence us in ways that are not always obvious. In addition the language is witty and at times extremely humorous.This book deserves to be very widely read. An astounding first novel. I would find it more incredible if she has anything left after pouring so much into this one.	2001-03-26

The restaurent reviews were helpful in narrowing down the choices and when I did eat in a place that was reviewed found the reviews to be quite accurate.

Reading it is like sharing a conversation over a brandy with a congenial and intellegient old friend. For fans of Maugham this is an enjoyable read which provides insight into how much of his personal experience is reflected in his works such as Of Human Bondage and Moon and Sixpence. While not necessarily agreeing with him on every point that he makes ,I thoroughly enjoyed the conversation and would deem him a person well worth knowing. Like all his works ,this is extraordinarily well written and lucid. If you are unfamiliar with his novels or short stories or are looking to try reading him for the first time I would recommend starting elsewhere.

He does not lapse into hero worship nor does he attempt to titilate with speculation on Kennedy's affairs as some other writers have done. He presents well researched facts and where the truth is unknowable ...he says so.  What emerges is a view into the character of a man which was large enough to contain many contradictory elements. I finished this book with a renewed feeling of admiration for Bobby Kennedy and the realization that the kind of idealism that he embodied is a quality that our current political and social leaders apparently lack.  Kennedy's complicated personal relationships with his family,political rivals and other prominent personalities of his era are fascinating to read about and the source material is efficiently utilized to enhance a well written narative. This is a fine book that deserves to be widely read.	2001-02-07

An ordinary guy placed in extraordinary circumstances with the ability to record what he witnesses in straightfoward and honest language. Rooney's voice and style from his 60 minutes editorials is evident throughout and in this context the result is a combination of respect for the men Rooney encountered in combat situations and an ability to find humor and irony in those situations as well.

I would have given it 5 stars except for some chapters where references to some of the german literature and poetry escaped me. This book  was an artistically brave effort that works 95% of the time.

This book is fascinating on several levels.  For those who are avid Civil War readers here is an entirely unique  perspective.The descriptions of the hospitals and Whitman's caring  relationships with so many of the wounded are especially moving. I highly  recommend this to anyone with an intersest in the period even if you are  not overly familiar with Whitman's work.	2000-08-20

Isn't that why we read? A great book with  lot's of fascinating details about the technical challenges and the  determination of the Roeblings to see it through. I'll never cross another  suspension bridge without thinking of this story. Highly recommended.	2000-08-20

Theresa Maggio writes beautifully and her  affection for the setting she describes is obvious and contagious.The  fishing details are fascinating but what resonates here is her love of the  place and its people.	2000-08-20

I read this in my 20's and didn't get it. Reading it again 20  years later I found the prose to be less dense and the story stands on it's  own as one of the greatest. Forget the symbolism and enjoy the ride.	2000-08-20

It evokes this setting in beautiful language and through a series of  character sketches. Slowly paced and poetic. A wonderful read.	2000-01-17

The section by George Vancouver was a great find. These accounts  are compiled in a way that flows very naturally from both a chronological  and stylistic view. I enjoyed reading this book very much and would highly  recommend it to my fellow Californians and others interested in this period  of history.	1999-05-22

Turns out he was from Montana and he highly recommended The Big Sky. Several months later I  picked it up and was blown away. What a great adventure story and what  wonderful characters. I am about to begin the sequel &quot;The Way  West&quot; . Much obliged ,stranger for the advice.	1999-03-03

Ali was &quot;THE  GREATEST&quot; in many ways. His influence on not only his own sport but on  the entire culture is evident throughout this well documented and  entertaining book. It is remarkable how much has changed in 35 years.  Remnick brings many of the events of the early 60's clearly into focus. I  found it fascinating to think about the proximity in time of such events as  the Kennedy assassination, the Clay-Liston fight, and the Beatles invasion.  Not that any of these things are necessarily related, but it WAS an amazing  time. The writing here is crisp and the numerous quotes from eyewitnesses  enhance the narrative. Well worth the time.	1998-12-02

It is an inspiring description of Frances' coversion and transformation filled with spiritual insight.I read this in conjunction with Patti Normile's Following St.Francis of Assisi.  The two books provide a wonderful introduction to Franciscan thought and  spirituality	1998-11-14

While some of the biographical background and quotations are interesting,  the main body of this book offers some absolutely silly suggestions for  emulating the thought process of Leonardo. If he were to read this I'm sure  that he and his compatriots would have a good laugh. When I reached the  &quot;exercises&quot; I was reminded of some of the infomercials that  dominate late night TV. I would not be at all surprised to see Gelb hawking  his audio tapes soon. A waste of time. Anyone sincerely interested in  learning about Leonardo would do well to look elsewhere.	1998-10-02

It is an accessable account of Galileo's life for  the general reader that for me captured the essence of the man.	1998-10-02

The description of the personalities involved are excellent  particularly given the author's personal connection to most of them.  Overall an outstanding read. The only drawback is that at times I found the  geography and the various unit displacements hard to follow even with the  sector maps provided.	1998-10-02
