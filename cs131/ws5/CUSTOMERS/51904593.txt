Books on this topic--Christian apologetics--are fairly plentiful, but few of them are as theologically and philosophy astute as this volume. Unlike many introductory to intermediate level books on this topic, Samples articulates a consistently Reformed approach to Christianity (which comports with my own), even offering a concise but astute chapter on the value of creeds to apologetics. I know of no other apologetics book with such a chapter.<br /><br />The book is organized around twenty questions broken into three sections: (1) Thinking Through Questions about Faith in God (2) Thinking Through Questions about Faith in Jesus Christ (3) Thinking Through Objections to Christian Faith. Most all the pertinent topics of apologetics are covered, with a few minor exceptions. The two chapters on the relationship of Christianity to other religions are superb and highly pertinent, since this is one of the major issues facing Christians today. (Even so, many texts on apologetics sadly ignore this issue.) His chapter on Blaise Pascal and the wager was much appreciated by this Pascalian! (See my book, \\"On Pascal.\\")<br /><br />Samples says his apologetic method is \\"eclectic\\" and simply asks us to discover it as he answers questions. That is allowable, but one wishes for a short statement on his basic means of argumentation. Although Samples' chapter on Christianity and science nicely covers the Christian basis of modern science and the problems with scientism, he says nothing directly about the problems with Darwinism (although has some helpful comments about philosophical naturalism, the philosophy that artificially props up Darwinism) or how one might reconcile Genesis and the deliverances of science.<br /><br />But these are minor complaints. \\"Without a Doubt\\" is one of the best one-volume introductions to apologetics published in recent years. May it become a textbook in colleges, seminaries, and churches around the country and the globe. I am using it as a supplemental text for \\"Defending Christian Faith\\" at Denver Seminary.cs published in recent years.

Why are there so few public intellectuals thoughtful Christians? Why is so much preaching so thin, weak, emotional, and decision oriented? Why do many Evangelical seminaries fail to require a basic apologetics class for their Master of Divinity students? Why do Evangelicals typically know nothing of creeds, confessions, and the history of theology or philosophy? And what can be done about this abysmal state of affairs?<br /><br />Nancy Pearcey, an independent writer and editor who formally co-wrote material with Charles Colson, answers these questions in a conversational, anecdote-rich, yet intellectually solid fashion. As student of Francis Schaeffer (and the Reformed Tradition in general), she explains the meaning of a \\"worldview,\\" develops the concept of a Christian worldview, explains why Evangelicals have lost a biblical worldview (creation/fall/redemption) and how their thinking tends to be wrongly divided into the secular and the sacred. But Christ is Lord over the entire creation and Lord over the intellect as well. Thinking well is part of divine worship.<br /><br />Pearcey's treatment of Darwinism and Intelligent design is the best introduction to this vital topic I have seen. She, unlike many Evangelicals, realizes that Darwinism is incompatible with Christianity and that Darwinism is rooted in and fueled by philosophical materialism, not by the empirical facts of science. She has labored fruitfully for many years in this area.<br /><br />I have used \\"Total Truth\\" for a seminary course called Christian Ethics and Modern Culture, although it could be used at the college level as well--or even for more precocious high school students preparing for the intellectual warfare of college life. Even Schaefferites and academic philosophers such as me will find thought-provoking and beneficial material in what is essentially an introductory book.<br /><br />The book, however, is flawed in a few ways. Pearcey at times sounds like a fideist (in spite of herself), especially when she speaks of worldviews being based on what cannot be proven. What she needs is a version of foundationalism in which basic beliefs are either self-evident, logically necessary, inescapable, or incorrigible. Then one reasons from those beliefs to other beliefs. One may then verify or falsify worldviews on the basis of these foundational beliefs. Worldviews can be tested for truth according to (1) the coherence of their defining beliefs (2) the factual adequacy of their claims and (3) whether or not the worldview can be lived out without deep philosophical hypocrisy. Pearcey address this third test very nicely on page 220. Pearcey engages in this type of intellectual critique, but her foundation is wanting in some respects.<br /><br />I could carp about a few other more minor issues, but my primary concern some of her comments on epistemology, as noted. The Dooyeweerdian school from which she draws (and who, along with Van Til, influenced Schaeffer himself) is weak in this area, despite the richness of its critique of non-Christian schools of thought.<br /><br />All in all, I heartily recommend \\"Total Truth\\" as a powerful antidote to \\"truth decay.\\" So, please: Turn off the television, turn off the video games, take out the iPod, and read this book as soon as possible. Then give copies out to your friends.lawed in a few ways. Pearcey at times sounds like a fideist (in spite of herself), especially when she speaks of worldviews being based on what cannot be proven.

The author handles philosophical controversies with clarity and without oversimplication. While not a technical work, Lynch takes the readers fairly deep into the discussions while always trying to explain the pertinence of the issues. For example, if there is no objective truth, how is it possible to \\"speak truth to power\\" or call for moral reform based on moral realities and not just the perspective or preference or language game of the speaker?<br /><br />One drawback is that Lynch's worldview is pervasively secular. He doesn't seem to see that the notion of knowable objective truth is far more \\"at home\\" within a theistic worldview than in a materialistic one in which \\"mind\\" is a mere product of nature (time, chance, brute natural laws, and matter). If we are designed to know the world, our knowledge is metaphysically justified. If not, why think that mindless nature would kick up beings capable of such significant knowledge, that which far transcends what is needed for mere survival?<br /><br />Moreover, the relationship between a belief and its object is not a material relationship. Lynch basically holds to a realist or correspondence view of truth in which a belief is true if it connects with the facts in question. But a belief's content (X is true) is only true if X exists objectively. This is not a causal relationship or a material relationship of any kind. It is the immaterial relationship between a mental state and a state outside the mind (whether material or immaterial--such as a moral principle).<br /><br />Lastly, Lynch's politics intrude at several points. His views are quite left-wing, and often given in an acerbic manner. More conservative ideas are never considered.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Professor Lynch's defense of the existence of objective truth and its value for us is to be commended for its clarity and importance.	2005-02-12

First, it is a near-miracle that the book exists at all, given the fact that the author was struck down with chronic fatigue syndrome (or CFIDS, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome) several years before writing it. Those familiar with this cruel disorder know that mere survival presents a challenge to its sufferers. The rigors of writing a book elude most healthy people. Second, the subject matter is (to my knowledge) unique. There are many books on treating chronic fatigue and coping with chronic fatigue and there are a few books that attempt to help loved ones understand this disorder in order to provide intelligent and caring assistance. However, this is the first book to put the experience of chronic fatigue into a larger cultural and theological framework.<br /><br />There are also numerous books on the problem of evil (of a philosophical and theological bent) and books on the vicissitudes of suffering through evil (of a pastoral and psychological bent). But these efforts nearly always ignore a category of evil and suffering that afflicts millions of people: chronic illness. Those in the vice grip of chronic illness-whether chronic fatigue, lupus, MS, irritable bowel syndrome, or other disabilities-must often endure a double malady. They not only lose their health, their dreams, and any semblance of normal life; they also end up becoming opaque mysteries even to those closest to them. This phenomenon lies in the nature of those chronic illnesses that are \\"invisible\\" to the uncaring eye. An invisible illness is one that is real, but not easily detectable visibly. Many who endure the life sentence of chronic illness \\"look fine\\" but feel miserable-more disconsolate than can be imagined by the those not stricken. Many unsympathetic friends and relatives put pressure on the sufferers to \\"buck up\\" or \\"stop feeling sorry for themselves\\" and \\"just get on with life.\\" After all, they are not in a wheel chair, they can see and hear, they have all their limbs, and they don't have cancer.<br /><br />So, what, exactly, is their problem?<br /><br />James Rotholz writes from a place of understanding and wisdom. Trained as an anthropologist, he knows the dynamics of cultural values. As a Christian, he knows that pain and suffering are part of a universe that groans in travail awaiting its final freedom. He further knows that in Christ there is hope and meaning for even the most debilitated human being. As a chronic fatigue victim, he knows the fear, disappointment, anger, and frustration of this dark fate. After his wife fell ill with chronic fatigue, this young professor succumbed as well. (His wife eventually improved.) He was forced to leave the academy, yet try to provide for his family and carve out a meaningful existence in spite of it all. Rotholz tells his story without lapsing into either self-pity or pious platitudes. Those not touched by chronic illness need to listen to his tale-especially pastors and caregivers. Rotholz grants that many believers and non-believers have suffered nobly. Nevertheless, chronic illness is a bitter pill that must be swallowed again and again.<br /><br />Rotholz's first-person narrative unveils a world of which most people know nothing. It is a world about which many would rather remain oblivious. His account is not a diversion from the unpleasant, but an immersion into the unspeakable. Those who are ignorant-willfully or otherwise-of the sufferings of others are exempting themselves from part of the human condition.  In avoiding knowledge of the experience of pain, such people cheapen their own relatively painless lives.<br /><br />After two chapters explaining his descent into the illness and his coming to terms with it, Rotholz utilizes his anthropological background to reflect on the larger questions of how American culture responds to and evaluates chronic illness. He explores the American \\"cultureof success\\" and how it marginalizes the disabled, who cannot perform economically or culturally in the ways deemed worthy.<br /><br />But Rotholz is not content merely to level accusations at American insensitivity, however needful this is. The remaining chapters present an alternative understanding of worth and meaning before God. Instead of emphasizing material achievement, the Bible calls us to value character and faithfulness. Instead of valorizing the wealthy, the beautiful, and the influential, God calls us to value all people-no matter how lowly-because they bear the image of their Creator. Our ultimate achievements are not quantifiable, but are matters of qualities-qualities of the soul as it rests in and gives glory to God, come what may.<br /><br />Rotholz wrestles with some of the deeper philosophical and theological problems in the concluding chapter, \\"Called to Dignity.\\" Rotholz finds meaning through his suffering in the wise providence of a sometimes mysterious God. As he notes in the previous chapter, \\"A New Vision of Success,\\" naturalism offers exactly no meaning or explanation for human suffering. \\"Any view of human life that is devoid of God must ultimately be dehumanizing, for it means that human life has no real purpose, thus, it is meaningless. Suicide would then become a reasonable response\\" (101).<br /><br />\\"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Christianity, and Culture\\" is not a feel-good, self-help manual. It doesn't tell you how to be \\"successful\\" in a worldly way (or how to be successful in a worldly way while pretending to be spiritual). It is not a \\"success story\\" as our culture defines it. The author is not a celebrity. Instead, this book tackles a subject most people would rather ignore or forget. But never mind that. By composing a contemplative book on a neglected topic, James Rotholz has won a moral and spiritual victory. His readers will find a story that ends not in despair, but in hope.

Recently in the New York Times, William Safire wrote: \\"Here's John Kerry's position on abortion. He's personally opposed to it, and as a matter of faith he believes that life begins at conception. But he's unwilling to impose that faith on women who may not share it. It should be a matter of individual conscience, he says. This position, I submit, is a self-serving and obvious absurdity.\\" Safire is right; this absurdity deserves some scrutiny with respect to both logic and consistency with the religious tradition Kerry owns.<br /><br /> First, if Kerry believes life begins at conception, he must believe that this life is human. What else would it be if not human? Would it be a vegetable? Would it be an insect? Of course, it (he or she) is human! Any biologist will tell you so.<br /><br /> Second, if that unborn life is human, as Kerry must claim, then this is an objective fact. Kerry may be trying to assuage his Catholic conscience (and appeal to Catholic voters), but this is not simply \\"a matter of faith\\" where faith means something divorced from publicly available reason and evidence.  It is a fact of biology. And if one grants human life a unique and incomparable value, then that human life should be protected by culture and by law. Many abolitionists-in Britain and America-opposed slavery for deeply held religious reasons, but that hardly relegated their concerns to matters of private, subject, and socially irrelevant faith.<br /><br /> Third, a statement can be affirmed by religious people and acted on publicly in civil government without any \\"imposition\\" of religion on the state. The Bible clearly affirms the humanity and value of the unborn (Psalm 139:13-16) and prohibits the murder of the innocents (Exodus 20:13). Christians should believe this to be true and pertinent to the legal and moral culture of society. But The Ten Commandments also affirm that theft is wrong. So does our legal system, but this hardly makes America a theocracy.  The First Amendment was never meant to bar religious people from contributing to law and public policy.<br /><br />A wide variety of American citizens of various religions and of no religion oppose America's abortion-on-demand status quo. Why should their voices be silenced while the pro-abortion voice remains the law of the land? All law is based on some moral vision or is enacted to that end.  In a democracy, people advocate laws that reflect their diverse worldviews. There is no reason why Christians-or other religious people-should not be participants in the public square, so long as they abide by legal procedures. Many religious people, myself included, are outraged by John Kerry's positions and do not want them emanating from The White House.<br /><br />John Kerry voted against \\"The unborn victims of violence act.\\" This act refers to \\"the child in utero\\" as \\"a member of the human species,\\" and calls for separate penalties for injury to the mother and to the unborn child. This proves that Kerry's affirmation that life begins at conception has no effect on his politics and shows his true colors. He is not willing to consider even a viable unborn human being worthy of legal protection against violence perpetrated by someone other than the mother.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Kerry also advocates research on embryonic stem cells. This means that he endorses the creation of human life for experimental purposes. Human beings become merely means to an experimental end. What these experiments may yield is uncertain-and stem cells gained without killing human embryos show experimental promise. But the death of the human embryos is not uncertain.<br /><br />Should a man with these illogical commitments be President of the United States? Should John Kerry be trusted to appoint two or three Supreme Court Justices and dozens of federal judges? Should John Kerry control federal stem cell research policy? Think about it-for God's sake and the sake of the unborn.hould John Kerry be trusted to appoint two or three Supreme Court Justices and dozens of federal judges?

It is, rather, a book a of tactics--hard-nosed, winner-take-all, name-calling tactics. Hewitt is right that the Democrats are unfit to rule--especially in wartime, since they do not understand the nature of evil or how to combat it. He is also right that this issue, \\"the war on terror,\\" should be the focal point of the campaign. Let's hope there are scores of \\"9/11 Democrats\\" out there who vote for Bush because they realize that the future of our Republic depends on it.<br /><br />A strong point of the book is that it contains key speeches made by George W. Bush wherein he lays out the key themes in the war on terror. These speeches are thoughtful, on the mark, and winsome. Those that portray the man as unintelligent or ill-informed need to grapple with the content of these addresses and stop relying on throughtless cliches.<br /><br />Hewitt is an insider who knows the angles and seems to know what it takes to win. However, his tone is cocky, matter-of-fact, and often belligerent. Instead of sticking to issues, he often goes after personalities with gratuitous insults. This is not only bad politics, but bad religion. (Hewitt is, like myself, is an Evangelical Christian.) Loving one's enemy doesn't mean voting for him or sugar-coating his political vices, but it does mean refraining from insulting him unnecessarily, especially in print.<br /><br />After a while, the short choppy chapters, the one-sentence paragraphs, the repetition, and the sentence fragments become annoying--as does the know-it-all tone. Even strong opinions can be offered in more gracious ways. But I suppose this is part of the ethos of talk-radio, which is Hewitt's main popular domain. Come to think of it, this book is more like a long monologue on talk radio than a book.<br /><br />One will learn much about power politics here, but not much about developing a principled and thoughtful approach to political theory or discourse.

Moreover, she has done something that very few evangelical women have done: become a professor of theology. In light of this, I wish I could recommend this book, but I cannot.<br /><br /> At the end of the day, and despite her fear of feminism, Sumner seems to be some of an egalitarian, since she claims women can teach and lead along with men. However, one is not entirely sure, given the fuzziness of this frustrating book. Clear compelling arguments are absent.<br /><br /> The style of the book can be grating on reader. Throughout the book, Sumner makes numerous unnecessary personal comments that are often embarrassing. One can forgive a few such comments, but this book is filled with them. Knowing Sumner's story (as a women in the church who is called to lead) relates to the subject of this book; knowing too much about Sumner detracts from the book.<br /><br />But on to content. Sumner is simply not clear on the basic themes necessary to navigate this issue: the creation order, the notion of the male being the head, the effects of the fall, and the nature of the various kinds of feminism (for her, they are all equally bad). She meanders more than she argues.<br /><br />Moreover, Sumner misrepresents the position of a key thinker in this debate, Rebecca Merrill Groothuis, by claiming that she puts a cultural view of gender above biblical authority. This is flatly false. This criticism is often leveled by traditionalists (such as the Thomas Schreiner) and reveals an avoidance of Groothuis's actual arguments. (It is a sad truth that no traditionalist has yet responded to Groothuis's careful arguments, especially her case that a woman cannot be equal to a man but unequal in terms of leadership roles--as the traditionalists claim.) Sumner does not appear to be a traditionalist, but she still misrepresents Groothuis.<br /><br />The one strength of the book is Sumner's plea that Christian women dress and act modestly. Immodestry is a terrible blind spot in the church and the cause of unnecessary problems between men and women. Worldliness is rampant in this area and repentance is required.<br /><br />If one wants to get clear on the essential philosophical, theological, and exegetical issues and arguments of the gender debate, one is better off reading egalitarian authors such as Groothuis, Craig Keener, and Gordon Fee.

Few resources are available to help them. This ought not be. But this book, despite its promising title, will not provided desperately needed help for those who attempt to minister to their chronically ill spouses.<br /><br />The reason is simple. The most important reality for handling chronic illness is ongoing love and commitment, despite the pain, frustration, and anger. In chapter three, Mrs. McGonigle condones adultery when the well partner has had enough and needs to have her or his sexual and emotional \\"needs\\" met by another man or woman. She even admits to committing adultery herself-during a one-year \\"affair\\"-and justifies this in self-deceptive ways. Her husband supposedly tacitly allowed for it. She even claims that this betrayal ended up strengthening her relationship to him. That is utter garbage.<br /><br />The wedding vows do not allow for that serve-serving and sinful path of destruction. Yes, living with the chronically ill is hell. One often does not know how cope. Nevertheless, the path of virtue demands faithfulness. Would Mrs. McGonigle have allowed for her husband to commit adultery if she had been the one with a chronic illness? If so, the debauchery only intensifies. For a more faithful response to chronic illness, read \\"Beyond Chaos\\" by Greg Phiburn.	2004-07-01

Did Jesus exist?<br />2. Did Jesus claim to be God?<br />3. Did Jesus rise from the dead?<br />Few today worry about question #1, but since some make the case he did not exist (such as Michael Martin in &quot;The Case Against Christianity&quot;), the material is pertinent and telling. Extra-biblical sources confirm the existence of Jesus, let along the New Testament materials (which are very well attested in their own right).<br />Harris marshalls an impressive case that Jesus claimed to be God, both directly and indirectly. For a more scholarly defense see Harris's, &quot;Jesus as God.&quot;<br />The chapter on the resurrection of Jesus takes the form of a dialogue, and may not be quite as effective as straightword prose. Nevertheless, the case is strong and solid once again.<br />This is an excellent book for Christians who want to sure up their faith against attack and doubts--and all Christians should be so concerned!

As much a critique of France as it is a defense of America, &quot;Anti-Americanism&quot; takes apart the most common accusations of the left against America--without lapsing into sychophantic rave about the world's only superpower. Revel has a strong historical memory and an absolute intollerance for cant and hypocrisy of any kind. He is often witty and sardonic--an appropiate touch then addressing some of the ridiculous anti-American chargs.<br />He reminds us that in the Twentieth Century, America saved Europe--and the planet--from two brutal dictatorships, both of which were generated in Europe: Nazism and Communionism. He also defends the broad outlines of the present &quot;war on terror,&quot; and speaks the truth about the Islamic threat to democracy in America, Europe, and worldwide.<br />Revel did not completely convince me of the goodness of globalization, but, nevertheless, he refutes extemist and uninformed criticisms of it by pointing out some of its salutary effects for third world countries (not just America).<br />If you are tired of &quot;the world according to the New York Times,&quot; then read and savor this book. Apparently, not all French people are unhinged when it comes to geopolitical matters. (And how can we really hate the country that both gave us Blaise Pascal and savors and supports jazz as it does?)<br />Douglas Groothuis	2004-01-24

Since I assiduously avoid direct contact with most of it (particularly movies and television), I learned a considerable amount about the rampant diseases that surround us. Hence, I award two stars instead of one.<br />However, the reader is left without any discernible theology of popular culture based on a biblical worldview. While the authors are associated with conservative Protestant schools, their approach is that of the archetypical theological liberal: Let's see what's happening in popular culture and make that the model for theologizing and encountering culture. Or, \\"The world sets the agenda for the church.\\" They want to contruct a theology \\"out of popular culture\\" and refuse to theologize about popular culture from a biblical vantage point. The result is (1) an avoidance of the widespread moral and intellectual debachery that pervades popular culture and (2) a grasping at straws to find anything remotely like a biblical theme within it. For example, they attempt to draw out a profound idea from the scatological perverse and adolescent Austin Powers film. The result is embarrassing if not sacrilegious.<br />There is no sense of critique or antithesis regarding the wanton and gratituous violence of much of cinema, the schatological hate-mongering of much of rap (the infamous Eminem is mentioned, but never criticized), the pure vapidity of contemporary celebrity (they, in fact, try to redeem the idea--vapidly), and so on. The only outrage they can seem to muster is over the greed that has engulfed modern team sports. (Such greed expressed by musical and film celebrities is not mentioned.) Exteme sports, however, generates a smile from them--despite the fact that it often symbolizes narcissism on steroids with no concern for one's safety (or even that of innocent bystanders). One searches the book in vain to find any discussion of the concept of worldiness (see Romans 12:1-2; 1 John 2:15-17).<br />These supposedly Protestant authors repeatedly bash Reformed thought and practice for its iconoclasm and emphasis on written communication--the Word. The authors embrace an avowedly Roman Catholic sensibility of the image as sacramental (even outside the church) with no worries about sanctioning idolatry or about the inherent conceptual limits of images to convey truth. For a wiser response, read Arthur Hunt's, \\"The Vanishing Word\\" (Crossway, 2003). Tellingly, the authors bring up the most imporant book ever written on televison--Neil Postman's \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death (1985)\\"--only to dismiss it without an argument. The attitude is this: \\"Well, we cannot stop it, so let's learn to adjust to it.\\" Never! One should refuse this counsel of despair--and read Postman (d. 2003) if you have not already.<br />All in all, I was repeatedly outraged by \\"A Matrix of Meanings\\" for the reasons cited above--and many, many more. My wife begged me to stop reading it, since I was sounding off about it constantly for days. Adding to the discomfort was a glib, ever-so-hip style adopted by the authors.

US	51904593	RCRK92HFB94CI	1581344457	636780015	Jesus Driven Ministry	Books	5	31	32	N	N	Inspiring study of the Gospel of Mark.	Ajith Fernando is a native of Sri Lanka and a prolific writer on biblical, apologetic, and cultural themes. Like John Stott, his books are usually organized around the exposition of biblical texts. For example, his excellent work, &quot;Sharing the Truth in Love: How to Relate to People of Other Faiths&quot; (Discovering House Publishers, 2001), follows the structure of Paul's great address to the Athenians in Acts chapter 17. &quot;Jesus Driven Ministry&quot; follows the structure of the Gospel of Mark, but adds many elaborations from other biblical texts and anecdotes from Fernando's active and challenging ministry with Youth for Christ in Sri Lanka. Fernando believes that the way in which Jesus and the disciples practiced ministry remains a model for contemporary Christians in every culture. This is a simple but ultimately radical thesis.<br />As a Sri Lankan who received his theological training in the United States and who often lectures here (including Denver Seminary), Fernando is privy to cross-cultural and deeply biblical insights that evangelicals need to hear and heed. His fourteen chapters address the following issues in profound ways: the need to identify with the people to whom one ministers, spiritual empowerment for ministry, the importance of recognizing God's affirmation of us in Christ, the significance of retreating from ministry activity periodically, affirming the will of God, being saturated in Scripture for godly ministry, \\"facing wild animals\\" (or opponents to ministry); bearing the good news, growing a team of leaders, discipling younger leaders, sending disciples into ministry, ministering to the sick and demon possessed, visiting homes, and prayer. Interestingly, many of these obviously biblical and deeply pertinent themes receive scant attention in contemporary evangelical books on leadership and ministry. Or, if the matters are addressed, they are often broached without close attention to how Jesus and his first disciples conducted themselves. Business models may even usupt biblical patterns of ministry. But Fernando's great strength is plumbing the depths of the biblical narrative, illustrating its themes from great biographies and from his own active life, and developing sensible-if not always comfortable-advice for ministry.<br />While never acerbic and always wisely pastoral, Fernando is critical of many contemporary models of church growth and outreach that he takes to be sub-biblical or even anti-biblical because they stress sociological methodology over biblical strategies. One such passage deserves full quotation. \\"We are seeing more and more people today who are moved to churches `where they feel more comfortable.' When did comfort become such a high value in ministry and church life? Was it when we left the path of biblical Christianity? The gospel is too radical and the needs of the world too urgent for us to ever be comfortable! But many Christians today have come to think that a major goal of the church is to entertain people and supply them with services that they want, such as a good youth program or music program. In such an environment, we are going to see people moving to churches where they are comfortable. The result will be that churches are going to miss out on some vital sources of enrichment through discomfort. They will become unhealthy by missing out on biblical wholeness. Biblical churches always are uncomfortable places because they are always looking for biblical wholeness\\" (page 197).<br />This is merely a small taste of the large wisdom of this timely and insightful book. I urge every Christian leader to read it prayerfully and thoughtfully and to apply its lessons to life. Then go read all of Mr. Fernando's other books!<br />Douglas Groothuis, Denver Seminaryselves.

He not only surveys the material, but advocates the just war position as biblically sound and morally superior to its rivals. In this, he appeals principally to Ambrose, Augustine, Aquinas, and Calvin. Cole challenges the commonly asserted idea that pacifism was the dominant position in the first three centuries of Christianity. Although the position was voiced by some, it was not the consensus. As Cole notes, \\"We have little evidence that any early Church Father (besides Tertullian, who was later declared a heretic) held an unambiguously negative view of war. In fact, there little evidence of any unified Christian attitude toward war during the earlier years of the Church era. It simply cannot be demonstrated that early Christians, in general, viewed either the military or the state as inherently evil, and hence completely off-limits to their participation\\" (p. 8). While the Christian understanding of just war was first developed principally by Ambrose (339-397) and more systematically by the great Augustine (354-430) in the early part of the Fourth Century, seeds of the idea can be found much earlier.<br />Cole notes that both Christian pacifists and Christian realists (such as Reinhold Niebuhr) \\"are in agreement about an essential point: Both assert that all use of force is evil and that the teachings of Christ forbid violence\\" (p. 7). The pacifist, therefore, shuns all military involvement, while the realist sanctions war only as a \\"lesser of two evils.\\" Cole, and the just war tradition, employs another approach by arguing that the use of force is sometimes virtuous, not merely necessary. That is, some situations demand a proper use of force in the name of love and for the glory of God. It is true that there would be no war in a world without sin (see James 4:1-2), but in this sinful world force is sometimes required to protect the innocent and to right terrible wrongs. It can be, in fact, a positive good in a bad world. \\"Modern Christian pacifists have argued that a presumption against violence is what led Christians to create just war criteria in the first place. But this claim is historically false. Christians did not create just war criteria out of a disregard for violence but because they wished to bring some sort of justice and order to this temporal existence. Aquinas and Calvin certainly knew of no such presumption against violence\\" (p. 71).<br />Pacifists argue that Christ's meekness under persecution is the normative model for all Christians with respect to war, and that his teachings in the Sermon on the Mount exclude any use of force. But Cole argues from Scripture and from leading theologians that this interpretation is mistaken. He cites Calvin to good effect on this issue. \\"For Calvin, Christ's pacific nature carries little normative weight for Christians, for that pacific nature is located in Christ's priestly office or reconciliation and intercession-an office that Christians can in no way fulfill or reproduce. Christ's pacific nature-His willingness to suffer death at the hands of unjust authorities both Jewish and Roman-is inextricably tied to His role as Redeemer and is not meant to be a complete model for Christian behavior. No Christian can follow Christ as Redeemer, but all can follow Christ as One who obeys the commands of his Father\\" (p. 75).<br />What are the criteria for a just war? The first set of criteria address the question of when to go to war (or jus ad bellum). Although Cole does not explicitly put it this way, each of these five criteria are necessary for stipulating a just war. Jointly all given criteria are sufficient for establishing a just war. First, proper authority must be used in declaring and carrying out a war. A band of rebels with no social standing cannot do this. Secondly, there must be a just cause. Expropriating land from another nation for simply in order to broaden a nation's wealth and influence (consider Iraq's invasion of Kuwait) fails this test. Defending a nation's borders against attack would pass the test. Third, a right intention should govern the leaders who degree the war. Fourth, because it involves so much suffering and death, war should be the only way to right the wrong in question. So, if other reasonable courses of action fail to achieve the just goals-such economic sanctions, mobilizing world opinion, or threats of force-war is justified. Fifth, there must be a reasonable hope of success in warfare. Otherwise, it is pointless and merely destructive.<br />The second set of criteria concerns how war should be fought in order to be just (or jus in bello). Again, each of these three criteria are necessary for stipulating a just war. Jointly they provide sufficient criteria for conducting a just war. First, the most overarching principle is that there should be no consent to evil. That is, we should never do evil that good may come (see Romans 6:1-2). If any act is intrinsically evil (such as rape), it is not allowed in warfare. The two following rules flow from the first principle and are interrelated. Second, discrimination should be used in warfare such that noncombatants are not deliberately targeted. This is also called noncombatant immunity. Third, the use of force should be proportional to the ends desired. An entire town should not be destroyed to neutralize a weapons facility, for example. (This act would also be barred under the criterion of noncombatant immunity.)<br />Cole takes these just war principles-which he defends on the basis of both Scripture and the work of orthodox theologians-and briefly applies them to the specific cases of World War II, the Vietnam War, as well as to the war on terrorism. These reflections are significant, if not entirely adequate for the depth of the subjects addressed.

In an age of pugnacious pundits, Bernard Lewis-a professor emeritus from Princeton-is a genuine scholar. He writes with eloquence, tact, and measured judgment. After a distinguished career as an historian of the Middle East, he has in recent years been called upon to provide perspective on the animosity between much of Islam and the West. This cannot be done in sound bites, but in 184 pages Professor Lewis succeeds admirably in summarizing and explaining the last 1400 years of Islamic-Western relations. He clears up a number of commonly held confusions and misrepresentations of Islam without sugar coating the dangers the world faces from Islamic terrorism. As such, The Crisis of Islam is a valuable primer for those seeking to make some sense of geopolitical events after September 11.<br />Lewis states that Muslims have long memories and root their present ambitions in their perceptions of both the recent and the very distant past. In a video from October 7, 2001, Osama bin Ladin spoke of the \\"humiliation and disgrace\\" suffered by Islam for \\"more than eighty years\\" (xv). While most Americas wondered what this might mean, Lewis points out that bin Ladin's Muslim listeners \\"picked up the allusion immediately and appreciated its significance\\" (xvi). In 1918 the Ottoman Empire, ruled by a Muslim sultan (or caliph), was defeated and its capital, Constantinople, was occupied. The empire's land was parceled out to the British and French empires. To Muslims, this was an unanticipated and unparalled reversal of their long history of global conquests, since for \\"Muslims, no piece of land once added to the realm of Islam can ever be finally renounced\\" (xxviii-xxix). This loss of social and religious influence in the face of the global influence of non-Muslim nations (particularly America) is in large part what constitutes \\"the crisis of Islam\\" today.<br />Muhammad, despite early setbacks in Mecca, was a very successful religious reformer, businessman, statesman, and warrior. The Qur'an proclaims Islam as the culminating manifestation of ancient monotheism that is destined to cover the earth. Lewis notes that \\"in Muslim tradition, the world is divided into two houses: the House of Islam (Dar al-Islam), in which Muslim governments rule and Muslim law prevails, and the House of War (Dar al-Harb), the rest of the world, still inhabited and, more important, ruled by infidels\\" (31).<br />We often hear from Western analysts that \\"jihad\\" primarily means an inner struggle for religious purity, but Lewis disagrees. For the majority of Muslim history, Jihad has been interpreted \\"to mean armed struggle for the defense and advancement of Islam\\" (31). The \\"presumption is that the duty of jihad will continue, interrupted only by truces, until all the world either adopts the Muslim faith or submits to Muslim rule\\" (31-32).<br />But does the concept of jihad justify the fury let loose against America on September 11, 2001? Lewis thinks not. He cites an hadith (an influential saying of the prophet recorded outside the Qur'an), where suicide is said to be \\"punished by eternal damnation in the form of the endless repetition of the act by which the [person] killed himself\\" (153). Modern Islamic terrorists today differ from the traditional Muslim martyr who was \\"willing to face certain death at the hand of his enemies or captors\\" (152-153), but not to be the direct cause of his own death. Thus, the September 11 terrorist attacks had \\"no justification in Islamic doctrine or law and no precedent in Islamic history\\" (154). One hopes Lewis is right, but how many Muslims worldwide are as knowledgeable of their own tradition as this scholar? Tragically, many seem more willing to heed the violent interpretations and pronouncements of Osama bin Ladin and cohorts.<br />Lewis is neither an apologistfor the West, nor an antagonist of Islam. He is rather a learned and fair-minded scholar whose reflections on these vexing issues are urgently needed today.<br />Douglas Groothuis, Denver Seminaryfor the West, nor an antagonist of Islam.

To that end, the author-an External Examiner of Philosophy for the European baccalaureate and the author of two previous books-(1) explores the lineaments of non-theistic religion and (2) mounts a case against all forms of theism, but particularly against Christianity. This review will prove inadequate to detail the book's plethora of contradictions, misstatements, and otherwise objectionable elements. Billington makes many uncharitable and unduly hostile remarks against theism and Christianity, such as speaking of evangelical enthusiasm as \\"religious masturbation\\" (138). One also finds many unsupported and even farcical statements such as, \\"The Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:7) is, in fact, a magnificent description of the way of Zen\\" (129).<br />Billington proceeds on the assumption that \\"God is dead\\" in the Nietzschean sense. The concept of personal God has little purchase for contemporary thoughtful people (at least those like himself). He seems to think that the brute fact of the secularization of the West presents reasons to abandon theism. But secularization is not a worldwide phenomenon (as the growth of third world Christianity evidences), and one cannot deduce a philosophical conclusion from cultural tendencies. One needs solid arguments for that. But unlike Nietzsche, Billington does not abandon religion entirely, but promotes \\"religion without God.\\" He gleans eclectically insights from several traditions, but seems particularly found of Taoism, claiming that \\"the Tao Te Ching is a book which expresses genuine religion more comprehensively than any of the scriptures produced by the Semites\\" (127), although is not taken as \\"a religious icon.\\"<br />Billington is quite dismissive of the positive arguments for monotheism (33-40). His presentation of theistic arguments is tendentious and clumsy, and he fails to note the significant work done in natural theology in the past few decades by virtuoso analytic philosophers such as Richard Swinburne, William Lane Craig, and J.P. Moreland. Versions of the cosmological, design, and moral arguments-among others-are flourishing. Billington does not engage these arguments, but ignore them. From another angle, the Reformed epistemology movement (lead by Alvin Plantinga) argues that natural theology is not required for rational belief in the Christian God (although Plantinga himself has revived a highly sophisticated, modal version of the ontological argument). This significant, well-recognized, and well-documented research program is entirely overlooked by Billington.<br />Second, Billington is incautious in his handling of the mystical elements of various religions. He merely asserts-rather than argues-that the nontheistic mystical elements various religions are \\"higher\\" than the theistic experiences found in many religious traditions (47). In the classic study \\"Mysticism: Sacred and Profane\\" (1957), R.C. Zaehner provided three distinct categories of mysticism: (1) nature mysticism (Wordsworth), (2) monistic (or nondualistic) mysticism, and (3) theistic mysticism. Billington seems to conflate the first two categories, while largely ignoring-or dismissing-the third as a live option. Billington's thinking is an example of the \\"perennial philosophy\\" approach that attempts to isolate an experiential or doctrinal core supposedly found in all religions (monism), which then becomes the normative principle for religious evaluation. Hence, the rejection of theistic mystical experiences as substandard by definition. (On this questionable approach, see W.T. Stace, \\"Mysticism and Philosophy\\" [1960] and Aldous Huxley, \\"The Perennial Philosophy\\" [1944].)<br />Having unfairly rejected the positive case for monotheism based on theistic arguments and having marginalized the theistic elements of mysticism, Billington builds his argument for religion without God almost entirely on certain nontheistic mystical experiences. Here, too, he ignores a large body of philosophical arguments for theism that are based on theistic religious experiences. Especially noteworthy here is the work of Keith Yandell and William Alston. The fact is that the arguments for some cases of theistic mysticism being veridical (or truth-conveying) is much stronger than those made on behalf of nontheistic mysticism, which are critically flawed.<br />Billington, like other perennialists, repeatedly claims that genuine mystical experience is ineffable (beyond thoughts, concepts, and language). Related to this, he is fond of the epigram from the \\"Tao Te Ching\\": \\"The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal Name\\" (81). Instead of describing a personal and relational being who is distinct from the one having the religious experience (as in monotheistic mysticism), the nontheistic mystical experience is said to be ineffable because the personality of the subject drops away into the nontheistic and nondualistic mystical reality, which eludes rational elaboration in principle. However, if the experience itself is incapable of being explained in conceptual and rational terms, it necessarily lacks any argumentative power. A rational argument requires coherent and factual premises that lead to a conclusion through some pattern of argument (whether inductive, deductive, or abductive). No such premises and no argument form are available for nontheistic mysticism if ineffability is invoked. Ironically, Billington criticizes theistic concepts as too vague to be very meaningful (4) and then turns around and claims that nontheistic mystical experiences are beyond rationality entirely (58). This is surely inconsistent.<br />On the other hand, theistic mystical experiences (as well as other non-mystical kinds of religious experiences) can be used as evidence for belief in God, since the object of the experience does not utterly transcend conceptuality or rationality. Moreover, the individuality and personality of the experiencer does not drop out of the picture, but remains intact. In other words, the subject-object relationship still holds, thus opening the door to coherent accounts of the experience.<br />Billington's attempt to advocate religion without God, scripture, religious exemplars, objective morality, and even truth is a peculiar hybrid of anti-theistic zeal and mystical enthusiasm, but it fails to achieve anything close to a convincing argument.<br />Douglas Groothuis, Denver Seminarytirely on certain nontheistic mystical experiences.

In 1918 the Ottoman Empire, ruled by a Muslim sultan (or caliph), was defeated and its capital, Constantinople, was occupied. The empire's land was parceled out to the British and French empires. To Muslims, this was an unanticipated and unparalled reversal of their long history of global conquests, since for \\"Muslims, no piece of land once added to the realm of Islam can ever be finally renounced\\" (xxviii-xxix). This loss of social and religious influence in the face of the global influence of non-Muslim nations (particularly America) is in large part what constitutes \\"the crisis of Islam\\" today.<br />Muhammad, despite early setbacks in Mecca, was a very successful religious reformer, businessman, statesman, and warrior. The Qur'an proclaims Islam as the culminating manifestation of ancient monotheism that is destined to cover the earth. Lewis notes that \\"in Muslim tradition, the world is divided into two houses: the House of Islam (Dar al-Islam), in which Muslim governments rule and Muslim law prevails, and the House of War (Dar al-Harb), the rest of the world, still inhabited and, more important, ruled by infidels\\" (31). <br />We often hear from Western analysts that \\"jihad\\" primarily means an inner struggle for religious purity, but Lewis disagrees. For the majority of Muslim history, Jihad has been interpreted \\"to mean armed struggle for the defense and advancement of Islam\\" (31). The \\"presumption is that the duty of jihad will continue, interrupted only by truces, until all the world either adopts the Muslim faith or submits to Muslim rule\\" (31-32).<br />But does the concept of jihad justify the fury let loose against America on September 11, 2001? Lewis thinks not. He cites an hadith (an influential saying of the prophet recorded outside the Qur'an), where suicide is said to be \\"punished by eternal damnation in the form of the endless repetition of the act by which the [person] killed himself\\" (153). Modern Islamic terrorists today differ from the traditional Muslim martyr who was \\"willing to face certain death at the hand of his enemies or captors\\" (152-153), but not to be the direct cause of his own death. Thus, the September 11 terrorist attacks had \\"no justification in Islamic doctrine or law and no precedent in Islamic history\\" (154). One hopes Lewis is right, but how many Muslims worldwide are as knowledgeable of their own tradition as this scholar? Tragically, many seem more willing to heed the violent interpretations and pronouncements of Osama bin Ladin and cohorts.<br />Lewis is neither an apologistfor the West, nor an antagonist of Islam. He is rather a learned and fair-minded scholar whose reflections on these vexing issues are urgently needed today.<br />--Douglas Groothuis is Professor of Philosophy at Denver Seminary	2003-08-15

In several books written in the 1990s, beginning with \\"Roaring Lambs\\" (1993), he admonished Christians to be saltier and more visible in contemporary culture. He thus challenged disciples of Jesus to make their presence better known in the media, the arts, and education. In other words, they should be \\"roaring lambs\\" - notable, but meek and Christ-like. He discouraged Christians from claiming victim status or complaining about cultural disintegration when they were doing almost nothing to inject a Christian worldview and ethic into their culture.<br />This was Briner's last book, completed by others after his death in 1999. He chides Christians that \\"we are the problem\\" (chapter one). \\"We haven't given our country the opportunity even to reject the truth of Scripture because we have rarely been in the place even to offer it. In this way, we have not shown up. We have failed America\\" (page 10). Instead of trying to \\"win a culture war\\" (and defeat our \\"enemies\\"), we should offer hope and truth to the world, as Christ did. From a wealth of personal experience, Briner urges Christians to engage in intelligent, active, and effective involvement in the media and the arts. Christian educators should \\"raise the bar\\" of excellence and challenge their students to permeate their culture for the glory of God. Moreover (this warmed by curmudgeonly heart), they should insist on the proper use of English - in both writing and speaking - when linguistic laziness is winning (and debasing) the day.<br />I applaud most everything in this stimulating and challenging book. As Os Guinness (read all of his books!) says, the problem is not that there are not enough Christians, but that they are not Christian enough where they are! That was Briner's basic message, and it desperately needs to be heard and heeded, especially as American culture moves increasingly away from a Christian ethic and worldview and instead embraces all manner of debauchery and degradation.<br />Nevertheless, Briner is sometimes overly simplistic, as when he says we are not called to reform society by changing laws but to be salt and light. Both, in fact, are needed. Laws may be unjust and oppressive; if so, they need to be changed for the good of society. Remember the civil rights movement! When Briner writes of a Christian presence in music he seems to assume that musical forms are morally neutral and that Christian content and character is what matters. I agree with Ken Myers (see his \\"All God's Children and Blue Suede Shoes\\") that cultural forms are every bit as important as content. We must labor to make both form and content as honoring to God as possible.<br />These criticisms do not counterbalance the overall value of this book to educate and mobilize Christians to be all that their Lord called them to be.<br />--Douglas Groothuis, Denver Seminaryiew and instead embraces all manner of debauchery and degradation.<br />Nevertheless, Briner is sometimes overly simplistic, as when he says we are not called to reform society by changing laws but to be salt and light.

One oft-repeated story is that all challenges to Darwinism are merely religiously motivated and hopelessly unscientific. Science is about objective facts. Religion is about subjective values. Darwinism is scientific. Challenges to Darwinism are not scientific and so have no place in any public institution. This standard story is being upended by lawyers, scientists, and philosophers who claim that Darwinism fails the tests of good science. These thinkers, who are neither theologians nor preachers, make up the Intelligent Design (ID) movement, which is chronicled in this important book written by a professor at Trinity College in Florida.<br />Woodward's account shows that the problem with the template of \\"religion versus Darwin\\" is that it simply doesn't fit the ID movement, although many detractors try to insist otherwise. The founder of the movement, Phillip Johnson, was, until his recent retirement, a Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley. While on sabbatical in the late 1980s, he studied the scientific case for and against Darwinism and concluded that the empirical case for Darwinism was surprisingly weak. He then presented his findings at a symposium held through his law school and was further encouraged to pursue his criticism of Darwinism. As Woodward amply documents, the proponents of this movement-which include a biochemist (Michael Behe) as well as a philosopher of mathematics (William Dembski)-have \\"doubts about Darwin\\" based on their investigation of the empirical evidence. Proponents of ID argue that Darwinism lacks crucial evidence, begs important questions, and often caricatures alternatives unfairly. ...<br />The proponents of ID make their case against Darwinian evolution by pointing out flaws in the arguments and gaps in the evidence, not by citing religious texts. ..Rather, ID thinkers are a diverse group united primarily in their belief that Darwinism is not beyond the reach of scientific criticism. ... Chance and necessity alone, they argue, do not provide sufficient scientific categories for explaining the origin of complex living systems such as DNA and the bacterial flagellum (a microscopic rotary motor). The scientific and philosophical establishment is beginning to interact seriously with ID claims in academic journals and at conferences, although it is still often dismissed as \\"unscientific.\\"<br />There are a growing number of books defending and criticizing ID, but Woodward's book is unique in that it assesses the history of this movement of the past decade-or-so from the perspective of the classical discipline of rhetoric. Given the book's rhetorical angle, the reader is treated to both the straight arguments for and against Darwinism, as well as an inside look at the personalities and persuasive strategies used on both sides of the debate. (For example, when noted Darwinist Stephen Jay Gould first met Phillip Johnson, he dispensed with pleasantries and said, \\"You're a creationist and I've got to stop you.\\") In Woodward's account, Johnson emerges as the rhetorical mastermind of ID, who, though an outsider to the scientific guild, nevertheless mastered the scientific case against Darwinism and helped develop a consistent strategy for the ID movement. His simple charge is that Darwinism is driven more by a commitment to a materialistic worldview than by the actual evidence of biology. If one admits the category of intelligent design back into science, the case for Darwinism crumbles-or so Johnson claims.<br />While Woodward is a friend of the Intelligent Design movement, he lets the thinkers speak for themselves and is neither partisan nor unfair. Rather, without getting too technical, he frames the debate in terms of rhetorical strategies employed. In this way, the reader can discover the larger intellectual, historical, emotional, and cultural contours of this growing debate-which, I wager, is not about to go away any time soon.<br /><br />--Douglas Groothuis, Ph.D., is Professor of Philosophy at Denver Seminary and the author of \\"On Pascal.\\"rofessor of Philosophy at Denver Seminary and the author of \\"On Pascal.\\"	2003-07-31

Beckwith is uniquely equipped in this endeavor, given his philosophical and legal training. Even though he covers some sophisticated material, his writing is crisp and interesting throughout.<br />ID is not the older creationism; it is supported by crendentialed scientists and philosophers; it is not going away; and it should be allowed to have a voice in state education.<br />Douglas Groothuis, Ph.D., Denver Seminary	2003-07-30

Drawing on the work of some of our best social critics (particularly Neil Postman), Mr. Hunt indicts American culture for returning to pagan idolatry--the idolatry of the ever-present visual image. This is closely connected to the cult of celebrity (people \\"well known for being well known\\" (Boorstin) not for any discernible achievement) and its accompanying spectacles.<br />Hunt appropriates some of the insights of C. Paglia that America has returned to a pagan worldview, especially in popular media. As a Christian, however, he refuses to celebrate this, but instead registers a jeremiad--and a very well informed and prophetic one at that. We must return to the Word as our primary way of acquiring and treasuring knowledge. The image, while important in some dimensions, is the easy tool of propaganda and manipulation; it often deceptive, and lacks the conceptual resources available to typography. \\"In the beginning was the Word,\\" declares the Gospel of John, not \\"the image.\\"<br />This book expands on recent articles published in \\"The Christian Research Journal\\" and provides a short history of western culture from the vantage point of communications theory (in which the author is trained).<br />I give the book four stars, not five, only because there is, to my knowledge, very little original material. It is largely derivative; however, Americans seldom fathom the significance of the sources upon which Hunt draws.

This book may end up as a kind of manifesto for the \\"emerging church\\" movement or \\"Gen X meets postmodernism and likes it.\\" Leonard Sweet is essentially in the same category. (See my review on Amazon of \\"Carpe Manana.\\")<br />McLaren is right that the ways of evangelism need revision, but his way is no better; in fact, it is much worse. There is no emphasis on the heart of the gospel--justification by faith through grace--or on the cruciality of defending objective truth in a time when postmodernists reject it (for no good reason, it turns out). McLaren's hero, \\"Neo,\\" embraces evolution (just when the intelligent design movement is making headway against it!), wonders if heaven and hell are really places (see Matthew 25:46), and says the Bible is not an \\"answer book\\" (see 2 Timothy 3:15-17). And so it goes.<br />Those want a biblical and bracing critique of evangelism's weaknesses along with positive proposals are better off reading David Wells, Francis Schaeffer, Os Guinness, and Ken Myers.(I have a longer review of this book in \\"The Christian Research Journal,\\" Vo. 25, No. 3.)<br />Douglas Groothuis	2003-05-05

It has been said that if you want to know a person, you must identity that person's \\"ruling passion\\"-that which unifies their personality and sets their course for life. Yet in our fickle age of reinvention and frequent lifestyle changes, one wonders if some folk even possess a fixed core at the heart of their being. Historian Bruce Shelley, senior professor of history at Denver Seminary, claims to have discerned the ruling passion of his longtime colleague and evangelical senior statesman, Dr. Vernon Grounds (b. 1914). That passion is the moral virtue of love-not love in a vague or sentimental sense, but rather Christian love, which is rooted in the understanding of Jesus Christ as the revelation of God's love for humanity. While Dr. Grounds' doctoral dissertation at Drew University addressed the concept of love in the thought of Sigmund Freud, his concern for this great virtue has been far more than academic. Love has been a demonstrable way of life for Vernon Grounds', as this book amply attests. Shelley credits this transformation by love to Grounds conversion during his college days, which occurred only after considerable intellectual struggles.<br />Shelley's narrative skillfully situates the long and eventful life of Vernon Grounds in the context of both twentieth-century America and American evangelicalism specifically. (The book includes a rewarding appendix of Dr. Ground's writings on a variety of subjects, as well as a select bibliography.) Emerging from his working-class roots in New York through his university and seminary education, Grounds became a significant figure in the development of American evangelicalism (or theologically conservative Protestantism). Although associated with more fundamentalist institutions in his younger years, Dr. Grounds became increasingly disenchanted with fundamentalism's tendencies toward cultural separatism, anti-intellectualism, and lack of love toward those outside its opinions. Out of these concerns, he and his wife Ann moved to Denver in 1951 where he joined the fledgling Denver Seminary faculty as Dean. The seminary had only a handful of students and was located in an old and ornate mansion in downtown Denver, where it remained until 1968 when it moved to its present location in Englewood. Fundamentalist backers tussled with the school until it eventually broke free from them to pursue a more open path. It now serves over six hundred students annually.<br />While highly gifted intellectually, Dr. Ground's love for his institution pulled him from the life of a pure scholar to that of a leader when he became Denver Seminary's second president in 1955, a position he held until 1979. Nevertheless, he taught (and continues to teach) a wide variety of classes in philosophy, theology, and counseling and published widely in these areas as well. In addition to his heavy leadership and teaching responsibilities, Dr. Grounds traveled nearly every weekend to churches around the country to preach, teach, and promote the seminary. (When asked how she coped with her husband's constant traveling, Ann is quoted as saying, \\"I'd rather have Vernon Grounds ten percent of the time than any other man one hundred percent.\\") For many people-in Denver and around the world-Denver Seminary and Vernon Grounds are virtually synonymous.<br />The book underscores that throughout his distinguished career, Dr. Grounds has been known for his commitment to academically excellent seminary education, his passion for social justice concerns, his path-breaking desire to integrate Christian faith with the best of psychological insights, and his voluminous knowledge. His legendary library of many thousands of volumes occupies the vast majority of his office space, where he regularly meets with a steady stream of alumni and students-and anyone who desires his warm and rewarding company.<br />I once met a man who introduced himself as \\"one of Vernon Grounds' \\"twelve hundred close, personal friends.\\" After reading this book, one can see that this probably was not an exaggeration.

Can we tell when religions become \\"evil\\"? What are the central claims of religions? Religion professor Charles Kimball attempts to shed light on these questions in his wide-ranging, but ultimately, disappointing.<br />  Kimball believes the well-established religions should be respected, despite evils committed in their name, because they all \\"converge in teaching both an orientation toward God or the transcendent and compassionate, constructive relationships with others in this world\\" (p. 39). However, this does not imply that \\"all roads lead up the same mountain\\" (p. 25). Religions may defect from their \\"authentic sources\\" and thus even become evil in several ways. Remember, \\"evil\\" is a moral category not available to relativists.<br />  For example, religions may make \\"absolute truth claims,\\" require \\"blind obedience,\\" \\"establish an 'ideal time'\\" (attempt to set up a utopian theocracy), teach that \\"the end justifies the means\\" or \\"declare holy war.\\" Kimball addresses these matters in the context of various religions (ancient and modern), such as providing insights into the dynamics of doomsday groups such the Branch Davidians and the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo, which required total commitment to irrational beliefs that led to destructive behaviors. He also attempts to explore the religious motivations of Osama Bin Laden and his followers, but spends less time on this than expected.<br />  Kimball rightly observes that truth claims are foundational for religion. But, he claims that believers err when they hold their religious beliefs in a \\"rigid\\" or \\"absolute\\" manner. So, when some Christians criticize the Islamic view of God (Allah) as deficient, they reveal their ignorance and bigotry. Kimball asserts that, \\"there is simply no ambiguity here. Jews, Christians, and Muslims are taking about the same deity\\" (p. 50). This is because the Qur'an claims that Allah inspired the Hebrew prophets and Jesus. Moreover, the Arabic word \\"Allah\\" means \\"God.\\"<br />  Is this true? While Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are all monotheistic, they differ considerably in their conceptions of God. Islam denies the Trinity and the Incarnation, both of which are well-established Christian doctrines. But God cannot be both a Trinity (Christian) and not a Trinity (Islam). This is a matter of logic, not religious intolerance. Moreover, these religions' different concepts of God explain why Muslims and Christians try to convert each other. If mutual understanding is key to tolerance, then disagreements between religions should not be dismissed by deleting \\"absolute\\" truth claims from their \\"authentic sources.\\" It is certainly possible to tolerate someone who holds religious views quite contrary to one's own. America, at its best, excells at this.<br />  Kimball wants to soften biblical claims about the uniqueness and centrality of Jesus by saying that they should be taken as pious exaggerations (p. 68-70). However, such affirmations are plentiful in the New Testament (see John 14:1-6; Acts 4:12) and have historically been seen as objective descriptions, not embellishments. The major creeds of the Christian church makes this clear. Kimball seems to be calling for a revision of Christianity's \\"authentic sources,\\" not a return to them. Likewise, most Muslims would reject this kind of revision of the Qur'an. Muslims claim that Muhammad was the last and greatest of the prophets, not just one among many. Being \\"rigid\\" on this doctrine is necessary to Islam. Mortimer Adler's short but incisive study, \\"Truth in Religion\\" (1990), is a better guide on the issue of conflicting truth claims.<br />  In addition, Kimball never really faces the possibility that a religion's \\"authentic sources\\" themselves may contain moral and theological errors that encourage evils. He also tends to overemphasize the abuses of Christians--such as the Crusades--while underemphasizing similar abuses by Muslims, such as dhimmitude: an institution that places heavy restrictions on non-Muslims in Islamic nations (p. 201). On this, see the work of Bat Ye'or.<br />  Kimball's ambitious book highlights the need to make reasoned and well-informed judgments on religions and their ethical implications. However, we still await a book that adequately handles this controversial topic in the wage of September 11, 2001.

Professor Campbell had a broad knowledge of mythology and religion, but his analytical skills were dulled by his philosophical commitment to nondualism (or pantheistic monism), which he uses as a Procrustean bed: all symbolism and religion is interpreted along the lines that \\"we are one with the nondual transcendent\\" that lies at the core of our being. However, monotheistic religions have never taught this, and this alien worldview cannot be read into their scriptures.<br />Nondualism is also philosophically flawed since it denies the reality of finite entities and experiences as finally real. If all is one and all is God, why do so many humans experience themselves as finite, contingent, and subject to death and decay?<br />Nondualism, furthermore, disallows the reality of evil. Good and evil disappear into the nondual. But any worldview that denies the objectivity of evil is philosophically and existentially bancrupt. What of the terrorists who immolated themselves and three thousand others on September 11, 2001. Were these terrorists not evil?<br />Lastly, Campbell claims that God is beyond logic and language. But this doesn't stop him from making statements about what he claims is ineffable--utterly beyond any statement. This is contradictory and, therefore, false.<br />There is another worldview that recognizes the reality of finite and sorrowful existence, that knows and honors the difference between good and evil, and which is based on the self-disclosure of a personal and transcendent God.

These categories do not fit the remarkable man described in the Four Gospels and the rest of the New Testament. (These are the most ancient and best records available to us.) Hanh places Jesus on his Procustean bed--and praises what is left. It is more honest to admit that Jesus and Buddha taught two irreconciable worldviews and two irreconciable ways of spiritual liberation. Both cannot be right. This is a matter of simple history and logic.<br />Jesus was a theist; Buddha an agnostic. Jesus believed humans were creatures of God; Buddha did not speculate. Jesus taught the reality of sin against a holy God; Buddha taught a method--the Four Noble Truths--to free people of the experience of suffering in this world. Jesus taught resurrection; Buddha taught repeated rebirth (and a way to escape it). Most importantly, Jesus called people to follow him to find forgiveness and eternal life. Buddha gave the Dharma, refused worship, and never claimed any knowledge of God.

The answer: make the Xer's ways and thoughts normative and adjust Christian practice accordingly.<br />Professor Sweet wants to make Christianity relevant to a new generation. That is commendable. Every generation needs to think this through. However, the book disappoints for several reasons, despite its interesting information about contemporary culture.<br />The book is fat with factoids; thin on theology; and hefty with hype. There is little attention to Scripture as authoritative, normative, and cross-culturally pertinent (not that Professor Sweet denies biblical authority outright). Rather, besides giving some basic biblical ideas, Professor Sweet thinks that postmodern culture must drive the church's structure and endeavors. For instance, if the culture is moving \\"from word to image\\" (a chapter title), so must the church.<br />I believe, that the opposite is true. Scripture as Scripture favors the Word. In the beginning was the Word, not the video (John 1). The \\"Word became flesh and dwelt among us\\" and the Bible is God's word to us for us for God's greater glory. Professor Sweet shows no familiarity with the trenchant critiques of our image-oriented (and thus intellectually and spiritually impoverished) culture given by Neil Postman (\\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\\") or Jacques Ellul (\\"The Humiliation of the Word\\").

Ferguson was a breathless chronicaler of mostly fringe ideas in psychology, science, and social science. She rallied the troops and dreamed big dreams.<br />I interact in-depth with the essential worldview--pantheistic monism--of this book in my several books on the New Age movement. It deifies the self while uprooting it from its proper mooring in the personal Creator and Redeemer of the universe. It is relativistic morally and unable to provide objective standards for human conduct. It denies the darkner side of human nature and opts for a utopianism of post-dated checks.<br />The New Age has become mainstrain in many ways today.  Now we have Deepak Chopra, James Redfield, and others. Ferguson is no longer a key player. Nevertheless, the flaws and unkept promises of this worldview and spirituality should alert the wise to follow another path.&lt;	2002-01-22

Steve Allen was one of the last bright and articulate Hollywood personalities. Any... complaint to this effect is greeted by mindless intonations of \\"censorship\\".... Censorship means governmental restrictions of speech. Allen does not advocate this. He argues for discernment and reasoned action. After surveying the decline of culture--as evidenced by obscenity, indecency, and outright stupidity everywhere--Allen calls for a return to clean, creative, and interesting art.<br />Allen argues from common sense and not explicitly from religious ideals. (He take a few unwarranted pot shots at religion, but I'll let that go, given the importance of his book. The overall tone is not hostile to faith.) He advises those concerned about the rottenness and perversion of culture to demand something better.<br />This is mere sanity. Culture counts. Art is not morally neutral. It affects people for good or evil. Those who listen to Marilyn Manson, for instance, imbibe his ugliness, hate, and horror. (He named himself after Charles Manson and Marilyn Monroe.)<br />I was particularly struck by two of Allen's comments.<br />1. Civilization is fragile (p. 281). It requires an ethical core that is eroding.... More and more of culture is becoming \\"an occasion to sin\\" (p. 107)...Allen has many insider insights that make for interesting reading. However, he needed a more active editor. The book is somewhat repetitive and could have been shorter. ...Mr. Allen, we will miss you.

This well-written and fully-documented book patiently addresses and analyzes all the pertinent biblical arguments regarding the role of women in the church and the home. It is marked by careful attention to and deep respect for Scripture as God's holy and fully authoritative word (another reviewer on Amazon to the contrary).<br />It is unique in its exploration of the philosophical consequences and assumptions of Traditionalism (sometimes euphemistically called Complementarianism). This view claims that God has forever ordained men to rule in the church and the home; women are subordinate by nature and design. Rebecca Merrill Groothuis bends over backwards to understand the arguments of Traditionalists and to respond to them fairly, biblically, and logically. Her arguments against traditionalism given in chapter two have never been refuted, let alone fairly addressed in any of literature I have seen. She convincingly argues that women are not to be subjugated to male rule by divine decree.<br />The crux is this: Jesus Christ calls women and men to follow him as equals. He does not place men over women or women over men. Rather, both are equally sinful, equally redeemable through the work of the Divine Mediator, and equally equipped for ministry in the church and responsibility in the home as they submit to the light of the Holy Scriptures and to the life of the Holy Spirit.<br />This a charter for freedom, authority, and effectiveness in the Christian life.<br />Rebecca Merrill Groothuis has also authored Women Caught in the Conflict: The Culture War Between Traditionalism and Feminism (Wipf and Stock, 1997).

I have also read several of Backus's other books, such as &quot;The Hidden Rift With God,&quot; which was excellent.<br />The chapter I read was on the sin of sloth. Backus address the psychological, spiritual, and moral dimensions of depression as it relates to the &quot;deadly sin&quot; of sloth.  I found it to be balanced, biblical, and historically grounded in that the author refers to spiritual doctors of the church who have addressed matters of sin and righteousness in the Christian life. He also used a case study to illustrate how &quot;telling ourselves the truth&quot; about our situations and God's character leads to spiritual liberation. This is the main theme of Dr. Backus's works over the years.<br />The book addresses &quot;the seven deadly sins&quot; and how to overcome them in the Christian life.

The last book I know of that surveyed  options in this regard was Gordon Lewis, &quot;Testing Christianity's Truth  Claims&quot; (Moody Press, 1976; republished by University Press of  America).<br />This book presents five different approaches, each represented  by one of its exponents: Classical Apologetics (William Lane Craig),  Evidentialism (Gary Habermas), Culumulative Case Method (Paul Feinberg),  Presuppositionalism (John Frame), and Reformed Epistemology (Kelly James  Clark).<br />Much ground is covered concerning the Bible's approach to  apologetics, where apologetic arguments should begin, how certain arguments  for Christianity are, and so on. I will simply make a few comments.<br />The  presentations by Craig and Habermas are the most worthwhile because they  are the most intellectual rigorous and well-documented. They also tend to  agree with each on most things and reinforce each others views. While I  tend to favor a cumulative case method (influenced by E.J. Carnell and  Francis Schaeffer, but with more appreciation for natural theology),  Feinberg's comments are the weakest by far. He never mentions the leading  exponent of this view in our generation (Carnell) nor Carnell's apt and  well-published student (and my esteemed colleague), Dr. Gordon Lewis. Not  one word about either one!  His comments are brief, his documentation is  thin, and he fails to advance anything very creative or helpful, I'm  afraid. A better person should have been chosen, such as Gordon Lewis.  Frame gives his &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; version of Cornelius Van Til,  which still suffers from the same kinds of problems--most notably the  fallacy of begging the question in favor of Christianity. Nevertheless, the  notion of a &quot;transcendental argument&quot; for theism is a good one,  but it should not carry all the weight of apologetics. Clark's material is  philosophically well-informed (one would expect this of a student of Alvin  Plantinga!), but apologetically timid. Clark almost sounds like a skeptic  at times.<br />A few bones more bones to pick. The editor refers to Francis  Schaeffer as a presuppositionalist. This is false; he was a verificationist  with more in common with Carnell than with Van Til. Gordon Lewis's fine  essay on Schaeffer's apologetic method in &quot;Reflections on Francis  Schaeffer&quot; makes this very clear. None of the writers address the  great apologetic resources found in Blaise Pascal. I also found at least  two grammatical errors.<br />Nevertheless, as a professor of philosophy at a  theological seminary who teaches apologetics, I found this volume very  helpful and useful. But let's not get so involved in methodological  concerns that we fail to go out in the world and defend our Christian faith  as objectively true, existentially vital, and rationally compelling (Jude  3)!<br />Douglas Groothuis, Ph.D. Associate Professor of Philosophy Denver  Seminarycally well-informed (one would expect this of a student of Alvin  Plantinga!), but apologetically timid.

I only made it about 150 pages into this book. I have recently discovered  Roland Kirk's wonderful music and wanted to know more about his life,  musical influences, and achievements. Kruth is long on interview comments,  but short on evaluation or insight. He relates many stories about Kirk, who  was quite a character (to put it nicely), but these tend to be repetitious.  Especially overdone are comments to the effect that: &quot;Yes, he could  play three instruments at once, but he was a serious musician.&quot; Fine,  I got it after the fifth reference.<br />Some readers will be bothered by the  needless profanity of the book. This could have been edited out of the  interview comments. I found them distasteful.<br />There are some very  humorous and revealing stories about Kirk. The story of how a blind,  African-American left his mark on jazz is not without merrit. The musical  analysis, however, cannot hold a candle to Lewis Porter's &quot;John  Coltrane.&quot; How Kirk fit into the larger cultural, racial movements of  the 1960s was not explored any real depth--although I did not read the  entire book. Given the level of analysis of what I did read, I doubt it  gets much more profound later int the book.<br />Because Kirk was underrated  and often dismissed as a novelty act, it is good, I suppose, that there is  finally an entire book about his life and music. However, the book leaves  something to be desired.<br />Douglas Groothuis	2000-08-14

This was his first book, originally published in 1973 by InterVarsity Press. Guinness got his intellectual  start with the late Francis Schaeffer (apologist, theologian, and social  critic, who died in 1984), working for several years in Switzerland at the  Schaeffer community called L'Abri (shelter). He has since written many  books, such as \\"The Grave Digger File,\\" \\"The American  Hour,\\" \\"Fit Bodies, Fat Minds,\\" \\"Dining With the  Devil,\\" \\"God in the Dark,\\" and \\"A Time for  Truth\\"--all of which I recommend highly.<br />This book marked a turning  point in my intellectual life when I read it in 1977. Along with \\"The  God Who is There\\" by Francis Schaeffer, it gave me the intellectual  confidence to engage the world of ideas with passion and precision, for the  glory of God. It is an exceptional piece of Christian social criticism,  well thought-out and keenly written. Guinness thoroughly analyzes the  historical and philosophical roots of the countercultural in a scholarly,  but engaging manner. He meticulously documents his sources and is never  condescending or unfair concerning views he opposes. Guinness  philosophically analyzes the roots and fruits of the counterculture and  finds them wanting logically and ethically. However, he does not endorse  the American status quo. Instead, he calls us to follow \\"the third  way\\" of Jesus Christ, in a radical community of love and truth.<br />The  edition of the book contains some new material taken from Guinness later  magisterial work, \\"The American Hour\\" (a book that never received  the recognition it deserved). I recommend \\"The Dust of Death\\" for  anyone desiring to understand the effect of the counterculture on American  life. It is a model of how a Christian mind should engage contemporary  culture.<br />Douglas Groothuis, Professor of Philosophy, Denver  Seminary	2000-07-25

Macbeth took up the study of Darwinist argumentation as a avocation. He does not appeal to any religious authority  to contradict Darwinism, nor does he reject the idea of evolution in toto.  Rather, he finds the evidence and arguments for Darwinism to be deeply  flawed. Questions are begged, evidence is fudged, and extrapolations are  unwarranted.<br />The first edition of this book (1971) came well over a  decade before Michael Denton's pivotal critique, Evolution: A Theory in  Crisis (1986), and well before the theistic Intelligent Design Movement,  spearheaded by Phillip E. Johson's book, Darwin on Trial (1991; revised  edition, 1993). (Johnson is also a laywer, and a professor of law at  UC-Berkeley.) MacBeth has also published a small booklet of interviews on  the topic called, Darwinism: A Time for Funerals (1985). This is a  thoughtful and fair critique well worth reading. Let me end with a quote  from the author: &quot;Any profession [he has biology in mind] that does  not supply its own criticism and iconoclasm will discover that someone else  will do the job, and usually in a way it does not like.&quot;<br />Douglas  Groothuis, Ph.D. Associate Professor of Philosophy Denver Seminary	2000-06-30

This book comes several years after Dr. Schaeffer's death in 1984 at the age of 72. It was transcribed and from tapes made of Bible studies on Romans 1-8 in the 1960s and edited. The writing is smooth and clear, despite the unorthodox route to publication. They are not scraping the bottom of the barrel for material. This is vintage Schaeffer.<br />Francis A. Schaeffer is most known as an evangelical apologist, evangelist, and social critic, but he was firmly rooted in Scripture and the historic (and biblical) doctrines of the Reformation: justification by faith, solo scriptura, and the priesthood of all believers. He was also experientially rooted in the life of Christ. For Schaeffer, doctrine should live in the life of the follower of Christ.<br />I found these studies to be refreshing and encouraging theologically and spiritually. One who is familiar with his other work will find salient Schaefferian themes throughout; but they are never superimposed on the biblical text itself.<br />Those who desire to understand the Christian gospel and world view should read this book. Those already committed to Christ and his cause should savor this book in order to delve deeply into the transformative truths of the gospel and how it applies to our needy world.<br />Douglas Groothuis	2000-06-17

They affirm a materialistic or naturalistic world view, which they call Humanism. This is not to be confused with Renaissance Humanism, which was theistic and often  Christian. Their brand of Humanism is Secular Humanism or atheism: The  universe is all there is; life evolved for no reason; ethics are dependent  on culture alone; there is no life after death; and humans can bring about  a better world by realizing the above points and using their abilities for  world peace and cooperation.<br />As a statement of Western atheism, it is  clear and to the point.  As a world view it is plagued by internal  inconsistencies and numerous disconnections with objective reality--too  many to cover properly here.  Let me just indicate a few philosophical  problems. The documents' premise that the universe has always existed is  extremely difficult to defend given Big Bang cosmology, which points to an  absolute origination. Unless everything came from nothing without a cause,  this implies a Creator. Second, the documents claim that morality is  relative to cultures and not absolute, yet they also go on to affirm  various moral imperatives that they claim should obtain cross-culturally  and absolutely, such as the need for world peace, the importance of  rational inquiry, and so on. This is logically inconsistent. For a solid  critique of the world view of naturalism, see James W. Sire, The Universe  Next Door, 3rd edition, chapter four, &quot;The Silence of Finite  Space&quot; and chapter five, &quot;Zero Point: Nihilism.&quot; His thesis  is that naturalism logically leads to Nihilism, which is unlivable and  incongruous with our deeper intuitions about life and meaning.  I  agree.<br />The same folks have just recently put out Humanist Manifesto 2000,  also written by Paul Kurtz.<br />The Humanists represented in all the above  reject postmodernism, which dispenses with normative notions of rationality  and the concept of objective truth. In this sense, the documents are  modernist, and attempt to hold the line against the nihilism of  postmodernist.

His ability to synthesize vast amounts of material is impressive, as is his literary output. However, his fundamental world view is philosophically inconistent  and denies things sane people take to be true.  His philosophy of  nondualism (or monism) logically entails the elimination of the duality of  good and evil. In some places Wilber admits this; in others he assumes the  ontologically reality of good and evil. This is contradictory, and  therefore, false. There is a thick contradiction at the heart of his worldview. No amount of meditation can dissolve that.<br />Wilber speaks of enlightenment as beyond words and  language, but then uses words and language to describe it. This, too, is  contradictory, and, therefore, false. And on it goes. He takes the Ultimate  or Absolute to be impersonal, thus leaving no philosophical explanation for  ourselves as personal beings.

Frank Kofsky (d. 1997) was a lover of jazz--particularly black jazz--and a Marxist ideologue. He goes to great length to argue that jazz is essentially an African-American phenomenon, and that whites are second-best  or interlopers. (He does reluctantly grant that Bill Evans was a legitimate  innovator and considerable influence...) That racial claim is questionable  enough, but his political ideas intrude on his analysis repeatedly. His  interviews with McCoy Tyner and John Coltrane attempt to pull political  ideas out of them that they appear to have thought little about.<br /><br />The book  is somewhat mistitled because it is not primarily about John Coltrane, but  about the black jazz and political revolution of the 1960.  Kofsky speaks  almost as much about Archie Shepp (saxophonist influenced by Coltrane who  played with him late in Coltrane's career) than about Coltrane, partially,  I think, because Shepp was much more outspoken in his leftist political  ideas than was Coltrane who was, I take it, basically apolitical--despite  some of his ethical concerns expressed, for instance, in his piece,  \\"Alamaba,\\" which was written to lament the racially-based murder  of several black children in their church during the civil rights movement.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the die-hard Coltrane fans may enjoy this book because of  its analysis of Coltrane's music and influence.  I appreciated the  interviews with Coltrane, Tyner, and Elvin Jones, despite Kofsky's overly  political insinuations. Kofsky gives some purely musical descriptions and  explanations that I found noteworthy.<br /><br />Kofsky, to his credit, does  integrate the black nationalist movement of the 1960s with certain aspects  of jazz during that period.  Although some of his connections are  questionable, he does emply this construct to illuminate the jazz scene of  the day in ways that some jazz critics have failed to recognize.<br /><br />The book  suffers from poor editing, much repetition, and a sense that Kofsky is  getting even after he was alienated from the jazz critics scene in the  1960s because of his political views. A kind of whining tone pervades much  of the book, which becomes tiring.<br /><br />I give the book three stars more for  its subject matter than for its author's insights or writing ability.

This is a well-documented, carefully argued, and civil discussion of the  relationship between Christianity and feminism. The author convincingly  shows that not all feminism is alike, and that biblical feminists (or  egalitarians) have not capitulated to secular trends. She outlines how  egalitarians can base their thinking squarely on the Bible itself.  She  continues her analysis in the sequel, Good News for Women: A Biblical  Picture of Gender Equality (Baker Books, 1997), which addresses the  theological issues in more depth.<br />Reviewed by Douglas Groothuis, Ph.D.,  Professor of Philosophy, Denver Seminary	1998-08-23
