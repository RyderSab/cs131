I liked most of the book, I just didn't like the ending much. The story was about Nancy Garrett and her family. When her grandmother  died, she left Nancy, her sister, Kirby, and her brother, Brandon, amazing  gifts. Kirby got the gift of dance. Brandon received the gift of music. And  Nancy received the best gift of all, the gift of magic. At the very end of  the book, the &quot;Afterward&quot;, Lois Duncan put herself in the story.  She kind of made herself a character. I thought that was different, a good  different. The story, towards the end, doesn't talk too much about Nancy's  magic. All the stuff about her magic was in the first half of the book. So  that's why I gave it four stars.	2000-05-22
