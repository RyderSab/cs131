After traveling to Cyprus to witness the conflict between Turkey and Greece, visiting Blue Mosque, Haghia Sophia, Topkapi museum... the book is a great addition to my learning about the Islamic culture.  Sultan (emperor), Grand Seraglio harem, Golden Cage, Ottoman Dynasty 1540-1990, polygamy with 4 kadins (wives), Koran reading and praying at the mosque, dalisques (female slaves for servants), slave markets in Alexandria and Cairo, black eunuchs, kismet (fate), one thousand and one nights, Turkish hamams (bath), plus an exquisite collection of the art work, make this a great book to read. The book would be better if it includes stories about a specific sultan and his kadins, dalisques and eunuchs.	2005-07-23

I just attended the 7th Forum with 55 people at Turkey, in June 2005. Dr. A. Safty and his staff did a great job organizing the forum. Many of the authors in this book also contributed in the 2005 forum.  Global Leadership is a hot buzzword in MBA curricula today.  Yet the theoretical definition, teaching and research diverge: (1)leader is a good manager, (2) good managers make lousy leaders, (3) leader is born, not made, (4) anyone can be a leader in any occasion or project team, (5) Unethical leaders (Enron, Worldcom)......  Needless to say, the debate continues, and more conferences will be held. This book, however, gives a good summary of the research effort.  It is a worthwhile read.	2005-07-23

This book is a great personal account of the fall of China. The main characters: Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Lin Biao, Chen Yi, Fu Zuoyi, Communists, and Chiang Kai-Shek, Madame Chiang, Chiang Ching-Kuo, Nationalists; Clare Chennault, Bill Gray, Henry Luce, President Truman, and many others were covered in great details. As a person who was born in Shanghai, I left Shanghai with my parents in May, 1949, I was educated in Taiwan under the Nationalists for 20+ years. I always wondered how Nationalist lost China to Communist? Nationalists got $3.8 bn from USA, weapons, millions of troops, yet could not win the war, truly amazing! During the battle of Xuzhou, Chiang lost 550,000 men and Communists captured 300,000 in just 65 days.  Chiang never fought strategically. It is a lesson for all of us, General Myers.... and the ones in Iragi today. $$$ do not dicate the winners or losers in any war. Roy Rowan led a wonderful life covering these events. He gave an excellent talk at Shanghai Tiffin (lunch) club, New York city, on April 23, 2005.	2005-06-01

As the world gets smaller and smaller through globalization, internet and superfast communications, every manufacturer from your local shop to General Motors needs to serve the 6 billion customers.  Carlos Ghosn did it with passion, integrity and style.  The fact that he can change the mindset of the Japanese management is truly remarkable.  He is a hero in Nissan, Japan and a true role model for all CEOs. The book will be better if he can include more about the future US expansion plan.

For anyone interested in learning the database theory, this is a must-read book.  The author did an excellent job in explaining difficult E-R relationships, data structures, system catalog, UML diagrams, and the components of distributed systems. The lab exercises can be implemented by using the commercial database software: Oracle 9i, MS SQL Server, MS Access, MySQL and MS Visio.

You like to learn the entrepreneurial mindsets from this book. The authors teach this course, at the Executive MBA program, of Columbia Univeristy (only $15,000 for five days). Of course your company pays for it. If not, reading this book is a good alternative ($20 is not bad). The problem with the book, is generality. It does not provide examples of any individual or firm that has been successful with the use of the entrepreneurial mindset.  It is like teaching you all the theory to be successful, but no examples on how these theories can be put into action. I stronly disagree with most of the reviewers here that this is a useful book to start a business.  It is not.  However if you wish to learn the theory, this is the book for you. I would like to find out if the authors themselves, started any business of their own by using these theories.	2004-09-12

Six main characters, Smolensky the Banker, Luzhkov the Mayor, Chubais the Economist-reformer, Khordorkovsky the oligarch, Berezovsky the Master Mind, and Gusinsky the TV Media King, controlled the Russia Yeltsin-regime economy. Many of them are Jewish, started from humble beginnings and got rich at the right place at the right time.  Unfortunately, with 1998 stock crash, ruble devalutaion, Putin as the new president, their wealthy empires quickly fizzled. It is a must read for any one doing business in Russia.	2004-09-09

Unfortunately they will not read this English version. If there is an Arabic version, it can certainly change the whole country...  As a professor, it is very difficult to teach courses in International Management without in-depth culture knowledge of Saudi Arabia.

It is appropriate for any undergraduate or graduate marketing research course.  For the former, one does not have to cover SPSS in details.  For the latter, SPSS is needed for data analysis and interpretations.  The book came with a copy of the SPSS version 16.0 for MS Windows Vista, that students can use it for free.  It is a great value.  The research cases tend to be short and easy to read.  For advanced research, one needs to consult Journal Marketing Research or International Journal Marketing Research for Ph.D. thesis topics.	2004-07-29

If you watch Sopranos, you would fall in love with the characters, especially Tony the boss. His management style is very different from what they teach you at Harvard Business School. Tony's way is simple, clear and effective. You generate new business weekly, using every soldier, capo, police, congressman.... You reach your goal.  Along the way, you enjoy what you are doing and live a great life. This is the ultimate American dream! The book will be better if many of the leadership theories are eliminated.

Yes, people are living a lot longer and marketing to 50+ is a major challenge. The focus on this group is based upon its size of the population (30 - 40% globally), purchasing power and needs.

Ellison started as a computer programmer, lied on his college info, got a job and went on to create the greatest database software firm in the USA! What a story!  In between, he went through several divorces, got two great kids, many one-night stands and had a reputation of using F-words continuously. A good coverage of A. Lee and Safra Catz. Was there any romance between Catz and Larry? Is Catz the next CEO?  If Larry cannot stand any male CEO due to his ego, how about Safra as the CEO? Who is Safra?  Is she married? There is little info on her, yet she seems to be the #2 person at Oracle now. Larry is the true American hero everyone loves, only next to Howard Stern? All the people that built Oracle with him, Lane, Siebel, Gloom, Conway, Benioff.... left him and became CEO in their own right. Lederberg, Jobs, McNealy are some of his closest friends.  Oracle is trying to take over PeopleSoft now with the $7.4 bn bid.  Why not buy/merge Apple Computer and Sun MicroSystems so you can really beat Bill Gates!

Ripplewood bought the bankrupt LTCB Japanese bank and turned it around.  It serves as a blueprint for US and global investors.  Tim Collins started this venture but there was little mention about his contribution in the later part of the book.  The ending seems too short.<br /><br />Ripplewood Holding is traded on the stock market after Tim Collins raised $1 billion in IPO, the stock symbol is RHJIF, about $27 per share.

It was finally published on August 15, 2002.  It is good for introductory Java class, for anyone who has no experience in programming or Java.  It is very clear and easy to follow.  I use the SDK 1.4 compiler. This books covers it well.  My students seem to like it although it is too early in the semester to tell. However, I used Horstmann's Java and Advanced book, for training professional programmers.	2002-09-08

It is over 1200 pages.  It is too much.  For the beginner, Lemay's book, published today, (8/17/2002) is much better.  For training purposes, Horstmann or Deitel book is better depending on the topics you wish to learn.  Yes, SDK 1.4 is the compiler to use now.  Every time a new book on Java is out, it is better than all the old books.  It is very competitive!	2002-08-29

It includes XML and eliminates earlier errors.  It is a great book for people who had the first Java course, Core Java2, Volume 1 by the same authors.<br />I have trained Advanced Java to 100+ people in 4 organizations in the NYC area since 1997.  This book provides the basis for the learning. The coverage on advanced Server, JSP, Corba and Jini is missing. The reader can follow up with avanced server such as BEA WebLogic 6.1 or IBM WebSphere if they have them installed at their firms.  For the reader that wished to get everything FREE, download the Tomcat server or Apache server, then implement JSP. It will be a great project.	2002-04-26

Great book with historical details in a laymen language.  This is the country that graduates about 1.1 million students per year in its 3,600 colleges/universities but only 1.5% major in Computer Information Sciences and related fields.  To appreciate the amount of effort each programming language is used in the commerical or industrial application, and to fully engage in the development of these applications remain to be the challenge for all of us.  I have taught and trained 5400+ people in the last 25 years in 18 colleges and companies. but only a handful of them are Computer majors (3%).  This book hopefully will bring more young people to major in Computer Information Systems and to develop better programs to be used by the society at large.	2002-01-22

I have been training &quot;Advanced Java&quot; in companies and colleges for the past 4 years. With many new compiler versions, development tools, books, CDs, in the market place, it is difficult to get focus.  This book is a little old using JDK1.2.2 not SDK 1.3 but the coverage is still excellent on JDBC, EJB, Advance SWING, Servlets, etc. Any developer needs to get deeper knowledge, other advanced books are required.  Let me know if there is a book on Java applications in PDA or Cell Phone interface.  Thanks.<br />  Don Hsu from NYC	2001-03-25
