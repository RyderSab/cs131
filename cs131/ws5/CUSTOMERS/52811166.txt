As a conversation between the author and Saint Augustine relating to religion, humanity and art, it is an immense success.  Just as Dante had Virgil, Petrarch had Saint Augustine and this is a good thing.  Petrarch's insight into his own weaknesses and those of society are enlightening.  In addition, the book is short and fast- easy reading to delve into the human soul.	2004-09-10

Our poor heroine is viewed first by her fellow travelers as being below contempt.  This view changes after she decides to share her food with them.  Again, poor Butterball's companions shift their views and try and sell her to the Prussians.  This is an immensely silly novella with a serious commentary.  After you read it, it is hard to be ride of its impression.	2004-09-10

This is a really amusing and quick paced memoir of an infatuated teen.  Flaubert perfectly captures that obsessiveness of infatuation and young love.

Not only does the book tell the tale of Dante's life, it illustrates nicely Italian life and politics.  The biography is short and fast paced.

Just imagine my surprise upon picking this up and finding a spectacular classic.  Kuprin does indeed tread that fine line between cheese and morality (both being boorish methods of storytelling) to create a truly human picture of Russian society.  If you are interested in the glorification of vice and youthful indiscretions, please reread Burroughs, Miller or Selby.  Likewise, if you are interested in moral high ground, stick to Tolstoy.  Here, Kuprin deftly defies the clichs to create not only a wonderful illustration of Russian life but a great story as well.  This is amazing considering the time period in which it was written.	2004-09-08

His psychological novels inform our understanding of Russian society and, at the same time, his works transcend their cultural boundaries to reveal truths of human nature.  One could go on and on about how great a writer Dostoevsky is.  That being said, the Village of Stepanchikovo is an odd book indeed.  One could consider this novel his homage to Gogol, a stab at comedy.  Although not entirely successful in and of itself, the novel is an important early sketch, raw material to be used in building his masterpieces.  In addition, the story moves at a great pace and is never boring.  Overall, I found it to be quite entertaining.  The novel probably is not a classic but rather quite an enjoyable story.	2004-09-08

This does not mean that I was actually looking forward to reading it, rather that I felt it important to do so.  I finally bit the bullet and picked it up.  I have to say that I was strangely satisfied with the read.  Grass really captures the duality of the characters and the \\"nations\\" that exist.  In addition, memory and a refusal to move forward with time (both personally and as a society) are captured perfectly.  Definitions of countries and ethnicities are shown for what they are, transient notions changing with time.  Who is a German and who is a Pole and who is Jewish? What is a nation and what is does it mean to be nationalistic?  Likewise, the idiocy of war and its impact on society are illustrated with a brilliance seldom seen.  That being said, the novel did plod along and was tedious at times.  However, the scene with the horse head makes even the slower parts worthwhile.	2004-09-02

After reading Taras Bulba, I also love his \\"adventure\\" story.  The book is decidedly anti-Semitic in tone but I think this is mostly a reflection of the subject matter.  I see it as a kind of a show the demon for what it is.  Russian society and especially the Cossacks were not the friendliest place for Jewish people.  As is obvious in Taras Bulba, they also had little love for the Poles, the Turks and the Tartars.  At this crossroads of the world, hatred was abundant.  The fact that Gogol pulled no punches with his descriptions illustrates his honesty.  Unfortunately, the Cossack mentality of either being with me or against me seems to inform the modern world as well.  <br /> <br />What is really interesting for me is the comparison of Taras Bulba with And Quiet Flows the Don and Tolstoy's Cossacks.  All three are very different illustrations of Cossack life, from bias but honorable villains in Gogol to stories of heroes in Tolstoy to Sholokov's sad demise of a way of life.  Any way you look at it, the Cossacks are an interesting subject matter.  So, that all being said, I suggest you read this book.  It is short and fast and works on multiple levels.	2004-09-02

I have never been more interested in viewing Saturn or seeing Starlings in Rome than after reading this.  Please, do not get me wrong; I know it is about more than that.  The thing is, like Invisible Cities, this book wraps itself around your psyche, hijacks your thoughts and informs your dreams.  Calvino went out with a bang.	2004-09-02

In Ocean of Words, it seemed that Ha Jin created likeable characters forced into a restrictive society.  In the Bridegroom, Ha Jin created some characters with a bit more of an evil streak.  I will never eat soup from a stand again.  This is not necessarily a bad thing; rather it just makes some of the reading uncomfortable.  Still, better than most.	2004-09-02

What seems to receive little attention in the reviews on Amazon is the play the Flies.  Sartre's reworking of the greek tragedy lives up to the original.  I would suggest to future readers that they read the Orestia et al. and then approach the reworking.  Sartre adds to one of the oldest story in the western cannon, and that addition is valuable.	2004-08-11

Clearly, Banville deserves a place not only in the cannon of Irish literature but in the greater western cannon as well. Stylistically, the writing is nothing shy of stunning.  Likewise, the characters are fleshed out and three-dimensional.  Lastly, the social, philosophic, and literary observations show the mark of true insight.

Contrary to many interpretations of this work, I did not view it as a historical novel, at least not the history that is represented on the surface.  Instead, it is the history of Poland, Christianity and Judaism now, then and every time in between.  Furthermore, it is a story of the human condition.  One should not approach this novel in a literal sense.  If you do, you are bound to be disappointed.	2004-08-10

However, the other day I was thinking about how much fun the trilogy had been. One has to remember that most of the scifi you read today has at least some of its roots based in Asimov's work,  Asimov was not the best writer, nor was he the most creative.  What he did accomplish was selling you another time and world that you could believe in.  So, taking it for what it is, not a great piece of literature but a really enjoyable trip, i need to give the trilogy 5 stars.	2004-08-10

I can think of no story, current or historical, that addresses the subject of gambling and addiction in such a convincing manner.  The interactions between masters and servants, lovers, and nationalities are so well illustrated that it makes you catch your breath.  I myself have no interest in gambling.  Still, I have probably read this novella ten times over the years.  If Dostoevsky's larger works are a little intimidating, start here and work your way up.

When the Baron decides to take up his arboreal existence, one cannot help but believe he is making the right decision.  Calvino fleshes out the Baron into one of the most believable characters in literature.  This is an amazing feat considering the farcical lifestyle the Baron decides to adopt.  Calvino takes the opportunity to create a world at once steeped in history, philosophy and politics while at the same time illustrating the everyday existence and lives of those around him.  The cat skin hat, the exiles in the trees, the Napoleonic troops all brought to life with amazing detail.  Memory, love and history all combine and swirl throughout the story. While there is nothing exactly magical or out of this world about this book, it is one of the best examples of magical realism I have read.  I could not put this book down.  Stop reading this review and buy the book.	2004-08-10

Then, it was but one piece of philosophy/political writings out of many.  I ran across the book again a few months ago and decided to give it a second reading.  I was very happy that I did.  In these uncertain times, the truth and role of government becomes cloudy.  Rousseau's work helped to remind me that the government should serve the people and humanity in general.  This is an idea that really seems to have been lost, especially under the Bush administration.  Although I do not agree with everything Rousseau writes, I would recommend this work to anyone to read this and reflect on its modern context. \\"Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains.\\"	2004-08-10

Likewise, it was a wonderful tool to center such a grand novel.  Around this nucleus, Chabon wove the issues of high and low culture, race relations, immigration, religion, urban life, war, corporate greed, suburbs, generations, families, politics, and a million other societal issues.  It was a really clever device and works quite well.  Add to this, Chabon writes like a pop culture maniac and pays homage to his predecessors both in comics and literature. I loved this book when I finished it.  Later on, I grew to appreciate it as a really entertaining read, just shy of a classic.  Read it, it will do you some good.	2004-08-09

The story is an excellent narration of present day society and one person's quest to try to find their place in it.  Although in my opinion this is not the best Chabon novel, it shows the promise of a real talent and hints at what was to come.  I think the reader who would like this work most is someone who recently graduated from college or younger.  This is not a bad thing; rather it is the audience of a young author.  Overall, I would recommend this book.	2004-08-09

All three works deal with fear, nature and the other.  All three are strangely at peace with their situation and surrounding.  All three are great. After reading this collection, I ran out and bought The Bridegroom and Waiting.  Neither of these works rose to the level of this collection.

Although Vernon God Little was a bit cartoonish, I found the overall story to be quite satisfying.  It seems to me that the author wrote the character and his surroundings for the movie rights.  That in of itself is not that bad a thing.  This is satire, meant to have caricatures and semi-unrealistic situations.  See Candide or Confederacy of Dunces that is what it is supposed to do.  By making the characters a little outlandish, one is able to address the societal issues without seeming as preachy.  If the novel were a movie, it would be a cross between Julian Donkey Boy and Stand By Me, and the Jerry Springer Story.  Although I question the logic of this receiving the Booker Prize, I did enjoy it.	2004-08-09

Then they go overboard and mix all sorts of nonsense in with it?  Sometimes this can really be funny but sometimes it kind of kills the magic of the original part.  That was my issue when I finished Summerland.  Chabon began the story with a really great premise.  His problem was that he became wrapped up with all this nonsensical extra information that added nothing to the story.  So, I say strong start and premises, weak ending.	2004-08-09

I have to say, I am not the biggest Tolstoy fan in the world, I find his later works preachy and War and Peace nothing more than an over large soap opera.  That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by Hadji Murad.  The story is as relevant today as when it was written, if not more so. Americans and Europeans typically have little understanding of this part of the world.  Likewise, some politicians seem to have even less understanding of what makes a culture tick.  To successfully wage a war, one must understand the \\"enemy.\\"  This includes compassion and respect for their culture.  Hadji Murad is the perfect illustration of a lack of understanding.

Taking the Trojan horse from the Iliad and mixing it with Fantastic Voyages, generation ship Sci-fi, and the Simpsons is a really funny idea.  If this book were any longer it would have failed.

What I knew was that there was that quite a few mainstream and respected critics that heaped praise on the novel, stating that it was the story of a generation.  I also knew that there was quite a bit of backlash against the praise, claiming the book was sub-par at best.  After finishing Fortress of Solitude, I fall on the side of praise.  Lethem has attempted to write a coming of age story that speaks to a generation.  With coming of age giants like The Bell Jar, A Catcher in the Rye, A Separate Peace, The Adolescent etc out there, that is a pretty tall order to fill.  That being said, the novel is an enjoyable read, probably not a classic.  What I really enjoyed about this novel was that Lethem did not abandon his previous take on reality, instead infusing the work with magic realism.  This makes it a much better story than if it was told straight.  It helps to illustrate how our society is no longer the solid place of times past.  I commend Lethem on being nonjudgmental towards his characters, knowing the world is not an easy place.  Lastly, I would say that the novel is more successful than Chabon or Moody, and slightly less so than Eugenides.  Overall, a worthwhile and ejoyable read.	2004-08-06

While there have been numerous accounts of the plights of other native peoples, the arctic is usually reserved for stories about the \\"great white explorers\\" and have little to do with those living there.   I enjoy how Vollmann refuses to pass judgment on his characters, leaving them to become real humans.  I will continue to read this series and look forward to the next installment.	2004-08-03

These stories are beautiful and sorrowful.  No one could read these and not be moved.  Usually, that means being moved to a very dark place.  These stories are up there with Aeschylus when it comes to tragedy.  That being said, I am really happy that I found this book.  The depth and quality of the prose is amazing.  I would recommend this to anyone.  The only caveat I would give is not to ruin a sunny day on it.  I agree with the other reviewer in that the greatest tragedy about this book is that there is no more to read.	2004-08-03

What I did know was that Powers was supposedly a \\"genius\\" author whose works would help judge our era.  What I found while reading the novel was that all the hype was true.  Although his prose is at times thick, it is always beautiful and well crafted.  Readers should have little trouble with the non-linear, interwoven plots.  Likewise, I really enjoyed his typically Russian use of simple pseudonyms for the names of people and places.  While the book deals with technology and is a few years old, the information is only theoretical and does not feel dated.  I had never felt such sadness for the end of a computer program as I did when I finished this book.  Overall, I would highly recommend this work.  I look forward to reading more Richard Powers in the future.	2004-08-03

This is one of the best books I have read in the last ten years. The story of Dostoevsky becomes the author's own story as well.  I would suggest reading Dostoevsky's The Gambler first and then read this.  Both works are not long and both are masterpieces.  The two inform each other in quite an interesting fashion.  Either way, your time will not be wasted reading Summer in Baden-Baden.	2004-08-03
US	52811166	RHU9C8IRO3PZK	0156949520	821335689	The Watcher and Other Stories	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Nice Collection	The Watcher and Other Stories is a collection of three different but thematically interlinked stories.  I personally thought that the title story was the most intriguing.  The Watcher deals with our protagonist \\"watching\\" the voting procedures in a home for invalids/deranged/etc.  The home is a mini city and becomes a type of microcosm of Italian society.  Smog deals again with the futility of human life through pollution.  The Argentine Ants is a type of mock horror story.  All of the above are extremely well written and executed.  Although I did enjoy this book, I would suggest that readers unfamiliar with Calvino try some of his masterpieces first, and then move onto the minutiae of works such as these.	2004-08-03

The balances between travel diary, historical information, and fictional account are just perfect.  That being said please do not take me for a disciple of Vollmann.  I usually find his work on prostitutes and drugs a little boring.  The Ice Shirt on the other hand stripped much of the modern \\"sins\\" out and left truly moral questions in their place.  The work as a whole is an important examination of what is America, who we are, and how we fit into history.  On a smaller scale, it is about change and belief.  I would suggest this work to anyone interested in reading a good book, be it fiction or otherwise.	2004-08-03

It is a great illustration of the changes in French society and those who were left behind.  It also is an insightful examination of the aftermath of Napoleon, nobility, the legal system, and the economy.  It is a quick read and quite enjoyable.  If you feel that Balzac's other works are unapproachable, I would suggest starting here and diving right in.	2004-08-03

This book spends more time on the pretensions of the second tier Ivy -- Princeton than it does on the overall mystery. This is NOT a thriller, rather an overblown portrait of college buddies involved in a pretty boring literary adventure.	2004-06-27

It remains facinating and never falls into a &quot;sob story&quot;. It is rational but allows you to feel every emotion along with the author. This book is a triumph!	2001-08-24

Beau's lifelong fantasy is to bed every stripper in New Orleans? Our girl deserves better. The book has its moments but I did not see the appeal of our hero(?).	2001-04-18
