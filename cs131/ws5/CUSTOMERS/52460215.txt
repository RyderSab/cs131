Dr. Murray Heller has crafted an exhaustive book containing nearly every source of every name of every Adirondack lake, mountain, stream, river, peak, hamlet, or anything else that exists in the Adirondacks.  He even debates the reasons why one lake or peak was named one way when another was named another.  The stories (or truth) start in the 18th century and include the stories behind the names of such places as \\"Calamity Pond\\", \\"Sabbath Day Point\\" or \\"Bloody Pond\\".  Heller also mentions the history of the areas names and places throughout the centuries.  Even the 46 High Peaks have their origins uncovered and how they have changed over the years.  Dr. Heller would make an amazing leader of a `fire-side' chat.  This is a rare book and one that should be cherished for all the research, dedication and information that went into it.  There are plenty of accurate illustrations to accompany the stories.  Just for fun, why are there 43 \\"Mud Ponds\\" in the Adirondacks?  Find out!	2005-07-12

What is unique about Dr. Yalom's writing is that he is free and open in describing his own feelings about and towards his patients.  These cover a full range of emotions, including frustration, anger, disgust and empathy.  Usually one reads about the patient, but in these encounters, Dr. Yalom almost bares as much of his own pathos as his patients and that can be unsettling.<br /><br />One patient understands and is finally relieved of her eight-year obsession with a younger man, but is left with the reality of her own boring octogenarian life.  Another regards a man who is dying of cancer and would like to rape all women, especially those in his therapy group.  He is filled with anger, but finally understands how to change his human flaw before death.  Yet another chapter is just called, \\"Fat lady\\" and this is one where Dr. Yalom really lets loose with his patient.  He empathizes and completely understands her history and pain, yet readily admits to being disgusted by her appearance and was surprised that he could actually get his arms around her in a final hug.<br /><br />Some may find his technique of psychotherapy obscenely honest, yet it does put the practitioner on the same plane as the patient.  To many, that will be upsetting - to realize that the person helping you is only a human guide for your own journey towards \\"wellness\\".	2005-05-15

Sylvester was `bigger' than fabulous and Joshua Gamson's bio reveals the truth behind the incredibly talented singer.  Gamson's biography of the unusual and lovable talent rings true and is consistently level headed without drama.  There was plenty of that in Sylvester's life alone!  It's amazing that it took this story so long to be told, but it is a great one about the golden gay mecca before it turned into the gay refugee camp.  Sylvester is accurately portrayed as the virtual overnight sensation \\"queen of disco\\".  He is shown as having had a heart of gold and the simple determination of being who he was - a great icon without regrets.  Gamson should be commended for writing a long-awaited biography that is fair and balanced, representing a time that started with such great innocence and fun.  It is worth mentioning that Rolling Stone magazine reviewed Sylvester's first album and stated, \\"if you have to listen to disco, it doesn't get better than this\\".  No kidding.	2005-03-10

Jose Canseco was a true record breaker and a baseball `rock star' that earned him high honors and a lifestyle many envied in MLB. Now with his career over and his monies dwindling (don't think he is truly poor for one moment), he does what any famous retiree does - he gets someone to help him write his memoirs. There is a big difference in Canseco's book compared to other `tell-alls'. He shamelessly \\"outs\\" other players who used steroids and Human Growth Hormones and brags about injecting them. He was the `supplier'. To be fair, if he didn't do it, someone else would have. The difference is despite his shameless arrogance and lack of remorse, he provides no advice for younger athletes on the serious, long-term health dangers of steroid abuse. Instead, he glamorizes the `drugs' showing how well they served him. The bold font of this easy read shows that he is appealing to younger readers (do you think it was for the older generations?) That also helps to increase the physical volume of the book. Call it `juicing the tome'. The only thing I brought from this book is the wonder of which athletes would have been the \\"best that they could be\\" if they used no steroids. It might have been just the same, as so many have used since. In any event, for perspective one needs to think back to Babe Ruth. He was crass and mean as well, but was a killer athlete that earned his trophies with his real muscles. I suggest getting the book at the library. It's a very fast read and you won't need to spend a dime.	2005-02-15

The varieties of careers are as varied as the personalities of the women themselves.  From river guides and biologists to ecologists and log home builders, the author lives with these women in their environment and describes their loves, fears and accomplishments.  It is a tale for both men and women.  Although it may seemed slightly dated now, when women are doing anything with no raised eyebrows, it takes on a special meaning when read with the reminder that this was the sixties and seventies.  Ms. LaBastille did try to write a follow-up with each of these women, but only half were able to be located.  Another sign of the fierce but gentle individuality of these modern pioneering women.	2004-08-04

She helps innocent people in danger disappear.  There are several successful clients she meets in the first part of the novel and the dialogue is a true as can be.  There is a constant tense feel to the narrative, as not only is this job dangerous, but Jane must prove herself each time, given her race and gender.  The ultimate client she helps to disappear turns out to be other than she suspected and she is left to resolve a dangerous and deadly situation.  Most impressive in Perry's writing is his attention to detail.  Not only are all the Native American rituals and survival techniques explained in detail (and implemented), but his knowledge of the Adirondack Mountains is as accurate as a compass.  Jane travels through real existing lakes, ponds, rivers and mountains.  It's the kind of book that keeps you up well past midnight just so you can reach the climax and resolution.	2004-06-21

Although the contents are factual and certainly have real meaning for any gay man who reads it, it's still a brief summary.  If Mr. Kort had added more diverse examples of gay men's hardships and how they overcame them, it would be even more helpful.  However, that's a tricky prospect, as redundancy is a tough trap to avoid.  I am saying that the book is terribly short for the immense amount of subject matter it attempts to cover.  It seems to be geared toward the younger gay man (not necessarily in age) and can be viewed only as a short general guide.  Perhaps another book addressing issues for happy single men may be forthcoming, as we do exist.  It is still well-written, even if it does read as a tome.	2004-05-19

Set during World War II, the author describes wilderness life in great detail and realistic dialogue.  Having grown up in the hamlet of Long Lake, N.Y., the author has the opportunity to first be a waitress at the famed luxurious mountain retreat of millionaire Dr. Seward Webb, the man who built the first major railroad through the Adirondacks.  Working as a waitress at this lodge on the remote Lake Lila, Francis experiences the lives of the rich and famous.  The people as well as the incredible beauty mesmerize her.  Later, she is asked to be the first woman to occupy an extremely remote fire tower for the duration of the fire season.  During this stay she experiences isolation, bear confrontations, severe thunderstorms and the constant fear of another major fire.  Meanwhile she longs for her boyfriend who has since gone off to war.  Never losing her sensibility or her love for her wilderness job, Frances takes the reader to a period and a place that few have had the opportunity to experience.  It was another time long gone, but the sheer romanticism she writes about is immensely rewarding.	2004-05-13

Folks with ultra-conservative views will avoid this book, but they shouldn't.  It is a witty and insightful collection concerning the American political system. Sure, Franken takes particularly focused aim at conservatives, but none are without strong reason.  Everyone has a great deal to learn from this book and if you can stand it, there is plenty of humor here.  If Al Franken were to be stoic and straightforward, he would never have been published.  If you can't stand the idea of purchasing this book, then just borrow it from the library.  If you can't tolerant someone who has a different opinion than you, then go back to your TV.  Al Franken is funny, clever and knows what he is talking about.  This book may not change the world, but it may change a lot of uptight underwear.  You may also want to read any book by Bill O'Reilly.  It would make a good bookend to any of Franken's tomes.  Note that Amazon reviewers commented over 500 times on O'Reilly's latest book, while this book has over 2,700.  But, those are just numbers manipulated by someone other than Amazon.	2004-04-21

Although the film adaptation of this novel was highly criticized, it is no less a highly suspenseful, frightening and endearing story (yes, endearing). Although many of the subplots seem repeated or at least some of the themes reemerge from previous stories, they are still with great value.<br /><br />Similar to \\"Stand By Me\\", in that, four boyhood friends bind by accident with a fifth (who has unique powers) in the early portion, it progresses into an `all hell breaks loose' plot. Now the men, all adults, engage in an annual hunting ritual in the Maine woods, when an alien spacecraft crashes. Bring in the military! The consequences and unquestioned loyalty that emerges from these five men is dramatic and King presents it as absolutely normal, despite the unusual circumstances. King is good at bringing out the hero in his male characters. The plot is complex and the characters are real, so despite any time in the story when things seem like what they are, a wild twist emerges and King stings you again with a fantastic surprise. I won't even attempt to spoil you with details, but they are shocking.<br /><br />Friendship, loyalty, masculinity and humanity are the stars in this novel, despite the crazy military portions and the alien aspect. Of all of King's stories, I felt this to truly be one that pulls full circle with plot, characters and a well balanced conclusion. Mind you, it is suspenseful and gory as hell, but isn't that what Stephen King is all about?	2003-11-09

This second in a series of \\"Adirondack Ghosts\\" provides much more of the same type of fascinating and frightening material as the first book. Told much in the same style as the first with folklore and modern day ghost experiences mixed, the author continues to delight the reader.<br />Once again we have tales of poltergeists, but the main emphasis seems to be on the actual witnessing of ghosts. The beautiful area of Lake George contains the history of the Sagamore Resort, where a cook experienced a ghost speaking to him just before it passed through his body. He immediately resigned. A young boy who collected golf balls was killed by a car. His ghost is frequently seen on the greens to this day. A manor house called the \\"Tratelja\\" has stories of a woman who appears in full-bodied apparition and speaks to houseguests. In Glens Falls at St. Mary's Church, a man finds the doors locked and upon peering through the window, witnesses activeley worshiping churchgoers - all have been dead, including the priest.<br />Some of the stories are eerie and others are terribly sad. Regardless, this is a nice companion piece to the first \\"Adirondack Ghosts\\" book and continues the history of ghosts in the Adirondacks, a much needed and appreciated subject for this beautiful and historic area.	2003-10-18

Many of the stories are handed down from generation to generation.  Others are taken straight from historic sites such as Fort Ticonderoga, the Lake Placid Club and various famous local mansions and estates.<br />Although most of the activities seem to revolve around poltergeist activity (objects being moved about, sometimes in sight of the visitor), many are true ghost sightings. Several employees of a restaurant (The Anvil in Fort Edward) experienced objects and noises until they actually witnessed the ghost standing in a doorway.  An apparition appeared over the water near Pulpit Rock in Lake Placid several times until divers found a woman's body intact thirty years after she disappeared - at the very same spot (the temperature is frigid). The most harrowing is probably the author witnessing a ghostly apparition hovering over the waters of Big Moose Lake.  Grace Brown was drowned there by her lover Chester Gillette in 1906.  The story has been made into a novel (\\"An American Tragedy\\") and a film (\\"A Place In The Sun\\").  This chapter is full of accounts describing odd happenings, electrical appliances not working and many other ghost sightings by employees and guests.<br />For a relatively short book, there is a large variety of ghost stories ranging from old folklore to modern day terror.  All are interesting, but it would have been great to know more about the history of these ghosts in some cases, such as the Grace Brown murder.  However, these simply made me want to study more into the history on my own.  I recommend you read this by candlelight.	2003-10-18

However, there are some missing goodies.<br />We are treated to a somewhat humble biography about Peter Marchall, but it's mostly forgettable fluff.  Every celebrity from the show is listed in the voluminous Index with a select handful being recognized with a page or two of biographical information.  Most notable are Rose Marie, Dolly Parton, Vincent Price, Alice Cooper, Wally Cox, Milton Berle, Ruth Buzzie, Jonathan Winters and, of course, Paul Lynde.  Marshall mentions tons of jokes that each celebrity has aired with some funny personal facts as well.  The jokes are truly funny, but we learn that most of them were not written by the stars and no credibility is given to those that did.  You might think that some interesting personal trivia would be exposed, but Marshall is very protective of his gang.  Even Paul Lynde's widely known personal sexual life is ignored, covered by Marshall's proclaimed naivety and replaced with a story about Paul's devotion to his dog.<br />It's still a great quick read full of jokes and some vintage pictures form the sixties and seventies.  One of the highlights is a CD included that has 45 minutes of jokes from the television show.  It's not Dolby Surround Sound by any means, but the point is the jokes and delivery and they are real side-splitters.<br />Example:  Q:  What fictional character ran around screaming, \\"I'm late, \\"I'm late\\"?  Paul Lynde:  That was Alice, and her mother's sick about it.	2003-08-09

This second installment of the 'Woodswoman' trilogy is a step up in maturity for Dr. LaBastille. \\"Woodswoman\\" (one), dealt largely with the purchase of land and the building of a dream cabin on a remote lake. This books becomes more real, as Dr. LaBastille begins to have to worry about trespassing intruders, acid rain and the real threat that the government can pose in this unique environment. Determined not to let these new problems destroy her outlook or her life, Dr. LaBastille begins to build a second cabin - further into the wilderness. Encompassing both the new thrill of building a more isloated respite along with some freinds, brings another insight into Anne LaBastille's life ten years later. Numerous elderly Adirondack guides become great friends, sharing their own stories of the wilderness. A new romance evolves and the author has to deal with the reality of having to deal with both worlds. This book speaks not only of the wilderness, but the grand people that make and keep it unique. Of course, Dr. LaBastille's dogs are always given star treatment and her love of these animals is heartfelt. More refined and a little less naive, this second 'woodswoman' book will break and warm your heart at the same time	2003-06-23

The trilogy of \\"Woodswoman\\" has gone one step further by allowing the public one more look into Dr. Anne LaBastille's unique wilderness life.  One might get the feeling that after dozens of conservationist and environmental oriented books that Dr. LaBastille might tire of letting the public peer into her private life.  Fortunately for us, this didn't happen.<br /><br />\\"Woodswoman IIII\\" is more than just another tapestry of stories and events of these last five years.  It marks an abrupt change in the life of a woman who cannot live without a tough balance of serene isolation and public duty.  It is a mix of wilderness ideologies and humorous, but tough modern realities.<br /><br />The reader is always treated to nearly mystical stories of the woods.  These include retreating from the remote cabin on the last day of winter thaw as six inches of water cover her remote lake.  The ice cold winter water bubbles up through holes from the weight of the ice as she passes over.  It is harrowing.  The romanticism of the mountains is revealed through generations of bold and gregarious wild loons who seem to recognize their neighbor without fear, even seeming to welcome her.<br /><br />Danger is also not lacking, as Anne tells of a southern camping excursion where she and a companion where shot at and chased through an Appalachian valley, hiding overnight, cold, wet and terrified.  Her ever faithful dogs put her to the test as they get older and desperately try to protect their lifelong companion, while she cannot bear to see their inevitable mortality.<br /><br />The reality of life as a writer and lecturer continue, however, and the reader learns hard but humorous facts about the complex and harried life of a writer who decides to publish her own books.  Her \\"miserly book factory\\" is an essay on the realities of making a sparse living from writing of your endeavors.  It's hard to believe she uses no computer and the one telephone line is only shared with a FAX machine.<br /><br />This latest edition in the \\"Woodswoman\\" series contains a more modern note than the previous, but that may be the point.  Society moves on and one can only ignore the madness of progress so far before your life becomes less meaningful.

This is especially true if the person is only regionally known. However, the life of Clarence Petty is nothing short of amazing and his life story confirms him as a living legend. <br />Author Christopher Angus (\\"Reflections From Canoe Country: Paddling the Water of the Adirondacks and Canada\\") has taken on the voluminous task of writing the life story of a man who was bred, worked and still lives in the Adirondack Park. Clarence Petty was born to a poor backwoods wilderness guide and lived his life in countless professions all in the name of the environment. <br />This is not a mundane tale of a \\"Dudley Doright\\".  The reader soon discovers that Mr. Petty grew from being a well respected wilderness guide into a Federal and State conservationist, all the while honing his skills as a first class aviationist. Between these two professions Mr. Petty traveled the world. From dangerous missions over the Pacific in World War II to environmental works over Alaska and the Adirondack mountains, Clarence Petty moved forward to serve and protect the environment in which he lives. Also worth noting are the staggering number of conservancy organizations to which Mr. Petty belongs and contributes. There are few Presidents, Governors or other noteworthy politicians that Clarence Petty has not met in the last several decades. It is interesting to note that his viewpoint of politicians is adamantly level headed but not without strong opinion. <br />If the reader is not familiar with some of the colorful Adirondack legends of the past century, there are some pleasant surprises.  His family personally knew all of them and the truth behind most.  These tales are woven through the upbringing of Clarence Petty and serve as a time table to his growth. Exciting stories from mountain and river mappings to political controversies over the Adirondack Park fill the saga of Clarence Petty.  The reader can not help but wonder what keeps a man like this going so stealthily for so long. His story is impressive.<br />People like Clarence Petty seem to be put on this earth at a time they are needed most. His influence and hard work to save the qualities of the Adirondack wilderness through the most crucial era of its' existence is inspiring. Mr. Petty's story is told in an unsentimental, yet moving manner.<br />The foreword is written by Dr. Anne LaBastille, a close friend of Clarence Petty and author of the \\"Woodswoman\\" series, as well as environmental gems like, \\"Mama Poc\\" and \\"Jaguar Totem\\". Her latest book, \\"Woodswoman IIII\\" has just been released.	2003-04-21

He is a strong match for anything David Sedaris has completed to date.  This collection of short stories covers a wide range of subjects and territories and always manages to bring a chuckle.  Remarkably, this is the kind of book that does not necessarily appeal only to gays, and in that, makes it unique.  This is the best of his collections, so far, but I wouldn't discount anything he has written.  He is just too much fun!	2003-01-29

How can you possibly write a biography about one of the most successful rock bands of the last four decades and get it all right? Writers Bilyeu, Cook and Hughes (along with Brennan and Crohan and many others) have managed to achieve the impossible. With uncountable interviews and years of research, this team has placed the Gibb family and all their triumphs and tragedies into perspective.<br />Starting chronologically with the pre-marriage days of Barbara and Hugh Gibb in the 1940's up to the present, continually active Bee Gees, we are presented with every viewpoint, memory and recollection of the three brothers and their freinds and acquaintances. The highs and lows of the Bee Gees and Andy Gibbs' careers are not glossed over or over-emphasized. They are told with 'matter-of-fact' honesty and sincerity; a refreshing exercise in storytelling. The read is fast and crisp with a personal edge lacking anything close to newscopy.<br />After the conclusion, there are numerous, wonderful appendixes including more comments from folks close to the Gibbs, a complete album and singles discography, a cover versions list and a bibliography with book, magazine, newspaper and Internet Web Sites.<br />All the beauty marks and all the scars are here. It just makes the Gibb family more human. They may be ordinary people, but they have had extraordinary lives.	2002-12-03

Whether you liked SNL in 1975 or enjoy it now, this book is an amusing romp through the history of the show.  Although the years have been filled with amazing talent, it's still surprising to hear from others that it was primarily the genius of Lorne Micheals, the guy behind the scenes, that got the show going and continuing.  This is stuff you DON'T see on television.<br />There are too many episodes of outlandish behavior to describe here, but suffice it to say there are things that went on that should have killed most shows.  There's lots of gossip, of course, and many of the cast members embarrass themselves while trashing others and many that are a heck of a lot sweeter than you would think (Jane Curtin comes to mind).  There is blatant talk of alleged 'racism', 'anti-feminism' (one member refused to do skits written by women) and outrageous drug use during, before and after the shows.  In fact, in the beginning, it seems the show needed that edge to survive, or to survive, needed that edge.<br />No matter.  This voluminous collection of after-thoughts is entertaining, hilarious and sometimes sad.  You can decide where the true talent was, who had the biggest heart or who was the biggest jerk.  This book is full of them and I highly recommend it.	2002-11-09

Culled from dozens and dozens of first hand account recollections, it is not for the timid nor even the brave.  I found myself tearing up with every section.  Each story is different and yet each one draws from the same source - the helpless horror that all felt on that day.  It is heart wrenching and it is horrifically gory.  Descriptions of that day are beyond belief and it is hard to imagine anyone surviving it without a lifetime of emotional hardship.  It goes beyond that as well.  It is impossible to describe this book as eloquently as those that lived it have.  Every walk of life is spoken here and every voice is full of a human spirit we all share.  I cannot begin to go further in recommending this book.  It is therapy.	2002-08-29

Gary Randolf has done a remarkable job of splicing natural history, Americans and psychical beauty into one great book.  Traveling through time and seasons, the reader feels the words and witnesses the beauty of the Adirondack mountains.  It's not just full of incredible landscape shots (both subtle and grand) but is matched with a moving narrative that warns us this island paradise will always be in danger.<br />Time for the world to take heed, especially in a period of history when our government seems to feel that acid rain is so irreversible here, that we can actually lower emissions standards?  That the damage is already done?  It's not too late, and Mr. Randorf reminds us with every page.	2002-08-19

Chris Alexander is an excellent writer who manages to get to the heart of a matter and make sense.  Much emphasis is placed on a person's synergy and if that sounds too mystical to you - it's not.  It's simply about the way one chooses to think and act everyday.  Practical methods that you can use everyday will soon have you realize that much of the stress we put ourselves through is wasteful and unnecessary.  This is a fast read and one that seems almost too simple and too good to be true.  Well, I can only suggest reading it, but I found it to be very practical.	2002-08-14

Henry A. Harter has written one of those rare and unique books that comletely and exhaustively decribes the history and details of one of the most fabled railroads in the world.  Not only do you read about the rich and famous that helped build this railroad (and all of it's privately owned spurs), but there are detailed plans showing locations and gauges of all the lengths of rails.  Long gone RR stations are described in location and historical function.  Although it can be a tad dry sometimes, one never loses the feeling of romantism regarding this great period of history.<br />I certainly hope that someone writes and updated version of this railroad including all the political and natural circumstances that have affected it since it went into disrepair after the 1980 Olympics.  Until then, nothing matches this marvelously ,heavily researched book.	2002-08-09

Only David Sedaris can take a mundane activity and turn it inside out so intensely and simply that you can't stop laughing.  This collection includes his morbid Greek grandmother who turns the family life upside down until they force her into not one, but two nursing homes where she traumatizes all around her.  As a youngster, Sedaris finds an old pornographic novel with horrible typos that speaks of relentless incest.  Passing it down to his sisters, they all develop a fear of their &quot;sexual prowling&quot; parents.  Senior Sedaris tricks the kids into going golfing only to have sister Lisa have her first period at the fourteenth hole in front of all the Golfing big shots.  Does the author stop hitch-hiking after several attempts on his life?  No.  This he finds exciting, made all the better when he can produce marijuana to calm any fag-hating drivers.  The stories are alarmingly fresh and Sedaris' viewpoint is so violently skewed, you wonder how he lives his life at all.  This is a hilarious outlook on life.	2001-11-18

Revel in his memoir of his love affairs and fights amongst the rich and famous such as Charlton Heston, Pat Buchanan, Chuck Connors and his ultimate love, Mike Tyson.  Listen in on Sedaris' account of living with his aunt and hearing all of his Mother and her sister's sordid stories.  Nothing smacks of hilarious hypocrisy more than Sedaris telling his freind Gill he that he drinks too much while he cannot understand why using the vacumn cleaner as a pillow unintentially is wrong.  If you have ever known a smoker, &quot;Diary Of A Smoker&quot; will have you licking ashtrays to stop from laughing.

Dave Eggers writes of simple and ordinary stories, unless losing two parents in five months and moving to California to work and raise your younger brother while you are trying to pull together some sort of sexual and social life while these morons are all around you, not even noticing how smart and clever you are and then just going on with their ordinary lives as if YOU never existed. Well. I apologize. That was my seriously pathetic attempt at mimicing Mr. Eggers style. One cannot mimic Mr. Eggers style. It is...un-mimicable! His style can drive you buggers, as he writes in a run-on, stream of conciousness, \\"fight or flight\\", semi-neurotic, nearly amphetaminically induced mania enhanced state. Then he pulls back. Kind of. Maybe. Maybe not. I'm not sure. Oh hell. Does it matter? Yes it does. But I cannot review this book so soon after reading it as I am developing the same kind of obsessive-compulsive narcissistic self-indulgence that the author is so good at doing to himself (and others, if you really want to know), but that is none of my business and none of yours either, except that he writes it all down so well, you just want to hug him, and then kick him really hard in the face, no, in the leg, no the face. Yes. That will do. In the face. But I highly recommend this book to anyone who can sit on BART and manage to completely enjoy everything about this new wave West Coast twenty-something book.. Even the maudlin tales are way excellent. Sorry. I did not mean to say, \\"way\\".	2001-10-26

One story deals with a woman's notes to her freinds after her family is forced to take in a young, female Vietnamese adult (a vestige of the husband's war mistakes) who speaks a language learned from Sesame Street watchings (\\"shiny, big bird, five dollar\\"). There is nothing but hilarious bedlam for the family, accented, of course, by the Christmas Holidays. Another deals with a true story of Sedaris' sister taking a crack whore home for the Holidays. The family considers this very cool and with his family, you'l easily see why. However, the ultimate laugh is Sedaris' short-lived stint as a Santa Claus elf in New York's Macys. Born of adult men and one midget, all because they are short, Sedaris describes the outrageous tedium and shocking marching orders they have to endure. The Santa crowds with or without children are mercilessly dissected, as well they should be, as Sedaris wonderfully describes this terrible thing that is 'visiting Santa'. This book is far too short, but well worth the endorphic giggles it induces.	2001-09-23

It truly takes a lot to make me laugh, but I learned not to read anything by David Sedaris in public. His skewed inside viewpoints of life are hilariously offbeat and ring true. So true, that you will be laughing out loud. Whether describing his amphetamine induced college \\"performance art\\" shenanigans or his childhood abuse by a speech therapist bent on taking glee in his curiously high-pitched lisp, Sedaris knocks you over with a literary feather laced with lead. Commentaries on New Yorkers, southerners or any other ethnic or regional folk are side-splittingly accurate. Always self-depracating, Sedaris is kind enough to include everyone in his hit-list of ridiculous human behavior. As a reference, David Sedaris' wack-job of a sister is also highlighted. It is no surprise that she went on to be a major contributor to Comedy Central's \\"Strangers With Candy\\". Don't be surprised however, if everyone you tell this book about has already read it.	2001-09-15

Born of a poor Mid-western Salvation Army family, Griffiths becomes romantically involved with a woman of his own class, only to fall in love with a socialite just beyond his grasp.  A series of miscalculations evolves and Griffiths finds himself lost in his own web of tragedy and panic.<br />Occurring mostly in the resort of Big Moose Lake, N.Y. during the hey-day of Adirondacks, the mood and characters are all too believable and Dreiser paints a romantically painful picture of a man who cannot escape his roots and destiny.<br />Don't be beset by the voluminous writing.  The structure, narration and characterization is perfect.  Dreiser truly has created the perfect All American novel.  If you can pace your reading to prevent getting ahead of yourself, you will notice the careful style Dreiser has created that turns a neat full circle by the end.<br />Made famous by the film, &quot;A Place In The Sun&quot; with Montgomery Clift, Shelley Winters and Elizabeth Taylor.	2001-08-04

Plimpton does a great literary service in this collection of &quot;gossip&quot; so perfectly interwoven, one can't realize how much fun a hayride it is. Beginning with Capote's Southern family relationships and the odd upbringing he had, Plimpton portrays Capote as a willing oddball star. The early years are romatic and endearing. Capote's New York success is also portrayed in a whimsical, almost surreal fashion, showcasing the enormous success and easy high society friends Capote made. It is made clear that as talented as this flambouyant author was, he truly published little for his lifetime, a thorn in the side of his nemesis, Gore Vidal - a master of historic quantitative excess. Peaking with &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, Plimpton truly gets under the skin of Capote and reveals that this was his tormenting climax and one that he would never get over emotionally. The biography becomes desperate at this point with reasons I will not disclose here. However, the downward spiral continues, as Capote publishes &quot;Answered Prayers&quot;, satiring all the friends that helped make him a New York socialite. Sinking into alcohol induced depression, Capote retreats to Joanna Carson's home in California to revel in his accompishments and defeats. A heartfelt but terribly depressing ending. Much kudos for Plimpton for bringing out the multitude of characters, comments and opinions from many sources and inter-twining them into a marvelous biography. It almost makes you wish you had a friend like Capote, almost.	2001-07-25

But, what do you expect from a book that dives into &quot;near death experiences?&quot;  Nothing can be proven.  However, it does make for an interesting read and the author at least has learned something in his life about inherent goodness.  The author also speaks of things like 'crystal cathedrals', over one hundred revelations and higher beings with energy fields.  It makes for fantastic fodder and pauses one to think seriously.  I found some of the claims to be outrageous, but still, the reader will become consumed, if only for the symphathetic outreachings of the writer.  Brinkley also speaks of his new found power and how he only uses it for 'good' things.  Well, this is all wonderful and good, and I really want to believe all he has to say.  However, even with the help of a co-writer (Perry), the writing is sophmoric and trite.  Certainly, a topic this ethereal and spiritual needs a heavier handed editor.  You may feel 'good' after reading it, or just bored, but for a few bucks, it's worth it.	2001-07-23

With 84 hikes described in detail, Mr. O'Shea calculates distance and time, fascinating history of the areas and descriptions of the flora and possible animal sightings.  Seasons of the year are also described according to what trails are reasonable in winter or summer as well as appropriate safety recommendations.  Sights most hikers might missed are noted and most trails have simple accurate maps.  The back envelope of this guide contains a very detailed topo map of the Cranberry Lake Region and the Upper Saranac Lake Region.  This guide not only improves your trip but can save you great distress with the analysis of lesser traveled trails.  The 1995 microburst destroyed many popular trails and one will have second thoughts about traveling these routes.  However, there are so many fantastic places to visit, you'll have no trouble finding a hike to remember.	2001-07-11

This books becomes more real, as Dr. LaBastille begins to have to worry about trespassing intruders, acid rain and the real threat that the government can pose in this unique environment.  Determined not to let these new problems destroy her outlook or her life, Dr. LaBastille begins to build a second cabin - further into the wilderness.  Encompassing both the new thrill of building a more isloated respite along with some freinds, brings another insight into Anne LaBastille's life ten years later.  Numerous elderly Adirondack guides become great friends, sharing their own stories of the wilderness.  A new romance evolves and the author has to deal with the reality of having to deal with both worlds.  This book speaks not only of the wilderness, but the grand people that make and keep it unique.  Of course, Dr. LaBastille's dogs are always given star treatment and her love of these animals is heartfelt.  More refined and a little less naive, this second 'woodswoman' book will break and warm your heart at the same time.	2001-06-14

Mind you, I am a great fan of Dr. LaBastille and have nearly all of her books; most of them signed.  However, this third installment of her career as a &quot;woodswoman&quot; seems achingly final.  All three books are adventures in the North Woods, however, this one clearly shows how her writing has matured with her own experiences.  With harsher stories of vandals, environmental scoundrels and the personal tragedies, she seems to counter it all with great stories of bravery, incredible freindships and profound people.  She still endears the reader with magical stories of the woods, lakes and mountains.  Marking her third decade living in the Adirondack wilderness, Dr. LaBastille's writing is more realistic, world-wary and sometimes achingly mature.  Facing ageing, near helplessness at the pollution and noise on wilderness lakes, she still keeps her sense of humor with great dignity.  A gracious gift or a book for your collection; she shares her life of passion.	2001-06-14

This book is not limited to the Adirondacks, but includes Central America and Alaska.  Each work is mesmerizing and invokes the true feeling of beauty in the wilderness and the kind people she has met along her travels.  You can find this book and the search is worth it.<br /><br />As most collector's items go, they are hard to find and can go for a high price.  However, I find that asking over $1,100 for this book is something that even Dr. LaBastille would find obscene, particularly in her world.	2001-06-14

All aspects of this remarkable region are well represented from the wildest of waterways and majectic peaks to the outlying areas of cozy farms and inland towns.  By far the most amazing photographs are those in wide-screen format - much wider than anything this reviewer has seen elsewhere.  Ranging  from awe-filled aerial views from high peaks in all seasons to the intimate settings of bogs and marshes, Hellman captures the mood of these mountains.  Mist shrouded ponds, newly falling snow, green glimpses through mature virgin forests and close-ups from lady-slippers to primeval bogs; the viewer is mesmerized.  Overwhelming beauty and the calm feeling of a lonely untouched wilderness is caught everywhere.  This is a collector's item to cherish all year long.	2001-06-05

Oliver Sacks has always had a knack for deftly explaining the sometimes confusing world of neurology, but &quot;Anthropologist&quot; is a remarkable series of case studies.  Dr. Sacks weaves the tales of seven human beings, each having a different neurological &quot;difference&quot; and portraying them in a matter of fact, logical light.  Instead of viewing each person as having a disability, Dr. Sacks focuses on the remarkable way they have learned to adapt and make the best out of all situations.  What to make of a painter that is colorblind?  How can a person with Tourette Syndrome possibly be a surgeon?  Why does an autistic teenager seem unable to verbally communicate appropriately, yet shows signs of immense, almost sacred &quot;feelings&quot; in his drawings?  All these questions are anwered and mostly with more questions.  However, this book differs than most in that it manages to bring a &quot;soulful spirit&quot; to those of which Dr. Sacks writes.  A spirit that eludes most human beings.	2001-06-04

Peter O'Shea's \\"The Great South Woods\\" is a detailed and heartfelt account of the flora, fauna, geography and people of the Northwestern part of the Adirondack Park.<br /><br />All the native creatures of the area are described in detailed narratives similiar to one heard around a deep woods campfire.  Golden eagles, racoons, bears, bobcat, snowshoe hare, beaver and white tailed deer are just a few of the animals reviewed in detail and passion.  O'Shea easily describes the large variety of trees native to the area.  Black cherry, white ash, tamarack, sugar maple, white birch and white pine read more like personalized characters rather than simple plant materials.  The rivers and famous waterfalls of the region are also portrayed in delicate prose, prompting one to want to visit them over and over, if only in this book.<br /><br />Hiking along these ancient trails, O'Shea conveys a magical aura to everything he views, including the sweeping vistas from the many peaks and the experience of having a quiet hike interupted by a flight of a grouse or the discovery of a rare plant in a bog.  Not content to stop with these topics, O'Shea delves further into the local lore and legend with well researched stories of the trappers, guides and sportsmen that first discovered and then protected this land.  You'll find many favorite passages here and a wealth of information that will last lifetimes.	2001-06-04

From issue #1 of Nov. 1967, John Lennon launches Rolling Stone in war garb and continues to grace more covers with and without the Beatles.  &quot;The Complete Covers&quot; is a time machine of photographs (most from acclaimed photographer Annie Leibovitz) reminding us of the issues that we faced and the climate of the music.  We can watch our rock heroes get older with us and witness the new birth of music groups over again.  Politics are always included at critical time periods and, of course, our more liberal movie stars are here to set another kind of tome for the period.  Although ending in 1997 with the cover of 'Women In Rock', you can bet that Rolling Stone gives us another in 2027.  Enjoy!	2001-05-28

How can you possibly write a biography about one of the most successful rock bands of the last four decades and get it all right?  Writers Bilyeu, Cook and Hughes (along with Brennan and Crohan and many others) have managed to achieve the impossible.  With uncountable interviews and years of research, this team has placed the Gibb family and all their triumphs and tragedies into perspective.<br /><br />Starting chronologically with the pre-marriage days of Barbara and Hugh Gibb in the 1940's up to the present, continually active Bee Gees, we are presented with every viewpoint, memory and recollection of the three brothers and their freinds and acquaintances.

His latest, \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" manages to spin a tale of orphan misfits, detectives, gangsters and a main character that suffers from Tourette Syndrome into an impressive, rapid paced melee.  The descriptions of the Brooklyn area, the characters and all the necessary sensory perceptions needed come through in snappy prose.  Lethem's description of the 'impulses' and 'partly contollable' symptoms of Tourette are dead-on.  Never has this reviewer read anything that so accurately captures the essence of Tourette and the personality in a novel.  The reader can feel the symptoms of Tourette welling up in themselves as strongly as the character does on the page.<br /><br />Half detective story and half a case study of a young man with Tourette, Lethem intertwines the two deftly, giving the reader little time to breathe between events.<br /><br />The detective story may be slightly hackneyed and the closeness of the orphans and thier Fagan-like detective mentor could have been more intimately detailed, but Lionel Essrog and his Tourette's make fantastic fodder.  Lethem goes for broke.  This novel describes Tourette and real life on the streets like no other author has before.	2000-11-06

Yet, few describe the  multitude of reasons for this event, much less the brave people who fight  the battles.  Dr. Anne LaBastille's, &quot;Mama Poc&quot; details the  myriad of mistakes and consequences of the now extinct Atitlan giant grebe.  Starting over 25 years ago, Dr. LaBastille started a one-person movement  to save a rare species of a water bird on a large volcanic lake in the  middle of Guatemala.  A modern day Dr. Livingston, Anne LaBastille dealt  with local residents of Lake Atitlan, the Guatemalan government and dozens  of foundations to obtain the necessary grants.  These were not just to save  a bird species, but a large recreational lake, a way of life and the  residents livelihood.  The author has woven a personal memoir detailing the  dilemmas of her work.  Far from a flat testimonial, one reads about the  friends and coworkers that befriended Dr. LaBastille during her years of  research.  It is a personal story as well as a brilliant documentary of her  research filled with stories of earthquakes, revelations, periless lake  storms, successes, political guerillas, murder and love.  At first the  reader may wonder why on earth someone would go through all this trouble to  save a water bird.  By the end of the first chapter you will find yourself  cheering for the underdog with all the odds stacked against her. The  Smithsonian Institution's Thomas E. Lovejoy summed it all up in the  'forward'.  &quot;The measure of our success will be in the number of  species that survive.  They will also be our reward&quot;.  Well said.	2000-09-10
