I thoroughly enjoyed Steve Sullivan's book on some forgotten glamour gals of the 50's and 60's.I particularly enjoyed reading about Joy Harmon and Cynthia Myers.Joy Harmon was an adolescent fantasy of mine ever since she popped out of her clothes in &quot;Village of the Giants.&quot;Myers may have been beautiful,but she proves she's no brain surgeon when she states that she went to the Democratic convention in Chicago in 1968 and met Adlai Stevenson.He'd been dead 3 years by then!Oh,well.All in all,an excellent book!	2000-11-04

I really hesitated before reading this book.What more could possibly be  said regarding Monica,Bill,et al?But Joe Esterhas has written a great  book.I would reccomend it to anyone-you won't be disappointed.Some may find  it too graphic.(Obviously,they never read the Starr report.)But if you are  interested in a book that tells it like it is,this is the only book you'll  ever need to read about &quot;Monicagate.&quot;	2000-09-04
