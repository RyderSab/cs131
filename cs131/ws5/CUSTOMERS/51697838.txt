Hart's book is profound, sorely needed, and right on. She argues that idolizing children and focusing solely on their self-esteem is not healthy. Clearly they need nurturing, but not to the exclusion of limits, ground rules, and a solid understanding of right and wrong. Parents need to be authority figures. They also, she argues, need to stop obsessing about perfect kids and realize that mistakes can become learning opportunities that help children grow into healthy, well centered adults. And, of course, she argues against falling for the latest 60-seconding parenting tip of the day. Her work helps shift the focus back to parent's proper roles and responsibilities in guiding the character of their children. I taught in a public school part-time for eight years and currently teach martial arts to kids (and adults). I have seen the behavioral problems she refers to over and over again and have seen first hand how her approach really does work. And I use a similar approach with my own kids. This book is well written, compelling, and sorely needed. It's about time someone promulgated this approach. Highly recommended!	2005-10-12

The writing is adequate, the knowledge is for the most part correct, the pictures while small and elementary are serviceable, and the information is okay but frankly nothing in this book stands out as special at all. There are stepping/footwork drills, solo drills, and two person drills that are usable as a supplement for just about any Japanese sword art. There is nothing truly wrong with this book but in my mind it is about 100 pages of extraordinary averageness.

Books	3	21	25	N	N	Interesting but not great	There are some good \\"combat\\" techniques for knife throwing, but \\"life-saving material\\" as the title indicates, I kinda doubt it. The author does seem to know his stuff and the illustrations, while basic, are pretty clear and helpful. The quality of the writing, on the other hand, is a bit below par. Topics covered include an introduction to spear-style throwing, basics of combat knife throwing, balancing a knife for throwing, targeting, psychological/physical conditioning, hunting/recreation skills, and a bit of interesting historical/context stuff as well. There is also a fairly in-depth chapter for spear-style throwing as well as one for combat throwing techniques, insomuch as you can go in-depth in about a 100 total pages.<br /><br />It's an interesting tome but not really a groundbreaking one. It also has some iffy ideas. The challenge as I see it is that the focus of the book is primarily on techniques without looking at the larger picture. I've frankly got a philosophical problem with throwing a knife in combat, even if you are in the military. First off, only weapons balanced for throwing will work properly for that application in the first place so you must be carrying a specialty device in order to be able to execute the techniques. Once you do throw your knife not only do you potentially lose your weapon, but you are also operating at some distance from your opponent. Unless you are in an active war zone, that probably won't play too well in court. After all, if you've got distance you'll have to explain to a jury why you couldn't run away avoiding the confrontation before it became violent in the first place as well as why you were carrying an offensive weapon (throwing knives just aren't defensive devices no matter how you spin it... and knives in general are hard enough to justify in court as it is).<br /><br />I'm not all that great at knife throwing but I did learn some new stuff and improve a bit from this book. All in all, if you take it as an academic instruction book to develop throwing skills for fun or possibly even for survival/hunting it's a pretty decent reference. From a self-defense perspective, on the other hand, I think it is a bit off target.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instructionbook to develop throwing skills for fun or possibly even for survival/hunting it's a pretty decent reference.

A little over half the book is dedicated to his early life as a law school student, FBI agent, and US District Court judge, with somewhat less information than I would have expected from the title devoted to his tenure as head of the department. Freeh unmistakably has an ax to grind with former President Clinton taking shots on the Lewinski scandal, Whitewater, the Kobar towers investigation, and the Marc Rich pardon among other things. Clearly he is relating his personal perspective (who doesn't), but I found myself feeling somewhat sorry for him as he related his struggles to work for a boss he clearly found unappealing. There is fascinating insight into the inner-workings of the agency and some of the political challenges that law enforcement professionals must face when conducting their business but that portion of the book is a bit too short in my opinion. The writing is clear, the chronicle is easy to follow, and the overall narrative is pretty interesting yet I came away feeling a little unfulfilled. I certainly think it was worth the time to read though. I give this one a pretty good but not stellar rating.	2005-10-11

It is really about the basic fundamentals that make any martial art work properly when you take your dojo skills on the street. This is good solid stuff, not particularly exciting, but absolutely essential, cerebral, and right on. The authors are highly skilled and their experience really resonates within these pages.<br /><br />As most long-term martial artists know, earning a black belt is really just the beginning of a practitioner's martial journey. Since obtaining mine I discovered that the more I know, the more I realize that the fundamentals are paramount. That's the focus of this book. The SWOT analysis is an important tool described herein. It stands for Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat, an invaluable tool for error detection as you place your techniques under a microscope. Essential nuances of structure, posture, body mechanics, and positioning are critical for success and well described herein. The writing is clear, articulate, and easy to follow. The highlighted practice hints are a nice addition too.<br /><br />My only complaint, which frankly is pretty minor, is that the pictures do not have very good contrast and there are harsh vertical lines on the wall in the background of many of them that make them a little challenging to view. Furthermore, there really are not enough photos to illuminate everything properly unless you've been practicing martial arts for a while and understand what the authors are talking about.<br /><br />There is a very short section on the purpose of weapons and weapons training and a brief overview of what happens when you utilize this knowledge in the real world but the vast majority of the materials are focused on getting the basics right. Topics covered include range, weight transfer, positioning, posture, placement, blocking, punching, stances, kicking, elbows, takedowns, and throws.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent and highly recommended book.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instructionking, elbows, takedowns, and throws.

Translated as \\"In the Shadow of Leaves\\" the various anecdotes cover everything from dying properly to how to avoid yawning in public. The Hagakure was once a secret text known only to the samurai vassals of the Hizen fief. Consequently this is translation offers unique insight into feudal Japan.

Written by one of the nation's leading experts on aggression and real-life fighting, it is a clear and comprehensive approach to refining your ability to survive a violent encounter.<br /><br />Before describing the content of this book it is worthwhile pointing out what an effective offense is and why you ought to care about it: If you get beat down on the street you will be totally at the mercy of your attacker for your continued well-being. You could just as easily wake up in the hospital as you could end up in a box. At a time when an 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient was raped and murdered less than an hour after wandering away from her residence, a father was beaten to death by three teenagers in front of his son, and thousands of other murders, muggings, and beatings took place around the country this very week, there might not be all that much mercy out there for you if you lose a street encounter to the wrong person. Don't get me wrong, this book certainly does not advocate picking fights, but it does show a comprehensive methodology for turning the tables on your attacker if you are assaulted and cannot get away.<br /><br />As a 30+ year martial artist I did not find a whole lot that I did not already know but I did discover a new lens for viewing the knowledge, one that is quite enlightening. The author's writing style is refreshing and clear, devoid of the cynical platitudes and four letter witticisms that fill many of his previous works. You get all of Animal's experience without his attitude, something that has turned off traditional martial artists from MacYoung's works in the past. It's not that the previous works did not have great content just that they were somewhat hard to read for many folks. That's definitely not a problem here. It's packed with vital information and pleasant to read.<br /><br />Contents include components of effective power, understanding range, body movement, structure, blocking and deflecting, parrying and countering, pulling, twisting, and takedowns among other subjects. The pictures and illustrations truly complement the excellent text. The book really helps you understand what works and why, set priorities, and develop a mindset that can really work. And it's easy to integrate into what you already know (in fact the author encourages just that). It helps you get your priorities straight and be sure that you can accomplish them. I really believe that this is MacYoung's best book yet.

The term fight implies a rule-based contest yet the reality is that there is no fight, at least not in the traditional sense. Assassination attempt might be a better description. I've survived a couple of knife encounters over the years and can tell you first hand that they are nothing like you see in the movies or on TV. The author provides a direct, no-nonsense explanation of the mindset, tactics, and simple techniques to use in an edged-weapons confrontation. Contents include the basics of knife fighting, knife fighting myths, knife attack, knife defense, and training. The information imparts some critical information for your survival but is way too short to be considered complete.

This is outstanding book is the logical concatenation of his numerous talents, a true A-to-Z guide to everything you need to know about sushi including what to eat, how to eat it, and what to drink with what you eat. It covers the rice, types of sushi you can obtain, toppings, fillings, condiments, utensils, accompaniments, etiquette, and more. The 300+ pages are packed with interesting and useful information to keep you from embarrassing yourself and make your dining experience more enjoyable. The \\"watch for,\\" \\"trivia,\\" and \\"ask the itamae\\" call-outs are really neat features.<br /><br />The book is broken into three parts. Part one covers everything about the sushi itself including rice, nigiri sushi (hand-pressed), maki sushi (wrapped or rolled), chirashi sushi (scattered), oshi sushi (pressed), tane (toppings), gu (fillings), and nori (seaweed). Part two is an in-depth primer of the various types of fish used for sushi. Part three explains the practice and etiquette of eating sushi, including condiments, drinks, utensils, accoutrements and furnishings, the itamae (sushi chef), and sushi ritual.<br /><br />The only bad thing about this otherwise outstanding book is that it has no pictures. I'm still giving it five stars because the content is so good, but it would have been even better with color photos of the various types of fish and pictures or drawings of the other items he refers to that many readers will not be familiar with. Regardless, as with all of Lowry's books it is comprehensive, easy to read, filled with interesting vignettes, and very useful. I was first introduced to sushi (and sashimi) at a judo tournament in 1972, yet I learned a lot I did not already know in this fine tome.

I've read hundreds of martial arts books over the years yet still found much I didn't already know in the Okinawan history. For a guy with a Ph.D., the author thankfully doesn't write like an academic. His writing style is pleasant, articulate, and easy to follow. His stories of the karate masters are very interesting, truly bringing them to life. I particularly liked the one about how Kosaku Matsumora disarmed a Satsuma samurai using a \\"wet towel.\\" He uses that one, among numerous others, to make some excellent points about how truth is viewed in Asian culture. A legacy of the Takugawa Shoganate, tatemae (official truth/outward story) often varies from honne (secret truth/inward story). [...] yet the official story is much more heroic. This wonderful insight into historical Okinawa makes the book well worth reading all by itself.<br /><br />The author makes a compelling case that the origin of modern Shotokan was in the brutal fighting arts developed by and for the Okinawan King's bodyguards. Much of karate and kobudo was developed by the nobles of that area in response to their environment where they had to figure out a way to stay safe from numerous, frequently armed enemies during a total weapons ban. He demonstrates a variety of interesting bodyguard-oriented bunkai (applications), things you don't commonly imagine finding in kata like forcing a path through a crowd, throwing an enemy at his friends, using a human shield, leaping past a blocking enemy, stealing weapons, abducting an enemy, and stairway fighting. These applications are creative, interesting, and eye-opening. There are a few mistakes such as a misunderstanding of sanchin kata (which isn't used by Shotokan anyway) but nothing overly disappointing.<br /><br />The book is a little light on techniques but quite thorough on principles, history, and assertions that can help you look at traditional kata in new and interesting ways. The pictures and illustrations complement the excellent text. The final section brings all the historical stuff full circle, describing a vision of a \\"Shuri II,\\" the author's projection of what modern karate should encompass today.

It's not often that I come across one that I truly detest but unfortunately this is one of that select group. The truly sad part is that it has much potential. After all, it is written by one of the world's foremost experts on the subject. Okay, here is why I don't think it's worth the paper it is written on:<br /><br />First off, it is in reality a puff piece, a 20-page book masquerading as a 208 page one. Less than one third of the work actually has any data that you can learn anything from. The rest is superfluous pictures that are only tangentially related to the text, historical illustrations, and a copy of the original text in Japanese (which is neat if you can actually read it I suppose). Most of the photos are intentionally blurred to show movement. One or two like that is kinda cool but in this case it is way, way over done. They are hard to look at and literally gave me a headache by the time I got done. And they have very little to do with explaining what is going on or how to do the techniques. The text is also poorly written (or perhaps merely inelegantly translated) and hard to follow.<br /><br />If you are looking for an interesting coffee table tome with some artsy pictures go ahead and pick this up. If you want a serious martial arts learning tool get something (nearly anything) else.

This comprehensive book is holistic, easy to understand, and very well written. Like all of Martina's work, the principles and concepts are well-researched and really work. Her work is unique and remarkable because it provides a scientific approach that helps readers truly understand why/how techniques work without being boring, condescending, or long winded.<br /><br />As the title indicates, this book covers all aspects of aspects of throws and takedowns as they relate to self-defense. The author focuses on gross motor movements so that the applications will actually work under stress in actual combat, describes drills to help you master the techniques, and then demonstrates how to apply the principles in various scenarios. An entire chapter is devoted to each major category of takedowns: leg, body/arm, neck, rearward throws, forward throws, empty hand and weapon presses, stick leverage, and knife defense.<br /><br />Principles include shifting the center of gravity, gaining positional superiority, using momentum, utilizing torque, and applying an aggressive mindset. Scenarios include striking attacks (including those initiated with a knife or stick), grabbing attacks, surprise attacks, and preemptive attacks. There are also important tips that should help you train more safely. The only thing I did not absolutely love about this book is that while there are hundreds of photos help clarify the brilliant writing, many of them were grainy and hard to see. That may have just been a printing error on the copy I purchased so I'll not downgrade my evaluation based on that one shortcoming.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent tome, highly recommended for serious martial artists!<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-09-23

While this material is accurate and practical, it is very cursory (seriously, how much insight can you really get onto 50 cards...). Having said that, however, it really is a great format for conveying the basic concepts that everyone interested in self-protection should know. The material is organized into four color-coded categories: (1) planning and setting boundaries, (2) nonviolent strategies, (3) basic physical techniques, (4) advanced physical techniques. Each card describes a possible scenario, explains methods you can use to defend against it, and provides a quick reference tip. Illustrations are the back of each card help you visualize what you are supposed to do. The non-physical escapes and awareness tips are in many ways more important than the physical techniques since not everyone has the physical skills or emotional wherewithal to apply potentially lethal applications on another human being. If you are a serious martial artist this deck is probably not for you.

Based on his considerable success as a martial artist and author, Iain Abernethy lays out a step-by-step methodology for overcoming doubt, building self-confidence, and achieving your dreams. Nothing in this book is rocket science yet his codification of a straightforward, understandable, and implementable process is nothing short of brilliant. As I read through his excellent tome I found myself thinking, \\"Yeah, that is how I did that\\" several times. Without knowing it, I've followed his process in achieving most of my major successes in my life, stuff like earning a blackbelt in karate, publishing three books and dozens of articles, gaining promotions at work, and building strong relationships at home. Abernethy's clear, encouraging guidance will show you how to develop a strong, powerful mind, grow your talents, become the person you want to be, and live the life you want to live too.

The end result is an odd tome-- one that is too challenging for most kids yet does not contain enough information for most parents.<br /><br />It is very short, a mere 48 pages, and rather expensive at that. The fact that it was printed in hard cover drives up the price beyond the value of the contents in my opinion. It probably would have been better as a soft cover with expanded content or similar content edited to more kid friendly grammar.<br /><br />The author clearly knows his stuff (he's been teaching since 1960) but I'm not convinced that this layout makes good use of his knowledge. It misses the sweet spot between ease of reading and value of content. It could also have benefited by including more information about how to find a teacher/class to meet your needs, both from the kid's perspective as well as the parent's.<br /><br />The contents include a (very) short history of kung fu, descriptions of the major kung fu styles, getting ready for training, what to expect on your first day of class, rules/etiquette, common class structure/flow, basic elements (e.g., stances, punches, kicks), basic forms, advancement and testing, and a brief summary of what benefits you can get from practicing this art form.<br /><br />Overall: Good concept yet poorly executed.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-08-09

Her writing is insightful, easy to understand, and, most importantly, her ideas really do work. The photos are clear and do a good job of reinforcing the text.<br /><br />Strength and power training is important--if you want to perform in the ring, on the street, or in just about any martial endeavor, functional strength is an essential component of success. As the author so eloquently states, martial arts skill, background and experiences are not substitutes for strength; they are complementary qualities. If you are overweight, under-conditioned, or lazy, you must condition yourself above the basic requirements of your art, regardless of what kinds of hurdles stand in your way. So how do you build muscular strength, endurance, and power? By reading this outstanding book, of course... Well, that and making a concerted effort to regularly perform the exercise routines contained herein ;-).<br /><br />The book begins by debunking common misconceptions about strength training then briefly covers important anatomical facts you'll need to take best advantage of the rest of the materials. Ms. Sprague's in-depth knowledge really shines through, explaining how each muscle group is used in the various martial arts, how to develop it effectively, and how to take advantage of anatomical strengths when striking, kicking, or grappling.<br /><br />Topics include bodyweight and mechanical weight exercises, muscular endurance, strength and flexibility, upper body strength, abdominal strength, plyometrics, cardiovascular endurance, breathing, and flexibility. The mental approach necessary for successful training programs is also laid out. One of the biggest gems in this fine work is right at the end of the book where the author describes how to tailor a training plan for your art and designs a couple of martial art specific programs for karate, tae kwon do, hapkido, judo, jujitsu, aikido, muay thai, and mixed martial arts. Her own training program is also included.<br /><br />This is a great book for the novice and expert alike. Well laid out, easy to read, and straightforward to implement.

Ilaria Montagnani's Forza has done for kendo what Billy Blanks' Tai Bo did for karate. It is a fun, relatively easy to learn, aerobic workout routine with a big stick (or bokken if you own one). She begins with a little background and context then jumps right into footwork, warm-up exercises, and basic techniques. You will learn how to hold the weapon and perform high, low, horizontal, and diagonal cuts as well as thrusts. There are a few \\"advanced\\" techniques as well, though they are really only variations of the basic stuff.<br /><br />If you are an experience budoka who has studied kendo, iaido, or a related martial art this book is not for you. If you are a mundane individual who's got enough space to swing around a big stick and wants an interesting workout routine you ought to give this book a try. The book is a bit light on explanation but the step-by-step photos are clear and easy to follow. It might be better as a DVD but you can get sufficient information out of this format to perform the routines successfully. I recommend reading through it a couple times before getting started though.<br /><br />I strongly recommend doing the warm-up drills before getting started. Even a few minutes with a lightweight stick can lead to pulled muscles or other injuries if you haven't done this kind of thing before.<br /><br />If you really dig this stuff and want a serious workout, you should consider picking up a heavy ironwood bokken. It'll make you sweat fast. If you want something even heavier, you should probably consider an ironwood suburito (suburi bokken) which is thicker and heaver than a traditional bokken but has the same general shape. The balance, however, is not typically as good. Consequently they are only used for solo training and not for tandem exercises in a traditional dojo (which is exactly what you want here anyway). If you do the footwork/stances properly along with the arm movements you really can work your whole body, not just your arms/shoulders.<br /><br />The editorial write-up touts that the book tells you how to get a hold of a workout sword yet the text simply suggests building your own and also refers to contacting a local martial arts store or internet site. I'm underwhelmed by that! There is also no warning against doing this with live steel in the book so I'll give one here: Don't even think of doing this stuff with a real sword without expert supervision. That's a serious accident waiting to happen.<br /><br />In summary, this book is an interesting idea that is clearly communicated and very well illustrated. It's an aerobic workout not a martial art, but a lot more interesting than most fitness routines. If you've got a big enough practice area and a passing interest in swords you ought to give it a try.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instructione arm movements you really can work your whole body, not just your arms/shoulders.

It's one of the few things in Black Belt, or any other magazine for that matter, that I'm sure I'll find illuminating and am rarely disappointed. This book is a collection of 70 of Lowry's best columns from the last ten years all in one place.  His essays cover just about everything related to traditional martial arts or related Asian culture. Topics are both broad and deep, including the benefits and hazards of martial arts training, budo teaching traditions, lifelong learning in martial arts, profiles of ancient and modern budo masters, tenets of the martial ways, dojo ethics, history, and techniques/applications.

Learn realistic methods to identify and subdue suicide bombers before they can carry out their deadly missions, escape from and/or disarm gun or knife-wielding attackers, recognize and respond to homicidal drivers, and react properly to hostage situations. This is hard-hitting and much needed information in today's dangerous world, useful for martial artists, law enforcement officers, security professionals, and every day civilians alike. The Madrid train bombings on 03/11/04 and the London subway/bus bombings on 07/07/05 are graphic reminders that this information is relevant and sorely needed.

You can decipher the basic plot from other reviews: Rain's conscience stops him from killing his target, Manheim (Manny) Lavi, in front of the man's son despite the fact that this guy is well deserving of elimination. Lavi is an explosives expert who has helped groups like MNLF, Abu Sayef, Jemaah Islamiah, and other terrorist organizations learn how to blow up their innocent victims. As happens in the assassination business, from the botched hit things go progressively down hill...<br /><br />Ex-CIA operative Jim Hilger makes a compelling bad guy with his calm persona and calculating nature. In fact all the characters, even those who get killed off on the same page they are introduced seem solid, three-dimensional, and very real. Dox is back as is Delilah. The exotic locations in Thailand, the Philippines, and so on are well researched and accurately described.<br /><br />The writing is up to Eisler's usual high standards--gritty, realistic, and fast paced. Animal Listees will catch quite a few inside jokes, everything from \\"it depends\\" to \\"lawsey-lawsey\\" to \\"nothing good can come of this\\" to sheep. For those of you who have no idea what I'm referring to, suffice it to say that part of the reason Mr. Eisler writes such terrifically realistic stuff is that he hangs around a bunch of folks intimately familiar with real-life violence and mayhem--current and former law enforcement officers, military personnel, bikers, street fighters, martial artists, and assorted dangerous characters. An accomplished martial artist himself, his knowledge, skill, and experience shines through in his terrific writing.<br /><br />This book is absolutely terrific. Highly recommended--I can't wait for the next one!	2005-07-02

The book is arranged in five sections in a manner similar to Musashi's famous book of five rings. The first chapter covers foundational concepts while each of the other four chapters describe one of the four Taikyoku series kata in detail. It's a pretty short work, but fun to read and very instructive for beginners. There are some essential basics (dojo lore) like how to understand kanji, count in Japanese, and decipher how ranks and belts are used. There are also a few insightful gems such as how \\"blocks\\" are used offensively.

Fumon Tanaka sensei's mastery of kobudo, iaijutsu, and jujitsu is well articulated in this excellent work. The writing is much clearer than many Asian master's first works in English. The layout is extraordinarily well done with outstanding photos and illustrations that really augment the text. Content includes budo (martial arts) history, jujutsu, kenjutsu, and samurai tradition. The nito-ken (two-sword) techniques included herein are not widely taught and rarely described in other texts. Basic, intermediate, and advanced Honmon Enshin Ryu applications are well laid out, with many okuden (secret) mastry level techniques portrayed. The focus is primarily on sword to sword applications though there is also a small section on sword vs. yari (spear), naginata (halberd), bo (staff), and shuriken (throwing star) as well. There is also a bit of muto dori (no sword) techniques covered as well.<br /><br />The author really knows his stuff and communicates it effectively. Tanaka sensei has been studying martial arts since 1956, achieving an 8th dan black belt in kobudo, 7th dan in jujutsu and kyoshi iai suemonogiri kenpo, 5th dan in Bojutsu, and 4th dan in kendo among other accomplishments.

Did you know that according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, workplace homicide is the leading cause of death among female workers in the United States and the second leading cause of death among men? 18,000 people a week are victimized by some sort of violence in the workplace in this country alone! Understanding how to protect yourself and your employees is indispensable knowledge.<br /><br />I was privileged to receive an advanced copy of this important work to review before its official publication and found it well written, informative, and packed with essential information. Loren Christensen is one of my favorite authors. A retired police officer, Vietnam veteran, and 7th Dan black belt he really knows his stuff. For the record, I have a library of over 230 martial arts books. Many are in mint condition; stuff I've read only once, didn't finish, or never got around to. Christensen's are all dog-eared with sticky notes and scribbles in the margins, solid material I read over and over again. As always his advice is practical, useful, and easy to read.<br /><br />In 'Surviving Workplace Violence' Christensen does a great job of making readers aware of the threat and presents solid strategies for keeping us safe. It is pretty short, a mere 105 pages, yet extremely valuable nevertheless. Its pithiness positions it as an excellent reference manual that just about anyone can read and understand in a few short hours. Clearly you cannot become an expert in such a short time yet the materials herein could literally save your life.<br /><br />The vignettes in this book are startling and very informative. For example, it describes a situation where a 70-year-old salesman attacked and killed his former boss with a mason's hammer several months after she fired him for spitting on another employee. This clearly points out that just about anyone can be a potential hazard. Christensen describes warning signs (employee behaviors) that may indicate a higher likelihood of threat.<br /><br />The author covers essential survival strategies for the employer (e.g., company policies/committees), as well as for the employee. The latter include awareness, stages of alertness (i.e., white, yellow, orange, red, black), hiding places, escape routes, incident response, combat breathing, mental imagery, and fighting back. He offers specific techniques that can be used against common weapons (e.g., knife, handgun, rifle) as well as descriptions of how to use common implements (e.g., stapler, pen, coffee cup) to help you fight back should you be forced to do so.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instructionhreat.

I think it is even better than its predecessor, chocked full of useful tips you can implement right away to improve your performance in any martial art. There are exercises to develop functional fighting strength in every part of your body. Most of these can be done alone though some require a partner. Some require training aids (e.g., weights, Body Opponent Bag) while others can be do not. There are some neat icons throughout which call your attention to cautions (e.g., extra care items), workout tips (e.g., critical information), important information (e.g., reasons behind the drills), partner drills, and training tips (e.g., stuff you can focus on for maximum impact). These icons make it easy to reference important information after you read it the first time.<br /><br />Section one is all about building a powerful foundation to facilitate employing your art in tournament or combat. Subjects include developing powerful abs, innovative pushups, bench press exercises, leg development, core strength development for grappling arts, and grip strengthening. There are also some mental conditioning exercises as well-walking meditation, creation/use of mental triggers, and developing a powerful mindset-something rarely covered in this type of book. There is nothing really earth shattering here, just solid, practical advice.<br /><br />The best part of this first section is called \\"41 Ways to Prevent and Relieve Pain.\\" I consider it an absolute must read for all us aging martial artists, especially practitioners of the hard arts such as karate, tae kwon do, judo, or jujitsu. It includes icing tricks, stretching, and conditioning exercises to prevent and relieve injuries to knees, shoulders, back, and other commonly injured areas.<br /><br />Section two covers some excellent methods to practice fighting without a training partner, including ways to attack and defend from the \\"I don't want to fight\\" posture, stances, innovative solo grappling practice methods, combinations, accuracy, BOB bag techniques, and ways to cheat speed. The differences between practice and real fighting are covered along with more mental techniques and things you can do before a tournament to become more successful. This is the really advanced stuff you won't find anywhere else; well worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Section three contains some great ideas for 15-, 20-, and 35-minute workouts.

Col. Hunt argues that three major inhibiters--apathy, bureaucracy, and a lack of political will stand in our way. A quick synopsis:<br /><br />Apathy amongst the media, politicians, and the electorate is very dangerous because the bad guys are still out there and still trying their level best to do us in. Regardless, in the four years since 9/11 apathy has taken hold nearly everywhere. Fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan just don't seem real; terrorist actions in foreign countries (e.g., Bali nightclub bombing, Spanish train bombing) don't feel like a clear and present danger here.<br /><br />Bureaucracy and status quo mentality have combined with this lack of urgency to stall essential change. For example, the Director of National Intelligence has neither the budgetary control nor the hire/fire authority to really control the various agencies that report to him. Intelligence officials spend too much time in congressional committees and not enough finding and fighting our enemies. The White House staff numbers in the thousands today while back in the Kennedy Administration it was less than a hundred...<br /><br />Political will not only addresses the ability to make needed change but also the willingness to take action at all. For example, even though the pre-Iraq war WMD intelligence was totally inaccurate, no one was fired and essential organizational/cultural change has still not been made. The FBI's $100M computing sinkhole not only led to no working system but also no firings for those whose job it was to implement the project. And, we are, in Hunt's words, \\"still sleeping with the enemy.\\" We have friendly relations with the Russians while they sell weapons to terrorists and unfriendly countries. We support Saudi Arabia even though their terrorist crackdowns are mostly just for show and they continue to fund extremist religious schools and institutions.<br /><br />The first part of the book is designed to scare us into action. Not only does he point out the many problems, however, but he also offers a solution. This would include markedly expanding the military, untying the hands of our special forces, massively reducing the power of congressional committees, gutting the entrenched bureaucracy, and making select changes to the law, among other things. I somehow doubt any of these changes can take place unless, god forbid, there is another large scale terrorist attack on US soil, but I found the book illuminating nevertheless. You can certainly see Col. Hunt's military background and perspective shine through.<br /><br />The book is hard-hitting and very frank. Treated as an academic study it is comprehensive, well researched, interesting, and pretty well written. And, it forms the basis of a plan of action should our elected officials wish to step up the war on terror to the next level. If you want the inside scoop on the war on terror, you gotta read this book.<br /> <br />The first part of the book is designed to scare us into action.

If the film is anything as good as the book this will be the best episode ever. I'm totally impressed! Stover has undertaken the monumental challenge of portraying how and why Anakin Skywalker, the Hero with No Fear, ultimately surrenders to the Dark Side. I keep remembering Yoda's line from Episode, \\"I sense much fear in you.\\" It all makes sense in this outstanding book. Stover's writing truly captures the reader's imagination and draws us into the story. I literally couldn't put it down, staying up until 3:40 in the morning to finish.<br /><br />The scale and scope of Palpatine's manipulations is finally revealed. We get fantastic insight into the central characters like Anakin, Obi Wan, and Dooku, seeing their motivations, strengths, and failings. The book starts out light and fun then gets progressively darker and more disturbing as Anakin is drawn inexorably into Palpatine's web.<br /><br />Everyone knows what's ultimately going to happen, of course, but the journey sure is fun.

This prequel to the Revenge of the Sith provides some interesting background material but is not terribly entertaining. There's the basic Obi Wan and Anakin bonding thing, with just the right amount of tension to foreshadow their eventual come-apart, while they pursue Gunray who's oppressing the intelligent beetles of Cato Neimoidia. There's new peril for Senator Amidala, of course, along with some more insight into Dooku, Sidious / Palpatine, suspicions about the Jedi order, etc. There's also some unnecessary political commentary that really doesn't add much to the tale. The writing is pretty bland, the dialog uninspiring, and the plot tawdry at best. The only real saving grace is the introduction of General Grievous, the man/machine (actually alien Kaleesh/bio droid) merchant of death and mayhem. He's interesting and plays a big role in Revenge of the Sith, but not really enough to hold this book together. If I had to do this all over again I'd have saved my money and bought the paperback later... sigh. It's just barely good enough to recommend but not at full price.	2005-04-05

Love him or hate him, Dr. Savage is certainly an interesting and compelling writer. He's back once again touting his \\"borders, language and culture\\" mantra from the previous books. This is supposedly the final of this series. The new spin this time takes his assault on liberalism to its ultimate and logical conclusion, asserting that extreme liberalism is in fact a mental disease--one in which logic no longer prevails yet emotion runs rampant. The useful morons, as he calls them, flock like lemmings behind ideas that simply cannot work. He goes on to prove his points by citing hundreds of specific examples based upon remarkably well-founded research (the guy is an actual scientist after all). It's nice to see a little substance behind the political commentary.<br /><br />He doesn't just slam the left, as you might expect from the title, however. His vitriol takes a stab at the current administration's handling of homeland security in general and our country's borders in particular. Savage's fiery witticisms such as \\"more Pattons (i.e., the general) and less patent leather,\\" \\"one dirty bomb ruining your whole day,\\" and \\"oil for illegals\\" aren't really as funny as he thinks they are and frankly got pretty annoying after a while. Regardless, the underlying message is pretty well-written, consistent, and insightful.<br /><br />If you want to look at America through the eyes of a true conservative, this book is for you. If you lean left you will hate it. If you lean right you'll probably love it. The vast majority of us in the middle will think it is worth reading. It doesn't follow the Republican party line nor does it universally slam the Democrats. It's truly a liberal vs. conservative treatise and a pretty good one at that.<br /><br />All in all, I found this book not only entertaining, but illuminating as well. It really did make me think.	2005-04-05
US	51697838	R2IQS9QHBSH7S3	0954446607	826621992	Five Years, One Kata	Books	5	18	18	N	Y	Illuminating	This is an outstanding tome which provides important insight for any karateka, not just Shotokan practitioners. Since each kata contains a fully developed, practical self-defense system, the ancient karate masters did not generally learn the plethora of forms we attempt to master today. Instead, they focused on one or two core forms such as naihanchi or sanchin kata, then went on to devote 5 or 10 years to deeply understand every nuance of one single additional form. Over time they internalized the strategy, principles, and tactics of that kata, mastering every detail. Once they fully understood all aspects of that kata, they might then pick-up another new form to study.<br /><br />Over the last century, the practice of mastering a single kata has disappeared from our curricula. The deep understanding of a few kata has been replaced by the superficial practice of many. This book follows the author's five year experiment as he focused all his training on a single kata, Gojushiho. You will not only find unique insight into the Burger's experiment, but also develop improved understanding of your own forms and what you can learn from them. This is a great book, a worthy addition to your martial library.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-04-05

After all, as my judo instructor used to say, the concrete can (and often does) hit harder than the fist.  In addition to covering the most common types of throwing techniques, Abernethy discusses fundamental principles that apply to all successful throws, provides some good practice drills to help solidify your knowledge, and even explains what to do should a throw go wrong and you end up on the ground. This isn't just dojo stuff, but rather fundamental information you can use on the street for self defense.<br /><br />Contents include: The use of throws in the striking arts, theory and practice, sweeps, hip throws, cross-buttocks throw, shoulder throw, neck throw, double-leg-lift throw, outer-reaping throw, inner-reaping throw, winding throw, tackle, shoulder-wheel throw, what if it all goes wrong, and some examples of throws found in kata (forms).<br /><br />Clear writing and great pictures make this a valuable and useful tome for practitioners of karate, boxing, tae kwon do, and other striking arts.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br /><br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-04-03

Exceptional martial artists in every style demonstrate both quickness and power in all their applications, overwhelming opponents with seemingly little effort. Mr. Christensen's best selling book Speed Training covered the quickness aspect. This outstanding book covers power. As always it is well written, easy to follow, and easily incorporated into your martial training.<br /><br />Subjects covered include ki power, ancient (traditional) exercises, modern weight resistance training, plyometrics (elastic strength/explosiveness), isometrics (resistance training), dynamic tension, developing a powerful neck, pushups, abdominals, kicking power, punching power, bag work, timing, and defending against power. You will learn how to use proper body mechanics and hip rotation to markedly increase your power. Even Bruce Lee's famous 1-inch punch is explained with sufficient clarity that most martial artists will be able to perform it themselves.<br /><br />Christensen really knows his stuff. He began his martial arts training in 1965 and over the years has earned 10 black belts, 7 in karate, 2 in jujitsu, 1 in arnis. As the author of 29 books, he has received high praise for his easy-to-read, informative writing style from readers and book reviewers in the United States, France and Russia. He is a retired police officer with some 30 years experience in military and civilian law enforcement.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-04-01

He was born in Nightside, a disturbing, dark, and absolutely fascinating alternate London where it is always 3:00 in the morning, monsters walk among men, multiple realities co-exist, and nothing is what it seems. Concepts such as love, luck, and lust not only run rampant, but they actually come to life as living personifications. Denizens of the Nightside can escape the mundane world to buy, sell, or find just about anything.<br /><br />Taylor we've seen before in Green's previous novels. A few previous characters are back, but there are some exceptionally entertaining new cohorts who appear in this one: Madman, an eccentric genius who has witnessed the true nature of the world and was driven insane by it, Sinner, who made a deal with the devil yet was rejected by both Heaven and Hell, Pretty Poison his supernatural girlfriend, and Bad Penny, the sometimes mercenary/sometimes assassin. We learn some fascinating new information about Walker, Merlin, The Authorities, and John Taylor's past and possible future.<br /><br />Taylor is hired by Lady Luck to uncover the secret history of Nightside and figure out how and why it exists. In exchange he is offered knowledge of who and what his mysterious, long-vanished mother truly was. Unfortunately for our hero, major Powers are lining up on both sides of his quest--both to help it succeed, and to ensure that it fails. For finishing his mission could mean very bad things not just for Nightside, but for all of existence as well.<br /><br />All of Green's novels of the Nightside are well crafted, entertaining, absolutely fun to read, and, oddly enough, believable. The characters are so \\"real\\" and the settings so interesting that it is easy to suspend your disbelief and become carried along by the fast pace and excellent writing. I devoured this one in just two days. Very highly recommended!	2005-03-30

Folks either love 'em or hate 'em with not much in-between. On the pro-side, they are nearly impossible to disarm and can perform multiple cuts in a single pass as practitioners can flip them mid cut. On the con side, they require very close quarters and are nearly impossible to stab with. This book clearly advocates the benefits of this unique weapon, providing an excellent historical overview along with practical tips and tricks for using one effectively. I think it oversimplifies in some places (kinda like I just did) but not to a large enough extent to warn folks away from it.<br /><br />I do feel obliged to mention that these weapons are really, really expensive (at least for anything of quality anyway) and very challenging to master without competent instruction. If you want to use one, I suggest picking up a non-edged trainer first. They can also be used as control devices in their own right. While no martial art can be taught solely from a manual, this one covers all the basics in a fair amount of depth. It is easy to read and understand.<br /><br />The author, Steve Tarani, is a Filipino Escrima and Indonesian Silat practitioner as well as a world renowned edged weapons combat instructor. In that capacity he has passed his skills along to thousands of law enforcement professionals and civilian practitioners. He is certainly knows his stuff and communicates it pretty effectively in this book.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-03-30

Subjects include rationale for training with the jo (short staff, evolution of jojutsu in traditional martial arts, equipment and preparations for training, kihon (fundamentals such as stances, grips, postures, and etiquette), uchi kata (striking methods), renwaku waza (combination techniques), tandoku renshu (31-count formal solo practice), and renshu bunkai (tandoku renshu applications with an opponent).

These methods are frequently not practiced in many dojos simply because practitioners do not realize that they even exist within their system. On the street, however, karateka may face grapplers, boxers, and practitioners of a whole plethora of styles. The good news is that we have all the tools necessary to survive or triumph in any violent encounter, be it standing up or on the ground.<br /><br />In an art which has become overly focused on striking and kicking by many practitioners, this outstanding text will help you to practice the way it was meant to be--as an effective, holistic, and complete fighting system. It is well illustrated, easy to understand, practical, and very insightful. The author not only describes how grappling methods were recorded in karate kata and demonstrates a wide assortment of techniques, but he also describes the principles that make them effective in real-life fighting situations.<br /><br />Subjects covered include understanding the role of grappling in self-defense, kata and bunkai (applications), close range strikes, throws and takedowns, ground fighting, chokes and strangles, arm bars, leg and ankle locks, neck twists, finger locks, wrist locks, and combinations. Dirty fighting and grappling drills are also covered. As you can see this is an outstanding and holistic treatise on the subject.<br /><br />Iain Abernethy really knows his stuff. He holds a godan (5th degree black belt) in applied karate from the British Combat Association, one of the world's leading groups for close-quarter combat and practical martial arts. He is also a yodan (4th degree black belt) in Wado-Ryu karate (English Karate Governing Body), a member of the Combat Hall of Fame, and a former national level kata judge in the UK. He is the author of four books on applied karate: Bunkai-Jutsu: The Practical Application of Karate Kata, Throws for Strikers: The Forgotten Throws of Karate, Boxing, and Taekwondo, Karate's Grappling Methods, and Arm-Locks for All Styles.

The setting is a Romanesque empire called Alera where the people bond with furies (elementals) of air, earth, fire, water, or metal during their childhood or early adolescence to obtain magical powers and thus defend the land against their foes. Our main hero's name is Tavi. He is a 15-year-old shepherd boy, one of the only people in Alera who has not bonded with a fury. Obviously he turns out to be more than he first appears. Amara is a courageous and resourceful heroine; Fidelias a bold and daring villain. As I've come to expect of Mr. Butcher, the writing is excellent, witty, and very entertaining. His style in this one is quite different from the Dresden novels, however. For example, rather than remaining first-person throughout, the perspective bounces around between the three main players. The pacing is superb, a real page turner. While the Dresden Files are more my style, I very much enjoyed this book as well. Recommended read.	2005-03-29

Pentjak silat and kuntao are, at their core, functional fighting arts and Sifu Orlando is master of these brutal styles. He places rarely divulged applications in context, artfully explaining why and how they work. I wasn't too keen on his work 'Martial Arts in America' so I held off on buying this one for quite some time. Having finally gotten around to reading it I really wish I'd bought this one sooner.

Harrison has really matured as an author. Her heroine Rachel is back along with Jenks the pixie and Ivy the living vampire (vampires are a race in this alternate reality) and a few other characters from before like Trent.<br /><br />In the same vein as the first book, the setting is in the Hollows, a section of future Cincinnati where supernatural creatures have come to haunt. The story takes place about a month after the conclusion of the first book, as Rachel takes on a new case: finding Dan, a missing warlock. Since the authorities require a 72-hour waiting period she gets the chance to jump in first and, perhaps, earn some much-needed cash. Pretty soon the inevitable bodies start piling up, in this case ley line witches (those who gain their power via the ley lines they tap). To make matters worse, Rachel finds herself chasing a serial killer who feeds on practitioners of the most powerful form of black magic. And she failed the ley line witch class she took in college, a bit of a disadvantage...<br /><br />This book is fun, witty, and better than its predecessor. I enjoyed it a lot.	2005-03-12

Just when I was afraid that the Honorverse was in danger of running out of steam Weber launches this brilliant new off-shoot. The Shadow of Saganami is fresh, fun, and a great read, building on the universe we know and love with intriguing new characters and a great plot. While you don't really need to have read the prior books they do help you understand how things work in this new series.<br /><br />For those of you who don't remember from before, Commodore Edward Saganami went down fighting superior odds in a heroic battle that inspired generations of Manticoran navel officers, sparked a naval tradition of courage and honor, and led to his name being placed on the main Manty training center. The opening sequence of the book has a brief \\"cameo appearance\\" by Honor Harrington who replays that epic battle for a graduating class of midshipmen. It is stirring and memorably written.<br /><br />Okay, on to the rest of the plot... The central action surrounds a newly launched cruiser, Hexapuma (affectionately known as the nasty kitty), led by Captain Terekhov, a hero from the last war who may or may not have lost his nerve along with his last ship and much of it's crew. Hexapuma is assigned to bring a new group of planets (the Talbott cluster) into the Manticoran Empire after a referendum in which more than 80% of the population called for annexation to get away from nefarious Sollie influence. It's the disaffected fringe within the 20% that our heroes need to worry about...<br /><br />The plot is complex, twisting, and hard to predict. The pacing is great. There is a bit more political intrigue and a bit less action than some previous Harrington novels but it is extremely well done nevertheless. The perspective is primarily centered around the aforementioned midshipmen (and woman)'s first cruise, though various ship's leaders, politicians, business moguls, and terrorists from several worlds are involved as well, creating a wonderful melting pot of characters, skullduggery, and intrigue. The new characters are great and the action quite memorable. Even the bad guys are three-dimensional. Like real people they didn't just wake up one day and decide to be evil. Everyone has sincere motivation.<br /><br />Highly recommended. A great read!w characters are great and the action quite memorable. Even the bad guys are three-dimensional.

Don't just take my word for it. Rain Storm recently won the 2004 Gumshoe award for best thriller of the year. The Gumshoes are given by Mystery Ink each year to recognize the best achievements in the world of crime fiction. I can't wait for Killing Rain to come out.<br /><br />So here's a synopsis of the plot for this one: John Rain is lured out of retirement in Brazil where he has tried to get out of the assassination business for good when the CIA offers him $200k to take out an Arab arms merchant known as Belghazi. Rain takes the job, promising himself (again) that it will be his last, and begins to track Belghazi across Macao, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. Shortly thereafter he discovers that not only is another assassin stalking his target but someone else is after Rain too.<br /><br />Tatsu is back but in a minor role. There are a couple interesting new characters too: Rain is reunited with an assassin from his past named Dox, as well as a the gorgeous Delilah who is more than she appears to be. There's great plot twists, double-crosses, and all the riveting, highly realistic action sequences that Eisler has become famous for. Once again the pacing is great too! There is also more depth his lead character as we get to know Rain better and see how he has adapted to the scars of his recent past.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-03-10

Randori (free sparring), kata (forms), and goshin jutsu (self-defense techniques) are covered. There is also some interesting history about how jujutsu became judo, the principles and aims of Kodokan judo, and training basics (e.g., gi, etiquette, postures/stances, moving and turning, breakfall techniques, the principle of continuous attack, and professor Kano's history and chronology). Since many judo applications can render an opponent unconscious, vital kappo (resuscitation techniques) are also included<br /><br /> Some of the pictures are outstanding while others, mostly historical items relating to kata and a few of the throws, are very difficult to decipher. Regardless, no text no matter how well written and illustrated can substitute for professional hands-on instruction. If you have already seen these applications demonstrated on the dojo floor, the book is more than adequate as a reference source -- in fact I'd call it ideal.

While I don't normally read this genre, several of my friends kept telling what a wonderful series Barry Eisler had created so I finally broke down and bought one. Once I picked it up, I literally couldn't put it down, finishing the entire volume in one weekend. I bought the rest of the series the next day!<br /><br />Rain Fall is an exceptionally well-written, gritty, and realistic thriller. The setting is accurate, the martial techniques are legitimate, and the aftereffects of violence hauntingly real. The character is complex but not sappy. The action is intense but not overdone. Surveillance detection runs and other tricks of the trade are accurately described and interestingly written.<br /><br />John Rain is an intriguing character, half Japanese, half American, yet apart from both worlds. A professional assassin with some scruples (no women, no children, and no acts against non-principals), he comes across more like a samurai than a ninja. I love the realism in this book. This (anti) hero is no super spy, just an aging soldier doing what he does best, killing people in way that do not look like murder (e.g., manipulating a pace maker or modifying an AED to create a heart attack).<br /><br />Rain dispatches a government bureaucrat just before he can leak vital information to the press that could bring down the sitting LDP government leadership. Ironically he then falls for the dead man's beautiful jazz singer daughter. What follows is a thrilling three-way struggle to recover the missing information. Taught action, superb pacing, and ghosts from the past come together in this highly entertaining thriller. Heartily recommended!	2005-02-28

Like book one of the series Rain Fall, Hard Rain is an exceptionally well-written, gritty, and realistic thriller. The setting is accurate, the martial techniques are legitimate, the characters believable, and the aftereffects of violence hauntingly real. The action is even more intense than the first one, the plot more intricate. Eisler offers intriguing insight into how men of violence live apart from every day folks. His characters, dialog, and plot are fabulously fun and very exciting. His martial arts experience and time spent in Japan really bring this novel to life.<br /><br />All the major players from the first book are back: Tatsu (the crusading policeman), Yamaoto (the shadowy powerbroker), Harry (the computer hacker), and Midori (the beautiful jazz musician). To save himself and his friends Rain must delve deep into the underworld where exotic dancers seduce secrets from unwary business and government leaders and yakuza hit men face each other in mortal combat at underground fight clubs.

While it is primarily aimed at police officers, martial artists and those interested in practical self-defense can really benefit from these materials as well. The author's experience, sense of humor, and real-life adventures make it a quick, interesting read despite its 200 page length. His long experience training other officers really shines through.<br /><br />You will learn how to stay safe patrolling (or simply walking) the streets, protect your weapon, deal with multiple attackers, handle stronger, larger opponents, and otherwise deal with deadly threats. It is especially good for law enforcement personnel who do not have a martial arts background. It is a bit more strategic than tactical yet I feel that hits just the right blend. There is an introduction to the \\"right demeanor\\" (which is reminiscent of Verbal Judo by George Thompson), a large section on control techniques, principles and concepts, and important insight into the nature of fighting. The various scenarios in the training section are truly excellent. The chapter on how to create a witness is really outstanding, though I do wish it was a bit longer.<br /><br />Overall this is a great book!<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-02-22

Clearly no book, no matter how well written, is a substitute for competent hands-on training but this will make a great handbook for practitioners to refer back to. Krav Maga evolved from a soldier's art rather than from a civilian's as many traditional karate or kung fu methods. The techniques are straightforward and relatively easy to learn. Many are very practical.<br /><br />Now the bad: I'm really, really leery of some of what is taught herein. For example, on page 34 a kick to the chin is shown in defense of a straight knife thrust. Sorry folks, but that's an almost certain recipe for disaster. First off, unless you are a superior, lightning fast athlete there is no way you can kick that high without eating steel since the attacker's wrist only has to move a few inches to slice or stab your leg, foot, or ankle while you need to cover several feet to hit his/her chin. Even worse if your timing is off you could be hit in an even more vital area. In 30 years of martial arts I've met and trained hundreds upon hundreds of practitioners. I know perhaps one or two who could pull this off. Perhaps there is some hidden intent that I don't understand or something got lost in translation from Hebrew but I'm just not buying this one...<br /><br />Overall: Don't get me wrong, there really is a lot of good stuff in here. However, there are techniques you know, techniques you do, techniques you train, and techniques you'd stake your life on. Choose wisely!<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-02-22

The information in this book is very comprehensive in breadth, hitting most aspects of these situations, but not particularly detailed in describing the attributes thereof. There is good coverage of the roles and responsibilities of first responders and police specialists who may become involved.<br /><br />Law enforcement professionals often seek to categorize a hostage taker's motivations to help determine a course of action in dealing with them. In essence there are three types of hostage takers: psychological, criminal, and political. The general characteristics and propensity for violence of each type are well covered herein. There is also a very good set of guidelines that can stave off the \\"action imperative\\" and logically help officers decide when and how it is appropriate to act.<br /><br />Topics include guidelines for first responders, intelligence gathering, hostage do's and don'ts, negotiation principles, crisis intervention, problematic phrases, useful words, the impact of time, the Stockholm bond, risk factors, legal issues, and action criteria. There is a good overview of the affect of drugs and alcohol as well. The CD is a MS PowerPoint version of the essential points that you can use to teach the materials to others.<br /><br />I would have loved to have seen more depth but this is a very good resource.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-02-22

I primarily study Goju Ryu, an Okinawan form of karate that, while somewhat influenced by Chinese kung fu historically, is much closer to Japanese martial arts then it is to any of the Chinese styles. Regardless, while the terminology is a little different, the principles and techniques herein are directly applicable to my art as well kung fu, aikido, jujitsu, and many others.<br /><br />Chin Na is the art of controlling an opponent, a practical and important skill. It is relevant to striking arts as well as grappling arts. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming covers joint locking, vein/artery sealing, muscle dividing, and bone displacing in a comprehensive and easy to understand manner. His vast experience really shines throughout this outstanding work. He also offers an excellent series of exercises for strengthening the joints to protect them from damage as you integrate these techniques into your training regimen.<br /><br />Applications include finger, wrist, elbow, shoulder, neck, waist, and leg manipulations, along with muscle grabbing and cavity press (pressure point) techniques. He also discusses how to use Chin Na in a real fight, including defense against knives, kicks, and punches. One of the most unique and important aspects of this book is the section on injury treatment which covers joint, ligament, cartilage, muscle, and tendon injuries, artery, capillary, as well as organ ruptures, sealed breath veins/artery in the neck, and even \\"stagnant\\" chi (ki). This section isn't particularly long but it is very insightful. There is also an appendix on Chinese herbs.<br /><br />Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming is a prolific author as well as one of the world's foremost kung fu experts. Highly skilled in Shaolin White Crane (Bai He), Shaolin Long Fist (Changquan), and Taijiquan and other forms, he has spent more than thirty years teaching his art to others. He has published 35 books and 75 videos on the martial arts.

Craig's basic premise is that the way of kendo is something different to each and every student who picks up a Japanese sword. While traditional Kenjitsu had no rules per se, modern (sport) kendo does. He has fascinating insight into the differences and similarities between the two, asserting that to learn kendo properly practitioners must not think of it (or practice it) as a sport. If you don't already know, kendo uses bamboo shinai and padded armor for practice while kenjitsu uses live steel. To get the most out of these arts, Craig believes that you must think of them as a way of life, a perspective promulgated by most of the leading sword arts practitioners such as Dave Lowry as well.<br /><br />Craig's writings will advance your sword skills imparting knowledge of equipment, exercises, applications, and kata (including the last three kata of the All Japan Kendo Federation, which use the wakizashi short sword). More specifically, topics include kendo clothing, equipment and care thereof, fundamental movements, advanced waza, and kodachi katas. There is also great information about samurai sword collecting, care, maintenance, and terminology. The illustrations enhance the text and facilitate the reader's ability to understand and internalize Craig's excellent points. I think that the target audience is experience practitioners so it might be a bit beyond some beginners though. Regardless, this is a great book, a worthy addition to any martial arts library.<br /><br />Darrell Craig really knows his stuff. He holds a exceptionally impressive list of black belt ranks in several different martial arts, including kendo (renshi), karate (kyoshi), jujitsu (kyoshi); iaido (godan), kobudo (godan), judo (yodan), and aikido (yodan). He has worked as a martial arts choreographer on a number of feature films and is the author of several other martial arts books as well.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts InstructionWay of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-01-28

This one's got more plot twists than a box of pretzels. Gotta be careful what I say to avoid spoiling anything: Joanne is back, human again and trying to wrest Jonathan, the most powerful djinn in the universe away from Kevin before he destroys the world with his stolen power. Marion Lewis, Rahel, and David are all back in major supporting roles. We are also introduced to the mysterious Ma'at, a sort of anti-warden group who are hoping (with Joanne's help) to blow Kevin's head off. This series continues to be fresh, witty, and most importantly believable. The \\"rules\\" to Caine's alternate reality support the books flow rather than getting in the way like so many other stories in this genre. This particular story is centered in and around Las Vegas. There are some superlative flash backs to events that impacted Joanne's life in that area years before that turn out to be germane in causing and ultimately solving her problems today. It's fast paced and fun, extraordinarily hard to put down once you get started reading it (I finished all 337 pages of this one in just two days). And, of course, there's hot chicks with fast cars too...	2005-01-23

This is an extremely entertaining tome, if not the best, certainly one of the top two or three Clone Wars novels. The prose is excellent, the plot complex, and the characterizations fascinating. The depiction of Yoda is flawless. Stewart brings back the mystery and humor of the famous Jedi Master portraying him as a wise teacher rather than an all-powerful, omnipotent Uber-Jedi. The minor characters who flesh out the story such as Scout (who is actually pretty major in this novel) and Master Iron Hand, Hanna, and Whie are written as true individuals rather than faceless non-entities needed to fill space. The two droids Solis and Fidelis are very cool. We also get insight into how certain Jedi's can live on as self-aware waves in the Force after their death.<br /><br />A snippet from a conversation about Dooku between Yoda and the ghost of Qui-Gon Jinn illustrates some of the exquisite dialog contained in this volume. Yoda is speaking first:<br /><br />~~~~~~~~<br />\\"Cunning it is. If I move to see him, I must keep any Republic ships away from the Hydian Way. Deny the chance of peace utterly, must I, or else give him extra months unharried in his lair.\\"<br /><br />\\"He is a fencer,\\" Qui-gon agreed. \\"Leverage, position, advantage--they are as natural to him as breathing.\\"<br /><br />\\"My old student--your old Master, Qui Gon. The truth he is telling?\\"<br /><br />\\"He thinks he is lying.\\"<br /><br />Yoda's ears pricked up. \\"Hmm?\\"<br /><br />He thinks he is lying.<br /><br />A slow smile began to light Yoda's round face. \\"Yessssss!\\" he murmured.<br /><br />A moment later Yoda felt a vibration in the Force, a ripple rolling out from the student dormitories far below, like the faint sound of distant thunder. Qui-Gon shivered and was gone, as if the Force were a pool of water and he a reflection on its surface, broken up by the splash of whatever disturbance had just struck the Temple.<br />~~~~~~~~<br /><br />This outstanding tome brings back the true spirit of Star Wars. There is humor, adventure, moral clarity, and great fun. I recommend it without reservation!on!	2005-01-15

Rule number one for survival is 'don't get hit'. The best way to do that is not being there. Before things get ugly, leave. On occasion, however, you can't just strap on those Nikes, make like brave Sir Robin, and beat a hasty retreat. The bad guys have a habit of getting in the way.<br /><br />MacYoung shows you how to survive when you're outnumbered or outgunned. Real life isn't like a kung fu movie. Rather than wading in with fists and feet flying, you need to learn to apply hit-and-run tactics, use the environment to your advantage, and use your attacker's weaknesses against them.<br /><br />This book is chock full of street survival lessons from a guy who knows. Marc MacYoung is a bad man (and I mean that in the best sort of way). He's been there, done that, broken a lot of people, and picked-up a lot of scars along the way. His writing style is engaging, entertaining, and sarcastically witty.

If you like his stuff (e.g., Dresden Files) this one will be right up your alley. This is another alternate America where magic actually works genre where wardens (e.g., weather, fire, etc.) keep Mother Nature from wiping humanity off the face of the earth. The concept is reasonably creative but the real strength lies in the interesting, original characters and the authors refreshing wit. The writing style is truly engaging and fun. In this one, our hero Joanne Baldwin is on the run from the wardens who believe that she murdered her boss, hoping to find the one person who can protect her from false accusations and, more importantly, save her from the Demon Mark that is slowly destroying her. There are hot women, fast cars, and all kinds of fun twists and turns in the plot. It's great fun. Heartily recommended!	2005-01-12

This is a fantastic book, much more than just a biography of the world's best (and most famous) cyclist. Lance Armstrong provides a heartfelt look at his amazing life, including his cycling feats (of course), growing up without a father, his illness, treatment, and recovery from cancer, his struggles to have a child (wife's vitro fertilization), and more. He outlines his triumphs and challenges, setbacks and victories in a compelling and interesting manner. I'm a martial artist not a cyclist and frankly have very little interest in the sport. Regardless, I could not help but be inspired by this fascinating book.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of 'The Way of Kata' and 'Martial Arts Instruction'	2005-01-12

That kinda bites until she realizes that she's been \\"reborn\\" as a djinn by her boyfriend David. The unforeseen repercussions of that act of love form the basis for this book. Unlike all the alternate reality novels filled with vampires and werethingies, we get creative insight into efrit and djinn, something that hasn't been overdone. Once again the characters are fresh, the plot is twisted (in a good way), and the book genuinely engaging. This novel is a romance, tragedy, and thriller commingled into one great piece of storytelling. Very worth reading!	2005-01-12

This book is a cogent and pithy overview of martial arts, what they, what they are not, how to get involved with them, and how to succeed if you choose to do so. It covers the basics of a good cross-section of styles including karate, kung fu, tae kwon do, judo, akido, escrima, hapkido, hapkido, muay thai, jeet kune do, and tai chi, all the major players. The author briefly discusses the martial culture, uniforms, and ranking systems so that you know what to expect. Further, she helps you understand how to pick a style and instructor, make the most of your training, know when/where you should use your martial knowledge, and how to avoid injuries during the process.

As a practitioner, I have known for years that sheer size and brute strength meant very little to accomplished martial artists, yet I never truly understood why. Having finished this excellent book, now I know.<br /><br />Sprague's tome helps us reach our full potential in the fighting arts, martial sports, and even in every day conditioning by successfully explaining in straightforward terms how the laws of physics can be applied to generating maximum power from martial technique. She describes how things like balance, momentum, rotational speed, friction, direction, impulse, and conservation of energy can work for or against us in executing striking, kicking, throwing, grappling, and joint manipulating techniques. That pretty much covers all the bases, huh? There are tons of great illustrations, summaries, and even quizzes to supplement the materials.

My wife is Filipino so I've had a long time fascination with the martial culture of that archipelago, but had difficulty finding English-language texts to study prior to discovering this outstanding work. This book covers all aspects of those arts. It is well written and very informative, covering the martial history of the Philippines, the ethos and worldview of the Filipino warrior, structure, rites, and symbols of the indigenous martial arts, typology of weapons, and more. Eighteen masters of the Filipino arts are interviewed, covering arnis, escrima, kali, and a variety of lesser-known arts (e.g., hagibis, sikaran, sagasa, and kuntaw lima-lima). There are some great pictures as well. In 1521 Filipino natives killed the famous explorer Magellan.

One of the world's most knowledgeable practitioners of Japanese martial arts, Lowry cuts through the hype and hyperbole to highlight martial concepts as they were meant to be. Among other things he discusses kata, aestheticism, and perseverance, draws comparisons between the martial ways and the way of flower arranging, and explores why Zen actually has very little to do with Japanese martial arts. One small caution though: it seems aimed at the experienced practitioner so if you haven't read one of Lowry's books before and/or are not currently a seasoned martial artist you might not want to start with this one. Regardless, I enjoyed it very much. It's been a couple of years since he put out a new book and I think that upon reading it you'll agree that this one is worth the wait.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-01-04

The characters, particularly Oberon are much better and the dialog is also improved from prior offerings in this series. That said, the book feels hollow and unfulfilling. To start off, it's double-spaced so the 300 some odd pages is really half that. It is also mostly dialog with little description and a pretty shallow plot. Perhaps that's somewhat due to use of 1st person perspective but it's disappointing nevertheless.<br /><br />We learn more about Oberon, Dworkin, Aber, Connor and the rest of the family yet never truly appreciate how powerful the Pattern is or why it is tied to Oberon (e.g., why it cloned him). While the Chaosians (is that a word?) are pretty god-like compared to normal mortals their powers seem illogical and oddly formed. For example, they can shift from world-to-world through Shadow finding anything their imagination requires (say a 100,000 warrior priests who worship Oberon as a god when he is in need of an army), materialize tons of gold necessary to finance castle Amber out of ethos using the power of the Logrus, catch arrows in mid flight, or unleash raw chaos to obliterate enemies yet are unable to defend against a common sword or a magic (poisoned) ring. The bottom line is that this work is much improved over the last but is still unfulfilling.	2005-01-04

Janich has trained with Special Forces vets, police, and street fighters. He really knows his stuff, cutting through the machismo bovine excrement many authors blather to provide a down to earth, effective approach.<br /><br />For example, his first piece of advice is to avoid knife fights altogether. As the survivor of a couple such encounters I wholeheartedly agree. Further, he reminds practitioners not to forget other weapons (e.g., hands, feet) and focus solely on the knife. He talks about moral/legal considerations as well as the appropriate defensive mindset. This excellent tome covers all the basics: stance, grip, footwork/mobility, zones of attack/defense, cuts/thrusts, defensive responses, defensive strategies, targets, counter-defenses, and more.<br /><br />Unfortunately Janich, like many self-defense experts, casually throws out the phrase, \\"it's better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6.\\" It's only one sentence in an otherwise outstanding tome but I feel obliged to point out that I'm not personally an advocate of that sentiment. I feel that it can trivialize the seriousness of violent confrontations. Never forget that if you are found guilty in a jury trial you will be spending a whole lot of quality time in a confined environment with unpredictable, dangerous neighbors who may be less than friendly as you interact with them. You will also suffer other personal and professional challenges upon release. Janich's point, which I sincerely agree with, is that under no circumstances must you let fear of legal consequences keep you from surviving a violent encounter.<br /><br />Overall, this really is a great book. I heartily recommend it.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-01-03

It's an impressive primer on the field covering everything from laying out your shop to tools/equipment, steels/alloys, grip materials, leatherwork, construction, heat-treating, grinding, sharpening, and tempering. It even covers Japanese heat-treating and polishing techniques and how to forge several patterns of Damascus steel. There are great charts/illustrations too. The author not only knows his craft but he is able to communicate this knowledge clearly and effectively to his readers. His writing is pleasant and easy to follow.<br /><br />For perspective, I should point out that I know just enough about this field to be dangerous. I apprenticed to master bladesmith Bob Powell for about a year quite some time ago, not to take up sword making as a profession but rather to have access to the tools and education to forge my own blade. Jim Hrisoulas, on the other hand, is a true expert! With more than 17 years working at the forge, he specializes in medieval style blades and Damascus pattern welding techniques.

This book was required reading for a defensive handgun course I took nearly 20 years ago and still remains relevant today. My copy is all dog-eared and marked-up, as I have referred to it many, many times over the years. Among other things, it answers the all important question, \\"when can I pull the trigger and stay out of jail.\\" This tome is well written; sound advice by Massad Ayoob, one of the world's leading authorities on weaponry. It covers several important subjects such as common sense about carrying guns, guns in your store, guns in your car, guns in your home, guns on the street, how to choose a defensive firearm, basic gun fighting techniques, what caliber bullet is appropriate for self-defense, and gun safety. The aftermath of violence section is also outstanding.<br /><br />There are two minor drawbacks to this otherwise outstanding tome. The first, which could be easily corrected with a visit to your local gun shop for more information (or an update to the book), is that technology has changed a bit since it's original release. For example, the Glock handgun, the 40 S&W caliber bullet, and pre-fragmented self-defense ammunition all did not exist at that time. The second is that the section on women and guns is somewhat sexist and not particularly accurate. For example, it suggests that \\"...if you do work up to the .38, lean way forward into the recoil.\\" My 110-pound wife shoots a .357 just fine, thank you very much.<br /><br />Overall this is an outstanding work that all gun owners should read.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2005-01-03

Her grandfather was one of Jigoro Kano sensei's early instructors (for those who don't know, he's the guy who invented judo and started the Kodokan). While ju no kata is sometimes perceived as a woman's exercise (since they learn it during kyu [colored belt] ranks while men generally do not until dan [black belt]), both men and women can benefit from this excellent tome. You cannot learn any martial art from a book, of course, but I believe that this is essential material to refine and internalize techniques that you encounter on the dojo floor. The forms are aptly described, well illustrated, and easy to follow. Fukuda sensei also includes a fascinating write-up of her thoughts on the evolution and direction of the sport of judo along with some great pictures of her training throughout the years.<br /><br />In many ways ju no kata is to judo what sanchin kata is to karate, an essential foundational exercise that expresses the principles and techniques of the art form. Unlike most components of judo, this kata can be practiced without a dogi (uniform) or tatami (padded mat) surface, since there is no throwing involved (or perhaps more accurately no falling). It is performed slowly with emphasis on the essential principles that make full-speed, full-power judo work effectively, and contains both offensive and defensive techniques. More specifically, the ju no kata technique refines a practitioner's sense of ju (gentleness/using an opponent's force against them), timing, body mechanics (e.g., proper hip rotation), tai sabaki waza (body movement/blending techniques), and mental focus. It also increases one's flexibility and conditioning if performed diligently.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-12-17

This comprehensive work covers all the shooting fundamentals such as considerations for choosing a weapon, figuring out what type of ammunition to purchase, and understanding shooting essentials (e.g., grip, stance, sight picture, safety). These pages are pithy with just enough depth for readers to understand the important ideas. The best part of the book, however, is the detailed training program which can markedly improve your speed and accuracy with a hand gun. I shot competitively for years, going through as much as 10,000 rounds per annum in practice. Believe you me, that ain't cheap. With Suarez's dry practice advice, you do not have to spend anywhere near as much I did to improve your technique. There is also a great section on extreme low light shooting, much better than I've seen in other books.

It really is a \\"bible\\" for the majority of shooting sports enthusiasts. Combined with a stop by the rental counter of your local range for hands-on experience, this tome is exactly what you need to purchase a new firearm or ascertain the value of one you might be interested in trading in or selling. It helps you keep tabs on interesting new products before you can find them in your local gun shop. The price information is not always accurate yet it is a good reference point (always best to shop around anyway).

Through Rosenbaum's words, we learn the power of kata (patterns of movements containing a series of logical and practical offensive and defensive techniques) to transmit proven methodologies from one generation to the next. This brilliantly researched tome provides important insight into the history and development of martial arts - both military and civilian. It is more of a textbook than a light afternoon read, yet it provides fantastic insight into the views and ethics of societies that created the fighting forms that many of us practice today. I learned a lot from it.<br /><br />There is one flaw in this work which, though not significant, is pretty annoying: there are 43 illustrations, more than half of which are truly awful. It would have been better off without most of them. Now that I got that off my chest, the main theme of the book is that through understanding the evolution of an art form and how martial knowledge is transmitted via kata, practitioners build a greater appreciation of their art and what it truly means to practice it. The author leads us through a journey back in time, where we see consistent evidence of martial systems being influenced by those that came before and/or invaded. Rosenbaum demonstrates that katas in one form or another were used by ancient Greek, Egyptian, Asian, African, and European societies, and that poetry, dance, and song were also significant methods of preserving and transmitting battle-tested fighting strategies and tactics across the ages.<br /><br />Michael Rosenbaum really knows his stuff. He began his martial arts training at the age of five. Along with Isshin Ryu karate, which he has been practicing for 25 years, he has studied Bando, Judo, and Boxing. Rosenbaum is former member of the elite 82nd Airborne Division of the U.S. Army, and has completed Infantry, Airborne, and Jungle Warfare Schools. I found his work extremely well researched and informative.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction<br /><br />...by the way, if you do want a \\"how to\\" book to add to this one, check out 'Bunkai-Jutsu' by Iain Abernethy.

This book is a fascinating set of interviews between Ichiro Suzuki, one of the world's best baseball players, and reporter Narumi Komatsu. I'm a Seattle native and Mariner's fan who has always been fascinated with all things Japanese. Naturally I'd be drawn to this book yet you don't have to be like me to thoroughly enjoy it. You don't even have to be a Mariner's fan, or a baseball fan to appreciate this excellent work. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Ichiro is not only one of the game's great players but he's a classy, hard-working guy as well. It's nice to know that the guy who broke the major league single season hit record is a truly worthwhile human being rather than just another steroid freak. To illustrate his character, it states herein that he was surprised by how shabbily the American players treat their equipment. Rather than letting the staff clean his shoes and take care of his gloves, Ichiro prefers to do such tasks himself, demonstrating a greater respect for the game. I liked this book much better than David Shield's collection of media quotes and cryptic comments published in 'Baseball is Just Baseball'. In this tome, you really get to know Ichiro not only as a great player, but as a great person as well.<br /><br />You can learn a whole lot about Ichiro, his family, and his transition form Japanese baseball to the American system. You find out how he learned to bat so well and the game where his technique finally clicked into place (on 04/11/99). And, you can learn some practical real life wisdom from his struggle for perfection. An example quote: \\"Win the MVP and everybody says you're great,\\" Ichiro says. \\"Everywhere you go people make a fuss over you... But once you get used to that and get carried away by it, you lose a sense of who you really are.\\" Sage advice I think.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of 'The Way of Kata' and 'Martial Arts Instruction'	2004-12-12

Karen Vactor is a well-rounded martial artist with a business degree who has built three successful karate schools. Susan Peterson, Ph.D. is a professional writer as well as an accomplished martial artist as well. The two have teamed up to create a comprehensive work which, while overly pithy in some areas, is really quite good. Be warned, however, that this book is all about creating and running a commercially successful school. Not all martial artists will agree with the authors' philosophical approach but none can argue with the quality of the materials they provide.<br /><br />Chapter one covers marketing your identity, whatever it is that makes your school unique and interesting to potential students, including how to choose a name that reflects your image. Chapter two covers the business groundwork, something that very few martial artists really understand how to do properly. It covers advisors (e.g., attorney, accountant) that you might need and how to develop a business plan. Rule number one in retail is location. So is rule 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6... you get the idea. The next chapter not only covers how to find a good location, but also how to figure out what it will cost you, how to negotiate a lease, and how to layout your dojo floor space. Chapter five covers essential legal administrivia like insurance and regulatory compliance.<br /><br />Chapter six covers student contracts, fee schedules, and hiring employees. Not sure I entirely agree with the author's philosophy here, but the advice is sound nevertheless. Chapter seven covers advertising tools such as brochures, business cards, flyers, and your entrance signage. Chapter eight comprehensively covers basic marketing such as mass mailings, yellow pages ads, etc. Chapter nine goes into more detail on the same subject. Once marketing brings perspective students to your door, chapter ten deals with how to \\"close the deal\\" and sign them up. Chapter eleven covers attendance, student tracking, and payment tracking. Chapter eleven covers the how to keep track of your cash flow and create basic financial statements. Chapter thirteen is a good overview of strategies that keep students motivated and interested in coming back. Chapter fourteen covers how to place and sell products associated with your training (e.g., uniforms). It covers the basics of pricing, costs, profits, inventory tracking, and display. The final chapter is a \\"troubleshooting guide\\" that can help you solve problems such as high drop out rates, attendance problems, \\"closing\\" problems, etc. The glossary of business terms is a great overview for folks who don't really understand all that stuff.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instructionten deals with how to \\"close the deal\\" and sign them up.

While you cannot learn any martial art purely from a book, the graphics are clear and the step-by-step explanations are excellent. It is an excellent supplement for judo training. Practitioners of other martial arts can still benefit from understanding the principles of unbalancing and throwing an opponent. While I have studied judo in the past, I'm almost entirely focused on karate today.

Norris worked his way beyond a pretty rotten childhood to become an international action star and a fine human being. That's a pretty rare combination these days. He had a tough time getting there though. Through the twists and turns of his life Norris eventually found spiritual enlightenment in Christianity and became a better person through his belief in god. In this book he successfully discusses how faith played an essential role in his success without proselytizing or becoming overly preachy in my opinion. He openly discusses both his strengths (which are fairly obvious) and his shortcomings (such as cheating on his first wife who he later divorced and having a child out of wedlock).<br /><br />Norris has lived a true rags-to-riches story. His early days were defined by poverty and an alcoholic father who abandonment him, contributing to his own shyness and lack of ability. He turned his life around by joining the army. Stationed in Korea, he learned tang soo do which he brought back to America along with a desire to teach. In an effort to recruit students and advertise his skills, Norris turned to tournament competition where he became a world champion six times. Upon retiring from active competition, his friend Bruce Lee talked him into pursuing what turned out to be a highly successful movie (and later television) career.<br /><br />Some of the material included herein is also found in Secrets of My Inner Strength. Joe Hyams (author of the famous book, Zen and the Martial Arts) who co-wrote that work has a little better writing style than Ken Abraham (a religious writer) who co-wrote this one but it is an entertaining and worthwhile tome nevertheless. There is virtually nothing about his film career in this book, probably because it was fairly extensively covered in the other volume.<br /><br />Interesting read.

Halfway through reading Butcher's first Dresden novel, Storm Front, I bought the whole series. I couldn't put them down, reading the whole lot over just a couple of weeks. As with all his books, Blood Rites is fast paced, entertaining, and great fun. As Chicago's only professional wizard Harry takes on the cases that no one else can handle (nor would most want to). His juvenile wise cracks, self-depreciating humor, and overdeveloped sense of responsibility make a likeable hero out of a guy who'd be extraordinarily powerful if he could just get out of his own way.<br /><br />This time the White vampire (incubus) Thomas asks our hero to put a stop to an entropy spell that is plaguing Arturo Genosa, his porn director friend before any more of his associates die from the curse. The plot has some interesting twists (e.g., revealing more about Harry's family history and blood relations) and the characterizations and dialog are up to Butcher's fabulous standards. Even the bit characters like the mercenary Kincaid are well developed and great fun. I suspect that the dog foreshadows interesting possibilities for the next book too. The relationship between Dresden and Murphy matures realistically and well in keeping with their personas.<br /><br />Blood Rites is another outstanding tome in an incredible series. There are a whole lot of entries in the whole supernatural alternate reality genre thing, yet as other writers tend to become stale over time Butcher continues to crank out fresh, fascinating novels. Wholeheartedly recommended!	2004-12-01

The authors wax verbose at odd times and prattle off too many bad puns (e.g., \\"dressed to kill\\" re: uniforms) yet the information really is pretty good. It covers everything from finding a school to properly wearing the uniform to basic techniques (e.g., stances, punches, kicks). Succinctly covers topics such as ranking, terminology, weapon forms, self-defense, tournaments, and sparring as well. The illustrations are excellent yet the explanations are often too brief for those who would like to understand not only what, buy why. For example, the index on safety tips contains enough gems that it probably have been expanded into a whole chapter. The \\"Sensei Says\\" summaries and \\"Ouch\\" safety tips are colorful, well done, and facilitate absorption of essential knowledge. Overall I'd recommend this book for beginners and those considering karate training. If you've been doing this for a while it's probably too elementary.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-12-01

It has pretty good illustrations but not a lot of depth. But hey, what do you realistically expect when the author tries to cover every major art in one 250 page volume? I find it a solid reference for those interested in martial arts but uncertain about what style might be the right one to pursue.<br /><br />In reviewing this tome you'll probably notice that there are only a limited number of vital areas on the body that can be manipulated, struck, or otherwise damaged by a martial practitioner. Similarly, there are only a limited number of ways that each joint in the body can move. Although every martial art has features that differentiate it from other styles, they all share certain common components (e.g., punching, kicking, grappling, and throwing). The fundamentals of fitness are universal too. Emphasis and strategies of each art form differ, of course, but techniques almost always overlap (though weapons forms are pretty divergent from empty-hand arts).<br /><br />Because of these similarities, I have discovered that most practitioners find that the teacher is more important to effective learning than the style being taught. New students should choose the art they wish to pursue in large part by choosing the person who will be teaching it. No one should feel forced to learn from an instructor who does not fulfill his or her needs just because they are the only local source of whatever style you have set your heart on. That's not to say that the information contained herein is not useful. It's just a friendly caution not to get too wrapped up in the style while forgetting about who you'll be learning it from.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-12-01

Invaluable for newer Goju Ryu practitioners, this outstanding book covers the basic stances, punches, kicks and blocks required learn hookiyu kata and gekisai kata (including how to formally begin and end the forms). While you cannot learn any martial art solely from a book, the kata, bunkai oyo, and basic kumite are clearly illustrated and adequately described for beginners. For more advanced students the sanchin kata write-up is excellent, integrating movement, breathing and technique in a way that illuminates some of the more difficult aspects of that essential form. There is also an interesting yet brief history of Goju Ryu, including biographical information about Kanryo Higashionna (the founder of Naha Te) and Chojun Miyagi (the founder of Goju Ryu karate). Seikichi Toguchi, a direct student of Miyagi's, was an inspirational leader of the Goju community whose teaching will be sorely missed. Both his books are essential reading for Goju Ryu practitioners.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-12-01

This book was, in large part, self therapeutic, written to pass along his philosophy and techniques while he recovered from a serious back injury. It truly captures the spirit of his art form, Jeet Kune Do. The text begins philosophically, covering Zen and the facets of Jeet Kune Do, then moves into basics such as warm-ups and basic postures, followed by more depth on the kicking, striking, and grappling aspects of the art.<br /><br />Whether you are a practitioner of Jeet Kun Do or not, there are large sections on attacks, feints, parries, distance, footwork, and evasiveness, all topics that transcend any individual art form. The concepts of power, endurance, balance, speed, timing, and attitude are universal as well. It is an interesting blend of philosophy and practicality that can benefit most any martial practitioner. Though it was originally published more than 30 years ago, it remains as relevant and useful today as it was at its inception.

It covers all the basics including a brief history of karate, why students might be interested in studying this martial art, an explanation of the karate uniform, description of the dojo (practice hall), discussion of etiquette, overview of warm up routines, explanation of basic techniques, and description of advancement testing practices. If your child is thinking about taking karate this book can help set his/her expectations and increase his/her chance of success. There is a small caveat about the appropriate use of karate in the front but I wish he'd spent a little more time on that particular aspect. New practitioners, especially younger ones, have a tendency to get into trouble for inappropriately trying out their skills on classmates at school. The sensei (teacher) should cover this but it is always good to know ahead of time.

Even though this book kept showing up in my Amazon recommendations I kept ignoring it due to the romance novelesque cover art. Boy am I glad I finally picked it up! It is very entertaining and a great read. Although it is not completely stand-alone, you don't actually have to have read the earlier books in this series to understand what's going on. Unlike many middle volumes, the synopsis of past activities is pithy and well integrated into the ongoing text so that it does not negatively effect the pacing. I liked it so much that I read all 450 pages in three days over a weekend.<br /><br />Here's the scoop: Even though this is another alternate America where supernatural beings wander around with the rest of us novel, Armstrong's semi-original plot, creative storytelling, and outstanding characterization make this book very special indeed. Paige is an interesting, savvy heroine whose open-minded approach to witchcraft puts her at odds with her coven and the local community yet ultimately becomes her saving grace when the bad guys attempt to kidnap her ward Savannah.

The main plot revolves around Paige and Lucas's hunt for whoever is killing off the cabal's supernatural children, yet the real strength of this book is the outstanding interplay between the characters. Armstrong's characterization is simply outstanding! The dialog is exquisite and the pacing is phenomenal. It makes her alternate America really come to life in a believable way.<br /><br />Here's the main cast of characters: Benicio is a sorcerer, manipulative dad, and charismatic underworld boss. Lucas is his rebellious, good-hearted son, who wants nothing to do with the cabal yet has become the heir apparent anyway. He is also Paige's boyfriend. As a witch and our heroine, she caught in the middle. Lucas and Paige must simultaneously face off against the killer and the cabals. And, of course, witches and sorcerers get along somewhat less well than cats and dogs. Even the bit characters like Troy the half-demon bodyguard are interesting and convincingly written.

Unfortunately upon reading the book my initial concern was mostly right. Betancourt is a good author but he's simply not Zelazny no matter how much he tries to write like him. Like other reviewers I think this work would have been much better if it had not been done in 1st person. Not only is that the hardest style to write convincingly but the vast majority of people reading this prequel already know everything that will follow anyway. It's simply not as fresh, funny, or fast paced as the original series.<br /><br />Speaking of the original, I was privileged to meet Mr. Zelazny and speak with him for about an hour at a Sci-Fi convention about a year before his tragic death. Though he knew he was arguably the greatest author in the genre, I found him quiet, unassuming, and shy; yet he had a sly charm and razor wit. He was also one of the most intelligent people I have ever met. Most of the conversation was about swords and armor and other things that had nothing to do with his books, though one of the topics that came up was his Amber novels. I got the distinct impression that they ranked among his favorite creations, something he did not want anyone else messing around with - hence no movies, TV shows, or other authors playing with his characters. This preview was clearly authorized yet I suspect Roger wouldn't have been real happy about that.<br /><br />Betancourt's plot was OK but not great, too much like a rehash of the original series. As with all prequels it's very hard to be truly creative or surprising when everyone knows what must eventually occur anyway. The characters were acceptable but not exceptional though the names were truly uninspiring. Oberon's personality doesn't quite jive with his older self though I suppose that can be explained simply through the maturation process. The setting, however, was pretty darn flat. I really don't understand what appeal Ilerium could possibly have over the Courts of Chaos. Overall I think that this book was a great try, a valiant attempt at continuing the Amber legacy. Even though this work fell short I do intend to read the second one to see if Betancourt has gained his stride.what appeal Ilerium could possibly have over the Courts of Chaos.

The drills, teaching tips, and classroom management techniques are useful. If you have already read \\"Teaching Martial Arts,\\" the best part of the first section provides forty ways to disguise repetition. Those tips are creative and useful. There is a little more new material such as weapons training tips, safety concerns, (e.g., avoiding injuries, summer training and dehydration), and dealing with ADD issues with children.<br /><br />The second half is probably what most folks thinking about this title are actually looking for. It covers public relations, marketing, student retention, instructor survival, hosting tournaments, and leadership. It is pretty well done though I was expecting more on developing business plans, financing, and other administrivia associated with actually operating a dojo rather than just teaching in one.

Discussions of meridians and pressure points are more suited to acupressure/acupuncture students than to martial artists who are the target of perhaps 10% of the content. There is almost nothing, for example, about how martial techniques work from a bio-mechanical perspective, nor how applications affect the body medically. If you want a good overview that compares and contrasts Western and Eastern thought it's a decent reference, but if you want an in-depth study suitable for serious martial artists this is probably not your best resource.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-11-22

Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the Starfist series which is also written by Sergeant Major (ret) Dan Cragg and retired Marine Dave Sherman. In that series these masters of military SF developed realistic plots, gritty action scenes, and convincing characters whose personas are clearly influenced by the authors' real-life experiences.<br /><br />This book, on the other hand, reeks! It is by far the worst Star Wars book I have ever read (and I've read every one ever published except for the Dark Horse comics versions). I have read a minimum of one book a week every week for the last 25 years and this rates among the worst of them all. As a huge Star Wars fan I can't bear to give any book in that series only one star, but this one barely rates the two I did give it. Here's why:<br /><br />The plot is shallow and predictable. OK, that's reasonably common in this genre and can often be overlooked. I imagine that the authors had a tight story line to follow to help pre-shadow the upcoming Sith movie. I can live with a lame plot if the characters are interesting. It is Star Wars, after all! If you don't know the story, here it is: Separatist troops capture the planet Praesitlyn, threatening the Republic's Intergalactic Communications Center. Since this would be a devastating loss, Palpatine dispatches Halcyon and Skywalker to the planet with an army of clone troops to take it back. As always they are outnumbered but win anyway.<br /><br />The most insidious problem is the complete lack of recognizable characterization found in every other book about Anakin. He is a totally different guy. This isn't the future Vader; he's some goofball wearing Anakin's skin. For someone who is supposed to be (nearly) ready to pass his Jedi trials he comes across as a 12-year old rookie Padawan; not particularly bright either. Jedi Master Nejaa Halcyon, who was disgraced by somehow managing to lose his ship to a crook he was trying to apprehend, is little better. Since his offspring show up in much later novels I was kind of excited to find out about him, sigh... Let me also add that the editor should be ostracized, shot, or both. As others have pointed out this book is a grammatical nightmare.<br /><br />Now you know why they call it Jedi Trial. Save your money; run away! If you just have to read every Star Wars novel, pick this up used or wait for the paperback version. Better yet, pass on this one altogether and pick up a copy of \\"The Cestus Deception\\" by Steven Barnes and/or \\"Hard Contact (Star Wars: Republic Commando)\\" by Karen Traviss, both of which are excellent.nce his offspring show up in much later novels I was kind of excited to find out about him, sigh...

Similarly, his no-nonsense advice is hard hitting and right on point.<br /><br />This excellent book begins by pointing out that avoiding violence is an essential technique in and of itself, just as valuable as knowing how to throw a good punch or deliver a strong kick. The fundamental elements of avoidance tactics section is important information. There are also solid sections on the realities of fighting which, as experienced warriors understand, is nothing like what you see in the movies. It's ugly stuff best avoided. Even when you triumph there are legal (and medical) ramifications that can come back to haunt you. The author's stay out of prison plan is excellent. Advanced practitioners should appreciate this information but won't get a lot out of the rest of the book.<br /><br />The principles of defensive and offensive techniques are fairly basic, but well written and comprehensive. He covers striking, grappling, and movement in good detail. Don't forget, however, that you really cannot learn this stuff solely from a book. It should be supplemented with a hands-on instructional program. Chapter 7, which covers how to select an appropriate martial art for your own personal safety is an outstanding overview for beginners that can help you find one.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-11-18

I learned a lot about the how the lives of George Bush, Gerald Ford, John Kerry, Condoleeza Rice, Henry Kissinger, Jack Welch, John Bon Jovi and many others were affected by what they learned in sports; how a game, a coach, or a significant event impacted their lives.<br /><br />I participated in a wide variety of sports growing up: judo, skiing, target shooting, archery, hunting, football, baseball, and mountain climbing to name a few. The lessons I learned from the individual competitions made me stronger while the team sports helped me get along better with my friends and coworkers. All these activities helped mold my character and improve my self-esteem. Before reading this fascinating book I had not realized how great an impact such activities can have in all successful people.<br /><br />In a time when a majority of American's are overweight, schools are cutting back on physical education, and more and more youth sports take competition out of the game, this book is a compelling argument that we ought to pay more attention to the way sports used to be played. Through the thrill of victory and the humiliation of defeat we can learn to set high goals and achieve great things by participating in sports. The author poignantly states how competition has enriched the lives of our best and brightest.

While I have thoroughly enjoyed this whole series, The Jaguar Knights is Duncan's best book yet. In other tomes we have developed a thorough understanding of the Blades and White Sisters. Now the Dark Chamber is highlighted. While Blades are taught to work together and help each other, the Inquisitors are brought up in a competitive environment where outdoing each other leads to advancement. Medieval spookery and one-upmanship abounds. And it's really cool!<br /><br />Our hero Sir Wolf, his brother Lynx, and the Inquisitor Hogwood set off on a perilous quest to determine what has happened to the king's former mistress Celeste who has been carried off by mysterious warriors who somehow overrun an impenetrable castle then magically vanish. Duncan's fabulous characters, intricate plot, and fabulous storytelling continue to bring Chivial to life. I really enjoyed the way he examines how divided loyalties and strong emotions conflict with the Blade's magical bindings.<br /><br />What happens to Sir Lynx when his ward is ward is kidnapped is very interesting. I'd say more but it might ruin things for you. Be prepared for a wild ride...<br /><br />I was torn between wanting to finish it immediately and savoring the reading experience. Had a very hard time putting this one down even when I should have been doing more important things. Great book!	2004-11-17

If you truly understand the techniques and bio-mechanics, age matters not in the martial arts.<br /><br />This interesting book covers attributes of fitness, flexibility, power, reflexes, coordination, speed, and endurance with a focus on older martial artists. There is pretty good coverage on the effects of aging and how to train hard without hurting yourself. The sections on injury prevention, self-care, and over training are worth the price of admission. If you've never practiced martial arts before, the sections on progression in the martial arts, sparring, and forms are also very good. They are not particularly useful if you've been doing this a while, however. The introduction and the first few chapters are very basic indeed. The section on weapons forms near the end is a nice bonus though.<br /><br />All in all the vast majority of material in this tome has been covered better in other books, some written by Kim himself. The target audience is the middle-aged beginner who is interested in pursuing an education in martial arts. If you are over 40, new to martial arts, and only going to purchase one book, this is it.<br /><br />If you have been training for a while I wouldn't put this too high on the priority list. I'd recommend \\"Ultimate Flexibility: A Complete Guide to Stretching for Martial Arts\\" by Sang H. Kim along with \\"The Fighter's Body: An Owner's Manual: Your Guide to Diet, Nutrition, Exercise and Excellence in the Martial Arts\\" by Loren W. Christensen instead. Yeah, it's two books rather than one, but I think that combined they have the depth advanced practitioners require.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-11-16

That event made headlines both locally and nationally. Now days such instances are so common that many are not even reported at all. Our newest generation seems so sensitized to violence that it is hardly newsworthy, yet television shows, music videos, movies, and video games pump out disturbing images and glorify brutality on a daily basis. As a parent this concerns me greatly. As a martial artist and self-defense instructor it frankly pisses me off. I've worked with students as young as 8 who have an alarmingly cavalier attitude about human life. Grossman's work is compelling, well written, and factual. I've seen what he talks about first hand. It is an important wake-up call. If parents get more involved in their children's lives, as the author argues, they can help put a stop to this disturbing trend. The tools he provides will help you do something about it today-in your own home, school, and community at large.	2004-11-16

I particularly like the coverage of saifa kata and bunkai. Though not every school teaches gekiha kata, it is covered as well. This excellent tome offers a terrific introduction to Kaisai No Genri, the method of identifying hidden application from kata, which is apllicable to most martial arts systems. The personal history of Goju Ryu is interesting and illuminating. Seikichi Toguchi, a direct student of Chojun Miyagi (the system's founder), was an inspirational leader of the Goju community whose teaching will be sorely missed. Both his books are essential reading for Goju Ryu practitioners.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-11-14

Important anatomical information is distilled in a way that just about anyone can readily understand and use. This book is well laid-out and illustrated effectively to convey the information.

The plot is not particularly complex or compelling yet Traviss's exploration of what happens when good people are forced to do bad things is extremely well executed due to her brilliant characterization. Quiilura, the world where this adventure takes place, really comes to life in a believable way as well. Even without the Star Wars tie-in it's solid, entertaining military SF. Once again the theme of `clones are people too' is a strong component of the book. The four Republic Commandos are unique and interesting characters. I really like how Darman's interactions with Padawan Etain strengthens them both. Lots of solid, realistic, leadership examples add depth to the work. It's great storytelling.	2004-11-11

Advertising for this marvelous work states, \\"a ground-breaking examination of what it takes to perform, cope and survive in the toxicity of deadly combat as a soldier in a foreign land and a police officer in the mean streets of urban America.\\" It really is all that, and more... Outstanding isn't a strong enough word to describe it.<br /><br />If you are a soldier, a police officer, a martial artist, the holder of a concealed weapons permit, or just live in a bad neighborhood you really ought to read this book. Both authors really know what they're talking about, clearly able to articulate hard won wisdom in this well-written and comprehensive tome. Their thought-provoking, insightful work definitively examines every aspect of the psychology and physiology of deadly conflict.<br /><br />The book begins by describing what happens to a person anatomically during a battle then covers the perceptual distortions that take place in combat. Having done college studies on eyewitness testimony and psychology and the law I recognize and agree with many of their points. The second half of the book covers why people put themselves in harms way and what happens to them after the smoke clears. It talks about post traumatic stress disorder, survivor's guilt, and a host of related subjects. I particularly liked the section on the Judeo/Christian views of killing which really help warriors understand and come to grips with their actions in battle - be it on the field of war, a city street, or even in their own back yard.<br /><br />The research is great. The various vignettes and quotes are quite interesting. Even if you are never involved in a deadly encounter it really helps you understand and have a new appreciation for those who are. I have several friends and relatives in the military as well as a few in law enforcement. This book is going to be one of their holiday presents. This compelling study isn't just for professional warriors, however. Anyone with an affinity for martial arts like myself will find it an excellent read as well.<br /><br />Lt. Col. Grossman is a retired U.S. Army Ranger, scholar, and the Pulitzer nominated author of On Killing, another great book. Loren Christensen is one of my favorite martial arts authors.

Different kanji can have the same sound; hence each name can have a variety of possible character combinations. This easy to follow text helps you pick out the best characters for first or last names. It explains the root and meaning of each word. Among other things I have used this information to make a hanko (chop or seal) to stamp important documents with in Japanese style (like a signature).

I've been training with swords of various types since 1985 and this is the best book I've ever read on the Northern Shaolin (jiang) sword. This straight sword is the toughest to master in the Chinese martial arts. Most practitioners start with the broadsword (dao) and progress to this weapon only after years of diligent practice. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming is a true master of his art, a fact easily discernable in this fine text even if you have not read his bio. The fundamentals, forms, and step-by-step illustrations are masterfully written, thorough, and illuminating. The san cai jian (three-powers sword sequence), the kun wu jian (Kun Wu Mountain sword sequence) and the qi men jian (Qi family sword sequence)are covered in detail. The overlay arrows really make these static pictures come to life, adding real educational value for the reader. I particularly like the tandem sequences. The solo training techniques are very good as well, particularly the internal power drills. This tome is an outstanding and comprehensive work on the jiang.<br /><br />My only argument with this book is the \\"blood groove\\" comment that other reviewers have picked-up on as well. I hate to nit-pick on such a fine work, but that concept is simply wrong. Fullers (grooves) were created to lighten a sword and increase its strength/flexibility. Historically, blades whose primary purpose was to slash (e.g., broadsword) were more likely to be fullered than those whose main use was to thrust (e.g., rapier), simply due to weight. It is not worth downgrading the rest of this excellent text for one bad paragraph though...<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-11-05

As a knight in a medieval recreation group (sort of like a black belt of swords, shields and stuff) I thought I really knew what I was doing. Problem is, street confrontations are nothing like tournament competition.<br /><br />I learned two essential lessons from MacYoung's book: The first is that there is no such thing as a knife fight as the author pointedly states (pun intended). It is really a knife ambush. Unless you are lucky or highly trained you'll never see it coming. Fortunately both punks I tangled with were rank amateurs who flashed their blades giving me enough time to react. The second is a comprehensive understanding of where, how, and why street thugs conceal their knives to pull off an effective assassination. The awareness is illuminating and very possibly life saving as well.<br /><br />Knives are as ubiquitous as cell phones these days. Working in a stadium where weapons of all types are prohibited and bags are searched on the way in, I nevertheless pull knives off at least a couple of fans every game. Imagine how often you find them out in the street where they are more or less legal. This book is packed with stuff you gotta know!<br /><br />My only complaint is that while it is long and deep on theory it is a bit short on technique. There are plenty of good sources to supplement this knowledge so that is not a serious detractor.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-11-05

Bad guys are bad because they cheat (among other things). All the martial arts training in the world is useless if you get taken down in an ambush before you have a chance to use it or even know that you might need to.

He's been there, done that, and broken a lot of people along the way. That's why he is called \\"Animal.\\" I have read and re-read this excellent book several times since I first picked it up in 10 years ago. More importantly, I have successfully applied many of his techniques to escort drunken football fans out of a stadium without being hurt, sued, fired, or otherwise getting into trouble!<br /><br />For those with reasonably advanced martial arts training you are probably better off following whatever system you study while keeping MacYoung's ideas in mind (so that they can't be pulled on you). If you are not a black belt or don't care to be, what he writes about is quite effective with a bit of practice. More than just the techniques, however, his insight into violence, escalato, and mind games is well worth the price of admission.

As a non-practitioner with 30 years experience in other martial arts, I found the 6 pillars and mental aspects the most valuable. The vignettes on the origins of the art are colorful and insightful too. While you cannot learn any martial art purely from a book it is a pretty comprehensive write-up. As a traditional martial artist I find some of the postures disturbing, however. For example, the back heel is off the ground for many techniques. While this may be effective in blade arts, for open-hand applications you sacrifice a whole lot of power and mobility that way. Perhaps that stuff works well within the Krav Maga strategy but it is inconsistent with traditional karate. Since I'm not an expert Kravist I'm not going to argue, just simply point it out. All in all I still found it an interesting read.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-11-05

From there they go into specific techniques and case studies to help you put these concepts to practical use. There are also some enlightening vignettes from Tai Chi Chuan, The Art of War, and the Book of Five Rings. Their down to earth writing style is refreshing and entertaining. The various examples, stories, and tips make the book fun to read. Even better, the drills and practice scenarios quickly take you beyond the theory to improve your skills in a meaningful way.

Mixing examples of his masterful brush work with insightful and thought provoking stories, Lowry delves into the deeper meaning of common martial concepts. It is easy reading yet profound. I read it for the first time nearly a decade ago then recently picked it up again. I do not know if it is the natural maturity that comes with age or through the furtherance of my martial training but I have found it even better the second time around. If you are looking for deeper meaning in from your budo training, this work belongs on your bookshelf!<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-11-02

Several years ago my friend Carol tried to break up with her boyfriend Steve (not his real name). He threatened to kill her and tried a couple of times. The TRO was ineffective. After the first couple of weeks the cops were not much help either. I remember trying to fall asleep on her couch with a shotgun wondering why she hadn't seen this train wreck coming a whole lot sooner. Long story short, he's in jail; she's fine. She did not go on another date for more than two years afterward, however, until I bought her this book. It is illuminating and empowering. The best, most holistic treatise on the subject I've ever read.<br /><br />Seems like every time there is a tragedy in the news where someone goes on a rampage, some reporter interviews the shocked neighbors who thought the guy or gal was perfectly normal until one day they snapped. Gavin DeBecker puts this nonsense to rest. There is always an indication ahead of time if you are trained to see it. This book is a step-by-step guide on how to identify these cues and avoid danger.<br /><br />The same thing works on a national scale. When the President or Homeland Security asks us to be vigilant, what the heck does that mean? DeBecker sums it up quite well, \\"Before the courageous FBI raid, before the arrest, long before the news conference, there is a regular American citizen who sees something that seems suspicious, listens to intuition, and has the character to risk being wrong or seeming foolish when making the call to authorities.\\"<br /><br />This is an outstanding book.

Many feel that training by themselves bites. Not only is there no one to help you, there is also no one to motivate you. Regardless, while tandem drills (e.g., bunkai, kumite, randori) are pretty much impossible to do on your own, some things are best practiced outside of formal class, especially where you need to focus on improving deficiencies that may not be shared with the rest of the class. If you really want to progress, you need to be able to effectively train alone.<br /><br />Loren Christensen's excellent work provides numerous tips, techniques, and exercises to get the most out of your solo training. A common complaint that my new students relate is that they are afraid to train outside of class for fear of learning techniques incorrectly. They think that unlearning bad habits is far worse than doing nothing at all so they do not practice on their own. Believe me, with this fine text even beginners can benefit. There is nothing earth-shattering here, just solid practical advice.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-11-01

As I prepared to leave the next morning I found I could not reach my car due to all the police tape, an ambulance, and a couple dozen cops. Turns out a lady a block away where I had parked had been hacked to death with an ax early that morning. The incident convinced me to think about personal protection in a whole new way. A Seattle police officer friend of mine recommended that I get this book (originally written in 1983). I've probably read it a dozen times since then.<br /><br />Although some of the material is a bit dated, I still consider it the finest tome on this subject matter ever written. It discusses what to do before, during, and after a violent encounter, morally, legally, and ethically identifying the appropriate to use countervailing force. It covers everything from walking down the street, to driving your vehicle, to securing your home. All manner of makeshift weapons as well as open hand defensive scenarios are discussed. It also provides a holistic set of criteria and considerations to help civilians decide whether or not to carry a firearm for self-defense.<br /><br />Massad Ayoob, Director of the Lethal Force institute, is a retired police officer and one of the nation's leading authorities in countervailing force. Most of his writings are about firearms yet I believe this to be his finest work. Even though I wish that he would update these materials and reprint this book, I still feel that the current version is well worth the money. It's no longer the end all be all, but it is essential reading nevertheless.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-10-31

While it may seem that this material is only relevant in certain Third World countries, it's only a matter of time before the global war on terror ends up back here. Let's all hope and pray that it doesn't, but I for one would rather be prepared and never use it then oblivious and dead.<br /><br />Lt. Col. Dave Grossman wrote that there are three kinds of people in the world: sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs. Sheep are regular, productive, law abiding citizens with no capacity for violence. For the most part they'd rather not even know that such dangers exist. Wolves are, of course, the dregs of society who prey upon the ignorant sheep. Sheepdogs protect the other sheep as well as themselves from the wolves. They are prepared to use countervailing force as necessary to defend themselves. In this wonderful book, Sockut has written the sheepdog's survival manual. One we'd rather not use, but clearly need to know about.<br /><br />Eugene Sockut has spent much of his adult life teaching the Israelis how to combat terror and win. This book helps civilians and professionals increase their threat awareness and build the tools necessary to survive. The various vignettes give clear and shocking insight into the mind of terrorists. I particularly like the section on surviving during a riot.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book is that it is a bit more militaristic than currently necessary. It does not quite advocate killing first then asking questions later but it comes a bit closer than prudent for my taste. Readers should treat it as an awareness building academic study more than as a how to manual. Regardless, I feel that it provides pithy, relevant, and important knowledge to help us in dangerous times.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2004-10-30

My eight year old son, who also happens to be one of my students, talked me into buying this book for him on his birthday. Since it wasn't a graphic novel and I wanted to encourage his reading I went ahead and picked up a copy for him even though I didn't think he was really ready for it. He not only read the whole thing, but he really seemed to understand the text as well. I was frankly amazed. Soooo, on an eight-year old's recommendation I picked up the book and began to read it myself. A couple hours later I found I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />This is a compelling, well written translation. It is fascinating and, for the most part, still relevant to modern life. Many of us who pursue the martial path do so in part to build good character, enhance mental discipline, develop physical conditioning, and of course, learn skills for self-defense. Yet the package is not complete in my opinion without a solid understanding of Japanese culture and history. After all, it played a huge role in forming what we do.

Bunkai Jutsu is extremely well done. Iain Abernethy is one of the few authors who truly understands and is able to communicate that martial arts are at their core about combat. Kata is not dance practice nor is it aerobic training (though that may be a legitimate side benefit of performing it). It is the fundamental basis of a fighting art. Bunkai are the kata applications practitioners can use for real-life self-defense. Abernethy provides an easy to read approach to understanding and utilizing these applications.<br /><br />If you know how to decipher them, all aspects of fighting can be found in kata, including kicking, striking, grappling, strangling, pressure point techniques, and throwing applications. The contents of this impressive tome include a brief history of kata, a treatise on the nature of real fighting, Iain's rules of bunkai (how to figure out what the kata is telling you), pre-emptive striking, entrance and exit techniques, ground fighting, the \\"true\\" use of blocks, the purpose of stances, kata-based sparring, and much more. This is all stuff you can use in real life combat. The section on vital points is illuminating.<br /><br />This book is well worth the money even though it's a little hard to find and may take awhile to get (almost 4 weeks when I ordered it on Amazon). It is one of the very few books I categorically believe that every martial artist should own. I heartily recommend it!<br /><br />Iain Abernethy really knows his stuff. He holds a godan (5th degree black belt) in applied karate from the British Combat Association, one of the world's leading groups for close-quarter combat and practical martial arts. He is also a yodan (4th degree black belt) in Wado-Ryu karate (English Karate Governing Body), a member of the Combat Hall of Fame, and a former national level kata judge in the UK. He is the author of four books on applied karate: Bunkai-Jutsu: The Practical Application of Karate Kata, Throws for Strikers: The Forgotten Throws of Karate, Boxing, and Taekwondo, Karate's Grappling Methods, and Arm-Locks for All Styles. Sensei Abernethy has produced numerous DVD's and videos on applied karate and kata bunkai and is a regular contributor to all of UK's leading martial arts magazines.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instructiondo, Karate's Grappling Methods, and Arm-Locks for All Styles.

While the author is an experienced, highly knowledgeable practitioner, his understanding of the traditional martial arts that he rails against is incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate. Don't get me wrong; I certainly do not believe that the author is an idiot.  I believe that he is the victim of bad teaching, an all too common occurrence in martial arts.<br /><br />For example, he states that, \\"today's full-contact fighters throw devastating, lightning fast punches from a distance of less than two feet.  Against this kind of speed, classical blocks and punches simply do not stand a chance.  What amazes me is how a flaw of this magnitude - and one that is taught to thousands of unknowing students every day - still exists in what are, otherwise, extremely potent arts...\\" This is just flat wrong.<br /><br />Contrary to Mr. Orlando's understanding, in classical blocks the hand that is out (e.g. just punched or blocked) performs the actual block, check, or deflection, while the hand that is in chamber executes a technique designed to control the opponent's limb.  Even though it is often hidden, almost all blocks in traditional karate styles utilize this check/control methodology.  In all cases, there is never ever any \\"wind-up\\" preceding anything.  In most traditional schools all but the most junior students understand that simple fact.<br /><br />To delve deeper, the word \\"uke\\" translates more accurately to \\"receive\\" than it does to \\"block.\\"  When viewed in this context, it may be easier to understand that practitioners typically check, deflect, or control an attack rather than meeting it force-on-force.  Using the traditional check/control methodology, a practitioner's outstretched hand need only deflect an attack by a few inches to spoil its effect when contact is made close to an opponent's body.  In this fashion karateka can easily avoid being hit by even the most \\"devastating\\" of punches no matter how fast, or how powerfully, or even how unexpectedly they are thrown.<br /><br />Common misconceptions such as this one are the reason that I believe it is imperative to supplement the traditional modeling approach to instruction with interactive discussions and other teaching styles.  Regardless, I hate to see this sort of stuff perpetuated...<br /><br />Now that I've ripped him down, I will point out that there are some redeeming concepts in this book.  For example, the author also promotes practicing martial arts in the same sort of attire one might be wearing in real life.  If you have spent your whole life barefoot in a dojo, training with loose fitting clothes, you may well be in for a shock the first time you have to fight in tight-fitting jeans wearing boots.  This is a very valid point.  I wholeheartedly agree that practitioners should devote some of their training to more realistic conditions though that often must occur at their home rather than in a tradition karate school.<br /><br />All in all, however, there is not enough meat in this book for me to feel like I got my money's worth from purchasing it.  It was disappointing. Get Sifu Orlando's book \\"Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals: The Brutal Arts Of The Archipelago\\" instead. It's a great read and well worth buying.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instructionby even the most \\"devastating\\" of punches no matter how fast, or how powerfully, or even how unexpectedly they are thrown.

Wiley interviews a good cross-section of martial arts instructors and portrays their collective wisdom in an entertaining and fast-paced style.  If you teach martial arts, you'll want to read this.  Couple cool quotes from the book:<br /><br />\\"Kids love to compare and compete, and they especially love calling attention to each other's mistakes.  I frequently have to remind them that I am the teacher and their job is to concentrate on their own improvement, without worrying about anyone else's...  From the student's point of view, the problem is that the mind is quicker than the body - and the mouth is quicker than the mind.\\" - Didi Goodman Sensei, Chief Instructor, Cuong Nhu Redwood Dojo.<br /><br />\\"Traditional schools emphasize self-improvement and self-realization as the primary goal, with \\"not losing\\" (in an actual fight) a result of sincere training.  Modern tournament schools emphasize being better than others, that is winning (and displaying) trophies.  Fun is not the purpose of traditional karate-do; the development of good character is.  To the extent that one has ego-centered fun at the expense of others, one has left the realm of self-improvement behind and sown the seeds of self-destruction.  On the other hand, training cannot be distasteful.  It has the rewards of happiness, fascination, satisfaction, and even humor, and it is on this feedback that the instructor and the club will succeed or fail.\\" - Dr. Elmar T.

If you want to teach martial arts, this is a great introductory book.  A quote from the author says it best: \\"If you flip through the ads for your local martial arts schools you might get the impression that being some kind of champion is a prerequisite for being an instructor.  In reality, what you are is more important than what you have done in the past.  To be a good instructor you have to do more than teach.  You have to understand and relate to your students.  You must have a sense of mission and motivation for what you are doing.  You must have knowledge and experience as well as a sense of professionalism.  Above all, you have to believe in what you are doing.\\"<br /><br />Absolutely true!  In a well-managed Dojo, all students are actively engaged in instructor-led activities or self-directed practice at all times.  Not only do they know what they are expected to do but teaching styles have been thoughtfully selected and communication techniques appropriately tailored such that they are generally successful at doing it.  Students feel that they are making progress daily, learning something new, no matter how small, at each training session.  There is little to no time wasted due to confusion or disruption.  A work-oriented tone prevails, but within a relaxed, pleasant atmosphere.<br /><br />Innate teaching methods are largely determined by an instructor's character, cultural-heritage, personality, and martial arts background.  This means that there can be as many different teaching methods as there are teachers.  Regardless, there are fundamental formulas that can be applied to anyone's teaching style to make it as effective as possible.  Dr. Kim's book outlines many of these formulas, offering practical suggestions to improve anyone's teaching skills.  While it's certainly not the end-all, be-all of instruction books, it is well worth the read. I found Sang Kim's work invaluable research for my own book, Martial Arts Instruction.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts InstructionAssaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction	2003-10-22
