US	49399480	R2Z0ZDMTLAJN81	0449206521	419016493	Tales of the South Pacific	Books	1	14	87	N	N	Glorifying war, ridiculing natives, having fun	&quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; is one of those books I don't want to believe. How can a book which puts such an romantic layer over something horrible become a classic?<br />The book is a mix of a novel and a collection of short-stories, becoming more novel-like towards the end. Several characters reappear, some more often than others. They are integrated in stories about either a strange idea of love, heroic tales about ideal soldiers and detailed descriptions of war plans and battles. Following that order, the book is ridiculous, disgusting and boring.<br />When in the second story &quot;Coral Sea&quot; a New Zealander gives a description what New Zealand will become if it is captured by Japan, you wonder what is going on here. Why is this description there, talking about &quot;white men being used on farms&quot;? It dehumanizes the enemy, the Japanese and is just one instance of many in this book where those people are described in the most defying ways one could imagine. Maybe I'm just not used to that, but the ongoing glorification of Americans versus the prejudiced description of the non-human Japanese in this book just made me sick. Of course war can only be fun if the enemies are pure evil, but I live in the real world where everybody is a human being.<br />Next tale, &quot;Mutiny&quot; is about a captain who has to decide if some old trees are chopped down for an airstrip. Of course he does (after all, they're just trees), but what's interesting is the description of a girl called Lucy living on this island. The words used for her are the following: chubby, crazy, fat little moron, chubby moron, etc. Very nice and a good basis for the description of all natives. Lucy isn't a native but a mix between natives and white men, an idea that makes our &quot;feel a bit sick his stomach&quot;.<br />On other occasions natives are primitive beasts who are unable to understand anything (because they can't speak English which makes them not worth respecting them), who are dumb and naive, maybe greedy, often mysterious and odd. But there are also good things, because when the natives are female and young, they function as excellent sex objects. Really romantic, isn't it? In the &quot;tragic&quot; story &quot;Fo' Dolla'&quot; a poor American soldier falls in love (read &quot;has a lot of sex&quot;) with a young native girl and just can't live his life with her. He doesn't need to explain why since his motives are quite logical. Right? He is an American and she is a native, so what other motives for dumping her, after using her, do you need?<br />The rest of the book consists of terribly boring descriptions of battle plans of which I have no idea why anyone would want to read about them. There are also battles which aren't more exciting because you don't care about the characters, since you don't know them. The author doesn't care either, since most of the deaths are just mentioned without going into detail. &quot;Then so-and-so many were killed... three were shot... we lost so-and-so many soldiers... etc.&quot; After all, they're soldiers, it is war, they're supposed to die. Right? And if they're white they're at least lucky enough to be heroes because, well, white soldiers are good and others... not. My favourite quote: &quot;I thought of the dead Japs bobbing upon the shorelines... Even some of them had been good men... All men rotting in Iron Bottom Bay were good men too. etc. etc.&quot; Repeating it doesn't make it better or less disgusting.<br />What is left is a view of war which is very far from realism. Criticiscm about war is unknown to the author. They did what they had to do, and there was enough fun, alcohol and girls to enjoy it even more. I don't deny that the book is sometimes entertaining, because some of the recurring characters are interesting. But it also is glorifying war, it depicts natives and Japanese as negative as possible and it replaces love with sex. If that has to be part of a classic, I have noproblems with getting rid of some classics pretty fast. Read Steinbeck instead, or Spike Milligan's memories of the war, if you like. &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; is most of the time just disgusting.	2003-09-28
US	49399480	R1K4N5ALQNO097	189395630X	344714132	The Holy	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Breathtaking, fascinating, weird, gripping and some more	1. A review for all readers:<br />\\"The Holy\\" starts out very interesting with a little story about a boy and continues with the story of a private detective who gets a rather unusual case. This said, it sounds like the most average book around. But what happens at around 1/3 of the book has simply to be read to believe it. The author tells the story of a man who can't take his life anymore the way it is and simply quits it. He packs his stuff, says goodbye to his family and boss and drives away. The chain of events that happens to him then is so unbelievable, that you will find yourself quite often shaking your head. Not because you will say \\"Yeah, right!\\", but because you just can't believe all the things that are happening. Quinn takes the reader very far until he delivers the solution to all of it. This is real suspense. It is nearly impossible to put the book away, because you know that you have to read on until you know what the hell is going on.<br />And then, when it comes, when the solution is coming along, your mind will quite simply be blown away. Everything flows together, everything, even the most absurdest things make sense. All you'll can do after you closed the book is to think. It is impossible to put it away, saying \\"Okay, that was that.\\" It changes your mind, making yourself ask questions you wouldn't have thought of before. You'll have a new way to look at the world.<br />Of course, this was the same with all of the other Quinn novels, but none of his books ever got you so involved with the story and characters, like \\"The Holy\\" does. Quinn has a beautiful way of writing, describing the characters so detailed and perfect, that you exactly know what to think about them. There are no clichees, no stereotypes. The story is outstanding, getting everywhere from crime to gambling to religion to murder to fate to satanism to animism to zombies and to life itself. The book starts like \\"The Story of B\\", continues as a John Irving-novel going beserk and endslike no other book I've read before.<br />If you just a need a really good book, read \\"The Holy\\". No matter, what kind of literature you're interested in, this book will surely satisfy you. This is Quinn's best work up to now.<br />2. A short review for all Quinn-experienced readers:<br />Read it! :) Really. Sure, maybe you won't find any new ideas that strike you as much as in the other books, but all you know up to now from the \\"Ishmael\\"s or \\"Story of B\\" is so perfectly put in here, that you'll just love it. The other books were so revolutionary for your mind because the ideas were so new, while the story was not always satisfactory (especially in \\"My Ishmael\\"). With \\"After Dachau\\" he proved that he can write really great stories without forgetting the big ideas. With \\"The Holy\\" he proves that he simply can do anything. This is Quinn's best work up to now, even better than \\"The Story of B\\".	2002-11-07
US	49399480	R2M5TS3VITVZL8	0743448219	858244378	The Four Feathers	Books	1	6	36	N	N	An absurd, silly, entertaining piece of...	I'm a fan of some kind of B-movies. Which means I like them if they are so silly you can laugh or at least smile through them. This works the best with movies that take themself very seriously. Honestly, I wouldn't have thought that a book could have the same effect, but \\"The Four Feathers\\" succeeds in being extremly funny - unintentionally, I suppose.<br />A man is crazy enough to be afraid of war and therefore gets thrown out of the society by his friends and his fiancee because there is nothing they could less understand. Soon he figures this out himself and does some really exciting things to save his honor or something to that effect.<br />As some have mentioned the book is \\"misunderstood\\", which means that it is not about Harry Feversham's stupid adventures to save his stupid honor, but mostly about the absolutely crazy relationships of his fiancee Ethne and his friend Durrance. This has to be read to believe. Durrance is blind you know, but since he is some kind of superhero he can sense everything this conversation partner does, breathes or thinks. Which doesn't help him of being the most miserable guy in the book getting nothing for giving everything. But there is Ethne, the woman, too, who feels pretty proud in marrying whoever comes along, as long as she can play some violin. Talk about some strong female roles here.<br />And there is Harry, the main character, who is absent most of the book. Which may not be too bad, since his actions are far beyond reason. Not his \\"cowardishness\\", but everything after the feathers, his actions and thoughts.<br />There is not a single character in the book you can relate to, because everyone is crazy about war and dying. Harry doesn't explain why he was scared of going into war. Everyone else doesn't understand it and the only person who pretends to understand it (Sutch), doesn't explain why. I suppose, the author had no idea too, so, well...<br />I though it was great that it was called \\"Four Feathers\\", that four feathers were given out most dramatically and that one of them simply is for free, without any meaning. You could ask yourself why it simply wasn't called \\"The Three Feathers\\" and one was left out, but if you start like this you get crazy with this book.<br />I can't believe anyone admires this. It is entertaining, somehow, I admit. It's not boring you know and, as I said, you can smile all the way. But taking it seriously is far beyond my understanding. I mean, this is a book that admires war, especially the colonial war that was all about expanding the white race. Therefore the \\"foreign\\" or arabic characters are just silhouettes or servants.<br />But if you always wanted to read about a woman who gets happy when she hears a person was killed and her big love is tortured in a prison (because at least, that's not cowardish), then this \\"classic\\" is right for you. Or if you watched a movie like \\"Star Crash\\" or \\"Double Team\\" often enough and ever wondered if it was possible to manage to write a real B-movie-trash-book. Because this is definitely what it is.	2002-10-18
US	49399480	RKLXIQCL2BN53	0440206154	247672694	Red Dragon	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Dark, disturbing, great	There will be a time, when the book &quot;Red Dragon&quot; will be as famous as his follow-ups &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;, because it's said that it will be filmed soon. Well, again, since it already was some years ago, when no one knew of Hannibal Lecter. Maybe when this time comes, it will be realized that this is Thomas Harris' best work till now and I think, will be.<br />The novel is about the profiler Will Graham, who gets the mission to track down a new serial killer, the Red Dragon, who has killed already two families and will kill more if no one stops him. On his mission, he gets more involved in the case than he wanted to.<br />Well, yes, Graham knows Lecter and he also appears in the book and plays an important role, but the book is not about him, and maybe that's why it's so good. &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; contained more Lecter, was still pretty good and &quot;Hannibal&quot; contained only Lecter and was not so good at all. The first two show when Hannibal works the best. When he's locked away and shows his power, which can't be locked. In &quot;Hannibal&quot; he's just and old man, who's clever, but unknown and uninteresting.<br />But enough of this. &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is the best book about a fictional serial killer that I have read up to now. It's extremely suspenseful, very dark and brutal, clever and surprising. Its characters are brilliantly drawn, which is shown especially in the person of the &quot;Red Dragon&quot; himself, who is not just a madman, but has reasons for his madness.<br />But the center of the book is Will Graham, the profiler, whose life is destroyed by his gift, to imagine the feelings of the killers. He is so torn apart, between his duty and his longing for a normal life. He's not a real hero, because he can't be happy with his talent. The visions haunt him, the murderers are still in his head and he got wounds from his job, that will never heal.<br />Thomas Harris wrote this novel witha brilliance, he hadn't in his previous novel &quot;Black Sunday&quot; and which got lost more and more in the next two. If I had to think which characters I would re-use from this book I wouldn't have chosen Hannibal, but Graham. Or, imagine how interesting it would have been to read about both of their beginnings. Hannibal is only interesting if he's in prison or at least if he's still killing people and Clarice Starling is never as interesting as Will Graham.<br />This book is a masterpiece and stands out of novels, which just went into the wrong direction. The potential he created here, was not used and this is a pity.	2001-08-17
US	49399480	RIXOVFXV8464J	031286583X	952678908	Song of Kali	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Suspenseful, but too high hopes	Dan Simmons is something unique in the literary world. He writes horror and science-fiction, alright, but I never considered this as something bad. The way he writes it, is brilliant. His &quot;Carrion Comfort&quot; is a masterpiece in every way, and &quot;Summer of Night&quot; and &quot;Prayers to Broken Stones&quot; prove his brilliance too.<br />&quot;Song of Kali&quot; was in that way a disappointment. It's a pretty good horror novel, well written, suspenseful and all, but something was missing. Something &quot;Simmons&quot;.<br />The story is about a literature agent who travels to Calcutta to find a manuscript by a famous, but vanished author. On his journey he gets involved in cultural and occult struggles and his life changes dramatically.<br />Right up to the middle of the book, it's also built-up and exposition. It can be read easy, it's not too interesting, but not boring. Then, after 3/4 the suspense somehow increases extremly. From that point on I had to read it all till the end. The end itself was not disappointing, but surprising in another way than usual.<br />&quot;Song of Kali&quot; is a good read, not brilliant, but better than most Koontz and some King.	2001-08-17
US	49399480	R388EPLSNN4QK2	0446608378	270870625	Thunderhead	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Not that great discovery	&quot;Relic&quot; and &quot;Reliquiary&quot; worked very well and &quot;Mount Dragon&quot; lost because of its weak ending. &quot;Riptide&quot; I missed till now. &quot;Thunderhead&quot; still ranks below the first three because of a lot of things.<br />The story is fast told. An expedition searchs for an old Indian city, which is legendary in archeological circles. Strange events seem to make the expedition fail. People die, etc.<br />The characters include the enthusiastic female leader, the arrogant specialist, the cool cowboy, the joking journalist and a shy scientist. There are some more, but, hey aren't it enough already? I surely don't mind a book with many characters. But it's obvious here that Preston and Child had too much do with all of them. Most of them stay so straight in their roles, you're never surprised about them. Other change their habits so often, you don't have a clue who they really are. The perfect example for this is Sloane, the daughter of the institute's boss, who also join the expedition. She is good and evil equally somehow. Some pseudo-psychological explanations don't help a lot.<br />The story itself doesn't deliver much to tell about. Searching the city, finding the city, exploring the city. That's about it. If you thought the previous books were scientific wait for this one. There is so much talk about archology you have to be a bit interested, or otherwise you fall asleep.<br />I am interested in the topic and it was another reason why I disliked it. The explanations are sometimes laughable and the message it delivers about science is nearly dangerous.<br />Besides that there are so many things that make you go &quot;What?&quot; it's too much really. Can anyone tell me how you can hear &quot;the sound of a ladder being put on a wall&quot;?<br />Despite all this the book somehow is suspenseful. The quality doesn't vary that much through it. It's really average, exciting and suspenseful, but average all through it.	2001-06-07
US	49399480	R33EKI0W9JJT06	0060920076	388683066	Affliction	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Emotional, but slow	'Affliction' is the study of a man. A sad and disappointed man. The character of Wade can't be neither called a hero, nor a anti-hero. He's just what normal people are, sometimes good, sometimes bad. But all the way he tries to get his life right.<br />The book is about how Wade has to cope with his ex-wife, his lover, his bosses, his colleagues, a murder and his father. He's kind of policeman, but no one takes him seriously. Wade is a bit slow in thinking, but he's not really dumb.<br />The book is not about the murder, really. It's not a thriller or a whodunit. It's a study about man who nevertheless how bad his life is going, he still thinks he can get it on. It's this hope, which makes this book so sad.<br />The book is very sad, at most in scenes when Wade gets treated by other people and when he just can't handle it. It's sad to see how impossible it's for him to take care of his daughter. She doesn't like him and that's hard to take.<br />Nevertheless this book is well-written and very emotional, it's a bit slow. Not much happens, and I'm not talking of more shoot-outs and murder. It's just a book which takes a while to read. But that's okay, because it's worth doing so.	2001-05-27
US	49399480	RCDSI1AWLIB8Z	0743211383	241269653	Dreamcatcher	Books	2	8	12	N	N	Bottom of King's barrel	Maybe, if I'd not be a big Stephen King-fan, I'd say 'Dreamcatcher' is a average novel, good entertainment, whatever. But unfortunately I'm not and so I have the heavy task for the first time ever not praising a King-novel. And even this is an understatement. I can not only not praise it, I also have to say how bad it is. Having read every King-book I have to say, even if there were some not-so-good ones, there never was a bad one. Never.<br />But there is 'Dreamcatcher' now (in german it's called for no real reason 'Duddits') and my disappointment about this book started after reading about 100 pages.<br />The story: four since-childhood-friends are on their yearly hunting trip. There discover a confused hunter, who is sick. They find out the forest their in is contamined and the military is guarding it. So they have to look for help by their old, retarted friend, Duddits.<br />If this sounds a bit confusing then because it is. These summary is only superficial. Let's see, we have four childhood friends who have to face they grew old, a retarted friend, telepathy, military, aliens, a lot of farting and even more clichés. If this sounds too much for one book, then because it definitely is.<br />King never really was the master of clichés, but here he shows that he can put one after another. The retarted friend is the real genius, the military colonel is pure evil, the aliens are either flesheating aliens or mind-telepathists.<br />The book in a whole is unbelievable from beginning to the end. It's also really annoying. How much do you want to read about people who fart more and more until they die very unpleasant? For me, one sentence was enough, but it lasted till the very end. The book is also unnecessary brutal and violent. It's not a somehow necessary violence as in earlier books, but seems just to be there for the effect.<br />The evil General Kurtz (yes, Kurtz) only wants to kill, prays a lot and doesn't like sex. Duddits, the retarted, is funny and everyonejust loves him and besides that he's brilliant. Government betrays us, aliens are evil as always and the past never lets you go.<br />I rarely saw such unnecessary flashbacks. There are so many hints to the past that I really wondered: why? When the stories are told finally, you never know why they should be important.<br />The book is a poor mixture of It, Tommyknockers, any Alien-monster-story, any Alien-mindpeople-story and Rain Man.<br />It's hard to summarize the problem of the book. It's very confused and full of clichés and sometimes boring. Even the usual references to other books seem faked.<br />King writes in the end, that he wrote the book after his heavy accident. I have the poor hope, that this is not only the reason for the quality of this book, but maybe he'll write a better one now. His last good book was 'Hearts in Atlantis' and before that 'The Green Mile' (and of course the Dark Tower). But there also was the unecessary 'Tom Gordon', the flat 'Storm of the Century', the money-maker 'On Writing', the bad 'Insomnia'-copy 'Bag of Bones' and now 'Dreamcatcher. At first I thought I like his books less, because I grew older. But now I think it's him. It's really a pity.	2001-04-26
US	49399480	R1D876VV0HRILQ	189395613X	234645673	After Dachau: A Novel	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Worth every cent	Part 1 - A Review for Non-'Ishmael'-readers:  If any of you never have heard of Daniel Quinn this is surely a book as good to start with as another. Quinn shows us not really a view of the future, as some may find. It's more an utopy and only in this point it's similar with '1984'. It's not really pessimistic, because he doesn't show us something which 'could' happen. It's more a clever parabel about how much you can accept the world's history without ever really questioning it. The surprising twist in the middle left me stunned and speechless. It's a really suspenseful book, which is very fast and easy to read. I can only recommend this to anyone (also the ones I will refer to next). Except for the boring, really overlong 'climbing-down-the-underground'-passage this book is somehow perfect.<br />Part 2 - A Review to 'Ishmael'/DQ-Readers: I will only refer to the ones who think they must be annoyed because of this book. What the hell did you expect? Did you really wanted another preaching book where we're told what we have to do? Do you really want to just going on reading the things instead of doing them? And, by the way, why can't you accept that DQ is an author, which means, he doesn't want to write the same book again and again. This is a great book, not handling THE topic so directly as the others, but anyway it does, and those who can't accept this are, in my opinion, narrow-minded.	2001-03-02

But 'Cider House Rules' impressed me pretty much and 'Owen Meany' does as well.<br />The story about little Owen Meany, who has a strange voice, seems to his destiny and has an big impact on anyone he meets, is hard to retell and very complicated. If you would try to tell it completely you would surely forget some details and once you've read it you know that every detail in this book is necessary.<br />It's about religion as well as about friendship, war, sex, politics, literature, television, etc., etc. It's about all those things. You can't just say it's about one thing, as religion, as you also can't say 'Cider House' is just about abortion. Of course both have somehow main topics, but in the end all comes together.<br />I was rarely so impressed by an author's talent to write. Irving has such a craft, such a wonderful way to write, it's just astonishing. It's one of those books you can't believe someone has imagined all these events. There are so packed with details you would think it was real. But on the other side everything's so weird, you'd never believe it's real. The storyline is so well-thought, that events from the very beginning relate to the very end. When close to the end Owen and the narrator, his best friend Johnny, try to remember events in their lifes, you feel as if you know them and as if you remember those things too. You do actually, because you read about it. You get the full life of these two guys and you surely think you know them personally.<br />This book took me two months to read and this is very unusually for me. I am a fast reader, I normally have one book per week. But this one is like a journey. You don't go through it very fast, but you do page after page. I mean, surely, it's not a small book, but it's just enjoyable. You relax in it. And you start to think like the characters talk. I can't count how many times I thought something 'gave methe shivers'. I never even heard that expression before!<br />'A Prayer for Owen Meany' is a wonderful and even if you could maybe think it's a bit boring in the middle (when Johnny tells about his life the most) it still gets you in the suspenseful, exciting, solving end. At the end you're just astonished, that you know the characters so good you understand everything that happens without explanations. It's a book hard to leave.	2000-12-29

But it's very close as I must add. 'The Relic' was wonderful, so it was very hard for the authors to write another one with the same topic and make it new. But they did. The descriptions of the underground and the people living there is very interesting and not exaggerated.

Here he proves that he can write them as well as horror books. Maybe even better.<br />This book is about war. Of course it's about Vietnam especially but where is the difference here?<br />The book is divided into five stories which are divided into years. Except the first and the last, they are not really connected except in this strange way King connects all of his stories.<br />The first in 1960 is a story about a boy who gets to know a man who becomes his best friend, but has strange problems. I won't tell more for surprises but Dark Tower-fans should read it!<br />The second in 1966 is the best one, a story about a young man and what he experienced when he was in university in this year. Since Vietnam began here, war begins to play its first role in this story. It's funny and sad and wonderful.<br />The third in 1983 is about a veteran who has a very strange way to earn his daily money. Nothing more told here too. Very unusual.<br />The fourth in 1999 is about another veteran and how he has to fight with his traumatic experiences in Vietnam. Very unexpected things happening here. Great story!<br />The last one is also in 1999 and is connected to the first one.<br />King says wonderful things about war and since he never was fighting in Vietnam it's even more surprising how good he writes about it. This one gives me hope again that King can still write unusual great books and doesn't think to much of money. A must!	2000-11-07

If you want to know something about him, you have to read it, because you won't learn more anywhere else. Not even in his own 'On Writing' by the way.<br />Maybe it would be interesting too to read more actual interviews, but these one help a lot. Okay, it's not always that interesting, like in the conversation about his radio station and sometimes weird, like in the one about 'Maximum Overdrive' if you have seen it. And of course a lot of things are repeated.<br />But it's really a must for King-fans.	2000-10-28

In books like this one or 'Sphere' he didn't seem to write for the film that will be made. Here seems to write a book.<br />This one has a lot of suspense and an interesting style. It doesn't seem like a real novel, more like a report. This results from the scientific facts he not only throws in, but explains everything and after a while you feel like reading a schoolbook.

I won't ask why they left the fifth one away. But, why?<br />If you know Stephen King you know it's not the same as Richard Bachman. It's the same person, but not the same author. The style is different, the themes, everything. It's not better or worst, it's just different.<br />'The Long Walk': One of the typical things of Bachman books is their strong pessimistic view of the world. This is one of the most pessimistic books I've ever read, but it's very effective and disturbing. Not an easy one.<br />'Rage': Maybe one of the simplest premises ever, but wonderful solved. It's very realistic and was written long before Littletown or something like that. It's a good one, not very easy too and quite disturbing, but better than 'The Long Walk'.<br />'Roadwork': Surely the most psychological one. It's very good I think, maybe the best of this collection. No ray of light is seen here again, but it's good anyhow.<br />'Running Man': Has nothing to do with the stupid movie. It's another wonderful idea, very similar to 'The Long Walk', but different somehow. A negative ending again and a pessimistic and depressive one.<br />These books are not easy to read and they are NO horror books!	2000-10-25

'High Fidelity' will remain his masterpiece for now, but 'About a Boy' comes quite close.<br />It's really different with two main characters now. Hornby is brilliant in developing characters, especially these two really unsual ones. At first a little boy who is so un-hip, he doesn't even now Kurt Cobain. And then a young man, who doesn't need to work, because he lives from his father's money. This are not quite stereotypes.<br />Hornby's style is hilariously funny, but on the other hand it's very intelligent. He comes to conclusions, you wouldn't have thought of. And he is always surprising. You never know how his books end, and it's not different here.<br />This is an absolutely wonderful book!	2000-10-24

The horror is chilling, the others are alright too and some are pretty flat. Escpecially the baseball-story is unecessary. He'd better had let this one out.

I've done a lot to get them all, since I'm from Germany and it's not that easy to get American books here. Since Quinn is, in my opinion, the most important author right now and here, I can only recommend this book to everyone (even if he/she's a Christian). Compared to Quinn's other work I think this is his best one. The issues he explains are the most interesting, the story is better than before and the speeches contain nearly everything that is need to be said. It's great written and wonderful mind-changing. You'll never be the same again. I'm not. If you look for hope for this world, read it. Maybe it's good to read 'Ishmael' first, but in the end it doesn't mind. Just read it.	2000-10-22

I know there are people who can ignore what Quinn says about the world, but mostly this book changes everything. It's impossible to think or live on as before you read it.

I don't know what this means, but it was... yes, unecessary. After I've read the book, I thought about it again and thought, well, maybe they wanted to give you something more, to make the money worth. The book doesn't really.<br />The story of a girl lost in the woods could be an interesting premise. When I read the premise before the book was pubished, I didn't jump because excitement and yelled: &quot;What a wonderful idea.&quot; It is no revolutionary idea and the book isn't too. It's interesting to read how Trisha survives in the wood and it's exciting too. You really want to know what will happen. But after two thirds I thought, well how should this book end. Since King doesn't give us anything else than the girl in the wood, what will he do to finish his book? Well, what he does in the end ruined the book for me totally. It was surely the most hilarious end from King I've ever read. It has no sense, no meaning, no whatever. It leaves you with nothing, nothing to think about, or laugh or cry. Just nothing.<br />I'm not against King writing serious novels (if you don't call horror serious), I always defended him, when someone said he's a horror-author. But books like this makes it hard for me to defend. King can do it much much much better and has done, but this one is thin, senseless and disappointing in the end. Enjoy it to the last ten pages, put it away and think about and ending yourself. Maybe this is more fun.	2000-10-22

I've read all his books, watched all the filmes, wrote essays in school about him, etc. When you read a lot of books by him, you get the feeling to know this man. This comes from his personal forewords and books like 'Danse Macabre'. He's a funny guy you think and an interesting one. So, what could be more interesting than a book he has written about himself and his writing? Well, a lot.<br />I was very excited to hear about this book and, exactly like all the other times, I ran to the bookstore and bought it, just when it was published. It's quite thin and I wondered again if this is really worth this much money. I've read it in nearly one day and was left with a feeling of confusion.<br />Alright, the stories about his life were pretty interesting and funny, although I really can't hear the 'Carrie'-legend anymore. But the part about writing is strange and boring. I write myself, you know, and was also happy to get some tips. But I really can't say he helped me. What astonishes me the most, is the fact that he neverever says: &quot;Well, that's how I do it, look for your own way.&quot; He seems to be convinced that his way is the right way. I don't think so. A notebook was always helpful to me, no matter what he says. And eight pages a day is impossible for me. And his talks about grammars, adverbs, etc. are somehow ridiculous. I mean, you should know grammar if you write, and if you don't it won't matter, I think. If you really want to be an author and want to tell a story, it will work somehow. I don't know, it's as if King wants to say there is this style and this way to do it - finito.<br />The story about his accident was interesting, but somehow unecessary. It got the book more pages, but in fact. And I wouldn't have mind to read the whole story, he starts to write. Isn't it enough, that he seems to want more and more money the older he becomes. I think so, and it makes me really sad. I liked him really and I still love most of his books. But if he won't start to write something really good soon, I can't keep my sympathy up.<br />I don't think this book is necessary for authors or King-fans. Since I'm both, I think I can say this. It's nice to read but not very helpful in any way.	2000-10-22

He says the right things in the right way and changes mostly the life of his reader forever. He did this with me and I will be thankful forever for this.<br />So, this the last one I've read from him and although it's quite thin and very fast read, it's wonderful. Especially the things he says about revolution and the homeless are very striking.<br />I can only repeat: Read every book from him and the ones he suggests. Don't be afraid. A better life awaits you.	2000-10-11
