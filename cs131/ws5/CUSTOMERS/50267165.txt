I think that after writing two reasonably standalone books in this series, Laurell K. Hamilton was about 300 pages into \\"Seduced by Moonlight\\" when she realized she was in the middle of a 3-to-4-year, 1000+ page project, so she decided to just submit whatever she had every 400 pages or so.  What she has is actually pretty good stuff, especially when viewed as erotica rather than fantasy, but it's really not complete.<br /><br />The action in this book takes place over one (magically extended) night, and ends somewhere around the middle of the night.  The action picks up very shortly after the end of \\"Seduced by Moonlight\\", and while lots of interesting things happen (mostly a whole lot of sex and magic), the plot doesn't even advance as far as the meeting with Taranis promised in the previous book.<br /><br />I see parallels between Merry's wish for more time and Ms. Hamilton's desire to stretch the plot of her books to make room for more sex scenes.  She really does write fun sex scenes, and they make it worth the ride, but I do think it's time to move the plot forward a little faster.<br /><br />We've had shadows, twilight, moonlight, and now midnight...  How many more books before dawn?  Please tell me it's just one.	2005-04-29

Hamilton's work when the Anita Blake series had about 6 books.  Up to that point, that series was all about supernatural action, violence, magic, supernatural beings, and romance (but not really sex).  Around book 9 or 10, though, the Anita Blake series took a turn towards erotica, and many feel it was a betrayal of the main character (an opinion I'm coming to agree with).<br /><br />The Merry Gentry series (which Ms. Hamilton probably-not-coincidentally around the time Anita Blake took her erotic turn, and also around the time she got married), however, has always been fantasy erotica, in the vein of some of Anne Rice's work when she was writing as Anne Rampling.  This is not a fantasy series with some sex.  It is erotica with a decent plot and a heavy dose of fantasy.<br /><br />If you approach this series with that expectation, you won't be disappointed.  You especially won't be disappointed by this latest installment, \\"Seduced by Moonlight\\".  From a plot standpoint, this book reads largely like a prelude to whatever will happen in the next book, rather than a self-contained episode.  Don't expect closure on much of anything here.<br /><br />The erotica is well executed in this book (for comparison, my reading list has taken a recent detour through Lynsey Sands and other supernatural romance authors, and I've got to say Hamilton writes a far better sex scene than just about anybody), and the magic and fantasy are as entertaining as ever.<br /><br />Bring on the next installment!	2004-08-27

They torture and eat their own offspring alive, among other things, and Kren is no exception.  Nonetheless, I really found myself rooting for Kren to succeed, and actually liked his character in many ways more than I like the human main character.<br />This book tells the story of Kren in parallel with the story of the humans' preparations for his invasion.  The human side of the equation is a bit too reminiscent of a future Conrad Stargard, but the Mitchegai story is really original, and a real winner.<br />The story ends just before the big battle is about to commence.  It reminds me a lot of Ringo's &quot;Gust Front&quot; in that (and other) ways; spending lots of time developing the villain, ending just before the action heats up, etc.  I think this is a far better book, though.<br />According to Frankowski's web site, his publisher thinks this book should be the last in the series, which would be a terrible pity.  Perhaps if the hardcover sales go well enough, they'll reconsider.	2004-06-22
US	50267165	RDN82OESLKRCO	1593301065	223419359	Kiss My Left Behind	Books	3	43	55	N	N	Too serious, too subtle, too many cliches	If I had read the Left Behind series, I might find this work to be a hysterically funny twist on the details of those books.  I haven't read the series, though, and I suspect most of those who have read the series would find this work more offensive than funny.  As a result, the &quot;in jokes&quot; for people who've read &quot;Left Behind&quot; are largely wasted, leaving a work that is far too much like my doubtless twisted notion of the thing it's parodying to be funny.<br />It also far too often descends (ascends?) into explicit rational criticism of fundamentalist theology (heck, all Christianity) and the American right in general.  Even when I mostly agree with it, rational discourse is not funny.  If you want to preach, write some nonfiction.  If you want to make a parody, let the reader supply the commentary from the situations.<br />Far too many characters were simple illustrations of various stereotypes of hypocritical religious figures, and the anti-religous arguments were too overworked to justify the book's existence as anything other than the parody it wanted to be.<br />Really, when you think about it, the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series itself could be viewed (in a &quot;Mommy Dearest&quot; sort of way) as an unintentional satire of the Book of Revelations.  A common technique in satire is to take as an ironic premise the concept that everything in the source material is absolutely true, then show the absurdity of that concept by following it to its ridiculous extreme.  For those who don't believe that the Book of Revelations is literally true, the actual Left Behind series could fit those criteria handily.<br />All of this means that for those who won't find this work too offensive to be funny, it's essentially a parody of a satire, and as such, really needs to be absurdly over the top.  &quot;Kiss My Left Behind&quot; does not deliver comedy at that level.<br />Overall, though, the book is not terrible as plain old fiction, and is much shorter than &quot;Left Behind&quot;, so I can't say I regret buying it.  I just wish it had been funnier, or at least less preachy.&quot;Left Behind&quot;, so I can't say I regret buying it.  I just wish it had been funnier, or at least less preachy.	2004-06-12

It's been bugging me for years, because I often think of the story and characters.  Today, I finally hit on the right search keywords, so now I'm going to get a used copy to replace the one that I haven't seen in years.<br />I was particularly struck by the attention to detail concerning the difficulties of being a sorcerer.  Blish started from the premise that the rituals in old grimoires were would actually work, but only if followed accurately.  The sorcerer must forge his own knife, for example...  And the whole field doesn't lend itself to experimentation, so you can never be sure which unpleasant-to-obtain ingredients are really necessary.<br />By setting the groundwork so effectively in the first part of the book, he really grabbed my attention for the subsequent rather rather wild story of the aftermath of unleashing a group of demons to do whatever they wish for one night.<br />The ending is not really what you'd expect, either.  I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone, so I won't go into detail, but I definitely would not recommend this book for someone with rigid theological views.  Blish's conclusions are a bit reminiscent of Heinlein.	2004-02-09
US	50267165	R2RVU7BK72I5QI	0425072975	596291923	Hellstar	Books	3	7	7	N	Y	Decent early work	Being a big fan of Perry's \\"Matador\\" series, I recently picked up a used copy of \\"Hellstar\\". While I enjoyed reading it, I can't really recommend it all that highly.<br />The book is set on a ship about halfway through a 50+-year journey from earth to Alpha Centauri. The ship is coasting at this point, and weight is provided by a rotating toroid. There are several subcultures specializing in things like working at the hub where there's no gravity, or working outside the ship, but there aren't any radical differences between groups. Most of the first generation crew members are still alive, so the ship still runs reasonably well, and the journey seems to be going pretty smoothly.<br />Then, of course, strange things start happening. There are weird temporary failures of basic laws of physics, escalating from subatomic particle experiments misbehaving, through failures in coriolis effects and eventually, far more serious things. The reasons for these failures are never really satisfactorily explained. There is some pseduo-physics mumbo-jumbo about macroscopic quantum effects and massless singularites, but it contains more than the usual proportion of handwavium[1].<br />The \\"science fiction\\" aspects of this story are, as a result, somewhat unsatisfactory. The description of the ship itself is good, but the \\"universe gone mad\\" eastern philosophy fusion bits really don't quite work. I've seen similar themes handled far better in many other works.<br />The real strength of the book is when it focuses on martial arts sequences or delves into Zen and the martial arts. There are major subplots involving a serial killer and political intrigue that are really the book's saving graces. Steve Perry has handled both far better in other works, however. You really can't beat his \\"Matador\\" series on that score.<br />I think Michael Reaves may be the weak point here. He was also a collaborator on \\"The Omega Cage\\", and that book also has some relatively weak science that detracts from the action. It could also be that this book was written fairly early in both authors' careers, and represents a time when they were still forming their respective styles.<br />I'd recommend this one only if you've already ready everything in the \\"Matador\\" series and are looking for something else by Steve Perry.<br />--<br />[1] Handwavium: n. 1.

The ideas are really the main characters here, and they take you on a fun ride through a well-conceived speculative vision of our future and our past.<br />That said, I have a few issues that might concern other prospective readers:<br />In these novels, James P. Hogan writes a lot like Heinlein, only with a bit more science behind his fiction. He offers a very Utopian view of the future of earth, at least where men are concerned. Where women are concerned, though... Well, again he writes a lot like Heinlein.  To be fair to Mr. Hogan, most of his later works are better on this score, but they're not under discussion here.<br />In \\"Inherit the Stars\\" (the first of the 3 novels in this edition), for example, there is only one woman mentioned by name, and she's some kind of assistant. Her biggest contribution in the few pages of the novel where she appears, is to recognize that some alien writing is probably a calendar because it's in something the \\"looks like a diary\\". That's right, he introduced a woman to recognize the diary because it's obviously a \\"woman thing\\". Her reward for her contribution is a condescending smile of acknowledgment from one of the men who did the \\"real\\" work. Ugh. He also consistently refers to women as girls.<br />The trend continues through the second novel (\\"The Gentle Giants of Ganymede\\"), though by \\"Giants' Star\\" (the last and best of the three) there are signs that Hogan has been thoroughly taken to task for his poor treatment of women in his novels, and he makes a certain amount of effort to redress the problem.  That is not to say that he fully succeeds, but at least a couple of the main characters in \\"Giants' Star\\" are women who are more than just appendages to men, and one of the villains is partly identifiable as such because of his beastly treatment of women.<br />Still, though, most of the women I know would have a great deal of difficulty enjoying the first two of the three novels because Hogan's writing is so aggressively chauvinistic in them.<br />Also, my copy of this edition had a bad binding. Pages kept falling out, till by the end, I was left with a stack of loose ages and a separate cover. I don't know whether that's just a problem with my copy, or whether the whole printing has that flaw.<br />My last complaint is that in \\"Inherit the Stars\\", the basic conclusions of the novel become blindingly obvious by about page 90, yet a massive organization of scientific geniuses then takes the next 90 pages to figure it out.<br />Hogan's vision of the future is, as I mentioned, a sort of Utopian projection of 1960s Britain. Everybody smokes (even on spaceships - at one point, everyone's having brandy and cigars after dinner on a space outpost), cheap energy and a clean version of the atomic bomb have somehow made everybody stop hating each other (though \\"Giants' Star\\" does make some effort to make that plotline more plausible), and the world has become one big happy place, apart from a few bad apples who must of course be summarily dealt with. Just go with it. It mostly worked for Gene Roddenberry, so why can't Hogan do the same?<br />If you can work past these issues, though, this some really solid \\"old school\\", almost-hard science fiction..<br />Still, though, most of the women I know would have a great deal of difficulty enjoying the first two of the three novels because Hogan's writing is so aggressively chauvinistic in them.<br />Also, my copy of this edition had a bad binding.

Both are witty takes on religion, and the messages are in some ways surprisingly similar.<br />Maybe I'm just weird (a very distinct possibility given my current reading list), but I actually got more real belly laughs out of \\"Ashes\\" than I did from \\"Principia Discordia\\", despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that \\"Dropping Ashes on the Buddha\\" is unquestionably a serious work on Zen, while \\"Principia Discordia\\" is clearly not serious, though the authors do appear to have a serious message. Seung Sahn's fascinating combination of wit and wisdom reminded me of a kind of Buddhist Groucho Marx, while the undeniably funny material in \\"Principia Discordia\\" put me more in mind of the Three Stooges. The humor's there in abundance, but the depth of the message just isn't the same.<br />Nonetheless, I'm glad I bought this book, if for no other reason than to teach me the origin of the Erisians I've read about in so many science fiction books (the \\"Illuminatus!\\" trilogy/ISBN 0440539811 and \\"The Long Run\\"/ISBN 1576466396 being my two favorites).<br />...	2002-06-27

His methods (particularly concerning the proper temperature for brewing) are the subject of much discussion, even derision, in the coffee community, because it is hard to get consistent results using his methods. That may be true, but his approach allows you to achieve near perfection about a third of the time, and decent results the rest of the time, while other methods will produce more consistent results, without ever equaling the best he can achieve.<br />If you want to get artistic about your espresso, learn some of the many variables involved, and commence your search for the perfect cup, this is the book for you.  Schomer has studied espresso making for decades, with a degree of attention to detail that borders on the fanatical, and his key conclusions are described here in detail.<br />My only complaint is that Schomer doesn't even minimally discuss his techniques for producing rosettes on top of his lattes. I've taken the pilgrimage to Vivace! a few times, and watched how it's done, but after several years of trying a couple of times a day, I'm still not able to get results as good as the people at Vivace! can.<br />I did, however, manage to coerce a few nearly-perfect cups out of my Gaggia Paros before it died, and I have this book to thank for the experience.	2002-05-17

Of course, I probably wouldn't have bought the book, either.  As it is, though, instead of learning the basics of candy making, I got about 15 pages of discussion of some techniques followed by about 90 pages of recipes.<br />Plus, about 3/4 of the recipes were just variations on the other 1/4.  The book did include recipes for a few of the basic pieces (butter, but not milk, caramel, marshmallows, and fondant, though it excluded nougat and marzipan for some reason, unless I just missed those pages), and they will be helpful to me, but they were pure recipes with no discussion of why you need to do anything.<br />For example, one recipe might say to bring a mixture to 238 degrees over medium heat while another says to do it over low heat.  Why?  What would happen if I boiled the latter over medium heat?  Why must this kind of candy be stirred constantly for 22 minutes while that kind only needs occasional stirring?  Why did she decide to add butter to the chocolate in the rocky road?  What effect does it have?  How do I control the texture of caramels?  Why add chocolate to your fudge before heating instead of after?<br />Also, the author explicitly chose to omit all recipes requiring tempered chocolate.  She included a number that call for chocolate flavored covering, though, which often left me wondering whether the chocolate flavored covering was there as a substitute for tempered choclate, or because it actually works better for the application.<br />The book also doesn't contain any information on common problems with the recipes, how to work around those problems, or even good definitions of basic terms (what exactly makes a fondant a fondant, anyway?)<br />I learned more about the basics of candy making from the sections on sugar and chocolate in &quot;On Food and Cooking&quot; (ISBN 0684843285) than I did from this book.  I am really disappointed, because this is one of the few books I've found that purports to discuss the basics of candy making in a broad sense.<br />My next read on the subject will be &quot;Candymaking&quot; (ISBN 0895863073).

Good information, OUTSTANDING presentation	If you care enough about food to be reading this review, but don't know who Alton Brown is, all I can say is, &quot;For shame!  Get thee to a cable or sattelite provider that has the Food Network, then watch every episode of Good Eats!&quot;  I'll wait till you're done...<br />Now that you know who wrote this book, I'm sure you'll understand why I pre-ordered it the second I heard it would be coming out.  As you know (you do know now, right?) Alton Brown is the &quot;Mr. Wizard&quot; of cooking.  He presents the science behind all kinds of cooking in a way that anyone can understand and enjoy.<br />&quot;I'm Just Here For the Food: Food + Heat = Cooking&quot; is the first in what will hopefully a series of books about the scientific principles underlying various recipes and cooking methods.  This book focuses almost exclusively on the various methods of applying heat to food, what they do, how they affect foods, and how to control them.  The presentation (in form and visual style) is reminiscent of a grade school textbook, but the text is light, easy to understand, and very witty.<br />Alton Brown is not a lightweight when it comes to erudition, either, but somehow the man can quote Brillat-Savarin and Greek philosophers without sounding stuffy.  I only wish Brown had been there to collaborate with Harold McGee on &quot;On Food and Cooking : The Science and Lore of the Kitchen&quot; (ISBN 0684843285, still the most comprehensive work on food science and history available), or to give style tips for &quot;The Curious Cook: More Kitchen Science and Lore&quot; (ISBN 0020098014, and a good read nonethless).  While those books may be more comprehensive and technically-oriented than this book, the style can get kind of tough to handle in those books.<br />As I have said, &quot;Food + Heat = Cooking&quot; focuses on cooking methods, rather than ingredients, which is a bit of a switch from the usual style of Brown's TV show.  He doesn't ignore the ingredients, though.  Instead, he choses to present each ingredient in the context of a method of cooking, and discuss the effects of the cooking methods on the ingredients.  It's an interesting approach, and one that results in a more recipe-oriented approach than any of the other works I've read on the science of cooking.  (I've also read &quot;The Science of Cooking&quot;/ISBN 3540674667 and &quot;The Inquisitive Cook&quot;/ISBN 0805045414).<br />In other words, this is not just a text book, it's also a cookbook.  I really admire Brown's ability to balance the two goals.<br />My only complaints are that the book could have used a bit more editing (there were several typos and some minor factual errors), and the paper stock was a bit too thick, so that I always felt like I was turning two or more pages at a time.  Minor faults, I know, but I don't want you to think I didn't try to find fault with the book.<br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the principles of cooking and how to apply them in real-life situations.ead, he choses to present each ingredient in the context of a method of cooking, and discuss the effects of the cooking methods on the ingredients.

Having slogged through &quot;On Food and Cooking&quot; (ISBN 0684843285), and having read &quot;The Science of Cooking&quot; (ISBN 3540674667), and &quot;The Curious Cook: More Kitchen Science and Lore&quot; (ISBN 0020098014), I wondered how such an obviously lightweight and short book could teach me anything.<br />I need not have worried, though.  Even though the chapters are short and the language usage is consistent with a 6th-to 8th-grade reading level, the book is highly informative.  It doesn't go into deep discussions of principles, but instead gives a simple overview of a number of processes, together with lots of short, practical examples and experiments.  I was very pleasantly surprised by how many of the things in the book covered new details on the topics I had already read about without excessively rehashing what I already knew.<br />If you really want to learn more of the science behind cooking, you might want to try one of the other books I mention above.  If you're just looking to expand your knowledge of cooking in a painless and even fun way, this is the book for you.<br />You could easily read through the whole book in one session, but it really doesn't require that kind of investment of your attention.  The chapters are short (as is the whole book), and there are lots of self-contained sidebars, so this book makes an excellent addition not only to your cooking library, but also to your bathroom magazine rack.	2002-04-12

While I certainly don't regret doing so, I am not as happy with it as I'd hoped.<br />The book contains interviews with all of the key figures in the Iron Chef world, including both the on-screen people and the behind-the-scenes people. I found these interviews very interesting and informative. The interviews alone justify the price of the book, which is a good thing, because the rest of the book is highly disappointing.<br />First, I was surprised to discover that despite the large number of photographs and the colorful cover, this is not a coffee table book, or even a normal hardcover novel, but is in fact slightly taller than a paperback and wider than a hardback. It has a really odd form factor. Perhaps this size is more common in Japan. Regardless, the size was odd, but not a terrible thing, I suppose.<br />Second, although the book lists all of the battles, ingredients, and challengers, it doesn't list who won the battles. It seems silly to leave that information out of these tables.<br />Also, the book only contains a few recipes. Dr. Hattori provides a number of \\"prestige menus\\" for various cuisines, but none of these menus include recipes or even complete listings of ingredients. The recipes that are in the book really aren't even proper recipes, since they don't give any clear indications of proportions.<br />There is a glossary of unfamiliar terms close to the back of the book (about 50 pages from the end, apparently in an effort to punish users who don't know Japanese cooking terms), but the glossary is not complete, and the book often seems to assume that just because there's an English translation for something, English speakers will know what it is. \\"Turbot\\", for example, is not defined, and I had to dig around a bit to find out it was the name of a kind of fish.<br />Also, the English edition was produced by the Food Netwok, and as a result, the discusion of the New York battle is a bit overly kind to Bobby Flay, and doesn't even mention Gordon Elliott's boorish behavior.New York battle is a bit overly kind to Bobby Flay, and doesn't even mention Gordon Elliott's boorish behavior.	2002-04-09
US	50267165	R34EEG9AIN8F53	7119016636	719242635	Journey to the West (Chinese Classics, Classic Novel in 4 Volumes)	Books	4	336	342	N	Y	All about the Monkey King, and then some	This is the most complete and faithful translation of Journey to the West I have yet found. It is the third version of the story I've read, and unlike those other versions (\\"Adventures of Monkey King\\"/ISBN 0962076511 and \\"Monkey : A Journey to the West [ABRIDGED]\\"/ISBN 1570625816), it contains the complete and unabridged story, preserving very faitflly both the style and content of the original story.<br />This extreme faithfulness is both a strength and a weakness. It's a strength in that you get a real feeling for the scope of the original work, and you get to hear all the interesting little back-stories and side-stories that make Journey to the West one of the great works of Chinese literaure. It's a weakness because these stories often seem completely irrelevant, and may be quite confusing to someone who is not familiar with Chinese culture and religion.<br />For example, every time something happens in Heaven, Hell or in the palace of the Tang Emperor, the book includes a complete list of everyone who attended. In Heaven, at least, many of the names are descriptive (names of stars, constellations, etc.) and are therefore translated. In the Tang Emperor's palace, though, you'll get a list of 10 or 20 names in Chinese, and only some of the names ever get stories attached to them in the book (and I challenge any non-Chinese speaker to remember the names when they do show up again).<br />There's also a lot of poetry, and though the translations are good, translated poetry can never equal the original. In one sequence, a fisherman and a woodsman argue in verse for 10 or more pages of very small type, frequently singing songs set to tunes few non-Chinese would recognize by name. These characters are important only in that the end of their conversation sets up a conflict, so the only purpose of the sequence is to provide a chance to read the poetry. It's good poetry, to be sure, but it really can drag a bit.<br />You can't just automatically skip over all the poems, as you might do with Tolkien, either. Elements of the story are often told in verse. You can usually skim if you're not interested in a particular bit of verse, but don't skip it entirely.<br />The structure of the work is also surprisingly complex at times, especially given its age. It will at times veer far from the main thrust of the story to recount the entire life history of a character, and has many side stories that somehow tie back into the main plot several chapters later. You may at times find yourself wondering just why the author chose to include a particular bit of story, but there's almost always a payoff waiting somewhere down the line.<br />Another problem is that the style of the storytelling is not very concise. If someone in the story needs to recount what has happened to them, you'll get a second, (fortunately much abridged) version of an earlier portion of the story, written as dialog, this time. You could make similar sorts of complaints about many of the early great works of English fiction, or probably just about any other country's older fiction, so this is not really a strong criticism given the work's great age, but I often found myself wishing the author (or the translator) had just written, \\"he told them what had happened\\" and left it at that.<br />There were also many quirks of the translation that bothered me. The word \\"memorial\\" was used throughout instead of \\"memorandum\\". It took me quite a while to figure out that was what was going on. I read all of the abridged translation that also made the same mistake throughout, but still didn't figure it out until I was several chapters into this one.<br />Will all these complaints, you're probably wondering why I gave the book 4 stars. The fact is, for all its faults and quirks, \\"Journey to the West\\" is still one of the greatest works of fiction ever written. The Monkey King is without a doubt my favorite character in any work I have ever read or watched. The story of his journey is a brilliant parable on the jouney to enlightenment, while at the same time a story of great humor and exciting action. It also provides fascinating insight into the history and traditional culture of China.<br />If you want to get the whole story and can't read Chinese, this edition is your absolute best bet. (Indeed, it's pretty much your only bet.) Some of the other translations may be a faster read, but none are as satisfying.nt parable on the jouney to enlightenment, while at the same time a story of great humor and exciting action.

US	50267165	R10VKVPW0T4AYT	0804818088	307963085	Understanding Zen	Books	5	13	14	N	N	A valuble tool for beginners	Have you ever been sitting in meditation, and suddenly realized that you don't really know why you're putting yourself through this kind of torture, or at least can't explain why in a way that really makes rational sense? If you have (as I have), you will understand just how valuable a book like this can be to anyone who is just learning how (and why) to be a Zen practitioner.<br />First, a little personal background:<br />I grew up in a generically Protestant, nearly-agnostic, nominally Christian setting. I never really had faith in what I was taught, and as I grew older, I evolved from nearly-agnostic to nearly-atheist. I didn't like the idea of completely denying the spirituality that was undeniably a part of so many people's lives, but I couldn't accept the dogma I grew up with, and nobody else's dogma appealed much to me, either.<br />I started investigating Buddhism for the shallow reasons common to most Western practitioners: I thought the Dalai Lama was cool, Buddha statues were neat, and I liked the artwork I saw. I started reading about the life of the Buddha, and about various schools of Buddhism. It was still a very uncomfortable search for me, though, because despite the fact that it looked like there really was something deeper there, all the talk of \\"emptiness\\" and \\"illusion\\" seemed more silly than the beliefs I had already rejected.<br />Then, about 7 years ago, I stumbled across \\"Understanding Zen\\".<br />The book was very easy to read, and presented its philosophical arguments in a style far lighter than most serious Western philosophical texts, but also far more direct and reasoned than most Eastern philosophical texts. It explained what Zen was about in a way that my rational mind could accept, and it allowed me to say \\"I am a Buddhist\\" without feeling like I was claiming to believe things I don't believe.<br />It helped me to grasp on a rational level the idea that thoughts and concepts, even the concept of self, are all simply tools for the conduct of life.  That, in turn, helped me release some of my attachment to these concepts, though obviously it is impossible to achieve true enlightened detachment simply by grasping a new concept.<br />As a result of reading this book, I suddenly had a rational basis I could use to goad myself into sitting and meditating when I didn't want to.  I was suddenly able to actually justify to myself, in words, the things I'd been feeling I needed to do.<br />I know that the philosophical arguments in this book are incomplete and doubtless have many epistemological flaws, but I think it's far better to talk in concrete terms about the difference between the concept of a thing and the thing itself (and the fact that even the concept that it is a thing is arbitrary) than to prattle on about the reflection of the moon on a still pond and tell people to stop looking at your finger.<br />Either approach may eventually help someone on the path to clearer understanding and even enlightenment, but the advantage of a more rational approach is that people are less likely to go off worshipping the moon and cutting off your fingers when they miss the point.<br />I found that after reading this book, I was able to approach Koans and more traditional methods of Zen teaching with a clearer mind, and to sit with one fewer concern to disturb my meditation.  You probably won't have a moment of Satori while reading this book, but if you're having difficulty reconciling rationalism with Zen, \\"Understanding Zen\\" may be a big help.uct of life.

While there were definitely a number of such entries in the book, the author too often focused on ascribing sinister motives and paranoid interpretations to perfectly ordinary photographs.<br />In one example, there's a photo with a man throwing a log onto a campfire in the background, accompanied by speculation as to whether the thing in the man's hand was really part of a dismembered body. Similar speculations accompany other innocuous photos. The speculation is well-written and reasonably funny in its own right, but Lileks was definitely reaching when he tried to tie the text back to the source material.<br />There were definitely a lot of examples of the kind of food the title promises (weird things involving Jell-O and lots of MSG), but I felt much of the book was padded out with things that didn't quite fit, and a good portion of the humor was working a bit too hard to try to stretch whatever laughs the source material was good for.<br />I definitely think this book was funny, but like most high-concept pieces, it wasn't really satisfying.	2002-01-14

The book tells the origin of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; effectively, if very sketchily.  It is presented in comic book (or maybe graphic novel) format, and the artwork is solid, standard, comic book style art.<br />Although the book is supposed to be targeted for children 4-8 years old, I'd narrow that range to 6-8.  Your average first grader will have a bit of difficulty with many of the words.<br />The strongest recommendation I can make for this book is that my son read the entire book on his own initiative without any prompting or encouragment from us.  That was the first time he ever read a book completely on his own, so needless to say, I'm thrilled.	2002-01-11

I am currently reading it to my 7-year-old (I read it by myself a while ago), and while the vocabulary is definitely a stretch (I have to explain 4 or 5 words on most pages), he's really loving it. The story has all the appeal of a Martial Arts novel, The Wizard of Oz, and a Buddhist philosophical treatise blended into a thoroughly entertaining tale for all ages.<br />I previously read &quot;Adventures of Monkey King&quot; (ISBN 0962076511) to my son, and while the language was much more appropriate for a young child, the story was overly abridged, and a lot of the detail that makes the story fun and interesting was lost.<br />This edition tells the beginning and the end of the story very well, but leaves out all of the middle episodes between finding the dragon horse, Pigsy, and Sandy and getting to the mountain of fire.  As a result, Pigsy and Sandy are a bit under-developed, but the Monkey King definitely gets a real chance to shine, and you do get a decent feel for Pigsy and Tripitaka, at least.  I kind of appreciate that they left the whole middle section out instead of picking random stories, because that makes it easier to go back to the full version of the story (&quot;Journey to the West (4-Volume Boxed Set)&quot;, ISBN 7119016636), and fill in the missing stories if you want to.<br />The way it's told here, the actual journey itself is the smallest part of the story.  It's all about setting up the characters and reaching Inda.  In the full-length version, the story is mostly about the journey, and how it changes the characters.<br />This version is very good for those who want to get the flavor of the characters and &quot;find out what happens&quot;, but the full version is best for those who really just want to enjoy reading about the Monkey King doing what he does best, and aren't anxious for it to end.  Be warned, though, the full version can drag a bit if you're hoping to actually see the plot move along.<br />I have heard that the book &quot;Monkey/Folk Novel of China&quot; (ISBN 0802130860) best captures the comedic aspects of the story, so that will be my next purchase.<br />The British (well, really, Chinese via Japan) TV series &quot;Monkey&quot; is also based on this story. I discovered that it has recently been released on DVD in Australia, and that a British release is coming that will include the 13 previously unaired Japanese episodes (with subtitles). As the series was never aired in America, I may need to buy a PAL DVD player to watch it, so that's what I plan to do. The story is that good.o end.

He's progressing very well now, though, so I've been looking for books that are a bit more advanced, closer to third grade level than what he's been reading.  He also has a typical interest in super heroes, and this book turned out to be an excellent way to help him develop his reading skills in a fun way.<br />The artwork in the book is outstanding, and the storytelling doesn't pull any punches on the Batman origin story.  It's not overly explicit about Bruce Wayne's parents getting shot, but it does have his parents going into an alley with him, getting shot &quot;off camera&quot;, so to speak, and Bruce being left alone, and terrified of the dark as a result.  The balance of the book is about him overcoming his fear of the dark with the help of the bat cave.<br />If you have a very sensitive child, the plot might be a bit traumatic, but I think most boys of the age this story is aimed at will have no difficulty enjoying it.  If you're looking for a less dark story with a similar level of kid appeal, consider &quot;Superman's First Flight&quot; (ISBN 0439095506).	2001-12-27

This book turned out to be perfect on that score.<br />The vocabulary is simple enough that my son could read most of it without help, but it introduced several words that he needed some coaching on.  As a result, it served both as a way to increase his confidence in his own ability to read and as a way to teach him a few new words.  Also, any book about Superman is bound to be of interest to a 7 year old boy, so he really wanted to read it.<br />The artwork in the book reminds me of the early-mid '90s animated TV series.  The plot, while not entirely consistent with most of the other &quot;Superman coming into his powers&quot; stories, was not so different as to bother any but the most die hard detail-oriented Superman fan.  The main difference from other versions of the story is that young (teenage) Clark has no idea that he has any super powers at all, and suddenly comes into most of them all at once.	2001-12-27

By reading about 20 pages of this book, I learned almost everything I now know about truffles. Of course, that leaves another 268 pages in which I learned essentially nothing.  There are some interesting bit of truffle history and trivia interspered throughout the book, actually, but they're well hidden among the photos and recipes.<br />The book is certainly beautiful, with lots of artistic photographs and recipes you might consider following the next time you want to spend a lot of money on a single dish.  I would advise you, though, to buy some truffle oil to give you an idea of what truffles taste like, then let your imagination wander as to how they'd taste with various other foods. You'll probably come up with recipes at least as good.<br />If you're looking for a pretty and pretentious (though novel-shaped) coffee table book, though, this one is definitely a good choice.	2001-12-19

While it's not what I was hoping to find, it is the most interesting of the books I've read so far.<br />McGee's earlier book, &quot;On Food and Cooking&quot; (ISBN 0684843285), attempted to be encyclopedic in its coverage of food topics, hitting on every ingedient from a historical and scientific perspective. As a result (for me, anyway), it failed to be fully satisfactory on both counts. This book makes no such pretense, and is much the better for it.<br />From the earliest chapters, discussing the effects of searing and various temperatures on meat (did you know you could kill trichinella by keeping pork below 5 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 weeks?), I knew that I was in for a much more interesting and lively read this time around. There is a lot of interesting, new and useful information in this book, though the information doesn't always necessarily satisfy all 3 criteria at once.<br />The second chapter, for example, covers the topic of why oil collects on the inside of your glasses when you cook. The actual reason turns out to be fairly pedestrian, but the story of his experimentation (including a rather tongue-in-cheek diagram of several pairs of glasses propped on inverted bowls around a frying pan) was fun to read.<br />The topics in the book were chosen more-or-less at random, consisting of free-form explorations of topics including how to force persimmons to ripen, just how little egg you can get away with in mayonnaise, the truth (such as it is) about food, cancer, and heart disease, and various thoughts about what makes things taste good.  The chapters on sauces were in general very well done, and I like the fact that McGee spent significant time discussing strategies for defeatng salmonella in egg-based sauces.<br />The only word of warning I have to offer is that McGee's writing style tends toward the sesquipedalian (and if you don't feel comfortable with words like &quot;sesquipedalian&quot;, you'll probably find the book a bit hard to read).

Being unable to find that series on DVD (or VHS, for that matter), I decided to buy this book to read to my son.<br />The book does an excellent job of introducing the character of the Monkey King, and tells the portions of the story that it covers well, and on a level comprehensible to children.  It is hugely abridged, however, and ends only partway through the original story, with no attempts to tie up loose ends.<br />As a result, my son wasn't really satisfied with the open-ended plot, and there also weren't enough of the little subplots with the interesting secondary characters to make the book as memorable as it really should be.  The book would have been a solid 4 or maybe 5 stars if it had just gone on a bit longer, either to bring the story to something resembling a conclusion, or to explain why there wasn't such an ending in a way as accessible to children as the rest of the book was.

I haven't found one that's right for him to read yet, but this version is excellent for me to read to him. The first one edition I read was the Bullseye &quot;Step into Classics&quot; edition, and this edition is the second children's edition I've read.<br />The chapters are short (as is the whole book), but the author takes the time to include the elements of feasting and fighting that mark the older, more adult versions of the tale. The language is more complex than the Bullseye edition, but not by too much, and the language has a bit more of the &quot;Olde England&quot; feel I'm used to without going so far as to use archaic words. There's no smiting of pates here, I'm afraid. I'm torn between missing the archaic style and being glad I don't have to explain every other word to my son.<br />Robin Hood comes off as having a nasty temper, which I suppose he always did, but other versions usually have a bit more build-up before he goes wild. In order to keep the pace fast, the author omits some of the process of Robin getting mad, so he often seems a bit mean.<br />This book does a bit better than the Bullseye edition as far as telling how the men joined the band, giving better detail on the origin of Robin Hood himself and how Friar Tuck joined the band. It also tells the story of Alan a' Dale with more detail, and gives much better background on Maid Marian and her father. The other members of the band are explained as having been there from the beginning (in this story, an existing band saves Robin from the Sheriff, and Robin comes to lead them.)<br />The biggest weakness in this edition is that Prince John is virtually absent from the story, and King Richard never comes back to pardon everyone.  There are several bits where the sherrif goes to see &quot;the king,&quot; and the king he talks to seems a decent sort of fellow.  Without a properly evil ruler, it's harder to understand why the people love Robin Hood so much.<br />Overall, I'd say this edition is a good compromise between being comprehensive and remaining accessible to children. I'd estimate it's at about a 3rd-4th grade reading level, but should be fine for reading to children as young as 6.properly evil ruler, it's harder to understand why the people love Robin Hood so much.<br />Overall, I'd say this edition is a good compromise between being comprehensive and remaining accessible to children.

I'm not a food chemist, though, and I was hoping for something that would actually educate me about some processes I don't understand very well.  This book does not succeed on that score.<br />&quot;Food Chemistry&quot; makes little effort to actually teach the subjects it covers.  All of the text has a very passive tone, describing chemical reactions and physical structures of food in a very disjointed way, such that there's never any real indication of why they're telling you anything.  This weakness may be a result of translation from German, but somehow, I suspect this book was equally dry in the original.<br />Huge sections of the book are devoted to simply listing chelating agents, enzymes, lipids, etc., with a description of the chemical reactions each is involved in, but there is really no indication anywhere of why anybody should care about such things.<br />There is enough text to indicate that &quot;Food Chemistry&quot; is actually intended to be used as a textbook, but unless you already have a very thorough grounding in the principles of food chemistry, you won't be able to make much sense of it.  Even if you actually do have sufficient background to make sense of the book, you probably don't need another textbook like this one.  You may, however, find it quite useful for reference, or for filling in obscure details of chemical processes you already mostly understand.<br />Unless you regularly engage in food-related industrial or research chemistry, though, you will find this book almost completely useless.	2001-11-28

The vocabulary is simple, the sentences are short (and often start with the word &quot;and&quot;; my grade school teachers would be appalled), but the tale is told effectively and accessibly for young readers.<br />Also, unlike some other books for young readers (e.g. the Droon series), this book does not simplify to the point of eliminating all of the descriptive passages. When Robin disguises himself as a musician, he wears &quot;feathers of many colors&quot; and carries a harp. There's not enough description to interfere with the pace for impatient children, but there is enough detail to hang your imagination off of.<br />As for the story, there were some frustrating omissions. The origin of Robin Hood is given only a few paragraphs in the introduction, and the tales of how Will Scarlet and Friar Tuck joined the band are missing. The book only tells how Little John joined. The rest just sort of show up later in the story. I'm sure that was done to keep the pace of the story moving, but it would have been good to have more of the stories written in this same style.<br />The rest of the story is a reasonably solid narration of the traditional tale of Robin Hood, with no more than the usual level of variation. I definitely recommend this book as a good way to introduce children to the story of Robin Hood, though I like the Dover Children's Thrift Classics edition slightly better.	2001-11-27

Those who are disappointed with the extreme level of sex in this book really haven't been paying close enough attention to what this series is about.  The Anita Blake series has always been about (in no particuar order) sex, violence, and monsters.  More specifically, the series has been about Anita's evolving attitudes towards the three.<br />At first, she was a chaste re-animator who occasionally got involved in traumatic, violent situations.  Monsters were monsters, violence was bad, but necessary sometimes, and premarital sex was a big &quot;no can do&quot;.<br />Over the course of the series before this book, she's fallen in love with a werewolf and a vampire, slept with both (though not at the same time) ceased to be bothered by violence, and cut way back on the re-animating gig.  Yes, she's barely recognizable as the woman she was at the beginning of the series, but the changes have not been sudden or unjustified.<br />Over the last few books, she's been fighting the inevitable step of coming to an arrangement that works with both her lovers.  She's concluded she can't ignore the situation any longer, and decided to try to make a three-way relationship work.<br />At the beginning of &quot;Narcissus in Chains&quot;, she decides to go ahead and take that next step.  Doing so, however, saddles her with &quot;the ardeur&quot;, a strong form of vampiric lust that ends up causing her to move several steps further down the whole unconventional sex road than she'd planned.<br />Ms. Hamilton describes the whole process with a level of detail that brings to mind (Anne Rice's) &quot;Exit to Eden&quot; more than &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot;.  Yes, &quot;the ardeur&quot; is a somewhat contrived plot element intended to allow Anita to change more rapidly in the sexual morality department, but that's definitely the way she's been heading for a while, and something was bound to happen to persuade her to expand her horizons.<br />I, for one, am quite impressed with Laurell Hamilton's ability to hold me enthralled for 10 novels in a single series.  This novel created an opportunity to explore sides of Anita Blake that she has repressed so far, and that may be suppressed again, if &quot;the ardeur&quot; fades as she's indicated it might.  The action isn't as strong here as in most of the other novels, but the substitution of erotica for some of the violence is not necessarily a bad thing.<br />Anita's atittudes toward killing have changed substantially over the series.  Now, her attitudes toward sex are changing in similar ways.  Granted, the changes are happening more rapidly, but really, I'm amazed that anyone who's followed the series this far is bothered by it.  If the series continues, I'm sure we'll hit the point where Anita-from-book-1 would look at Anita-from-book-12 and se nothing but a homicidal nymphomaniacal monster-lover.  We, however, will have seen how she got there, and hopefully understand that that is not really what she is.Laurell Hamilton's ability to hold me enthralled for 10 novels in a single series.

US	50267165	RCUXHYY8TMM27	3540674667	501249147	The Science of Cooking	Books	4	310	322	N	Y	Gets right to the science with little digression	I recently purchased &quot;On Food and Cooking&quot;, hoping to find a good, comprehensive book on food science. While there was a lot of good detail in that book, much of the detail was buried among less interesting historical digressions, and the space taken up by those digressions seemed to be depriving me of some details I really did care about.<br /><br />In contrast, &quot;The Science of Cooking&quot; makes no pretense of being encyclopedic in its coverage of food science. Instead, the focus is directly on the chemical and physical processes at work in the kitchen. As such, it succeeds admirably, and much of the information that seemed &quot;missing&quot; from &quot;On Food and Cooking&quot; here seems simply absent because it is outside the scope of the work.<br /><br />While the introductory material gets a little condescending at times (I mean, who actually needs to be told what an atom is?), and some of the sidebars get overly technical for most people (do you really care about differential equations?), such sections are easily ignored. The few really queasy technical discussions are even set in a different background color to let you know they may not be for the faint-of-heart (and the rest of those colored sidebars are quite readable and interesting on their own).<br /><br />Be aware that the author is a scientist, not a chef.  This book is tightly focused on chemical and physical effects of ingredients.  Things like flavor and food safety are not part of the discussion, beyond a few passing mentions.  Most notably, the author repeatedly demonstrates a lack of understanding of the effects of salt on flavor, and talks of things like clarifying cold stocks with raw egg whites without a discussion of slmonella (which is admittedly perceived as less of a problem in the author's native Britain).<br /><br />The book is organized like a textbook, with sidebars, tables, and even little experiments at the end of each chapter. There are useful conversion tables, and charts on various topics. It is easy to skip over what you find uninteresting and to skip directly to the information you need when using the book for reference.<br /><br />The information here is valuable, concise, and well-presented. You'll find yourself understanding things like the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats (and why you should care as a cook), how foams form (and why they collapse), why and how cooking affects flavor and texture, etc.<br /><br />I was able to read through this book very quickly and easily, while learning (and even retaining) more information than I normally would from a non-fiction book of this sort. This book is definitely an excellent overview of the processes involved in cooking, and indeed, probably contains as much information as most of us are ever likely to use on the subject.<br />Why 4 stars and not 5, you ask? There are some important omissions that bothered me. The most glaring examples are that there's no discussion of osmotic pressure, or the role of pH in various processes, topics that &quot;On Food and Cooking&quot; covered admirably. The section on cooking utensils and appliances is largely a waste of space, in part because the author is British and doesn't have access to many of the alternatives that have become common in serious American kitchens. Be warned, the book is very British in its use of language. You will need to know that &quot;hob&quot; is a British English for &quot;stove&quot;, for example.  Also, all of the recipes use metric weights and volumes, so should you actually wish to follow them (not something I'd particularly recommend), you'll need an accurate metric food scale and measuring cups.s on various topics.

As such, I have to recommend it more highly, simply because you're not going to get the same infomation in any other single book.  Be prepared to work hard for the knowledge, however.<br />&quot;On Food and Cooking&quot; is a very comprehensive work that contains a lot of very useful and interesting information. It also contains a lot of less useful information, random historical musings, and general digressions. As a result, the useful/interesting information density is much lower than I'd like, particularly given the general &quot;verbiage density&quot; of the text. Perhaps part of the problem is that I've gleaned too much of the information already from other sources, so that I feel like I'm wading through a lot of common knowledge to get to the bits I care about.<br />The book goes into a fair amount of historical detail about various ingredients. It doesn't focus on the historical aspects enough to be a &quot;history of food&quot; book, though, and the historical perspective tends to detract from the scientific content ratio simply by increasing the overall amount of text.<br />Also, there are many variations on ingredients, food safety issues, etc., that were not considered significant in 1983, but which are more relevant today. There's no discussion of salmonella in the section on eggs, for example, and no discussion of things like the impact (or lack thereof) of RBGH on milk quality. The effects of organic methods in general are given short shrift. I have observed various quality differences in organic ingredients relative to more conventional ingredients (both for better and for worse), and had hoped for some quantitative discussion of what the physical differences are, and why.<br />Compared to &quot;The Science of Cooking&quot; (my most recent read on the topic), this book doesn't cover some of the physics and organic chemistry as well, but it does go into better detail on some of the more biologically oriented topics. For example, osmotic pressure, the process by which salt and sugar preserve food, is covered fairly well in this book, while it is never directly mentioned in &quot;The Science of Cooking&quot;.<br />I also wish there had been better organization of the material in the book. &quot;The Science of Cooking&quot;, for example, is organized like a textbook, with well-marked side bars and tables, allowing you to easily skip to (or over) information that may or may not be relevant. &quot;On Food and Cooking&quot;, however, is organized more like a novel, making it difficult to use it for reference, and complicating efforts to skip over material that is not of interest.<br />Also, some sections (for example the discussion of cheese) assume too much knowledge about the basic processes, making it sometimes challenging to correlate the underlying chemistry with actual kitchen mechanics. In general, the book has very few examples of &quot;kitchen experiments&quot; you can try yourself to develop an integrated sense of the qualitative and quantitative aspects of cooking. There are many discussions, for example, of the effects of pH on various processes, but little discussion of ways to manipulate the pH using different ingredients to help balance flavor against the needs of the chemical processes.<br />I still haven't found the ideal source for this sort of information. &quot;The Science of Cooking&quot; is at least concise and very clear in what it does cover (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3), but as I look back and compare it to &quot;On Food and Cooking&quot; again, I see some of the major holes in that book (which doesn't deal with the role of pH in cooking at all, for example).

US	50267165	R2LL9N3CVF4MBF	0195903234	302838456	The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	Also on DVD	The film adaptation of &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; is called &quot;Royal Tramp&quot; 1 &amp; 2 (part 1 is ASIN 6305052212, part 2 says it's ASIN B00000INCR, but I'm not sure that's it). The film is perhaps the best of many excellent adaptations of Louis Cha's work, and while the adaptation is not completely faithful to the book, it does an excellent job of preserving the humor and the spirit of the original.<br />Like the film, the book is divided into relatively arbitrary sections. The end of volume 1 of &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; is pretty clearly just the end of a chapter chosen as an arbitrary breaking point. Plan on buying all three volumes.<br />Despite the fact that he hasn't written any martial arts fiction in almost half a century, Louis Cha is the author behind many of the best films made in Hong Kong in the last fifteen years. Ever since I first heard of Louis Cha, I've been hoping someone would translate his works (a year of Mandarin in college just won't cut it for reading the original).  The only other translation of his work I've found is &quot;Fox Volant of Snowy Mountain&quot; (ISBN 9622017339), which was a mediocre translation of one of Cha's weakest works.<br />I was, therefore, happy to discover that &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; (at least the part I've read so far) lives up to all my hopes and expectations, and look forward to reading the third volume of the translation, and also any other translations Mr. Minford may make of Louis Cha's work in the future.	2001-07-24

I'd like to start out by saying that I enjoyed the entire Black Jewels trilogy.  The setting is certainly interesting, and certainly pretty dark.  The characters are engaging, well-rounded, and, for the most part, quite likable.<br />It's that last part, though, that annoys me a bit.  Here you have three powerful male characters that rarely or never see each other, with ample opportunities for tragic misunderstandings causing them to harm each other until some great redemption comes together, but instead, every time the author sets up some kind of tension that could escalate, she resolves it at the earliest opportunity.<br />Even the tragic-looking situation at the end of this first novel gets resolved in the first third of the second novel.  The ease with which the evil plots of Dorothea and Hekatah were dispatched left me feeling like I was reading a book based on a Saturday morning cartoon, where everything has to be resolved within a half-hour window, and none of the characters you care about are allowed to die.<br />Don't get me wrong.  I like the &quot;love conquers all&quot; theme running through the books, and I do like the world and the characters, but I really wish I'd been given more opportunity to worry about them before things turned out well.	2001-07-20

It follows a prisoner in the Confed's most  secure prison (called, not surprisingly, the Omega Cage).  With the help of  the warden's albino sex slave, he escapes the prison and makes his way off  planet using some interesting alien technology.<br />The pace of the novel is  reasonably fast, but because of the prison setting, much of the action is  not as brisk as most of Perry's novels.	2000-05-22

Nobody does martial arts/action/sci-fi novels better than Steve Perry, and even when he's not at his best, his work is still well worth reading.  This book does a good job of adding more human depth to the excessively-muscled  Bork of the other Matador novels.<br />The story focuses on Bork's life, his history with his father, and his search for a sense of self-worth as he encounters an opponent who might finally be able to beat his physical strength....  Of course, you're probably not looking for introspection when you read a Matador novel, so you may feel the angst detracts from the action.  I know I did.<br />For more background to some of the more  obscure references in the novel, see if you can track down the Omega Cage.	2000-05-22

Her protagonist, Jaana, is convincingly written as a woman born in a primitive  society trying to manage contact with advanced technology from earth and  the people who bring it.<br />The problem is that the entire book is little  more than a description of life on a planet without a lot of native  technology.  The story, such as it is, is told in the first person from the  perspective of Janna, a woman who is not really prone to introspection and  has a tendancy to flee anyplace that might give her more insight into her  own nature.<br />Near the end of the book, Jaana starts to make a kind of  connection to the wold around her, but she never really does.  The book  ends with the same kind of &quot;when's the sequel coming?&quot; ending as  China Mountain Zhang, but unlike that oustanding book, I can't see any  evidence that a sequel would have much more of interest to say.<br />Reading  this book reminded me in some ways of reading the first book in the Thomas  Covenant series.  The main character was an idiot at the start, and made it  through the whole book without quite ceasing to be an idiot.  Unlike Lord  Foul's Bane, however, Mission Child doesn't have a lot of cool secondary  characters that make it worth reading.<br />In short, the plot is relevant  only as an opportunity for character development, but the main character  steadfastly refuses to change.  As a result, the book is weak both on plot  and on character development.  The reason it gets two stars from me is that  McHugh has created an excellent backdrop for a character who has some  interesting attributes.  I only wish there had been some coherent plot to  the whole thing, or some real development of the main character.	2000-05-12
US	50267165	R33ELKH29WK70Q	0345327004	87526254	World Enough & Time	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Very innovative take on the fantasy genre	I recently read &quot;A Plague of Angels&quot; by Sheri S. Tepper, and was struck by the many similarities between the way Tepper integrated fantasy into science, and Kahn's work in this book and its sequel, &quot;Time's Dark Laughter&quot;. Given that this work precedes Tepper's by at least a decade, it seems likely that Tepper was inspired by Kahn's work, though it's certainly possible she came upon the idea independently.<br />Kahn introduces many interesting forms of modified humans and genetically-engineered fantastic beings living in a post-technological world. There are engineered vampires, who generally live peacefully with large harems of humans; centaurs; and &quot;neuromans&quot;, cyborgs who have replaced all their body parts and fluids with synthetic materials. The &quot;neuromans&quot; chose to modify their brains also, with different groups enhancing different personality traits to become ultimate hedonists, philosophers, warriors, etc.<br />If you enjoyed &quot;Angels&quot;, you will enjoy the &quot;Time&quot; books, assuming you can find them, of course. If you didn't enjoy &quot;Angels&quot;, or didn't read it, try to track these books down for a well-written tale of science as fantasy.	2000-05-04

The combination of science fiction and fantasy elements is effectively done, and the characters are entertaining even though rarely fully-developed.  The book's weaknesses would have been easily forgivable if the premise had  been as new to me as it was to some of the other reviewers, but for me, it  was not breaking new ground.<br />In the early '80s, I read two books by James  Kahn, &quot;World Enough and Time&quot;, and &quot;Time's Dark  Laughter&quot;.  These works similarly follow a post-technological world  moving back into the realm of myth and legend, but do so far more  effectively.  It is possible that the main difference is that my standards  have changed over the last 20 years, but I sincerely believe that those  earlier works were far better developed than &quot;A Plague of  Angels.&quot;  If you are familiar with Kahn's work, you may be  disappointed by this book, but still, it is an enjoyable read.	2000-05-04
