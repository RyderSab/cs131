Naturally, you must know the product (you) and the customer (school/admissions committee).<br />2) Know yourself.  Determine your positioning statement first.  What is the major theme that will pervade your application?  What makes you different from the other 10,000+ Harvard applicants?  <br />3) Know the school.  Learn as much as you can about the schools.  Each of them has a different market position and culture.  You have to get past the information on the website or else you will bore the admissions committee to sleep.  Visit the schools and talk to alumni.<br />4) Good tips on writing: keep it simple, write colorfully, edit mercilessly.  (chapter 7)<br />5) 42 pages of essays, but if you want to see a lot of essays, read Richard Montauk's HOW TO GET INTO THE TOP MBA PROGRAMS (over 90 essays from 30 different people).<br />As other reviewers mentioned, this book is not a bad place to start, but it is terribly outdated - no mention of the internet.	2003-03-27

Ogilvy's wisdom is only matched by his wit.  Some takeaways:<br />1) \\"The wrong advertising can actually reduce the sales of a product\\" (pg 9)<br />2) \\"If you are lucky enough to write a good advertisement, repeat it until it stops selling.\\" (pg 19)<br />3) \\"If it does not sell, it is not creative.\\" (pg 24)<br />4) Hire \\"gentlemen with brains.\\" (pg 48)<br />5) Communicate verbally.  Attend the right meetings.  Remember the French saying, \\"He who is absent is always wrong.\\" (pg 56)<br />6) \\"Any fool can write bad advertising, but it takes a genius to keep his hands off a good one.\\" (pg 67)<br />7) People read headlines 5 times as often as they read the body.  People remember ads with news 22% more than ads without news.  (pg 71)<br />8) Ads in four colors cost 50% more, but are 100% more memorable. (pg 79)<br />9) In TV ads, use the name it the first 10 seconds.  Show the package.  <br />10) Learn from P&G:  They are disciplined.  They only enter categories they think will grow.  They have multiple brands that compete against each other.  They invest heavily to launch a brand.  They never change a successful strategy.  60% of the ads show a demonstration.  They communciate the name of the products repeatedly.  The names fo the products are easy and simple.  They don't use celebrities. (pg 155)	2003-03-20

Many of these books cover the same content, but the format and the writing is very straight-foward.  I recommend it for people who have time constraints.  A few tips:<br />1) Submit applications to lesser schools first - It gives you practice writing your essays. (pg 11)<br />2) Build your application around a theme - Create a vivid and distinct picture of yourself.  You want the application to be personal enough that the AdCom could even make a nickname for you. (pg 12)<br />3) When writing a \\"Why MBA\\" essay, think more in terms of what you can do with an MBA, rather than what an MBA can do for you.  (pg 49)<br />4) For resume, quantify work-related accomplishments (pg 132)<br />** If you have the time, I would recommend \\"How to Get Into the Top MBA Programs\\" by Richard Montauk.  It only costs $ and has over 50 sample essays (170 pages worth) from thiry different people.  It shows how you can meld the different essays into a three-dimensional picture of who you are professionally, academically and personally. <br />Good luck, and hope you get into the B school you want!	2003-03-18

This is true for money (20% of people have 80% of the wealth), crime (20% of criminals commit 80% of crimes), energy usage (15% of population uses 85% of energy), competition (20% of suppliers have 80% of market share)and even carpet (20% gets 80% wear and tear). . . <br />In a non-linear world: <br />1) Celebrate exceptional productivity . . .look for the short cut. . .be selective. . . only do what you do best.

It outlines some practical steps to <BR>gather information, motivate teams, think proactively, market services and ensure customer satisfaction.  Although many of the ideas are common sense, I recommend this book strongly for people who are paid to solve problems.  Some highlights:<br />1) After gathering the relevant facts, segregate the issues so they are MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive).  This will help make sense of the chaotic data and help clarify the problem.  (pg 10)  In fact, sometimes the problem that the client brings you is not even the real problem.<br />2) Use hypotheses and analysis frameworks (Porter's five forces etc...) but do not fall in love with your original hypothesis.  <br />3) Consulting work is not in a vacuum.  Be aware of the internal politics and remember that a good recommendation is one that can realistically be implemented.<br />4) To increase the customer's ROI, focus on the main problems (80/20 principle) and stop analyzing when you have the answer or you see diminishing marginal returns.  As the author quaintly put it, \\"Don't boil the ocean.\\" (pg 32) <br />There are many others, but let's not spoil the book.   ;)	2003-01-20

It is basically in two parts - his journey with writing and advice for writers.  It is very readable and quite funny.  Although this is a hack way to simply this book, a few points:<br />1) Writing is like a fossil.  The skill of writing is comparable to an archeologist's skill in unearthing the fossil without damaging it.<br />2) Read a lot and write a lot.  There are no shortcuts.<br />3) Create truthful characters and exciting situations and let them lead your writing.  Plot will develop itself.<br />4) The writer and the reader meet halfway.  As a writer, set the stage and call the reader to you.<br />5) It's always about the story.<br />6) Show don't tell.<br />7) Write until it the book is finished without sharing it with others.  Then take two weeks off to digest and reassess.  Then edit mercilessly and take 10% out.	2003-01-08

My score went from 620 to 670 to 710.  I believe that practice really helps and recommend the following GMAT books:  <br />1) Kaplan GMAT 2003 (Book & CD-ROM for Windows)<BR>2) Barron's How to Prepare for the GMAT with CD-ROM<br />This book is a little different from the others.  It focuses on the psychology of the test makers and how to mentally prepare and choose between the different answers.  Here are some of the points they were making:<br />1) Since the CAT is adaptive, you can out-psyche the test makers if you know the difficulty of the questions.  Therefore, you should practice and analyze your current scoring level and adjust your Procees of Elimination (POE) tactics accordingly.  Example: If you are a high scorer - you will consistently get difficult problems - and should assume that the obvious straightforward answer is probably a trap.  If you are a low-scorer, then the obvious answer might be right.<br />2) With problem solving, make sure you are answering the right questions (units, ratios etc. . .)<br />3) With problem solving, work backwards by plugging in the answers.  Start with C (since the answers are in ascending order) and adjust accordingly.<br />4) For data sufficiency, the answers will fall into two groups: AD or BCE.  This routine is important to speed your reaction time during the test.<br />5) For sentence correction, do not rely on your ear.  Find the mistake (if there is one) and just find the correct alternative.  <br />6) For critical reasoning, pick unadventurous answers.  Since ETS does not want to be challenged (any more than necessary) for their choice of answers, the correct answers will be middle-of-the-road.  Be wary of answers that use words like ALWAYS, NEVER, MUST,EVERYBODY, ABSOLUTELY, ALL etc. . .  In short, \\"ETS rewards narrow thinking.\\" (pg 245)<br />7) For writing assessment, write as much as you can.<br />8) Warning, this book does not have a lot of practice questions.  Barron's has the most # of questions.<br />9) Definitely log onto the Princeton site for applications.  It is the best system.  No need for paper applications.	2003-01-03

This is that story.  It addresses the personalities and culture that drives Goldman to success.  For anyone interested in the financial markets, it is a joy to read.  Some things I did not know:<br />1) GS focuses on the client and maintains a long-term focus.  Long-term greed.<br />2) During the 1980's, GS set itself apart from its competitors when they refused to represent any company that was the aggressor in a hostile takeover.  As such, they billed enormous business as a \\"defense\\" investment bank.  (pg 19)<br />3) \\"You cannot just be an employee.  The firm demands that you be a contributor.\\" (pg 21)<br />4) There is a culture of understatement.  \\"A mild shabbiness seems to be almost a status symbol.\\" (pg 25) The main office does not say Goldman Sachs on the front.  It just reads the first two numbers of the address:  85.<br />5) GS started out as a family firm specializing in commercial paper.  By the 1960's, it was handling 50% of the country's commercial paper. (pg 34)<br />6) GS was almost ruined when it was involved in the speculating leading up to the crash of 1929.  The investors lost 92% of their investment in the infamous GSTC investment trust.<br />7) Sidney Weinberg is considered the father of modern Goldman Sachs.  (pg 49) He worked at Goldman for more than 50 years and started out as a helper to the porter: cleaning shoes, and brushing hats.<br />8) Gus Levy became the next senior partner in 1969.  Levy was from trading, not banking, and would \\"prepare the company for the trading-oriented work of the 1980's.\\" (pg 63)<br />9) The next leadership was in teams: John Weinberg & John Whitehead, then Steve Friedman & Robert Rubin, then Hank Paulson & John Corzine.  <br />10) In the 1980's, the profit centers were M&A and arbitrage.<br />11) Historically, GS was known for its excellent people, but not its innovation.  One JP Morganbanker said that GS bankers were incredibly good, but predictable.<br />12) Partners were making incredible money in the 1990's, but naturally the competition was fierce: 4000 Vice presidents competing for 32 partner seats. (pg 135) <br />13) Numerous stories of GS's great traders (Becerra, O'Brien etc...) and how they would make $80 million in trading profits one month, then lose $100 million just one month later.  At times, the speculation would get out of hand.  One person commented that GS's London trading desk was \\"testosterone alley.\\" (pg 192)<br />14) In early 1994, the firm was in a crisis.  Its top management had stepped down and the company was losing $200 million a month due to heavy trading losses and a bear market.   (pg 202)<br />15) GS invented, and still dominates, the block trading market.  Great story: Kuwaiti Investment Office (KIO) gives three investment banks one hour to price $2 billion of British Petroleum (BP) stock.  GS wins the bids, transacts the stock smoothly and gains a reputation as the firm able to handle block trades. (pg 248)<br />16) Paulson said, \\"Good firms worry about competition, great companies worry about clients\\" (pg 250)	2002-12-25

After you read this book, you will want to board a plane for Xian.<br />1) First, the dynasties in chronological order: Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Lio, Jin, Yuan, Ming, Qing.<br />2) Zhou (770-240BC) is an era of constant warfare and power struggles.  Confucius and Lao-tzu (creator of Daoism) are born during this period.  Their writings have an enormous impact on Eastern thought and governance. The famous terracotta warrors also date back to Zhou.<br />3) Qin (221-206BC) and Han (202BC-220AD).  This is the start of China as an empire. (pg 60)  Trate routes reach all the way to Turkey,  The population is 58M in 2AD (slightly larger than contemporary Rome).  The great wall starts construction.   <br />4) Tang (581-907) unifies what is now considered modern China.  <BR>They link Northern and Southern China by huge canals and inter-regional trade floursihed.  Chang'an becomes the world's largest city. Culture and the arts start to thrive.  <br />5) Song (907-1276) is not able to control East Asia like Tang or Han.  They broker deals with neighboring states for a shaky peace.  The status quo continues.  By the 11th century, China is outpacing Europe in terms of \\"agricultural productivity, industrial technology, and sophistication of commercial organization.\\" (161)  <br />6) Ghengis Khan (1162-1227) creates huge lightning force of calvary that eventually covers 2/3 of Asian continent. Some of the cities under his (and grandson's) control: Beijing, Lhasa, Moscow, Kiev, Ormuz, and Baghdad.  The divisions between Mongol ruling class and Chinese are kept clear by law, status, and language. The Chinese resent this alien rule.<br />7) Ming (1368-1644) is founded by Taizu, who is was the first commoner to become emperor in 1,500 years. (191)  The population continues to grow, but the country is not entirely under control.  Mongols attack from the North, while the Japanese attack from the east. <br />8) Manchus (1644-1900) from Manchuria (east of Mongolia, above Korea) create the Qing dynasty.  They govern efficiently.  They force their subjects to adopt the Manchu hairstyle (shaved heads with braided hair in the back) as a symbol of their loyalty.  Trade with Europe increases exponentially. By 1800, Europe was buying 1/7 of all Chinese tea.  This eventually leads to the Opium wars.  Various colonial powers all vy for a piece of China.<br />9) Sun Yatsen, Chang Kaishek, Mao Zedong round out the rest of this beautifully illustrated book.	2002-11-05

Books	4	7	8	N	N	Things Don't Change, We Change	Anthony Robbins is a famous writer, motivational trainer, speaker and celebrity.  Most people in the US know him as the tall, energetic self-help guy on television.  He first reached acclaim with his book Unlimited Power and is highly regarded for his specific techniques to re-train yourself to be a happy, motivated and successful person. <br />While the size and content of the book is somewhat overwhelming, the premise of this book is quite simple: You have the power to live the way you want, but you have to coach and train yourself to do it.   <br />Things don't change.  We change. - Henry David Thoreau<br />The first step to any change is a decision.  Not a passing interest, or desire, but a firm decision.  The word decision comes from the Latin word (de-caedere) for to cut.  It means that you cut away any other possibilities.  Interestingly, there is a similar word in Korean (GYUL DAHN).  These words indicate finality.  It is the end of one thing and the beginning of another.  Decisions are not just logical conclusions, but acts of willingness and commitments to action.<br />The next step is to train the body and the mind to accept this change.  Robbins explains that we have neural associations (physical nerve connections in the brain) with certain behaviors, and unless we change those associations, we cannot change our behavior.  Simply, if our brain likes smoking (more than it hates it) ~ we cannot stop smoking. To stop, you must associate more pain (than pleasure) to the action.  At times it seems obvious, but it is a practical way to teach yourself to change. <br />Finally, any change must be reinforced through repetition.  As we all know too well, it is difficult to give up a bad habit and even more difficult to keep a good one.  As Aristotle said, \\"We are what we repeatedly do\\"<br />While reading this book, I had to take breaks periodically to digest what Robbins was saying.  While he writes in a simple and readable way, the objective of the book is quitelarge and comprehensive: change your life.  It is a serious subject and it requires some open-mindedness.  Overall, I recommend this to anyone who wants to change some aspect of their life, and wants to know the actionable steps to affect that change.	2002-09-30

In Chinese, the two characters that mean busy are \\"heart\\" and \\"death\\".  <br />3) Effort and ease are not opposites, but compliments.  Think of a champion runner:  Although they train mercilessly, when they run in a competition, they are trying to find their own internal tempo.  When their effort becomes easy, then they really perform.<br />4) Don't try to manage time and fight it.  Time is always the same, it is only the difference of our perception about time.  Time is only a series of NOWs.  So the way we spend NOW will determine our destiny.<br />5)  Success does not necessarily mean more.  Life is like a full glass.  To put more in, you have to pour some out.  Prioritize and do what is REALLY meaningful to you.<br />6) Be willing to walk away from negative relationships.<br />7) There is wisdom in irritation.  It is a sign telling us to change our lives.  Enjoy the game of life, and the challenge to find the real you.<br />8) There is no failure, only re-direction.  We keep failing as we progress towards success.<br />9) Believe that there is a divine plan for you.  Give into this spiritual guidance.  <br />10) Accept death.

It is just a tool. <br />3) Albert Schweitzer said, \\"The purpose of life is to serve and show compassion and the will to help others.\\" <br />3) Question: So, why do we work? Why do we need money?<BR>Answer: Unless we have, we cannot give. <br />5) The reality is that most people live their lives very defensively. They are always afraid that someone will take some of what is theirs. They are too busy protecting ~ to give to anyone.<br />6) Question: So, how do you succeed? <BR>Answer: Be an entrepreneur. Start small, and inexpensive. Be creative, believe in yourself, find a good mentor, have a dream, make a goal, do the basics everyday, learn from mistakes, work hard, care about others, put people before products,don't make excuses, never give up.<br />\\"Never give up, never give up, never give up\\"<BR>-Winston Churchill<br />\\"Success is going from one failure to another failure with great enthusiasm.\\"<BR>- Winston Churchill<br />\\"One man with courage is a majority.\\"<BR>- Thomas Jefferson <br />\\"The best portion of a good man's life is his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and love.\\" <BR>- Wordsworth	2002-09-06

Gives the reader a good working knowledge of management concepts, tools, and formulas.  This should be mandatory reading for any new employee, regardless of industry or expertise.  Some highlights:<br />1) Break even unit volume (how much to produce to break even) = fixed costs / selling price of product - variable costs<br />2) A balance sheet is a snapshot of the company's holdings at any time.  Assets = Liabilities+ Owner's equity.  If the records do not balance, then there is a mistake.<br />3) Overview of quantitative analysis: how to calculate EMV (expected monetary value), cash flow modeling, net present value, IRR (internal rate of return), and probability distributions.<br />4) A major drawback of the corporation is double taxation: taxation as an entity, and also taxation on dividends.<br />5) CAPM (capital asset pricing model) determines the rate of return necessary to compensate for that inherent risk of a particular investment.  (e.g. is that stock worth buying)<br />6) Even if you do not work in operations, it will help you to understand the meaning of key acronyms: MRP (master resource plan), BOM (bill of materials), SPC (statistical process control), CPM (critical path methodology), EOQ (economic order quantity)<br />7) Good history of economic thought: Keynes (positive effect of government fiscal spending), Friedman (government should only focus on money supply), Smith (invisible hand), Schumpeter (creative destruction), Laffer (supply side)<br />8) \\"Strategy is the most exciing course in the MBA curriculum because it gives you the chance to put all your new skills to work.

Although the research was based on only three franchises, it makes many generalizations.  Overall, it portrays franchising in a very negative light.  Some points from the book: <BR> <BR>1) Franchising has low barriers to entry, numerous competitors, low switching costs for customers, reliance on part-time and low paid employees, limited alternative suppliers<br />2) The franchising system creates uniformity among the outlets, which is good for the brand, but creates perfect substitutes among the franchisees.  Little opportunity to differentiate.<br />3) Franchisors write the contracts and consequently it is slanted in their favor.<br />4)  Good prospective franchisees: A students, people without speeding tickets, people with long careers with one company, people with good credit, women, people who are risk averse.<br />5) Many people enter franchising expecting a free ride, but it is just as demanding as starting your own business.  All you get is a brand, and some best known methods.<br />6) \\"Operational factors are more critical than geographic factors.\\" (pg 120)<br />7) \\"In the technical areas, in products, and in sales, franchisees had greater knowledge about the business than the franchisor.\\" (pg 125)<br />8) Franchisees might think they are entrepreneurs, but they are not.  As on franchisor said, \\"We need people who will follow our system.\\" (pg 141)	2002-08-27

Drucker touches on the mega-trends affecting us ~ as individuals, consumers, students, workers, and voters. Interesting to read, especially since many of his projections of the future (remember this was written in 1989) are surprisingly correct:<br />1) Politicians in developed countries are increasingly becoming centrist, and function-oriented.  Most political debate is focused on the means, not the goal.  Chrisma is not needed.<br />2) The concept of government as the savior of society is dead.  Instead, it will offer specific remedies for specific ills.  The government cannot run the economy, but just help create the right climate for business, trade, and activity.<br />3) Society is segmenting into knowledge workers and non-knowledge workers (laborers).  This concept runs through all his books.<br />4) Russia will segment and collapse.  This will create imbalance as the majority of Russians are actually Asian and Muslim.<br />5) The military will continue to be a drag on the economy.  Weapons will become increasingly counterproductive as the enemy unknown and elusive. Terrorism will rise, and the military will suffer an identity crisis.<br />6) The third sector (after the knowledge workers and manual laborers) will be non-profit.  This serves a large function in society and provides many of the services once expected from the government.  Volunteer hours totalling $150 billion (in imaginary wages).  <br />7) Interest groups will continue to gain political influence.  Drucker calls it the \\"tyranny of the small majority\\".  These single cause minorities will be very vocal and usually against (rather than for) something.  <br />8) In the transnational economy, cheap direct labor will no longer the way to competitiveness (since the portion of direct labor for goods is declining)  <br />9) George Stigler, University of Chicago economist and Nobel prize winner, showed that NOT ONE of the regulations through whichthe US government tried to control, direct, or regulate the economy has worked. (pg 166)<br />10) Information based organizations should most resemble an orchestra.  Each participant is a specialist and an individual contributor.   They have separate responsibility and are expected to handle that work without direct supervision.    Things get done, but only if the common objectives (the score) is clear and simple.	2002-08-23

A few things you might not have known:<br />1) Mao had a very poor understanding of physiology.  He had no faith in medicine or doctors.  He would not let anyone in his staff get an operation without his permission. <br />2) Overall, he was not hygenic.  He did not bathe, but only had towel massages.  He did not brush his teeth.  Instead he rinsed his mouth with tea.<br />3) He was a complex, and contradictory person.  He enjoyed being unpredictable and constantly played people off one another.  He was unemotional and was largely unfazed by the fact that 25-30 million died from his Great Leap Forward fiasco.<br />4) Mao was an incessant womanizer.  He was constantly holding dances and card playing parties to find new young women.   <br />5) Maoist China was completely a cult of personality.  Everyone was a sychophant.  To give Mao the impression that his skewd policies were doing well, his staff would summon people to plant rice near the train tracks before he passed by so he could see peasants (actors) wear brightly colored clothes and generally looking happy.<br />The last two sentences: (pg 638)<BR>\\"I want it (the book) to serve as a reminder of the terrible human consequences of Mao's dictatorship and of how good and talented people living under his regime were forced to violate their consciences and sacrifice their ideals to survive.\\"	2002-08-17

Definitely read through this book (even if only in parts) before you start to invest yourself (time and money) into a franchise.  It is a frank, and straightforward book about a complicated subject.<br />Some clues from the book: <br />1) As a franchisee, you buy \\"the right to use the franchisor's expertise, brand name, experience, methods, and support.\\" (pg. 14).<br />2) Although you get a proven system, the business is yours. <BR>It is work and it is not for everyone.  Successful franchisees must be very good operators who stick to the rules.  <br />3) Franchisors vary.  Since you will be paying a royalty going forward, make sure you do the research and know what you are getting for your money.  A contract can be a life preserver and a trap.<BR>    <BR>4) The evaluation, preparation, funding, and negotiation for the franchise is paramount.  This book gives detailed lists, and questions to ask before you sign on that contract.<br />5) Top two reasons franchises fail: 1) not enough money going into the investment 2) absentee owners <br />6) Factors in assessing your location: population density, neighboring stores (cross promotion), anchor tenants, traffic patterns, speed of traffic, seasonal factors, day / night, competition, security, access to employees, size of property, zoning, landscaping, parking, landlord reputation, visibility, signs, environmental concerns, title, buy vs. lease, hidden costs.<br />7) Royalties vary according to franchisors.  Wendy's is 4%<br />8) In the end, franchising is a relationship business with franchisor, customers, other franchisees, suppliers, attorneys, bankers, and family.<br />9) When selling the franchise to others, the franchisor often has the \\"right of first refusal\\" which means they can purchase it on the same terms and conditions as the offer you received from a prospective buyer.  Check this clause prior to signing.<br />10) Usethe International Franchise Association's webpage:<BR>[...]	2002-08-16

Hone a particular quality until it is a calling card.  <br />2) Create attention at all cost.  PT Barnum (of the circus fame) would even write public attacks against himself to keep himself in the news.  Even scandal is better than indifference.<br />3) The essence of power is to keep the initiative ~ making other people react to your moves (pg. 65)  Make people come to you.   Sometimes pickpockets put a sign that says \\"Beware of Pickpockets\\" because passerbys see the sign and instinctively reach for their wallets.  The thieves see that and know they have a prey.<br />4) Win through action, not through argument.  \\"Learn to demonstrate the correctness of your ideas indirectly.\\" (pg 71)<br />5) Learn to keep people dependent on you.  \\"If you are ambituous, it is much wiser to seek out weak rulers or masters with whom you can create a relationship of dependency.\\" (pg 84)<br />6) Crush your enemy completely.  Chang Kia-shek did not finish off Mao.  Mao's army was reduced to 10,000 soliders, but eventually came back from the Long March to take over China.<br />7) Be deliberately unpredictable.  It keeps everyone on off guard and confused.  It intimidates and creates a sense of power. <br />8) Do not commit to anyone but yourself.  <BR>\\"I would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married.\\"  - Queen Elizabeth I<br />9) Feign surrender.  It lulls other people into a sense of complaceny.  \\"When a great lord passes, a wise peasant bows deeply and farts silently.\\"   - Ethiopian proverb<br />10) Plan it to the end.  The end game is everything.   Most people are just prisoners of the moment.  To be the one in control, you must have a plan to the end of the chess game.	2002-08-16

Lots of good facts which reflect on the competitive, and opportunistic capitalist paradigm we currently live in. <br />1) There has been significant change in the economic landscape, and that change continues to accelerate. Before the industrial revolution, 98% of the world's population had income only from farming. Now less than 2% are farmers.<br />2) The world is increasing a global market. Coca Cola gets 80% of its revenues from outside the United States.<br />3) The gap in wealth continues to widen. <BR>- Bill Gates market value is the same as the poorest 110,000,000 Americans. <BR>- In the United States, the average CEO pay is 212x the average worker.<BR>- The top 1% of people in the US own 40% of the total wealth.<BR>- Africa GDP is the same as it was in 1965. Has not changed in 35 years.<br />4) We are all busier. With the invention of electricity, the average hours of sleep dropped from 9 hours to 7 hours a day.<br />5) Old companies must destroy themselves (re-invent themselves) in order to stay competitive and grow. Also, individuals must constantly change and grow to remain competitive. If not, they will fall behind.<br />6) Capitalism is a tough game. The number of businesses failing (88% a year) is almost as many as new business are formed. Wealth is constantly being transferred from one group ~ to another.<br />7) There are many basic ingredients to create wealth. Some are cultural (like entreprenuership), some are created and enforced by the government (intellectual property, law and order, infrastructure), some are learned by the individual (skills, knowledge)<br />8) Each country, and region has its strengths and weakness. In order to build wealth for the future, each country must act differently:<br />- Japan: Clean up the banks, bring in professional management, restore government credibility, and create internal growth. Japan is too big to play the export game anymore.<BR>- US: Break the two-tier society (rich and very poor) by improving education for more skilled workers, and investing more in infrastructure<BR>- Europe: Encourage entrepreneurs and corporate flexibility<br />9) Wealth is created when there is a disequillibrium (imbalance) in technology, or society. When there is change, there is opportunity ~ because wealth is being transferred. <br />10) Know your weakness and go where that weakness is not important.	2002-08-02

Once can just be ahead of it.\\"  (pg 73)<br />An outline might look like this:<br />1) For starters, people must understand that a) Management does not only pertain to business.  90% of organizations are the same.  b) There is no such thing as a RIGHT ORGANIZATION.  The organization fits the task.  c) In the knowledge economy, you cannot manage people.  Only lead them.  d) Management focus is external, not internal.  \\"Management exists for the sake of its institution's results.\\" (pg 39)<br />2) For knowledge workers, money is not enough.  They require a challenge for motivation and must believe in the company mission to really perform.  It is the quality of their work, not the quantity that matters.<br />3) Management needs to clearly define WHAT SHOULD BE DONE, rather than HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE.  For manual labor, HOW matters because there are minimum quality requirements.  For knowledge work, quality is a given.  <br />4) Increasingly a company's comparative advantage will be its ability to attract and retain the most talented people.  Likewise, knowledge workers should be treated as a capital asset, not as a cost.  <br />5) Successful companies have a culture of organized abandonment.  People are encouraged to abandon what does not work.  It is innovation in motion.  Opportunities are fed and problems starved.<br />6) The new Information Revolution is about concepts, not data.  Going forward, IT will focus less on the T (Technology) and more on the I (Information).  Once again, it is a question of quality ~ not quantity.  Likewise, the ultimate test of any information system is that there are no surprises.<br />7) Since knowledge workers have a long working life (evidence, the author), they must actively manage their careers.  Toachieve this, Drucker gives straightforward advice:  Know yourself.  What are my strengths?  How do I perform?  What are my values? <br />8) Everyone should develop secondary interests (volunteer work, different job, hobbies) to challenge, and motivate themselves.  Do not get stuck mid-career without any alternatives.	2002-07-29

Basically, we are what we think, so think big.<br />1) Build confidence in yourself.  Action reduces fear, so act.<BR>Take small steps at first: Sit in the front everywhere you go, practice eye contact, walk 25% faster, practice speaking up,  smile big, use positve words. <br />2) Think and dream creatively.  Believe that it can be done and then the mind finds a way to get it done.  Be open to new ideas and be progressive. Stimulate yourself with diverse ideas from diverse people.  Capacity is a state of mind. <br />3) You are what you think.  \\"The price tag you put on yourself, is probably the same price tag that the world will put on you.\\" (pg 75)  Dress up.  Think your work is important.  Think enthusiastically.  Ask yourself if you are the type of manager that a subordinate would respect and follow?<br />4) Manage your environment because it is food for your mind.  <BR>People who tell you that it cannot be done are usually unsuccessful people.  <br />5) Make your attitudes your allies.  Live it up.  Broadcast good news.  Do better work that others expect.   Remember people's names.  Take initiative to build friendships.  Talk less.  Listen.  <br />6) Get the action habit.  Nothing happens just by thinking.  Do not worry about problems.  You can handle them as they come. Successful people handle problems as they arise.  You cannot buy insurance on all problems.  Start now. <br />7) Turn defeat into victory.  Defeat is a state of mind.  Be constructively self-critical; do not just look for another reason that you are a loser.  Think that there IS A WAY.  If it does not work, then back off and start afresh.   Get mentally refreshed.  <br />8) Use goals to help you grow.  Goal is a dream acted upon.  \\"The important thing is not where you were or where you are but where you want to get.\\" (pg 195) Know where you want to go.  Visualize your future.  <br />9) How to think like a leader.  Achieving success requires the helpof others.  Trade minds with the people you want to influence.  \\"What would I think if I were that person?\\"  Be human, and put people first. <br />The last words of the book, sum up its meaning:<BR>\\"A wise man will be master of His Mind.

The effective executive. . . <br />1) Knows where their time goes.  Time is the most valuable resource and is inelastic.  It must be managed.  What has priority?  What is better left undone?  What can be outsourced? <br />2) Focuses on results (not effort) by asking: <BR>\\"What do I do that justifies my being on the payroll?\\" (pg 53).  <br />3) Staff to people's strength (not the absence of weakness).  <BR>There is no such thing as a \\"good man\\".  Good at what?  Likewise, a person is hired to produce results, not to please a superior, or blend in.  <br />4) Fills the job with the right person (not fits the job to the available person).  Jobs in the organization are interdependent; if one changes, it will affect another.  Also, \\"To tolerate diversity, relationships must be task-focused rather than personality focused.\\" (pg 77)<br />5) Tries to be himself / herself (not someone else). (S)He looks for patterns in their performance, and focus on their strengths.  \\"Feed the opportunities and starve the problems.\\" (pg 98)  <br />6) Concentrates on one effort at a time. (not multi-tasking)<BR>It is hard enough to do one thing right.  <br />7) Concentrates on important and strategic decisions (not a great number of small, reactionary decisions).  Many problems were created in the past, and solving them only re-establishes the status quo.  It is better to seek opportunities than just fix problems.<br />8) Makes decisions based on dissenting opinions (not pseudo facts and pre-judgements)  Use other's opinions to form a case for each side.<br />9) Acts or does not act (no hedging or compromise)	2002-07-20

A quick summary of 10 laws.<br />1) Law of Influence: The true measure of leadership is influence.  Influence, nothing more, nothing less.  Managers can maintain direction, but cannot change it.  Leadership cannot be awarded, appointed, or assigned.  It must be earned.  It takes hard work. <br />2) Law of Progress: Leadership Develops Daily, not in a Day.  Leaders are Learners.  The goal is to get a little bit better everyday.  During the day, you will influence 4 people. <br />3) Law of Navigation: Leaders must see farther, see more, and see before others do.  Past success and failures give experience.  Leaders must be positive.  You must have faith that you can take all your people all the way.  If you cannot do that I your mind, then you cannot do that in real life.  The Secret to this Law is preparation.  <br />4) Law of Solid Ground: Trust is the foundation of leadership.  You cannot take shortcuts.  It is like pocket change.  Every good decision, you add. Every bad decision, you take away.  People forgive occasional mistakes, but if you lose their trust.  It is finished.  Leadership is strategy and character, but if you must be without one. . .it is better to not have strategy <br />5) Law of Magnetism: Leaders always look for good people.  Make a list of the qualities you want in your people.  Do you have those skills?   You get (not who you want), but who you are.  Different people will not attract themselves to you.  If you want to attract better people, time to improve yourself. <br />6) Law of Connection: Leaders touch the Heart before the Hand.  People do not care how much you know, until they know that you care.  Relate to people as individuals not as a group.  It is the leader¡¯s job to connect first.  The tougher the challenge, the greater the connection.  Lead yourself, use your head.  To lead others, use your heart.<br />7) Law of Empowerment: Only secure leaders give powers to others.  People can only achieve when the leader empowers others.  Great things happen when you give credit to others.  Must have belief in people. Not like a boss who is always micromanaging your work.<br />8) Law of Buy-In: People buy into the Leader, then the Vision.  You are the message.  Athletes are hired as promoters of products. You cannot separate the leader from the cause.  Ghandi.  Silicon Valley start ups.  <br />9) Law of Victory: Leaders Find a Way for the Team to Win.  What does it take to be a winner?  Inability to accept defeat.  Not winning is unacceptable.  Great leaders are at their best when the pressure is on. <br />10) Law of Priorities: Leaders understand that activity does not equal accomplishment.  A leader is one who climbs the tallest tree, surveys the entire situation, and yells, ¡°WRONG JUNGLE.¡±  80/20 Principle	2002-07-06

You must have the money work for you; you have to be a business owner (B) who owns assets than make money or an investor (I) who invests in those assets. If you are an employee or self-employed specialist, there is a limit to your income because there are only 24 hours in a day.<br />2) Become financially literate. Have a basic understanding of how assets create income, and liabilities create expenses. Then, simply collect assets.<br />3) Once financially literate, hire the best advisors who can help you to play the game. Don't penny pinch on financial advice; good advisors will pay for themselves.<br />4) Don't let the government needlessly take your money (Earn -tax then spend). Start a corporation and legally pay taxes after expenses (Earn - spend then tax). <br />4) Start small and learn from your mistakes. \\"The only difference between a rich person and a poor person is what they do in their spare time.\\" (page 65)<br />5) Become a sophisticated investors who is willing to take educated risks. \\"True investors make more money in bad markets\\" (page 64)<br />6) Don't take on debt that will not take care of itself.

(page 57)<br />3) No goals = no game. Activity is not accomplishment. Don¡¯t be a wandering generality. Goals should be big, long range, daily and specific. <br />4) Unlimited possibilities. Records were meant to be broken. Until Roger Bannister ran the four-minute mile, most thought it was physically impossible. After his achievement, people broke the record constantly.<br />5) Work as a team. There is a limit to what you can accomplish by yourself. Example: Geese fly 72% farther by flying together.<br />6) Attitude is everything. It determines the outcome. While you cannot control the environment, you (and only you) can control your attitude. The pessimist says. ¡°I will believe it when I see it.¡± The optimist says, ¡°I will see it when I believe it.¡± (page 206)<br />7) Create good habits because habits define our lives. Example: The average teenage student watches 17,000 hours of television before they graduate high school.<br />8) Successful people enjoy their work.<br />9) Keep going. \\"The price of success is less than the price of failure\\".

Reich (personal bio covered by other reviewers) covers<BR>some of the mega-trends that are affecting our lives.  <br />The book follows this train of thought, if only roughly.<br />1) Technology and globalization is breaking down barriers for competition.  With so many suppliers, buyers have more choice.  There are better deals everywhere and switching costs are going down.  You can change (your house, job, lifestyle) easier than ever before.<BR>- Every year 17% of American¡¯s change residences, and 20% of them change jobs.<br />2) It is a buyers market and sellers are forced to innovate.  Everything must be better, faster, and cheaper.  The innovators are increasingly independent, and networked free agents (rather than a vertically-integrated conglomerate).  These free agents seek market visibility by associating with large recognized brand portals: Disney, Dell, Harvard, and AOL.<BR>- 90% of the 7,000 entertainment firms in Los Angeles have fewer than 10 employees. <br />3) Loyalty? Companies are constantly trying to cut costs and looking for cheaper suppliers (and employees). \\"The underlying cause isn¡¯t a change in the American character.  It is to be found in the increasing ease by which buyers and investors can get better deals, and the competitive pressure this imposes on all enterprises.  As the pressure intensifies, institutional bonds are loosening.¡± (page 71)<br />4) The nature of work has changed.  There is more emphasis on the individual; they must provided for themselves, and constantly define their value.  It is an opportunity, but also a great source of insecurity.  <BR>The gap in wealth is increasing.  <BR>- In the US, the top 1% of people hold 18% of the wealth.<BR>- CEO pay (as a % of typical worker¡¯s salary) has risen from 40x (1980) to 85x (1990) to 419x (2000)<br />5) Americans are working longer hours. The opportunity cost of not work is very high: people are compelled to work for that marginal income.  The free agent culture: Peopletake their work home with them  <BR>- Americans work 350 hours a year more than Japanese and Europeans<BR>- 30% of families are supported by single parents<br />6) As free agents, we sell ourselves constantly. (Not just when applying for a job) ¡°Individuals now blaze their own career paths by making reputations in their fields, not in their organizations.¡± (page 143)<br />7) Families are shrinking, as both women and men feel compelled to work more. Many of the functions for the family are being outsourced: meals, childcare, shopping.<BR>-  The percentage of unmarried people with no children is 32% (1998)<BR>-  In Massachusetts, more babies are born to women over thirty (than under thirty)<BR>-  Spending on take-out & restaurants exceeds the spending on groceries.<br />8) Although technology is making our lives easier, more efficient, we are very alone.  As a result, we are paying for attention: spas, clubs, counseling, childcare, and brokerage.  Companies are segmenting their markets by their customers¡¯ ability to pay for service (or attention).  Invariably, this trend will continue as more people work longer hours and spend less time at home and with their families.<br />9) Communities are becoming commodities.  People are more mobile.  We choose our location, neighbors and lifestyles.  Friendships start and end easier.  We choose the communities that offer the best return on investment: lifestyle, schools, and real estate value. Society is becoming more segregated as people bargain for something better; no one wants to subsidize anyone else.  <br />10) Leadership is about attracting and keeping talent; governance is salesmanship (section title pg. 209).  <br />Finally, Reich discusses the choices we must make in light of the world we live in.  Overall, it is an insightful and organized view of the hectic life we live.	2002-06-20

Freedman<br />Freedman firmly believes Marine methodology creates a strong and effective organization.  For those who read this book, you will probably agree.  As you might expect from a book that parallels the military and business management, there are many references to training, discipline, order, and sacrifice.<br />However, a vast majority of the book gives a perspective of the US Marine Corps which is radically different than most people would expect.<br />Provided that Freedman is correct in his analysis, the US Marine Corps is an extremely focused group which is both fast, versatile, and effective in complex situations. <br />1) Marines aim for the 70% solution because in the battlefield, speed and boldness is more important than perfection.  Put another way, indecisiveness is a fatal flaw.  It is better to make small, frequent, and rapid decisions.<br />2) Marines find the essence of any mission.  It should be made very clear. In the process, all the assumptions, boundaries (what shall we NOT do) should be questioned and explored.  Dissension is invited prior to the final decision.<br />3) Marines are a capability based organization.  They are defined by what they are able to do, and how they do it.<br />4) Marines push decision making to very low levels in the organization.  Bureaucracy does not work in the battlefield.  To quote. \\"The best soldiers are ones who follow orders from above, but do not depend on them.\\"<br />5) The Marines are very competitive.  Marines hire through trial by fire.  Boot camp is a form of Darwinian natural selection.  The best and fittest survive.  Even after boot camp, many officers leave the Corps because they cannot be promoted, because they are not the best.  <br />6) Leadership is defined as the ability to have others follow you.  If a Marine does not follow an legitimate order, he / she can face disciplinary action, but the superior who gave the order will often find their career stop too.  (It demonstrates a break in their leadership ability.)<BR> <BR>7) Marines glorify the lower levels of the organization.  The most training is at the lowest level of Marine leadership - Corporal.  Even in the dress, there is little difference in dress from the officers and the privates.<br />8) Marines focus on the end statement.  Marine leadership focus on WHAT TO DO (Mission), not HOW to DO (Details).<br />9) Marines reward failure.  The best way to learn is through experience, and if someone does not fail from time to time, they are not pushing the envelope.  Marines are focused on continuous improvement, and that requires temporary failure.<br />10) The Marines have passion for what they do.  The Marines have an expression to describe people who just go through the motions of their job:  \\"Going Admin\\"	2002-06-02

Like any travel book, it covers the geography, history, culture and people of the region.<br />Overall, the book is very readable.  It is well written and paints a vivid picture of everyday life in rural China.  From this foreigner's experience, the reader comes away with a better understanding of the Chinese character and lifestyle, both positive and negative.  <br />While the author does make generalizations about the Chinese, the reader is given the sense that his assumptions are largely correct.  Yes, China is an old, diverse country with a complicated mixture of nationalism, communist indoctrination, and constant change. <br />While thousands of people come to Asia to teach English each year, very few of them have the insight (or the curiosity) to delve into the real clockwork of the country around them.  Most people come as tourists, and leave as tourists.<br />Ten points:<br />1. The communist party is everywhere.  10% of the population are party members.  It pervades all aspects of life, <BR>especially education.<br />2. Life is rural China is tough.  China is developing into a two tier economy, much like the rest of the world. <BR>The standard of living in the countryside, where most of his experiences take place, is only a fraction <BR>of the lifestyle that Chinese city people enjoy.<br />3. Really funny stories about his English lessons and their adaptation to the Chinese classroom.  Essays on \\"What if Robin Hood lived in modern day China.\\"  Chinese adaptation of Hamlet with Hong Kong <BR>fighting scenes.<br />4. Three Gorges Dam.  It will be the largest in the world and produce the same electricity as 10 nuclear power plants.<BR>Strangely, the majority of the residents are accepting (almost complacent) of the huge change this will have on their<BR>environment and lives.  All throughout the city there are markers that read 177 (the height above sea level that dam<br />will raise the water).<br />5. You can learn Chinese within 2 years if you try.  Apparently, the author did.<br />6. Many of the peculiarities to the Chinese mindset are not entirely Chinese, but Asian.  I wonder how much culture shock a Korean, or Japanese born person would have felt in his teaching position.<br />7. In Xian there is a law which states that all people get a day off if the temperature goes above 35 degrees.  The government regulates the official temperature, and during the peak of the summer it is a consistent. . .  .<BR>35 degrees.<br />8. He took a 50 hour train ride through China without a seat.<br />9. True to the communist roots, people are not ashamed of being working class.  When he asks his students what their parents' occupation, the majority of them say \\"peasants\\" without the least hesitation.<br />10.  Quote.  He wonders about the future of his students.  <BR>\\"He would turn out fine, too.  Most of them were that way.  They were tough, and sweet and funny, and sad, and people like that would always survive.  It wasn't necessarily gold, but perhaps because of that it would stay.\\"<BR>Page 377.	2002-05-30

It is biased, but serves as a counterweight to the generalist reading of history taught in most schools.	2001-02-06

The models which the authors offer are helpful, but fairly elementary for those who have read other business books or articles about the Internet. <br />Yes, the economics of information is different from the economics of things (with physical inputs like capital, and labour) but most of the examples cited in the book are not new: Dell Computer, Charles Schwab, and Sabre on-line reservation systems.  <br />As one of the other reviewers mentioned, it is perhaps better to scan it while in a bookstore.	2001-01-31

Dell's mass customization.  Schwab's lead to discount brokerage.  <br />For those who have read popular newspaper, or magazine articles about how the internet is changing business ~ this book might bore. It paints broad strokes and seems even outdated given that it was published so recently.	2001-01-29
