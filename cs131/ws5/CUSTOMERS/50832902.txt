I also enjoy it, which is saying a lot, given the repetition with which this book is requested. The pictures are great, the text is great, the story is wonderful - I know all these animals, we do fun things together, \\"because the live with me\\" - showing a preschooler's imagination at work with her stuffed animals. There's about an equal distribution of male, female, and unspecified animals. Best of all, the text is large enough that it works well in the dark - perfect for putting your child to sleep. (This book is part of the children's book genre that ends with the child asleep.) Heck, the book is addictive enough that soon you'll be able to read the whole book without looking at it!	2004-12-28

It's written tongue-in-cheek as a guide to enjoy work - you're there most of the time, might as well have fun. Being devious is key. Some of the practical \\"jokes\\" that readers have sent to Scott Adams border more on cruelty than humor, but hey, you wouldn't take this advice seriously anyway. Reading it in the dot-bomb era is fun, too, as it shows the \\"take this job and shove it\\" attitude that the stock option days led to.<br />The latter part of the book is Scott Adams' musings on creativity and humor. He tries to keep the same tonality as in the rest of the book, but you can tell he's a bit more thoughtful about this. It, too, is a good read, albeit different than the first part of the book.	2004-07-11

Using the comic form, he presents the stories of people from various backgrounds and how they got to be where they are now. Through this method, he's able to bring in some perhaps forgotten or overlooked history - of the US funding the Taliban, etc. Not a diatribe, the book can be read quickly and shared with others to be used as a starting point for further discussion.	2004-07-11

This book is up to date, relevant, and &quot;rings true&quot; when it provides opinions. It's of most help to people in SF, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, or Marin Counties. We picked it up at about 6 months pregnant, and were impressed at how closely the advice and listings matched what we had experienced ourselves or heard from others. The listings and descriptions of baby stores, for example, along with phone numbers, was worth the price. This book is about where to find products and services; couple it with Baby Bargains to help decide what you need.	2002-10-13

Each word is well-chosen, effective, and yet easy to read. At one point in the book, he alludes that he has written poetry previously. Each of the 39 chapters is a few pages long, presenting a brief essay on something related to garlic farming in New Mexico. There's an obvious love and care that he gives to his work (both garlic farming and writing), and he's able to show respect for others who have not chosen this path.  The book also presents some information about how garlic is grown, but it's by no means a gardening book. It's a descriptive story of the cycles of the growing season. Like in his other excellent book, Mayordomo, the author also shares his community with us - talking about how farming, farmers markets, irrigation, and such intertwine a community, even one that contains members who originally went there to &quot;get away from it all.&quot;	2002-08-13

It's written very clearly and thoroughly. I liked the &quot;passport&quot; approach - it broke items into clear pieces. The book was well organized and clear. The exam on the included CD had a couple of answers that were wrong, but overall, this is a great way to learn the subjects, for the price. I took the two tests on the same day - 30 minutes total, for both tests, and I passed. If I were to recommend only one A+ book to friends, this would be it.	2002-06-20

For the first 65 pages or so (out of 330 before footnotes), San Francisco is barely mentioned. Instead, the author talks about Rome, Washington DC, the Mexican-American war, the Spanish-American war, UC Berkeley, the mining-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, and other related-but-not-directly-related items. There's a good chapter on San Francisco newspaper history and politics, and the UC Berkeley history is interesting but not directly relevant. The book's origin as a PhD thesis kind of shows. Unlike the book jacket, I did not find it to be &quot;potboiler urban history&quot; or &quot;written in a lively, accessible style.&quot; It advances a new way of looking at urban development history - the history of a city's growth as it (negatively) impacts the surrounding environment. It's interesting for that, but not if you want a book focused on San Francisco history.	2002-06-20
US	50832902	RUJHP6THT16Q2	0440217490	233998989	A Dangerous Fortune	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Suprisingly good	I had heard that Ken Follet wrote good spy novels, so I picked up this book. It's not a spy novel - it involves intrigue among a wealthy banker family in late 19th century London - but it's suprisingly good. I was expecting a piece of trashy pulp fiction, and instead got a book that was compelling to read. Sure, there's lots of intrigues among the rich and not so rich, within a family and not, but Follet brings more to it. The characters have depth, and the characters develop over time. I found myself thinking about the story and the characters after I read it, and I wish there was more to read. On top of that, it is solid, good pulp fiction, so it's a fun, easy read.	2001-10-02

Since you're reading this on (    ), you know that this was not particularly visionary - it's true today, barely a decade later. Even at that time, this was pretty easy to predict. That's not the book's main problem though. The problem is, it's pretty dumbed-down. I had read the Exiles Trilogy by the author a couple of times, and was disappointed by this book. I know he can write better. There are parts that read like Bova was going for a farce, but it's unclear - it may just be bad writing. The book also has some totally unnecessary about the Japonese. Get the Exiles Trilogy, not this one.	2001-08-07

Nothing in here was _bad_, but I never once laughed out loud. Given how much I enjoy his acting, I was hoping for better. A better example of someone stepping slightly out of his normal world and writing a hilarious book is Dave Barry. He writes a newspaper column, but put together a novel, Big Trouble. Now that's laugh-out-loud material!	2001-08-07

This book provides a good overview of how Windows 2000 is different from Windows NT, but it has almost no relationship to the 70-222 exam topics.

Unfortunately, the book takes a long time to develop, both in terms of plot and pace. It plods along. I almost gave up at 50 pages, but things started to be happening, so I continued skimming for anything interesting. At 100 pages, there's now something going on, but I still have to suffer through way to much description of way too many boring events. I've given up on the book.	2000-12-14

As a native Californian, it was interesting to  see how he described the various people at the various places that both he  and I have been. In order to be pithy, he has to distill a town into a  short description, which risks greatly oversimplifying matters. Barich  pulls it off amazingly well, with dead-on descriptions of many places.  Readers may take issue with how he depicts a favorite place, but I think he  manages to capture the feel of each place he goes. Definitely worth reading  if you're from California or know someone who is.	2000-08-09

Where Fradkin  excels is in uncovering little-known social history, particularly around  racial strife. There's a lot of us-vs-them in this state's history that's  rarely talked about. The great thing is, the author presents a coherent,  readable history, rather than a tiresome sermon from a soapbox. Worth a  read.	2000-08-09

The author writes about his  journey walking along the California coast from the Mexican border to the  Oregon order. Although he gives more attention to Southern California than  the Bay Area and up north, it's an enjoyable journey to participate it.  Quite readable.	2000-08-09

A farm that might  become part of a dam, that has no running water, and electricity for about  one light bulb. The influence of his neighbors is felt here - there are no  biting comments - but it's a good way to immerse onself in another  lifesytle.

If you live in, or care about, the West, or California, or anywhere with  water nearby, you need to read this book. If you eat produce (oranges,  rice, almonds, etc.) that is grown with water from irrigation projects, or  you live somewhere where hydropower brings you electricity, you need to  read this book. If you're interested in environmental issues, you need to  read this book. Reisner writes with a thoroughness that is destined to make  this the definitive work on the Western water wars - for now. His style of  writing is engaging, at least for the topics that interest you. The rest  can be skipped without losing anything. He paints a history that is more  social and political than &quot;environmental&quot; in nature. And perhaps  the value is that he's painting a *history* - this is how we got where we  are to day. What you, the reader, do with this knowledge is up to you. He's  not trying to preach. This book is loaded with facts, is meticulously  researched, and yet is not burdensome. Get it!	2000-08-09

In fact, reading Stegner in these discrete chunks may be  the best way to appreciate him - especially if you read it out loud,  letting the cadences of his writing drive the tempo.

The book describes the Donner Party's ill-fated attempt  to get to California over the Sierras in the winter. Stewart's writing is  compelling, and the story is convincing. As an added bonus, Stewart felt  the need to defend this book against later writers who felt he got some  facts incorrect, so he includes (1) the unedited original of the book,  along with (2) added text that goes into detail describing and refuting  criticisms of this book.

They are, however, funny and a breeze to read. This book was  not as laugh-out-loud funny as his prior books, but it still a quick read.  It's a little odd now that the central band of misfits are so thoroughly  respected, but Asprin's formula keeps on working - strong leaders with lots  of financial resources (they type you'd like as a boss), getting into and  out of sticky situations with their loyal band of various oddities,  complete with a lot of puns.	2000-08-09

Here, he follows environmental leader David Brower as he interacts with a  miner, a developer, and a dam-builder. McPhee tells these stories in an  even-handed way, playing up the dialog and letting the conversations and  actions tell the story, rather than focus on the issues themselves. It's  reasonable to assume that McPhee sympathizes with the environmental  perspective beacause of the choice of topics he covers, but he never  presents one side more than another.<br />A particular treat is for readers of  Reisner's Cadillac Desert, who learned about an entertainingly bold  dam-builder, Floyd Dominy. Here, McPhee places him and David Brower at the  scene of Brower's greatest disappointment - a dam that he  &quot;allowed&quot; to be built. The results, and the tone of the  conversation between them, may be suprising.<br />For readers who want an  introduction to McPhee without the focus of this book, Table of Contents  (the title of another book) is a good place to start.	2000-08-09

Stegner's biography of  Powell describes Powell's career, in a largely engaging way. It's not a  page-turner, but it gives you a good feel for the man. I appreciated it the  most as I read it at the Grand Canyon while simultaneously reading Cadillac  Desert. Stegner describes how Powell, a one-armed man, lead a rafting  expedition down the Colorado river, complete with climbing up the sides of  the Grand Canyon. Although some of the descriptions come across as a bit  quaint these days, it's a valuable work. Reisner borrows from the story and  its structure extensively when he writes about Powell in Cadillac Desert  (probably the most important book about the water wars in the West).	2000-08-09

This  book is different - and probably more readable to more people. There's more  of a defined storyline, and has a more limited number of engaging  characters.

I never would have thought I'd be  interested in this subject, but McPhee made it interesting.	2000-08-09

He shows the  power Nike has in creating an image of an athlete, and fitting that image  into a Nike ad campaign. The athlete gets more of a newly-identifyable  image than Nike.
