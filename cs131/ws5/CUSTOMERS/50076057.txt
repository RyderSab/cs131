Eleven years later I was inspired to read this book - and what a find it was! <br /> <br />Etidorhpa is a work of pharmacological and geological fantasy which progresses through a series of Masonic-style initiations into the mysteries of the earth, the mind and the inner soul of humanity.   At times it is reminiscent of Dante's \\"Divine Comedy\\" with a slimy, sightless subterranean serving Virgil's role as cicerone and Etidorhpa herself as the Beatrice of the narrator's journey.  By turns it evokes Homer's \\"Odyssey,\\" DeQuincey's \\"Confession of an English Opium Eater,\\" Coleridge, Verne's \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" and of course, Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland and Thru the Looking Glass.  If you read this, you might find Ted Nugent and the Amboy Duke's \\"Journey to the Center of Mind\\" an appropriate musical accompaniment.  <br /> <br />On a personal note, my coming to the book was something of a journey as well.  Though I first became aware of the book in Buffalo and read it eleven years later in San Francisco,  the action takes place in Cincinnati, the narrator's address and the scene of most of his mysterious interview taking place in 1895 somewhere in the downtown area of W. 8th Street and Western Avenue near St. Peter-in-Chains Cathedral (which is mentioned in the book).  Some 90 years after the tale here narrated, I walked these streets daily for three years on my way to work.  Bits of reality (the Cathedral) were thus mixed with historical imagination (trying to imagine that neighborhood 90 years before) as well as pure fantasy.   As a result for me the story became both more real and more fantastic. <br /> <br />I am not exactly sure of all the lessons Lloyd sought to teach here.  The story hints at several deeper truths.  Near the surface is a lesson on the psychology of chemical addiction.  At a similar depth there are warnings on the dangers of both extreme science and fanatical religion - making the book relevant to today's concerns with both stem cell research and jihad.  More precisely, since the action in the book takes place in 1895, and the narrator is told to put the manuscript in a vault for 30 years (to 1925), I have to wonder if Lloyd did not see that science was headed for Nazi-style human experimentation as seen in the death camps.   The author repeatedly and strongly warns of the dangers of unbridled science and to me, this would be the scenario we was concerned to warn against. <br /> <br />Excised from the MS:  <br />\\"O, Science, what crimes are committed in thy name!\\" -- Gilbert Highet <br /> <br />There is a lot here: Good story, mystery, intrigue, bizarre initiations, the hint of secret knowledge, instructions on how to see your own brain tissue, in-depth discussions on matter, gravity, fluid dynamics, caves, fungi, drugs, medicinal plants, the possibility of human immortality, the potential of post-human evolution, life, love, the deepest secrets of the heart and the rather ambiguous and multi-dimensional \\"end of the earth\\" -  <br /> <br />It's all here.  But it will take many readings to mine all the ore. <br />	2004-10-04

More important, they discuss how to distinguish inflationary from delationary times through their oil-indicator and how to invest in each sitution.    The Leebs make a strong case for having oil stocks, gold and Berkshire Hathaway shares as core holdings in both an inflationary and deflationary portfolio.  Aside from  REITS, their case for holding defense stocks and particular tech and lifestyle stocks is much less convincing.   In fact, their much touted tech stock has under performed the S&P index by 40% over the past year, and made the news last week losing 7% in one day.  I am also very aware of one of their lifestyle stock picks and would never put my money there - an organization noted for its success in losing pounds, may also succeed in losing dollars. These are their recommendation sins with commissions.    There are sins of omission as well.  There is no mention of TIPS - a surprising omission when discussing inflationary environments. And there is no mention of how or why to invest (or not invest) in China apart from PetroChina (whose ticker is PTR not PRT as printed in the book).    The authors include their results from their last portfolio recommendations from 1998. On the plus side, they honestly reproduce their portfolio warts and all.  On the negative side, one of the warts is ENRON (listed as an environmental play) which they correctly report as having a return of exactly -100%.  The silver lining is that their zero-coupon investment gained over 90%, so their overall return was above 39% over a 5 year period.  Overall, pretty good, even with Enron.  But what this underscores to me is how important and useful zeros are for investing in a deflationary time and just how wrong the Leebs can be with their individual stock picks.    All in all, though, I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to protect their assets in the coming years.    PS: Regarding the status of our civilization vis-a-vis oil and energy, I'm of the same opinion as the May 31st review from \\"A Reader.\\"  We are, I believe, in a period of overshoot soon to be followed by war and/or collapse.  So, in a way, reading this book was something of a pick-me-up -- for the Leebs presuppose that things will pretty much continue as before only with more expensive energy.  I fervently hope they're right!  We'll all find out soon enough.  This is one wager I'd be happy to lose.	2004-09-07

John 12:24    This is a wonderful book, destined to become an enduring spiritual biography, a \\"Confessions\\" from the turn of the second Christian millennium.   Through her life and experiences Ms. Armstrong provides a dispatch from the frontlines where spirituality meets medical science, pop culture meets age-old institutions and women's growing sense of spiritual self-consciousness confronts an inflexible and ossified religious order.     The book is intensely personal.  For my taste, too personal at times.  Even so, one gets a real sense of being there with her, throughout her life's journey, even to the point of feeling the weight of lugging groceries home without benefit of a car. (Been there, done that!)      Random musings and notes:    - Armstrong first put me on to the work of Henri Corbin, whom she extols in her annotated bibliography in \\"The History of God.\\"  I just wonder what she makes of the imaginal realm now that her visions are known to stem from epilepsy.       - The drama of her academic career is heartbreaking in the extreme.  My wife just finished her dissertation in Bronze Age Aegean archaeology and is preparing to defend.  As much as I want her to read this book, it may prove too much.   If you are an aspiring academic, proceed with caution!    - It seems to me that after losing her way through life's labyrinth time and again, the Ariadne's thread that enabled her to find her way was keeping a journal. Note to self: start writing a journal.     - Toward the end, I really hoped she would not go in the \\"follow your bliss\\" direction, but she did.  As much as I admire Armstrong, Bill Moyers and Joseph Campbell (whom I once heard lecture - amazing guy) this bit of advice has never worked all that well for me.  Naturally I found this annoying.    - Two especially vivid passages have stayed with me duringthe months since I read this book:     The clawing sense of loneliness.     The God-shaped hole in Consciousness.    Karen, I'm a huge fan.  I wish we could get together and chat.  I'll bring the wine.    About the book, I only wish I could say more.  Most highly recommended.	2004-08-25

Pricking bubbles and bloated reputations can be terrific fun, and they take full advantage.  Second, it's easy to read writers who share your opinion of public personas: they skewer Greenspan - repeatedly, laugh at Gilder, hiss at Kudlow (who causes me to go into uncontrollable fits of  channel surfing) and have a kind of love/hate relationship with  Krugman.  They quote a little Nietzsche and a lot of Emerson.  Indeed the authors' credo might be \\"Whoso would be a man [investor] must be a Non-comformist.\\" And forget the madding crowd. <br /> <br />Yet, despite the jokes and the pleasing presentation of some very troubling news, the book is repetitious and recycles several themes.  Sometimes their story changes in the recycling: in particular when explaining the Great Bull Market of 1982 to 2000.  Sometimes they say baby boomer demographics caused the Bull; other times it's Greenspan's  lack of monetary restraint  and asset inflation. Then  they say the Bull is a natural outgrowth of a market that had been driven too low during the preceding 16-year Bear market, a simple reversion to the mean.  Did it come of an Irrational Exuberance that continued to feed on the hype of its own excreta, or did the Bull owe its birth to the Laffer Curve and Reagan's tax cuts.  Five explanations - take your pick. <br /> <br />I was a little troubled that Bonner and Wiggin praise Supply-Side Theory on one page and mock it on another, especially after their digression into Nietzsche in order to explain wissen und erfahrung.  It's a simple idea.  There is knowledge from theory (wissen), what we think we know and what the crowd believes, and knowledge personally derived from the school of hard knocks.  Guys, we don't need to go to Nietzsche to explain that the difference between theory and practice is that in theory there is no difference and in practicethere is.   <br /> <br />But, like I said above - this is an entertaining and an important read.  A literary/historical approach to the economics of the end of the American Century.  Read it and weep.  Read it and reap. <br /> <br />Hold on to your hats.  It's a rough ride ahead. <br />	2004-08-05

US	50076057	RTCWO6DDA8G9J	0195153472	628563862	Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase	Books	5	19	20	N	N	Fascinating History of the American South	This book had strong content and very weird organization.<br />On the plus side:  Kennedy puts together a commanding set of facts to show that while Jefferson's words rang strong and true, the man himself was hamstrung by his allegiance to his class and could not affect any change regarding slavery in America.<br />One reviewer called Kennedy's work a Marxist critique of southern history.  I would argue precisely the opposite.  The \\"lost cause\\" of the title was the idea that yeoman farmers, tending their own farms for their own benefit would lead to a strong, engaged and committed citizenry.  This was originally a Roman idea shared by men such as Adam Smith, James Oglethorpe, George Washington and Alexander Hamilton.  This practice was in place in the Northern colonies and later the Northwest Territory, and led to economic development and economic independence from Great Britain, industrialization, wealthy citizens and a diversified economy.<br />In the South, the plantation system meant large farms run by absentee landlords who exploited and ruined the soil, enslaved and robbed people of self-initiative (those people being the slaves), stifled diversification (all hail King Cotton), discouraged industrialization, and prolonged dependence and subservience to textile manufacturers in Liverpool and Manchester.  Since the people actually working the land did not have a stake in it, or in the care of the tools they used, the factors of economic production - capital, land, tools and labor -all were \\"run into the ground.\\"  <br />The lasting effect of the plantation system - low wages, demoralized citizens lacking entrepreneurial spirit, ruined tools, ruined fields, death and suffering - strongly parallel the effects of 60+ years of Communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and before that the effects of British absentee ownership of Ireland.  Indeed only in the past couple decades, a full century after the fall of the plantation system, is the South now reviving with manufacturing, entrepreneurship and economic diversification.    Post Communist Eastern Europe has strong resemblances to the Reconstruction South.<br />Therefore, if anything, Kennedy's book affirms the social, moral and economic benefits of  the Capitalist market system of small time farmers and business owners over the ruin that stems from collectivization of any sort - Communist or Plantation.<br />The rest of the book is a wonderful excursion through the history of the deep South. This is what I enjoyed about the book.<br />On the negative side:  the book needs a new title, the current one is misleading.  The book is not really about the Louisiana purchase as much as it is about how Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and their cohorts lead the nation down a path to a condition that would only be rectified with much bloodshed in the 1860s.   <br />The book needs better organization (this is the worst organized book I've ever encountered).  <br />It needs a new appendix. The book mentions Aaron Burr and his doings, trial, conspiracy, sentencing, exile, etc. without provide some sort of appendix to tell us about Aaron Burr.  All I know about the man is that he dueled with Alexander Hamilton and won.  I think the author presume much to much on the readers part when it comes to Burr.  That was troublesome.<br />The matter of how and why the Louisiana Purchase came to be is found in ONE obscure paragraph buried deep in the book: Napoleon's real interest was the  income from sugar plantations in Haiti - Louisiana served only as a source of material to operate the plantations in Haiti -- and when Haitian rebels took over (sound familiar?) France was forced out of the sugar business and found a better use for  Louisiana: cash it in - cheap.<br />Finally, the book comes together only on the final page when Kennedy sums up Jefferson's accomplishments and failings, especially how his ideas finally came to fruition under Lincoln and in the various Homestead Acts.  <br />All in all, despite its numerous faults, I highly recommend this book.  It is a very interesting and engrossing history of the US acquisition of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas; the personalities of Jefferson, Washington, Madison, Monroe; Native American-African American-European and American relations and quite a bit more.  Lots of food for thought here. Great book.	2004-02-25
US	50076057	RV48ODZBTMS3W	0679433325	398249945	Where I Was From	Books	4	22	28	N	N	Geography, Genealogy, Generations and the Great Divide	Californians think they're special.  There is no doubt about that.  The first thing a native will tell you upon introduction is how many generations their family has been here.   They don't do that in Boston -- where old families know they're old families and don't really give a damn if you know it or not.  They don't do that in DC, New York or Toronto.  But they do it in California.  Those who have been here awhile will tell you exactly how many generations a long while is.  <br />Didion's book is filled with that  brand of smugness - the one-upmanship of who's been here longer.  <BR>Personally, I don't care.  <BR>I don't mean to be too harsh on the book, though, for on another level this is a story not of geography or genealogy but of a generation - the generation born in the mid-to-late 1930s - too young to remember the Depression but old enough to remember the way America \\"used to be.\\"<br />My parents are from that same generation, and Didion bears a resemblence to a cousin. My grandparents are of the same generation as Didion's parents. Like them, we also have a family graveyard (ours is still in the family, still accepting members).  And my father was an aerospace worker who lamented how things changed in his 42 years on the job, happy to now be retired.  <br />I mention all this because \\"Where I Was From\\" had its greatest impact on me not as a depiction of the changes in the Golden State, but as a depiction of how a family ages,  of how the older generations pass over the Great Break of the grave and the Great Divide of death.  While it may feel true that the land is yours only after you bury your dead in it, underlying much of this book is a sadness that this may not be enough, that not even the graves of the elders shall be respected with the passage of time - that graveyards will be sold, driven over, dug up.   That progress will efface all markers.<br />In retrospect there appears to have been no redemption for passing over the Great Plains.  Perhaps there will be or will not be a redemption after passing through the grave. There is here an acceptance of the possibility that all is meaningless; and I was left with the impression that the title is facing the wrong direction.  Perhaps it is not so much \\"Where I Was From\\" but \\"Where I Was Going.\\"  The promised land of the Golden State may prove to be nothing other than a hustler's illusion, there for the masses to devour only to enrich those who in turn will become the Disillusioned.	2004-01-16

Indeed, if economic models were this much fun when I was an undergraduate, I might have become an economist.<br />Funny thing though, this was not written by an economist, but by a geophysicist.<BR>It seems physicists and psychologists in particular are writing more interesting economics books these days than economists themselves.  <br />The core focus of the book is a derivation of a market model that includes value investors, momentum investors and the herding effect of individual economic agents acting in a world of partial information.  The final model is stunning.<br />Sornette points out the main problem with predicting bubbles: even if all the signs say \\"yes,\\" there is still a pretty good chance that the bubble will be self-correcting.  Turns out chasing market bubbles is a little like chasing soap bubbles - they may simply disappear at any moment.  Thus, the book and the model are of limited use in any type of market timing.  Indeed, the model suggests that the market should now be in the tank, and yet it continues to hover on the higher side of its expected range.<br />As much as I loved the book, there was a slight aftertaste that this was all nothing but a very mathematical and high-minded type of technical analysis.  That at base, when all was said and done, this was not all that different from the various \\"tools\\" in the chartist's handbook, e.g. MACD, RSI and OBV, etc., etc., etc.  The difference may be solely that Sornette knows his statistics and would easily and readily dismiss any model which did not perform significantly different from chance.  <br />Finally, this book will have you trotting out your old high school calculus book.  It brought back memories of just how much fun mathematics can be.<br />All in all - I give it 5 stars.	2003-11-06
US	50076057	R3CJR2UCL5NXC3	0471443069	500982182	Practical Speculation	Books	3	12	14	N	N	A Few Pearls but Mostly Filler	I was looking forward to this book after having enjoyed Niederhoffer's first, but ultimately I found this one lacking.<br />The read got off to a good start.  The tone was not as cocky as the first book, which made it more readable and enjoyable.  By about page 150 or so, I started to get the idea that there was precious little here.  I was looking for some heavy statistical testing of interesting market strategies.  For all the horn blowing, there were very few statistics and very few ideas.  The ones I took away were: invest on the swing in the VIX; and look for companies with decreasing inventories, decreasing shares outstanding (buybacks) and decreasing A/R ledgers.  The only other chapter of interest was the history behind  the Value Line timeliest 100 stocks and their performance over time.<br />I enjoy reading about Victor's father.  I mean that sincerely. Arthur Niederhoffer sounds like a truly wise and wonderful man.  It's moving to read his excerpts here, and of his son's relationship and feelings for his dad.  May we all be so blessed with great fathers.  <br />There are interesting discussions on the FDA and how it adversely affects health care in this country;  and modern management methods which are both touchy-feely and authoritarian at the same time.  Good bits, but tangential to market speculation. <br />The rest of the book covered  baseball, fishing, horseracing, racquetball, checkers; a few gratuitous digs at Warren Buffet and David Tice, and a few well-earned digs at Alan Greenspan.  The correlations between baseball strategy and market strategy were not convincingly explored statistically or causally and all in all I missed the point.  This just didn't seem serious.  It seemed like filler.  In fact most of the book (except the bits mentioned above) seemed like so much fluff.	2003-11-06

My eye-opener, though, was not so much Ted Owen's abilities to affect the weather, sporting events, etc., but everyone else's strong and determined disbelief that he could do any such thing.   The feeling was something like waking up one day and discovering that you live in a different world than most people; and though you knew it, you never really \\"knew\\" it.  It's like discovering that gravity or electricity - common forces that one has accepted as basic facts of life - are preposterously outré for most of the people around you.  <br />Say you've experienced static electricity while combing your hair.  You can make your hair stand up using some invisible force of attraction.  But since the comb doesn't actually touch your hair and \\"magically\\" works at a distance, no one believes you.  Instead of combing their own hair to check this out, they tell you that you are fooling yourself, that you're crazy - even dangerous.  Doing un-godly things.  Exercising evil powers.   Some do decide to check you out.  They wet your hair to conform your phenomena to their experimental methodology; and when the \\"comb effect\\" doesn't work, you're labeled a charlatan.  So it goes.<br />If you find yourself in such a place, you either become an extraverted psychic pyrotechnician like Ted Owens or you hide this ability under your hat and quietly conform to the critics.<br />Owens clearly had \\"issues\\" -some sort of narcissistic disorder for which he compensated by using his powers - like a huge neon sign that said \\"Look at Me!\\"   Through self-hypnosis, he worked and developed his ability until it reached a high power level.  To continue the electrical metaphor, it's as if he combed his hair a lot and saved the electricity in a Leyden jar for later use, or figured out the principle behind static electricity and then created an industrial-strength dynamo.  <br />His personal idiosyncrasies do not invalidate his powers, nor are they necessary concomitants to those powers.And his powers do not absolve him of their reckless use.<br />The Space Intelligences: maybe, may be not.  <br />Many traditions around the world (especially in the East) stress that psychic powers should be used for the good of the community but are really best left alone.   They are distracting sideshows on the road to \\"better living.\\"  <br />Mishlove does an admirable job laying out the story, the evidence, and the counter-evidence.  The writing is accessible.  The author manages to tell the story as objectively as possible and dispenses with the eerie or \\"woo-woo\\" angle -- which could easily be played up to increase book sales.  No, one gets the clear impression that Mishlove published this book as a duty to science and not to line his own pockets.  He did so at some risk to his career as well.  His motives are honest.<br />All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about humanity's latent abilities.   For further study check out biographies on Swedenborg, Tecumseh and just about any Saint or Swami worth their salt.	2003-06-24

Here's A Ph.D. in mathematics with a highly scientific mind who attacks science with science (in this way he could be labeled a \\"metaphysician\\"); a man who would destroy people to save them from \\"the system\\"; a student of the humanities (literature, languages, philosophy, history) who acts inhumanely; a loner who would rather be in the wilds of Montana but now finds himself in the belly of the beast he so hated.  His dissertation was on \\"Boundary Functions\\" but it seems that for all his breakthrough thinking, he malfunctioned at the moral boundary.  <br />Finally, here is a man who dismisses morals as \\"mere\\" emotions that are irrational and without an objective, scientific foundation, who at the same time was driven by the emotions of rage, anger and revenge.  If emotions and morals are invalid in the service of humanity, certainly they are invalid in the pursuit of destruction.  <br />Alston wants to place a lot of the responsibility for the Kaczynski's anger on the General Education curriculum then taught at Harvard.  I thought it strange that the books and authors Chase mentions are books by my idols!  But I draw very different lessons from the works of Dostoyevsky, Melville and Mumford than does Chase.  There is a lot that can be said about the Gen Ed curriculum, but based on an intense personal experience with most of the writers mentioned here, I know them to embrace humanitarian ideals and to move beyond despair.  To lay the causative influence of the Unabomber here is mistaken.<br />The author asks:  \\"Is intelligence evil?\\"  Answer:  No, of course not.  Intelligence is a tool.  Chase gives us only half of the picture when he lists all the tyrants and genocidal killers who are intelligent without also listing all the brilliant people who benefited humanity- whether that be in science, the humanities, medicine or religion.  The very question is dangerous, for the anti-intellectual class would pick up on that immediately and march forth under this banner that ignorance is bliss, that the intelligent are wicked, that books should be burned, etc. etc.<br />Then there is Henry Murray.  So what if his favorite book is Moby Dick and he has interesting nocturnal trysts with his assistant.  Odd, but not evil.   As far as the \\"dyad\\" is concerned, I wasn't there; but it doesn't sound any worse than the standard fraternity or military initiatory hazing.  True, the CIA was up to some really strange and evil things that violated the Nuremberg Code it its investigation of mind control techniques, but the dyad does not seem to be one of those.  It did use deceit - which is unethical - but otherwise I was surprised by how non-horrific the interrogations were - as presented here.<br />Chase like Kaczynski seems not to trust psychologists.  Perhaps with good reason, since the court appointed psychologist seem to discover whatever the court wants them to discover about Ted's mental state.  For the final analysis of Ted's personality, Chase turns to the Enneagram. And the Enneagram is presented as the final word on the type of person Kaczynski is.  This is pseudo-science, and the author knows it.   While the Enneagram seems to describe Ted rather well, it is hardly scientific.  But perhaps that is just as well.<br />All in all, \\"Harvard and the Unabomber\\" was an absorbing read.  It touched me in a deeply personal way. As a history of the Unabomber case, it's pretty good.  As an analysis of the root causes to explain, \\"what exactly happened to Ted?\\" - I think the author injects far too much of his own story into this analysis and doesn't support many of his theories as to why Gen Ed, Harvard or Henry Murray caused Kaczynski to terrorize the system.	2003-06-23
US	50076057	RLDAA87GWNHHL	0385484917	600360522	Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Warren Buffet: A National Treasure	It Couldn't Have Happened to a Nicer Guy<br />Lowenstein achieves a rare feat in business biography:  I came away from this book with a warm glow and a deep respect for one of the leading lights in American business: Warren Buffet.  Quite rightly, the author likens Buffett to a combination of J.P. Morgan and Will Rogers - someone who has a sharp mind for business, who banks on character rather than glamour and who can spin an instructive and entertaining yarn on how the world works.  Buffett is truly a national treasure.<br />Indeed, Buffett's upbringing, the story of his youth and his approach to life and business brought back memories of the values, character and hardwork of my grandparent's generation - values that seemed to have been eclipsed in the past 40 years.  Buffett's story serves to remind us that those values still work and can serve as the basis of solid success in business and life.<br />But the book is actually much more than the story of Warren Buffett.  Within its covers the reader finds the central biography, three smaller biographies and a discourse on value investing.  The three short biographies are of Ben Graham, Kay Graham and John Gutfreund: each a very sympathetic and humanizing portrait.<br />The sections on value investing presented the most cogent arguments against Modern Portfolio Theory and the Efficient Market Hypothesis that I have read yet.  I knew there was some dissension as to the merits of EMH - but nowhere had I encountered this convincing an argument against it.  Somehow Graham, Buffett and Lowenstein - but mainly Buffett - distilled the argument to a point where I \\"got it.\\"  <br />Naturally, the first thing I did after finishing this book was to rush out and get Graham's \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" which I devoured in three days.  Highly recommended!<br />Lowenstein gets in close to his subject, yet respects his privacy.  I'm still wondering why Mrs. Buffett moved out - but of course it's none of my business.  <br />As with any paradise, there are snakes in The Garden: Dwayne Andreas of Archer Daniel Midland (ADM) and Larry King of the Franklin Savings &amp; Loan of Omaha.  Lowenstein names the first as Howie Buffett's employer and the second as a phony that Buffett rebuffed.  For more on these nefarious characters I refer the reader to Kurt Eichenwald's \\"The Informant\\" and to John Decamp's  \\"The Franklin Cover-Up.\\"  The first is the inside story on ADM price fixing; the latter a somewhat purple-prose, true crime and hard to believe story of a really sick individual.<br />Indeed, I wondered why Lowenstein bothered to bring up King at all.<br />All in all, though, this is a really wonderful book.  Not only will you learn that character still counts in business, but that intrinsic value almost always rises to the top.  Highly recommended.	2003-04-30

The book uses several different arguments backed up with lots of graphs to explain where we are and how we got here. I have a BS in Economics and I like to think a built-in \\"BS\\" detector as well. Indeed, I came to this book very skeptical that it was just another book playing on the public's stock-market jitters.<br />Well, it's been a year since the book came out. The S&P YTD is flat, even with its recent war rally; and it's down 20%+ for the past 52 weeks. We have a war on our hands, the public is hotly divided politically, and protestors are in the streets (I'm writing this from San Francisco's financial district). The Federal Reserve is just about out of options (despite Alan's claims to the contrary). So, if Prechter's not quite batting 1.000, he's still knocking an awful lot of pitches out of the park. Everyday it seems, the Wall Street Journal and New York Times carry economic and business news that confirm many of his forecasts. Things may not become as bad as Prechter forecasts, but it's always prudent to prepare for the worst. <br />The book seems to address two separate audiences: the working stiff whose job is iffy, his mortgage behind and who's buried in debt; and the well-heeled who have the means to plunk down $100k on platinum bars or invest in funds which have a $250k initial investment. <br />There is something here for everyone, whatever your situation may be.	2003-03-25

Chancellor even covers the 90's art market.<br />One constant stands out about market piracy: what is new is old - only the names and games have changed.  Markets have always been manipulated and always will be.  The reforms that follow in the wake of each bubble plant the seeds for the next.  Often because the legislators who enact the reforms are beholden to those positioned to benefit from the loopholes.<br />There are several phrases that seem to pop up with every bubble:<BR>\\"This time it's different.\\"<BR>\\"It's too big to fail.\\"<BR>\\"The business cycle is no more,\\" or some nonsense about reaching a plateau of permanent prosperity.<br />Reading this book will make you think twice about investing in the market.<BR>It'll make you doubt the foundation of the efficient market hypothesis.<BR>It'll show how often the experts are wrong.<BR>It'll show how often Nobel Laureates in Economics turn out to be fools.<br />It will make you think three times about investing in Japan.<BR>Four times about investing in Latin America.<br />And you'll run away screaming from derivatives of any stripe.<BR>In fact, one wonders why the whole shooting match hasn't imploded yet, ala Baring's Bank or LTCM.<br />Devil Take the Hindmost is a fun read.  More important, the next time a Mania strikes - and it will - this book and a general understanding of the history of speculation just might just save you from rushing over the cliff with all the other lemmings.	2003-02-26

Later, a Kiwi acquaintance told me a bit more about him, and then while reading W.H. Brands' Franklin biography, I learned that Cook had navigated the St. Lawrence Seaway for the British just prior to the Battle on the Plains of Abraham.  I became fascinated with Cook, who seemed to have been everywhere and yet was so little known. <br />Blue Latitudes is a \\"where are they now\\" retracing of Cook's landfalls.  More interesting is Horwitz and his sidekick  Roger Williamson's, search for physical evidence of Cook's life.  It's pretty slim pickings.  A man like Cook who spends his life on the sea doesn't leave many traces on land.   Cook was almost as elusive as the historical Jesus: someone who had a great impact on the world but didn't leave too many footprints.<br />Horwitz could have found no better traveling mate than Williamson.  First, Roger brings a lot of boozy humour to the book (maybe too much!). Second, he like Cook is a native son of Yorkshire who also made it to Australia. Third, Cook's crewman of the same surname played a role in Cook's untimely death.  <br />The book could have used more maps.  Nice glossy color pictures would have been nice too.  Overall, though, it's a fun first foray into the life and travels of Captain James Cook.	2002-12-12

The Hugo course struck the right balance between total immersion on the one hand, and just learning select phrases on the other.  This series will give you a quick grounding in the language though it is not as complete as the Barron Foreign Service Institute tape set.  The Hugo audio quality is much better than Barron's, and the speakers are quite a bit friendlier.  (The Barron series sounded like it was recorded in a garage and the speaker was about as friendly as a police interrogator).<br />After working with these tapes for about two months I went to Athens.  I'm pleased to say they worked.  People could understand me without trouble.  However, one gentleman asked me where I learned Greek.  I sounded like I was stuck in the 1950s.  Perhaps it is the difference between Katheravousa (\\"official\\") and Demotic (\\"popular\\") Greek. So, I may have sounded a little stiff, but most everyone understood me.<br />The bottom line: this is the best Greek tape and book course I found for someone looking to learn a lot of useful Greek in a short time.  Highly recommended.	2002-12-03
US	50076057	R37XXXO1QO8THW	0374199639	64824201	The Metaphysical Club : A Story of Ideas in America	Books	5	27	29	N	N	Relevant Reading in Time of Jihad: Absolutes vs Democracy	As I was reading Thomas Friedman's \\"Latitudes and Attitudes,\\" I kept coming back to Louis Menand's \\"Metaphysical Club,\\" where a major theme is how we form beliefs; and how we are to navigate through life in a universe shot through with contingency.  When an absolute belief dominates one's thinking, when theocracy is held high and democratic dissension is not allowed: violence results.  This is as true today with the Islamic Jihad as it was in the antebellum US, when differing beliefs on race and slavery led to Civil War.  <br />To appreciate this fully, one would need to read Menand's book.  It isn't really about a philosophy club - indeed the club is hardly discussed.  Nor is it a biography of the key members of that club - Oliver Wendell Holmes, William James, Chauncey Wright and Charles Sanders Pierce, John Dewey et. al.  It's not even about an idea.  It's about an approach to thinking - Pragmatism -\\"an account of the way people think - the way they come up with ideas, form beliefs and reach decisions.\\"   It's about the interplay of necessity, belief, free will and chance in the face of war, labor unrest and the dynamic growth of a young country.  <br />This is not a biography in the usual sense.  Indeed, the main characters are \\"Representative Men\\" in Emerson's sense  - or - l'homme moyen  -- \\" the average man\\" in The Queteletan, statistical sense.  These are the men who \\"for a given era...represent everything that is grand, beautiful and good.\\"  The book begins with Holmes - whose story opens and closes the book.  Holmes serves the story as an encapsulation of the changes in America, from antebellum Boston-Brahmin beliefs in absolutism and abolitionism to the Supreme Court Justice whose jurisprudence rests on hard-won experience and the first widespread use of the concept of \\"the reasonable\\" man. <br />This approach to biography was both fascinating and frustrating.  Holmes is not Holmes, but the nexus of Emerson, the Civil War, and progressive politic in the court.  William James serves as the point of departure for a comparison of the absolutisms of Agassiz vs. the contingency of Darwin, societal pluralism, race relations, and the assimilation of Eastern and Southern European immigrants into the American \\"race.\\"  Pierce is emblematic of the use of statistics in the analysis of personality traits (the Hetty Green case), and an object lesson in the clash of changing morals and a conservative academy.  Dewey serves as the transition from the impractical Burlington (VT) school of Transcendental philosophy and Hegelianism (absolutisms) to a reformer of education, psychology, university-faculty tenure rights, sociology and labor practices.<br />All of these ideas and currents wend through the individual lives and times Menand covers.  The overall narrative structure of this book is equally fascinating and frustrating.  The reader is forever led down tangents that circle back and intersect with some other section, thought, event, or person covered elsewhere.   In this way, the book really is a tapestry showing the warp and woof of American life.  <br />Menand handles most of the people in this narrative in a dismissive and belittling manner:  Emerson comes across as nothing more than a lapsed Unitarian who never really read a book but grabbed higgledy-piggledy for gems among the works of others. William James is a procrastinating, depressed dilettante and drug taker, a mystic who \\"discovered\\" Pragmatism in the works of a French philosopher, and then promptly dropped it (indeed, this reader got the sense that Pragmatism was not an original American idea at all but was derived from France).  Eugene Debs is a drunk.  All these things may be true of these men, but it is not the key to their greatness or why they are remembered today.<br />One thing I was not aware of which Menand covers at some length, is the degree to which American Transcendentalism derives from Coleridge's Aids to Reflection and how this in turn derives from Coleridge's misreading of Kant.  I studied Coleridge, Kant, James and Emerson at Harvard Divinity School and still I didn't know this.  Must of missed class that day (it was known to happen).<br />All in all, The Metaphysical Club was well worth the time invested.  I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in the development of American cultural identity, history and philosophy.  Of all the books I've read so far this year, this is the one I keep turning over in my mind.  \\"The Metaphysical Club\\" is a thrilling, intellectual and cultural adventure.  Highly recommended.	2002-11-18

Indeed, \\"The Corrections\\" aspires to be \\"The Recognitions\\".<br />This is a post-modernist book. Oh joy. I thought \\"po-mo\\" went out in 90's- or that was my hope. Post modernism is the sampling and juxtapositioning of other previous styles. Franzen's narration wonders through a forest of other author's styles: Thomas Pynchon, Walker Percy, John Updike, Ken Kesey and Don DeLillo (some have said J.D. Salinger -- maybe, but I don't think so). There are pointed references to Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Knut Hamsun and others. After a while the point of reading this book became - \\"Name That Influence,\\" which needless to say detracted from the main story.<br /> The main story: how a \\"typical\\" - that is, dysfunctional -- Midwestern family gets together for Christmas long after the children have flown the nest.<br />Tolstoy begins \\"Anna Karenina\\" with the observation that all happy families are alike and that unhappy families are different in their unhappiness. This does not apply to Franzen's vision of America where every family is either unhappy or lying to itself. What's more, every unhappy American family is exactly the same! How many people have read this book and thought - gee, this sounds like home! Enid's just like mom, Gary's just like me and Jonah's just like Jonathan Franzen as a child. What an amazingly well observed novel.<br />I don't buy it. But that's neither here nor there. I will agree that Franzen renders a penetrating look into how narcissistic deprivation can whack the hell out of family dynamics in a way that passes down through generations.<br />There are, however, some well-written and very moving moments in the book: Alfred Lambert's reflections on Gary's Popsicle-stick jail; Sylvia Roth - out of nowhere, under radar - transforms from a minor character to become a very real, a very deep and profound soul; Chip as the forgotten child at the dinner table; Alfred's final days in the rest home.<br />The novel has much too much of an obsession on sex - and this comes from a reader who likes Henry Miller. The filler paragraphs of sex made almost every man and woman in the book seem like the same stunted 12-year old boy. It didn't seem organic to the characters. I'm not sure whether this was meant to portray Midwestern prudery or the author's mindset. In any event, the book would be improved if this were snipped. *Snip*<br />Also the author is much too focused on furniture and chairs in particular.<br />It's not the book of the century. It wasn't that funny. It did not restore my faith in the novel. Parts were moving. But it's a sad commentary on our current literary scene if this book won the National Book Award.<br />All in all lukewarm recommendation.e novel has much too much of an obsession on sex - and this comes from a reader who likes Henry Miller.

He brings history to life.  <br />The narrative follows from the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill and the mass, world-wide movement of humanity to California to the settling of San Francisco, the rush to statehood and the Compromise of 1850.  <br />The core significance of the book for me wasn't so much about the gold, as about the debates and mounting animosities between slave and free states back east as California sought admission; and about how California, and the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads united a country on the East-West axis, even as the Civil War was forging a new union between North and South.  <br />As Brands presents them, Leland Stanford and William Tecumseh Sherman are as large in the union of East and West as Lincoln and Grant are in uniting North and South.  Stanford as the first Republican governor of California met with Lincoln - the \\"rail-splitter\\" and former railroad attorney.  Grant and Sherman worked together in the war, but before then, Sherman was a banker in San Francisco, commuting between New York and the West coast.<br />From California gold, the narrator follows the prospectors into Nevada and its silver mines.  Brands includes Mark Twain's observations on the silver bubble of that day.  In a manner of speaking, Twain worked for a time as a stock analyst covering Nevada mining companies in very much the same way dot.com analysts operated in recent years.  This was an inspired and fun piece to include - worth the price of admission itself.<br />The only disappointment with the book is the final chapters are a bit rushed.  There is a very cursory discussion of the economics of gold and a denouement in describing the futures of the main players in the story, most of whom - like Sutter - ended their days poor and broken men.<br />If you are interested in the further development of San Francisco and the west, I recommend picking up Gray Brechin's \\"Imperial San Francisco.\\"  That work includes aspects of the California story that Brands does not, e.g., why Fremont named the gate, the \\"Golden Gate,\\" and a discussion of the economic and environmental impact of hydraulic mining. <br />In the main, this is an important and entertaining look at the Gold Rush and the lives of the people who took a part in the event. Highly recommended.	2002-10-30
US	50076057	R2P46SSVZS2SNA	0767905334	421292455	Wealth and Democracy: How Great Fortunes and Government Created America's Aristocracy	Books	5	36	39	N	N	Really, This Book is a &quot;Must Read&quot;	A very important and timely look back at the road U.S. economic and political history have traveled, and a look ahead to where we may be going if we follow the cycles of three prior world empires.  This is one of the few books I would put in the \\"every American must read\\" category.<br />My key learnings from the book:<br />Wealth distribution in the US is dangerously out of balance, and we are looking at the rise of an American aristocracy. <br />Most great fortunes in US and world history were the products not of invention and markets, but of government favoritism.  <br />The \\"market\\" derives from medieval fairs where the church allowed a little betting on the side.  Speculation grew.  The countries with the most speculative cultures - Anglo, American and Dutch - tend to have the most expansive and dynamic economies.  <br />Democracy is a system of government.  Market capitalism is an economic system. Democracy is not necessarily capitalist, and the confusion of the two is a danger to both.  If democracy is viewed as a market, then one dollar is one vote.  Money stands in where the voice of the people should speak.  When it does, as it has recently and in the Gilded Age, a democratic deficit sets in and the road to reform or ruin begins.  <br />Americans believe they are the exception to world history.  I hope we are.  Yet history shows many cultures which believed the same thing and have risen and fallen in due course.  America may be now waking from a long historic holiday from world history.  See Andre Gunder Funk and others as to the source of American exceptionalism.<br />Those who have a knee-jerk reaction against these and other sentiments in the book are missing the point.  Phillips isn't saying the US is going one way or the other.  He is saying, look, this is what's happened to the three most recent world empires.  They all thought they were invincible, but they weren't.  For my money, the best line in the book is, \\"if history books could chuckle.\\"  <br />Wealth and Democracy is especially poignant now that Congress has given the green light on action against Iraq.   Phillips explains why.<br />My only criticism of the book is that it can be repetitive on certain themes.  Otherwise this was a highly informative and educational read.    Highly recommended.	2002-10-11

There is very little new information here. The only thing I learned was that UFOs are also a nautical phenomena. Dolan's presentation is an unremitting assault of fact - or reported facts -- gathered over the years. Unfortunately the facts come in such rapid succession that there is hardly room for breath in between and the result is tedious.<br />The second story regards the National Security State. Again, there is precious little new information here. James Forrestal's apparent suicide, Project Grudge, Blue Book, etc., are all old news, as is the idea that Blue Book was more a PR stunt than a serious study of unknown phenomena. Where Dolan does bring in writers and thinkers like Chomsky, it is to describe how the power structure works in covert operations - not how it may or may not hide UFO information. There is very little \\"glue\\" between the workings of the national security state and UFOs in this book.<br />The half story regards the author's gratuitous and unnecessary inclusion of government mind control experimentation under Sid Gottlieb and MK Ultra, Monarch, etc. This is an important subject. How it relates to UFOs remains a mystery. Again, there is no glue connecting the shocking details of terminal mind control experimentation to unknown things in the sky. <br />Three quarters through the book Dolan writes that if the reader has made it that far, maybe they can stomach yet another unsubstantiated report from inside the NSA. What is this great disclosure? The NSA apparently notes that either something is really going on, or mass psychosis is sweeping the planet! This was certainly the funniest bit in a book largely lacking in humor.<br />All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a concise review of the UFO controversy from the 40s to the 70s. If you already know much of the history, this is not your book. And as far as revealing anything about the national security state's treatment of UFOs - well, the state debunks them. But then again, you didn't need this book to tell you so.	2002-10-07
US	50076057	R1FUO1297596Z4	0385495404	556829614	The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin	Books	5	7	8	N	Y	The Story of the American Prometheus	I've always been a big fan of Franklin and was very glad to learn that Brands had written a new biography of this seminal American.<br />The book is engaging and moves along at a good tempo.  <br />There is a fated-ness about Franklin's life - as if Providence supplied the American colonies with the right man at the right time and place.<br />Scientifically, he was a \\"Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" -- a seemingly 20th century man caught in the 18th century.  His experiments with electricity and his scientific theories were cutting-edge for his time, but today are on par with a third-grade science course.  He saw where science was leading, and thought that he should have been born two or three centuries after his time.<br />Franklin's real genius may have been for people and civic organizations.  Whether on a large scale - organizing a new nation and government -- or the local --organizing fire departments, libraries and an efficient postal service, civic organizations are one of his most enduring legacies.<br />Brands work is no hagiography.  While strong on civic bonds, Franklin's family life is portrayed as something of a tragedy.  I was moved and troubled by his long absences from his wife Deborah, who died while he had been in Europe for 20 years, and his estrangement from his son William.   As Brands writes of the final communiqué between father and son, \\"It was not his [Franklin's] finest hour, and he knew it.\\"<br />Franklin had a reputation as a ladies man, though Brands downplays this quite a bit.  At one point we are told that F's libido, as a youth would prove to be a challenge later on.  This thread is never picked up again.   Instead, Brands reports that most of F's overtures to the finer ladies of Parisian society were rebuffed.  The reader gets the sense that there is more going on beneath the covers than meets the eye.  And inquiring minds want to know.<br />Another more important facet of the life is his religion.  Franklin was a deist,borderline atheist for most of his life.  Yet at the end of his life, Brands stresses Franklin's call for prayer over the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention.  How he moved from a non-practicing Christian to one calling for prayer is an important part of the story.  That it is not developed gave the impression that Brands was throwing a bone to the more conservative members of his current audience. <br />Franklin knew that all human institutions eventually erode away.  In his estimation, if the people of the United States were not virtuous enough -- in a civic, not religious way -- to maintain the nation, it would eventually degenerate into a tyranny.  The challenge that Franklin and the book leave us with is this: When a woman asked him what the congress had created in Philadelphia, Franklin replied,<br />\\"A republic, madam, if you can keep it.\\"<br />Sometimes I wonder.<br />All in all, this is a terrific biography of one of the more important Founding Fathers.	2002-09-17
US	50076057	R2VSRGGU9LYGYS	0520229029	363902245	Imperial San Francisco: Urban Power, Earthly Ruin (California Studies in Critical Human Geography)	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A Fascinating History of San Francisco	I was first drawn to this book because of its cover photo: the intersection of Market, Montgomery and Post Streets in the heart of the financial district in San Francisco sometime in the early 20th century.  Today my office looks out at the very same intersection.  A (very) current photo would show me waving from a window above the building on the cover's front left.  <br />That aside, I found this to be a very entertaining and enlightening history of the Bay Area.  Using Lewis Mumford's concept of the Pyramid of Mining, Brechin structures his history along these main lines: the Gold Rush; San Francisco as the Golden Gate of US dominance of Asia; water, Hetch Hetchy and land values; newspapers and the shaping of public opinion; Mining and Munitions; and finally UC Berkeley, E.O. Lawrence and the mining of Uranium and Plutonium.<br />Brechin's book is a serious, down to earth history.  It is important for understanding not only the history of the west, but also the history of the US and Western Civilization's march from east to west to encircle the globe.<br /> The comments in the next few paragraphs are my conceptual riffs - my connecting the dots - the dots that Brechin provides. <br />Brechin's work reminds me of David Ovason's book  \\"The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital.\\"  Like Ovason, Brechin brings an art historian's eye to San Francisco's cityscape and public art - telling the history behind the art, what it means and what the underlying story really is.  Whereas the first book deals with Washington, D.C. as the New Rome filled with Masonic symbolism expressed through astrological orbits, \\"Imperial San Francisco\\" deals with that city as an even later New Rome - a Constantinople -- dominated by the technology of Mining and Munitions expressed through atomic orbits.  There is an axis that follows directly from Washington, DC through the Gold Rush of 1849 and on to the bright star in the east over Hiroshima in August 1945.   It makes me wonder if the fireballs of August 6 and 9 in 1945 are somehow related to the sun's setting position in Washington around August 12th of every year.  (see Ovason for more details).<br />In 333 AD Roman Emperor Constantine the Great moved his capital from Rome to Constantinople.  I was in Istanbul (Constantinople) in 1995 and was struck at how similar its topography is to San Francisco.   I learned from Brechin's book that I was far from the first to note the similarities.  For example, California pioneer John Fremont named the Golden Gate in reference to the Golden Horn of Constantinople - the water route by which the riches of the east flowed to the capital. Over the years many San Franciscan city boosters have hailed San Francisco as the New Rome and the New Constantinople.  <br />Brechin explores how both Rome and SF both built their pyramids of power on a basis of gold mining, and how water was channeled via long aqueduct systems to both.  <br />He explains and documents that the Polk administration knew of the existence of gold in California at least two years before it was publicly announced.    Once the stage was set and the time was right, Polk presented a huge nugget of gold to Congress and the Gold Rush was on.  And what a myth the Gold Rush turned out to be!  Most lost money.  Indeed, as Brechin shows, each $1 of gold produced cost a total of about $5 to produce when land degradation, soil erosion, clean up and other costs are included.  <br />Toward the end of the book, the author traces how Silicon Valley arose.  What he doesn't get into, but others have, is how similar the dot.com bomb is to the Gold Rush.  We are even now living in the shadow of the tech wreck, which while born in the Bay Area, affects the national and even the world economy.<br />All in all, a very interesting read. Highly recommended.	2002-06-24

Books	4	32	46	N	N	Hey Mike, You Forgot Jars -- Women Need Us to Open Jars	You have to hand it to Michael Moore: he stands by his principles.  Even though he's become an international celebrity (they love him in Toronto), he still proudly carries the imprint of his Catholic/Union/Michigan industrial, \\"guy\\" roots.  You can take Mike out of Flint, but you can't take Flint out of Mike.  <br />In the \\"about the author\\" section at the end of the book, Moore mentions that among other things, he is an Eagle Scout.  Being one myself, I thought it might be useful to review his book according to the Boy Scout Laws.  Therefore, we ask are the book and its author:<br /> Trustworthy:  Yes, the book is trustworthy.  Most of his claims are footed with their sources given.  I certainly trust Mike more than most CEOs.  The book tells it like it is.<BR>Loyal:  The fact that Mike lives in Manhattan, spends a lot of time in Paris and still continues to visit Flint, MI is proof enough that he is loyal to his hometown.  Outside of loyalty, why would anyone visit Flint?   Despite all the failings he finds with the state of US governance, he still calls this home when he probably would feel a whole lot better in a place like Toronto or Stockholm.<BR>Helpful:  Yes.  The book is very helpful in spurring its readership to take action in the political process: write representatives, march, unionize, and run for office.  I never thought about actually running for office until I read this book!  Way to infuse some life into the national debate.<BR>Friendly:  Yep, Mike is one big likeable lunk, about as friendly as a Labrador.<BR>Courteous:  I found only one bad word in the whole book.  I think the book is about as courteous as one can be when talking about hypercritical politicians, stolen elections and corporate greed.<BR>Kind:  Yes.  Mike is kind even where he could really sink his teeth in and give his prey a thrashing.<BR>Obedient:  Well.  The book doesn't advocate disobeying any laws.  In fact the book demands that the powerful and privliged live by the same lawsas us common folk.  On the other hand, the book does encourage a healthy skepticism of power.  I'm sure many corporate and political masters do not consider Mike very obedient.  <BR>Cheerful:  The book makes the Rep/Dem/Corporate trashing of America about as cheerful as anyone can possibly make it.<BR>Thrifty: Arthur Carey states in his 1915 \\"The Scouts Law in Practice\\", that \\"A scout is thrifty. He does not wantonly destroy property. He works faithfully, wastes, nothing, and makes the best use of his opportunities.\\"  Mike lives by this law.  Unlike Enron, Global Crossing, and so many industrial polluters.<BR>Brave: Yep.  It takes a lot of courage to speak truth to The Man.<BR>Clean:  The book is suitable for family reading, though Mike himself could probably use a shave.<BR>Reverent:  Yes.  An entire chapter is a prayer to The All-Mighty, beseeching Him to awaken the Pharisees of Power to their in-born but little-used sense of compassion and humanity.   <br />Just a few more points:<br />The one thing woman will still need from men (beyond the obvious) is not a long arm to reach a high shelf.  No, the correct answer is \\"to open jars.\\"<br />The book is very effective at reminding all of us how the Democrats and Clinton conned us into thinking they are better than the Republicans.<br />Some of the material is dated.<br />Some of the material is addressed to those in high school, which is terrific, because the book engages the young in the political process.  There's a real \\"you can affect a change in the world -- really\\" message here.<br />The book was written pre-Enron and pre 9-11, and through no fault of its own, it shows.  In fact, it almost predicts Enron.<br />All in all, great job, Michael.   Stupid White Men gets a thumbs up from me.	2002-06-21

When I picked up this book thinking it was his take on 9/11, I was disappointed to find that most of it was about Timothy McVeigh.  <br />The first piece in the book is about 9-11, but it doesn't say much, and it ends abruptly with a list, several pages long, of US military actions.  Most of these are against Serbia and Iraq, which I consider to be two campaigns, not a dozen (though he is technically correct of course). One action in Turkey in August of 1999 may actually have been a humanitarian effort after the Istanbul quake that killed 20,000. (I remember it well for my wife was in Turkey at the time). So, the first essay was a non-starter.<br />Subsequent bits were about McVeigh and Vidal.  Vidal gets some mileage from the fact that neither Vanity Fair or the Nation printed these articles, the implication being that they were too hot to handle.  Strangely, I didn't get any heat at all, and suspect that they weren't published simply because they weren't very good.  <br />This being said, Vidal cites two books that seem interesting: Joel Dyer's \\"Harvest of Rage\\" and David Hoffman's  \\"The Oklahoma City Bombing and the Politics of Terror.\\"   The Hoffman book, though published in August of 1998, is already out of print and available for a steep premium from used-books sellers.  It was either too good and a danger or it simply didn't sell.  The premium suggests it's causing someone some discomfort...	2002-05-02

It spans most of human history and the entire globe.  It has history, economics, money, adventure, world politics, war, personalities, social commentary, geopolitical strategy, geology, geography and the lyrics to the Beverly Hillbillies theme song.   <br />Through almost 800 pages, Yergin manages to sustain a high level of interest.  The writing is logical and concise without being dry.  He manages to follow oil into all its nooks and crannies and yet to keep things organized so it is easy to follow.   It's a page-turner!<br />I cannot say enough good things about this book.  If you want to understand the economic and social history of oil and its role in the modern world, this is the only book you'll need.	2002-05-02

Reading this book, my overriding thought was, \\"Thank God for the Balance of Powers!\\" <br />It is not a big national security secret that Ronald Reagan is a likeable guy. Despite what other reviewers imply, I did not get the impression that FitzGerald dislikes the former president or is out to belittle or poke fun at him. In places, her portrait of the man is even endearing. Where she does point out his shortcomings, she uses documented quotations from those who worked in the Reagan White House or on his campaigns. I can't see how that is controversial, especially since all of the critical comments she relates are from conservatives. <br />Reagan may have had a hands-off management style, but clearly he was a shrewd politician. As an actor, he knew the power of image, and how to use it. Reagan also had a genius for making the small move that gave big returns, like the \\"impromptu\\" fireside chat at Geneva with Gorbachev. FitzGerald relates these events but underplays Reagan's good moves and emphasizes his disinterest in policy and micromanagment. Carter micromanaged and I can't say America was better for it.<br />It's interesting to me that the reviews here are of a piece with the on going debate over military and nuclear strategy. Some claim that FitzGerald doesn't know the subject. FitzGerald herself often claims that many of the principal policy makers in the story didn't know the subject. The game rule seems to be that anyone who doesn't share your opinion doesn't know what he or she is talking about and is a radical of the opposite camp.<br />Of the cast of characters, the US Congress, particularly Sen. Sam Nunn and Rep. Les Apin come off best. On the White House team, George Shultz appears as a reasonable and decent man, probably the best of the bunch. Cap Weinberger seems an insecure bulldog who doesn't think much for himself. Paul Nitze is more human than I remember him. Richard Perle, well, is Richard Perle; and Bill Casey is the American Brezhnev: an old ColdWarrior who was not keeping up with the times. Lastly, George Bush is largely quiet and off camera (doing God knows what).<br />In retrospect all this blather about arms control came to naught. The Soviet Union imploded from its own dead economic weight. It had nothing to do with the arms race. <br />SDI would have been no help on September 11th. Nor would it be any help against chemical or biological weapons. (Ironically, Reagan gave $300 million, arms and training to the dogs that returned to bite America's hand: the Afghan mujaheddin, and their leader Osama Bin Laden. So much for defense.)<br />My opinion (fwiw): SDI is a boondoggle. Still is. It will never stop a terrorist. It will only stop domestic programs, create budget deficits and (listen up you conservatives!) cause Congress to raise our taxes to pay for it (for which Bush, Sr. was denied re-election). The only real reason I can see to support SDI is if you are a defense contractor. Profit is good, but let's be honest about our motives.<br />The book is timely for today, as the Bush Jr. administration replays Reagan's best scenes. <br />Despite all the naysayers, I give this book 5 stars, as a well researched, respectful, thought-provoking rehash of the Reagan years and how a nation had its chain pulled in the name of the Strategic Defense Initiative.	2002-02-04

This is the most accessible, down-to-earth and learned rendering of this guide to spiritual liberation that I have encountered in modern American English.   Thurman even manages to work in a little humor on the edges.<br />What this translation makes abundantly clear is just how many chances in the in-between we have for liberation.  Apparently one has to be very non-aware to go through the in-between and miss the chance for stepping off the carousel. of samsara.  (So why am I still here?)<br />It would be interesting to devote some time to a cross cultural/cross discipline study of death, dying and beyond.  In particular, a study comparing Stan Grof's 3rd perinatal matrix; Sufi descriptions of the interworld (barzakh) and the world of Harqalya (see Corbin's Celestial Body); some schools of visualization/dream work; descriptions of the astral world (Robert Bruce's and Robert Monroe's works in particular); and shamanic traditions would be illuminating.  Throw Dante in for good measure.  There appear to be large areas of overlap and agreement as to what happens during death, and what happens next.  (Get enough blind men together and compare their impressions of the elephant and a clearer picture may come to light.)<br />The best thing about this book, however, is that it invites the reader to learn the Tibetan death ritual for oneself.  It helps that, as the book explains, our after-death mind is nine times more intelligent than our current mind.  So just a little application now in learning these texts will go a long way later. <br />Face it.  At some moment in the near future you will close your eyes for the last time on this world.  Death is more certain than retirement - and longer.   Like anything else, the more you learn about it and get acquainted with it, the less shocking and scary itwill be.	2002-01-21

Do It a Favor -- Read This Book	I would have to agree with John Bogle's endorsement: \\"This is a great book!\\"<br />While Malkiel's Random Walk covers Modern Portfolio Theory, Bogle covers the virtues of index investing, and Graham, Lynch and Fisher cover individual stock selection, studies show that asset allocation alone is responsible for over 90% of a portfolio's performance in the long run. Yet asset allocation theory seems to me to be under-represented in the investment literature for non-professionals.<br />Bernstein's book goes a long way to correct this gap. He starts out almost too simply. Bernstein takes the reader step-by-step through a discussion of basic financial math and statistics (hitting variance and correlation coefficients in particular) as he builds the case and explanation behind asset diversification. He writes to an intelligent audience but does not assume a mathematical or financial background. I like that he encourages the reader to take a chapter at a time. He instructs the reader to finish the chapter, and then put the book down and get back to life. This adds to the methodical tone of the book: a step at a time.<br />In the final chapter \\"Odds and Ends\\" the author changes gears. Suddenly we are in the world of - well - odds and ends, the finer points of portfolio management. This was the most interesting part of the book for me. Here Bernstein reviews the case for index investing and - of special interest to me - value investing. What is the premium in returns for small vs. large caps, value vs. growth? Which MPT stat, P/E or P/B is the better predictor of future performance? Why is value averaging so important and yet so counter intuitive? This chapter alone was worth the price of the book.<br />Finally, Bernstein shares the wealth. The bibliography and recommending reading sections are terrific. This alone might be worth twice the price of the book.<br />In a time when we are all more intimately involved with the management of our retirement accounts, I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone and everyone. You cannot afford not to be familiar with the contents of this book. Highly recommended.ok highly enough to anyone and everyone. You cannot afford not to be familiar with the contents of this book.

Like the Escher drawing of one hand drawing the other in a chicken-and-egg creation loop, conservation of structure and adaptation to environment each give rise to the other.  <br />The universe is self created -- no God required!<br />The authors present biology in the most beautiful poetic prose.  If high school biology were this eloquent I may have taken a different path, i.e., my ontogenic drift would have been altered.<br />Reading their words, I had the same response as I do to the poetry of Wallace Stevens.  The show clearly how language is something we &quot;do&quot; and a medium in which we exist.  How language gives rise to mind, consciousness and self-awareness.  It brought new meaning to Steven's line, &quot;Man made out of words.&quot;<br />Part of their narrative drift is an explanation of the workings of the neurosystem.  How it is neither representational or solipsistic.  We are not &quot;like&quot; computers at all.  We do not repond to &quot;reality&quot; out there, but to the neural electrical impulses the external reality triggers on our membrane.  From these impulses to the brain, we create a model of the world and respond to that.  Looking at others respond we say they exhibit certain behaviour because we interpret their movement in the context with which we see them.<br />Their entire approach is systems oriented.  They stop and language and consciousness, but I would be interested in seeing how their ideas continue into the realm of economics and culture.  But these areas are out of scope for this slim volume.<br />If you are interested in biology, NLP, Buddhism, neurology, linguistics, systems theory, Bateson, Stevens or the movie &quot;The Matrix,&quot;  this book will give you a lot to chew on for a good long while.  Highly recommended.	2001-08-16

It reminds me of Walt Whitman's line that its not the book but a piece of the man himself that you touch when you read it. The writing was very clear, accessible, and left me with the impression that I was in the actual presence of Vimalananda. I could smell him.<br />Having said that, this is the story of a Hindu shaman/sorcerer. Like a shaman he has powers, communes with spirits, is a healer and something of a joker too. Vimalanand has a great wit. And sometimes when he's in the middle of a serious story all I could think was, this guy's trying to pull my leg. You could almost see him winking at you in between the lines.<br />As an approach to God, this is not for me. It's a very dangerous path, physically, psychologically and spiritually. As a westerner, I just listened. I didn't get the urge to go out and try this stuff myself. There are enough warnings in the book to that effect as well.<br />The section on sexualtiy was very enlightening and surprisingly modern. However the practice of Vajroli is beyond credulity. I would have to see this with my own eyes to even begin to believe it's possible.<br />I was just getting to the chapter on spirits and thought &quot;yeah, yeah. Right.&quot; One night I left the book in my car inside a cheap bookbag. The next morning I got into the car and found someone had broken into the car to steal the book. Nothing else was taken. I dont know if this was a synchronicity, bad luck or spirits, but it certainly made me wonder. I waited 3 months before buying another copy and finishing. True story.<br />Bottom line: I would take it all with a grain of salt and with a lot of caution. This book packs real power.	2001-08-09

Emerson, Self-Reliance<br />Eric Schlosser shows that little has changed in the meatpacking business since Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle in 1905. Indeed things have gotten worse.<br />The book is very easy to read. If you don't already know what's in the meat, this book will tell you that very clearly. I would not call Schlosser a muckraker so much as a consumer advocate. In an area where the meatpackers exercise such incredible control of their own QC processes, logs, inspections, government regulation and press, the public needs to know what it's eating.<br />Schlosser's not saying don't eat meat or fast food. He is saying, &quot;think about where the food came from, about how and where it was made, about what is set in motion by every single fast food purchase, the ripple effect near and far, think about it. Then place your order. Or turn and walk out the door.&quot; <br />It's your money and your health. It's your choice.

Despite a degree in International Economics from an east coast school known for its School of Foreign Service, I firmly believed Max Weber that the Protestant work-ethic was the source of western prosperity.  I also believed in American exceptionalism.  Frank's book cured me of both those false notions.<br />A couple points I'd like to add to Frank's thesis explained in other reviews.<br />1) I work for one of the major trans-Pacific ocean shipping companies.  The company was founded in California in 1848 and sold to the Singapore government in 1997.  (Shipping going East)<br />2) US-bound shipments are full of manufactured goods.  Asia-bound ships are filled with wastepaper or are largely empty.  The West continues to produce nothing that Asia really wants.  Where in times past, most of the Asian-bound shipments from England and the Netherlands were boats filled with silver and gold, today we \\"ship silver\\" to Asia in the form of electronic fund transfers.  Given the trade deficit the US alone has with China and the rest of Asia, it seems only a matter of time before the Chinese start buying Manhattan and US assets the way the Japanese did in the 1980s.<br />3) Frank's book adds an interesting background to the history of the Roman Empire.  After subjugating Europe, Rome moved eastward under Constantine the Great.  First, Constantinople provided a more defensible position for the New Rome (indeed where the western capital - Rome -- fell in the 5th century, the eastern capital - Constantinople -- continued until the 15th century, despite being \\"on the way\\" as it were for invading Huns and other invading armies).  But perhaps more importantly, all the commercial action was centered in the East.  Moving the capital eastward took it out of the backwater of Italy and moved it closer to the overland trade routes with the Asia).<br />4)That the East was far wealthier than the West can again be seen in microcosmic perspective during the 4th Crusade.  Western soldiers had never imagined a city as wealthy as Constantinople.  When they saw it they had to have it.  The West, especially Venice, did to Constantinople in 1205 as the British did to Bengal in 1857 and the Americans have been doing to the Native Americans since they got here.  They took by force, not by superior ethic, religion, tradition, or racial superiority.<br />The book itself, despite its \\"must read status\\" and historical importance, is very poorly written and highly repetitious.  If you read the concluding few pages, you will have the main points of the argument. Read the rest of the book if you want the details.  And Frank provides plenty of detail, footnotes, references, etc.<br />All in all, this book is important for understanding the world's past as well as the contours of the future.  I wonder how long it will take for the pendulum to swing back to Asia.  Chinese-US relations are getting interesting, aren't they?	2001-05-17

It is the Moby Dick of the 20th century, where the hunt is on, not for the Great White, but for Rocket 000.<br />Pynchon knows his history and entwines it into the story in such a way that it becomes hard to know what is real, and what is not.  The result: paranoia.  And paranoia is a condition of the modern individual.  <br />After reading this for the 3rd time, I became aware of things like Operation Paperclip, John Foster Dulles' work for Nazi industrialists, MK ULTRA, intelligence work with LSD and other drugs, the official abuse of children, and Pynchon's work took on more and more meanings.  There is a lot here.  And if it is difficult to read, consider what it was like to get the &quot;A treatment&quot; at Cornell or Harvard and keep your sanity -- TK is a case in point.

As an introduction to that topic I would give it 5 stars --  it makes an otherwise bewildering subject somewhat approachable.  But  overall, the astrology here is not convincing, despite the back cover.  <br />In the Astology of Death, Houck showed himself to be a tough critic of  astrological methods.  Here, that critical element is missing.  Things are  fudged a bit.  So, I recommend it as an introduction, but then you'll have  to get books from India to really explore Ashtakavarga techniques further.	2000-09-02

It is packed with exciting ideas for  chart interpretation that bring you to the boiling point, and then leave  you there.  I found this frustrating and leaving me to wonder if the whole  point of the book wasn't simply to advertise the contributors' private  practices.  <br />You'll get great ideas and perhaps a springboard or two for  further research, but don't look for any in-depth discussion.	2000-08-31

Clearly written, easy to  follow along, and quick enough to read, it serves as a good executive  overview and thought generator.  If, as he maintains, you follow along  these 10 guidelines, you'll prosper in the times ahead.  But not without a  few bumps in this most dynamic, chaotic world.	2000-08-25

Through our combined learnings and accumulated metaphysical  know-how, humanity has reached a point where we can all do whatever it was  we were doing before we had to earn a living.  <br />Unless of course the  &quot;pirates&quot; of capital, aka &quot;The Grunch&quot; cheat us of our  rightful inheritance.<br />Critical Path is about the evolution of know-how  from the beginning of humanity to the present.  Fuller charts out where we  came from, the accelerating advance of learning, the ephemeralization of  tools and technology and where we go from here.<br />He also charts out where  the &quot;pirates&quot; came from and how they maintain their grip on  things.  Indeed I was surprised at how candid Bucky's comments are in this  regard.   It's as if he somehow got inside the inner clique and is  reporting its machinations to the rest of us.  Read it and see!<br />Finally,  this is a book of suspense.  Bucky felt that the war between mind and  muscle was coming to a head.  He died in 1983 and seemed to predict that  the battle between the pirates and humanity would come to pass in the  1990's.  I not sure what he would make of things today, but I would  recommend that in addition to reading Critical Path, check out the  Buckminster Fuller institute's web site and get a copy of &quot;GRUNCH of  Giants&quot;  (Grunch is the &quot;Great Universal Cash  Heist&quot;).<br />Fuller said he was ahead of the times by about 50 years.   This makes Critical Path mandatory reading from now until 2030 and beyond.   <br />Do yourself a favor and become familiar with this friendly genius.	2000-08-23

Books	5	121	123	N	N	An Esoteric Tour of the US Capital	It's generally well known that many of the Founding Fathers were Masons.  Ovason presents convincing evidence that Masonic symbolism is hard-wired into the layout of our nation's capital.   <br />To do so, he reviews the  beginnings of the city: Washington's selection of this site for the new  nation's capital, the design competitions, the building projects.  Having  lived in DC at one time, this alone made the book worthwhile.  Ovason then  overlays the city with all the astrological symbolism that can be found  around the district.  Some of it is in the open and is plain for all to  see.  Other things are hidden.  Better yet, alignments between zodiacal  symbols have meanings and the author careful spells it all out.<br />I won't  give away the complete story, but Ovason has discovered something in the  layout of Constitution Avenue,  Pennsylvania Avenue and the Old Post Office  that locks heaven and earth together and gives literally concrete meaning  to celestial symbology.   Washington is the New Rome, and our Founding  Fathers carefully imprinted their hopes for the future in the very streets  of the city.<br />You'll never look at Washington, DC the same way ever again.	2000-07-27

Patton uses Area 51 as an entry into the psychology of the era.  The skunk works, strange lights in the sky, the secrecy and paranoia all  come together in a sane and down to earth commentary on those times.  <br />I  especially enjoyed the history of Area 51, the workings of the Lockhead  SkunkWorks, and the story of the U2 and other spy planes. I was distrubed  by the book's portrait of Curtis Lemay (of Dr. Strangelove fame)and his  nightly bombing raids on American cities. Strange things indeed were  happening in the skies.  They may still be going on.<br />Patton's style is on  the level and humorous at times, a delight to read.  Highly recommended.	2000-06-14

I remember it as being one of the least memorable books I ever read.  Friends whose opinion in these matter I value gave it very high praise.  I read it again.  The jokes were D.O.A.,  the satire limp, indeed nothing.  My wife recently picked it up and  struggled to finish it, it was so boring.  The jury seems strongly divided  on this book.  Check it out at the library and test drive it, then buy if  you like it.	2000-06-05

The book is big, which gives it enough space to delve into the tragedy of the two younger James brothers, the maturation of William and Henry Jr., and the closeted life of Alice.<br />I came away with a new respect for the somewhat eccentric Henry Sr., with his diverse interests in educational philosophy, Swedenborg, and Emerson. He is the under-sung hero of this narrative and its true author.<br />Perhaps I enjoyed the book most of all because it allowed me to feel almost a part of the family, to live what to me is a fantasy. If you feel yourself a kindred spirit to William, Henry, Jr., or Sr., or Alice, I would heartily recommend this book.	2000-05-31

Consider.  If you were a Harvard Medical School professor with a Pulitzer prize and a sterling reputation would you endanger it for the sensationalism of  &quot;alien&quot; abduction?  Even if you were confronted with evidence of  strange events, why put up with all the headaches?  That Mack did proves  him to be a true man of science, one who investigates phenomena instead of  prejudging it as valid or not valid.<br />Mack is not saying outright that  alien abductions are &quot;real.&quot;  He is saying that something is  happening that leaves a real and lasting effect on people.  These events  have certain characteristics in common.  Mack is mapping the terrain  features of a new psychological continent using the case histories of  individuals who have come forward.  These individuals are also taking  serious risks.  <br />In truth the issue is not alien abduction per se, but  what Mack calls the politics of ontology.   <br />Personally I have had more  than my share of &quot;interesting&quot; events.  Mack's book, though not  overtly written for this purpose, is a guide by which those who quietly  keep to themselves may evaluate how their experience compares with others.  <br /> If you are interested in a serious exploration of this topic, this is  the best book on the subject.	2000-05-30

Gaddis' work is far more mature, wide ranging and dispairing.  His  erudition is breathtaking.  The work attacks the fake and counterfeit in  society, art, Christianity, personal morality and business.  My favorite  bits are Gaddis' thrashing of Dale Carnegie's &quot;How to Win Friends and  Influence People&quot;, and the weird flashes into the pagan  underpinning  of Christianity.  Many questions are raised and left unresolved, indeed are  unresolvable.  The narrative is left in fragments that bleed in all  directions, blurring the line between narrative and non-narrative, the  conscious and the unconscious.   It is a beautiful if bitter book.<br />PS  In  my opinion The Recognitions and Gravity's Rainbow are very different and  not derivative one from the other. The Recognitions is about fakes, its  style jagged fragmentation, highly realistic.  GR is paranoid, fragmented  like an opium dream or acid trip, and it comes off like a big practical  joke or comic book.  Read both! Don't think if you've read one, you've got  the other.	2000-05-30

A complete waste of time and money. This is as spiritually nutritional as a fast food meal. That so many find it inspiring is a sad testimonial to the state of spiritual health and depth in the world today. On the other hand, spirit is where you find it. Personally, I couldn't get this book out of my library fast enough.	2000-05-30

I am now on my third reading, and I appreciate it more each time.<br />Houck is  very precise in his methodology.  He establishes his rules of evidence at the start and then  systematically works through many charts showing how his system works.  There is no obfuscation in this book.  It is as clear, crisp and pointed as  a razor's edge.<br />The author packs the book with interesting facts,  philosophies and news items about death.  I came away from this book  feeling a lot more at peace with death as a natural part of living.  After  years of &quot;The Denial of Death&quot; this book makes it something to  look forward to if only because it is so interesting.<br />There are two more  things I love about this book.  Houck has a tremendous sense of humour.  In  an area of life that all too easily can be grim and macabre, filled with  black humour, he manages to render death a humourous human foible.  Nothing  to take too seriously.<br />Lastly, I love the graphics in the book. Pick it  up and see what I'm talking about.<br />All this before one even gets to the  astrology.  I have studied western and eastern systems for almost twenty  years, and I agree with the author as to why Hindu or Vedic astrology is  superior to the western system.  What is new here is tertiary progressions,  how they tie into the Vedic dasha/bhukti system, and the role of pre-natal  eclipses in a chart.  His technique has vastly improved my ability to time  events in the charts I read.  While I haven't instituted such a policy for  myself, I can understand how Houck ofers a &quot;double your money  back&quot; guarantee on his readings.<br />Thanks, Mr. Houck, for a great  book.	2000-05-26

Athos and a month-long tour of Istanbul and Turkey.  As an American-born, Eastern Orthodox Christian, I was familiar with the general history of Christianity in this part of the  world. I did not know or appreciate the extent to which Orthodoxy has dried   up or been driven out of Turkey, the Levant and Egypt.  It is truly sad.   Outside of Greece, the Orthodox world has the feeling of a ghost  town.<br />Dalrymple's book brought a vividness to much that I witnessed  firsthand but didnt have the background to appreciate.  He is a far more  intrepid traveller than I.  Highly recommend, it is an enjoyable,  entertaining and thought-provoking travelogue for any who are interested in  Orthodoxy, the middle east or simply good travel writing.	2000-05-22
