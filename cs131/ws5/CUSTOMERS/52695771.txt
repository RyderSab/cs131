SOS is certainly a wonderful book, as is nearly everything Toni Morrison has written--I have read four of her novels, and haven't yet been disappointed.  However, I don't see it as her \\"masterpiece.\\"  I felt that Part Two seemed to drag on and on for too long until it became boring.  Other than that, however, the rest of the book is captivating and, as usual, is phenomenally written.  The ending is also wonderfully open-ended.  Still, I don't think it's as good as BELOVED, THE BLUEST EYE, or even JAZZ, which I think is as good as anything else she has ever written, despite being so maddening.  Despite its flaws, though, SOLOMON is still a fascinating, interesting read.	2002-04-21

I was fascinated by this book, except for the last 100 pages or so, which I found miserably boring in comparison with what had come before.  It was interesting to find out what happened to the women after leaving the jungle, but did we really need to go into that much detail about it?  I found myself losing interest very quickly...other than that, however, the novel was engrossing and suspenseful.  I found all of the characters, especially the four daughters, to be well-written and psychologically realistic (I found myself loving Adah, hating Rachel, annoyed/charmed by Ruth May, and ambiguous about Leah...)  However, I would have enjoyed hearing some of the story told from Nathan's point of view.  I felt that, as it is now, the novel seems overly \\"feminist\\" in that it is told by five women, all of whom feel persecuted by the main male character in the novel.  Although I dislike Nathan and do not sympathize with him, I think that allowing him to tell his side of the story would have made him seem more of a realistic, three-dimensional character and would also have strengthened the book as a whole.	2002-04-20

However, no true Joni fan should be without this book, mainly because of the wide array of interviews it includes with Joni over the past thirty years.  While the critical reviews and articles are mildly interesting, the real joy lies in reading Joni's own words from her interviews.  In reading them, the Joni fan is bound to feel as though they have gotten to know her even more intimately than through her music.	2002-04-20

It's wonderful to read analyses of Morrison's extremely complicated novels written by a real person, in real language that isn't phony, confusing, or pretentious.  Ron David writes as a real person would talk, something that I found extremely enjoyable (although I can see where some would find it annoying).  I love that, while he praises Morrison as the finest author of our time, he is not afraid to point out and openly criticize much of her writing, particularly THE BLUEST EYE.  I thoroughly enjoyed what he had to say about JAZZ; if anything, he makes you feel better about not understanding all of her writings.  David's admittance that he doesn't understand what the hell JAZZ was all about is enough to make us all feel better about not understanding it, either.  His style is wonderfully intimate, friendly, and easily readable.  This book is highly reccommended to anyone who has struggled with Morrison.  It also made me feel proud to discover that many readers are never even able to finish her books--and I've read four.	2002-04-20

Treachery, lust, betrayal, and violence occur, shattering a child's view of the world around her.  It is a startling, unpredictable start...unfortunately, Parts Two and Three (McEwan seems to think of his novel as theatrical, in the tradition, I suppose of Greek tragedy) can't measure up.  I personally find war fiction to be incredibly boring, so was disappointed to find that Part Two was all about WWII.  And Part Three, as an elderly woman travels home for a family reunion, feels surprisingly cloying when placed next to the dark, brooding suspense of Part One.  The novel feels very uneven, and I was disappointed to see it go downhill, especially since the beginning is so promising.	2002-04-20

I don't quite know what to make of THE CORRECTIONS, which is either being hailed as the best book of the year or an overhyped mess...I think it's somewhere in the middle.  Franzen is undoubtedly talented, and the best parts of the novel are magnificently written.  It's obvious that he has real ability and a lot of guts.  The novel is certainly more ambitious than almost any other new fiction book, and it is filled with scenes that are either horrifying, heart-breakingly sad, wildly funny, or deeply shocking.  On the other hand, much of the novel (which is far too long) is so slow-moving that I found myself actually skimming pages, something I hardly ever do.  I couldn't help it; I was desperate to finish the book one way or another.  Certain sections feel pathetically overdone--Franzen never gets tired of driving home the same points, over and over again.  How dysfunctional these families are!  How empty are their lives!, etc.; he seems to be shoving it down our throats.  The best moments of the book are its most subtle.  And, I also kept getting the feeling that Franzen is way too cocky for his own good; he's a great writer, but at times the book feels too smug.  It's either impossible to put down or else dreadfully boring.  I have to say, though, that the final chapter (ONE LAST CHRISTMAS) is absolutely gorgeous, and perfectly tragic.  The final 100 pages are just masterful.  However, they aren't enough to make the book a masterpiece in my mind...it still feels very uneven to me.	2002-04-20

It's better than the too-long SONG OF SOLOMON, but still not as good as JAZZ--her best novel, if you ask me.  THE BLUEST EYE is amazing, though, and at times deeply depressing.  I found the incidents with the cat and the dog to be particularly horrifying, and the rape scene is written so horrifyingly well that I practically felt guilty--as though I were the rapist.  It's an incredibly powerful story with a very sad ending...and the mysterious, lengthy conversation that Pecola has with her \\"friend\\" near the end still has me wondering who she was talking to.  Has she already gone crazy?  (She mentions that no one else can see this \\"friend.\\")	2002-03-31
US	52695771	R27ZHGYMXT9WRL	0452269652	522305574	Jazz	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Great	This was the first book by Toni Morrison I had read, and I was a little intimidated.  I listened to the audio book.  Her soothing, calm voice and the poetry of her language quickly absorbed me and I was deeply entangled in this fascinating, strange story.  However, I was very confused from the middle all the way until the end...narrators keep switching and the time period keeps jumping around.  I was so frustrated that finally I had to actually read the book, and now I feel more confident that I understand it, but not really.  Anyway, her language is so beautiful and unusual that, coherant or not, JAZZ was worth the read.  I'm now reading SONG OF SOLOMON, and that too is confusing at times but good so far.	2001-09-16

JIMMY CORRIGAN exists in the world of images, and that is its strongest feature: thousands of amazingly intricate, absolutely gorgeous drawings that are too beautiful to be called comic strip panels.  This book is simply phenomenal.  I read it in three days and absolutely loved it; it is the best book of the year and I had to buy it.  There are so many details that you could read it a hundred times and still find new touches you missed before.  I also loved the way that the book ended, without a real resolution.  It was a poignant and fitting end.  This is a real masterpiece.	2001-09-16

While some parts of the novel are admittedly a little weak, everything builds to create an astonishing whole.  Reading it, you are constantly on the lookout for characters, events, even mere words that make reference to those from the other sections.  All in all, there are dozens of connections.  In particular, I found countless references to bats: a man who comes into Saturo's shop wears a shirt with a bat on it; the Mongolian folk stories mention bats; Mo finds a dead bat near her cottage; her husband is blind (as a bat); the DJ's name is Bat Segundo, and so on.  Also, nearly every section makes a reference to babies, pregnancy, and/or abortion: Quasar is haunted by a baby he sees on the subway; a friend of Satoru's has just had an abortion; Neal and Katy cannot have children; the tea shack woman longs to see her baby grandchildren; the Mongolian spirit saves a baby's life by transmigrating into it; Margarita speaks highly of abortions; Poppy may or may not be pregnant; Mo looks back on the birth of her son with joy and happiness; etc., etc.  All in all, the book is a wonderful read--full, funny, terrifying, beautiful--and Mitchell is an amazing writer.  I must also speak up for the \\"Petersburg\\" segment, which is one of my favorites, despite the fact that no one else seems to care for it at all.  I found it interesting and highly suspenseful.	2001-05-20

Leebron's short, succinct, unnerving tale of a family's (near) collapse makes for fascinating reading.  It's a completely unromanticized look at married life in the real world, complete with whiny spouses, annoying kids, problems at work, arguments at home, and meddling in-laws.  Violence erupts without warning, and the family is nearly torn apart as each character undergoes considerable unhinging.  I loved this book because it is certainly a depressing and dark look at the need to make &quot;six figures&quot; and keep up with the Joneses.  Many of the incidents are disturbing and get under your skin.  This book deserves to be thought about long after it's finished.  It also benefits from loose ends that stick out like sore thumbs; as with life, certain questions are never answered.  SIX FIGURES would make a great film and I couldn't help seeing it as a movie in my mind.  My favorite character was Nan, the wife's bitchy mother who you soon love to loathe.	2001-04-28

After waiting almost a year for it to come out at  last, the book is well worth the wait.  It is written very well, concisely  and easy to understand, goes through and touches on a variety of aspects on  the film and includes a number of beautiful color photos.

As I had hoped, A KISS BEFORE DYING delivered twounbelievable surprises that shot me out of my seat.  And, as with Levin's superior novel ROSEMARY'S BABY, Levin uses a simple but firm prose.  It was a fairly satisfying read. On the other hand, I was disappointed.  The first part of the book is almost a blow by blow ripoff of Dreiser's AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY.  Between its clever surprises, I was left bored and counting pages.  And the ending is sadly contrived coming off of its earlier brilliance.  A KISS BEFORE DYING is worth a read for its several shocks, but the rest is dismissable, dated, and sadly predictable after fifty years of similar TV movies.	2000-07-03

This one is particularly good in that it has lots of good photos, is easily readable, and offers extensive information on all  of Kubrick's films, right down to the insignificant details that other  books overlook.  Example: it recounts all of the projects that Kubrick  planned on working on such as A.I and his long-awaited Napoleon film.  It  goes into tons of details about the making of each film, the critical  reaction, Kubrick's little touches, follow-ups and other spin-offs each  movie produced, in short everything about each of Kubrick's films.  Also,  complete and accurate summaries of each plot, cast and credits lists, lots  of photos of the rarely-seen director and even much kind insight as to the  director's personality and private life on his English estate.  I was a  little disappointed that Howard didn't wait another four or five months so  he could include all of the details about Eyes Wide Shut as well, because  now all that exists are rumors and info about the making of the film, but  its distracting to read about the movie being top-secret when now it has  long been out in the open.  Anyway the book is packed with facts for any  fan.	2000-05-13

Nelson goes into so much detail about each film--nicely excluding the early films and Spartacus, which don't fit into Kubrick's signature style--that its  exhausting.  But most of his info is psychological, and this can be very  confusing to people like me who aren't educated in such metaphysics.  He  goes off on lots of tangents that I, being a literate and knowledgeable  person, sometimes just don't understand.  He makes some good points though  and the book is good.  I admit I'll probably look for the new edition with  Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut added on.	2000-05-13

Magnolia was brilliant, fearless, and  sorrowful. It was a perfect marriage of a talented director, a great cast,  and the perfect song compilation of Aimee Mann (the CD is indispensable, I  listen to it, or at least all of the songs by her, all the time).  The  frogs, the musical montage, all of the twists--the entire movie was  magical, real and yet surreal.   Now this book is a wonderful way to  remember the movie.  The script is helpful in finalizing all the details  many missed when confronted head-on with so much to take in.  Plus, I love  the bonus stuff--an introduction by the director, plus a new interview  where he talks about the frogs, the music, that weird character that was  eliminated from the film (I can't think of his name), deleted scenes, Aimee  Mann, and his favorite character.  Plus complete cast, great for keeping  track of all the actors, many from Boogie Nights, another **** Anderson  epic.  AND, fifteen pages of gorgeous color photos, both stills from the  film and pictures from the set with Anderson and his actors.  What more  could you ask for?  It's the definitive screenplay book for an  unforgettable movie.	2000-05-13

This collection is the first of many featuring Bertie Wooster, a none-too-bright English gent, and his ingenius butler Jeeves, who is constantly thinking of schemes to get Bertie and his  friends out of trouble.  The Jeeves stories are a great place to start for  anyone interested in Wodehouse's funny work.

Though many may find Nathaniel Hawthorne's writing boring or too descriptive, I think that every sentance serves to bring the book to life even more.  The story itself too  is fascinating, especially since the characters of Hester and Dimmesdale  are not clearly good or bad.  They've sinned, but they are still good  people, or are they?  Is Chillingworth really truly evil or are his motives  justified?  And then there's Pearl, the strange little girl who posesses  unusual thoughts and character traits while still being the scarlet letter  come to life.  Altogether the book is a great study of shame and guilt for  any age that is mature enough to appreciate it.	2000-03-11

It had its flaws, it was certainly a challenge, many parts were entertaining, and now I can say I read it.  But it is by no means perfect.  I also have to admit that I was Boooored during many parts of the book.  I  liked the more &quot;personal&quot; side of the story, dealing with the  characters' lives, their loves, etc. much more than the long-winded  sections describing the battles and Tolstoy's ramblings about history. The  second epilogue seemed to take an eternity to finish.  I guess what I'm  trying to say is that even though I didn't catch every last detail of the  novel, it doesn't matter because I still got something out of it and I  understood Tolstoy's point.  I think he would agree.  I'd also like to say  that anyone who decides to read this book is in for a long, hard journey,  but hopefully they will find some part of it to enjoy.	1999-12-04

There are many different interpretations of the meaning of this story, but I like to think of it as the &quot;dark side&quot; of  Victorian literature.  It is also interesting to point out the many erotic  overtones in the book.  As for the story itself, it drags a bit, and though  it is genuinely creepy in some parts, the ending is so quick that  everything is wrapped up in two pages, with a &quot;happily ever  after&quot;-type ending that has Van Helsing bouncing Mina and Jonathan's  child on his knee.  However, though the book does have its faults, it is  still a classic novel of English literature and should not necessarily be  classified as &quot;horror fiction&quot; when there is a lot more there to  be discussed.	1999-11-06

I was lucky to have found my copy in the library.  The book is both very funny, touching and violent,  with moments of brilliant humor, suspense and romance scattered throughout.   Goldman can make a somewhat silly idea seem unquestionably plausible.  The  book switches back and forth from present time to the past, then back to  present time.  Also, the movie (starring Anthony Hopkins and Ann-Margret)  is wonderful if you can find a copy as they too are scarce.  Great to read  and watch if you can find copies.	1999-09-12

This book is excellent  because it gives all the details of Chester's life, his trial, and love  letters written between him and his girlfriend whom he later murdered.  For  people reading the novel, which I am doing now, it is also helpful because  there is a chart telling who each of the characters was actually based on  in real life.

Anyone who loves the film (like I do) should buy this book.  It tells about the actual possession case that inspired the book and the movie, the making of the  movie and the plot, plus discusses deleted scenes and interesting anecdotes  about the movie from the director and the actors.   Also, if you like this  you should definitely rent or buy the new video re-release.  It contains a  new documentary and the original trailers.  It is even better seen in  letterbox.

The film itself is an extraordinary and powerful thriller and love story--anyone who has seen it can never forget  its beginning and ending scenes, or its beautiful sex scene between Julie  Christie and Donald Sutherland.  The movie is filled with hidden secrets  and little details which this book does a good job of pointing out.  It  also goes through, shot-by-shot, the opening and climactic scenes.  A very  interesting book.  It also helps that the author writes on a personal,  intimate level without being stuffy or confusing.	1999-07-03

However, this is a nice book for anyone interested in the late Stanley Kubrick, a film genius whose works ranged from sexual thrillers and science  fiction epics to period dramas and war films.  It contains some nice  photos, as well as just enough information about each film.  I bought it  after seeing only three of Kubrick's films and it compelled me to see five  more.	1999-07-03

Here are the pros and cons of the novel. King's story is surprisingly original.  I must say this is a new direction for  him.  The novel contains some interesting plot twists.  I liked the  &quot;crossword puzzle&quot; theme especially.  Rogette Whitmore is a  strong, frightening character, the kind you love to hate.  And the final  paragraphs prove to be an interesting conclusion to the story that  surprisingly impressed me. BUT...that's not to say the novel has many  drawbacks.  The third-person narrative stinks--one minute Mike is a serious  literary personality, quoting Maugam and Hardy, but the next he babbles on  childishly about erections and breasts.  Kyra and Mattie are annoyingly  perfect.  And, needless to say, the plot seems to drag on forever. BAG OF  BONES is sadly a disappointment.  It has its faults, but I guess it's  good-natured and kind of innocent.  It's truly a mixed bag.	1999-07-03

Othello has such suspense, and plays with the idea of fate controlling our every moves.  MacBeth is  the dark play that deals with our fears and our primal ids.  Hamlet is the  supreme story that sums up all of life's ups and downs. And Lear,  well...Lear is about relationships.  It's best scenes involve communication  between two souls, or lack thereof (though Gloucester's blinding scene is  quite dramatic).  Sadly, Lear is just too long for my liking, and I longed  to hear more from the daughters--Regan and Goneril are so nasty you love to  hate them, and Cordelia is so gentle that you love to love her.  I must  say that this is a wonderful play, filled with action and double-crossing,  sure to satisfy.	1999-06-26

Hopefully these books will attract more fans as they did me.  MacBeth is a truly nightmarish and  spooky play, filled with revenge, adventure, guilt and redemption.  My  favorite scene is the one in which Lady MacDuff and her son are attacked by  the Murderers, immediately after a heartbreaking conversation together.   The contrast of motherly love followed by brutal murder is at once horrible  and fascinating.  The Roman Polanski film is especially noteworthy.	1999-06-26

Jeremy Irons brings out all of Humbert's excruciating  obsession; The young Dominique Swain is a lovely Lolita who perfectly  captures her seductiveness and childishness at the same time.

Though it is clearly wrong for a middle-aged man to  have a sexual relationship with a young girl, I must remind you that, no,  he was NOT a child molestor.  Instead, Humbert is a troubled man consumed  with unexplainable feelings for this girl--he feels she is his angel, his  Beatrice, the one being that seems to surpass all around her.  Such  characters of divine perfection are common to anyone with knowledge of  literature.  I remind you once again that this is a tale of that one  perfect thing that we always strive to reach, but which always manages to  slip through our fingers.	1999-06-26

Now I  have found all of my old books by Roald Dahl and want to read them again,  to remember how good they all are!  However, if you liked Dahl's books when  you were a child, his adult short fiction is just as great, and when you  read it you feel just the same as you did reading &quot;Matilda.&quot;   Also, the movie is not as annoying as it might have been, but the book is  still better.	1999-06-05

I remember reading it as a child and still enjoy looking over my old copy.   Dahl perfectly understands what children like to read about: wacky  characters, nonsense, funny words, candy, and the good side winning out in  the end.  Though the classic fairy tales of the Grimm brothers, famous for  their uncompromising endings, are also important children's stories, Dahl  almost always, without shame, shoots and scores with a happy ending.  The  characters are all unforgettable, and the movie is likewise a  &quot;scrumdiddlyumptious&quot; treat.  Treat a child you know to this  wonderful book.	1999-06-05

I just read it for the second time. It is one of the three  best plays I have every read in my life, and believe me, I have read all  the plays worth reading. This is almost as good as &quot;Who's Afraid of  Virginia Woolf?&quot; Once again, I love love love love love this play and  all the characters. There is a movie. Don't see it. The play is better.  Read the play. There are many great moments: Tobias' &quot;cat  speech,&quot; Tobias' memorable four-page closing speech, all of Act Two  Scene Two, all of Act Three, Claire's disturbing interpretation of what  it's like to be an alcoholic...they go on and on. This is my theory of what  the play is about essentially: this is the story of a family who does  nothing all day but sit and drink and b*tch about how terrible their lives  are. They have lots of money. They have good friends and a good family. But  they have let their lives go to waste. They've let life pass them by. Now  they are old and sit back and realize how much they've missed. But not  before much turmoil and anger are let out. There are a husband and wife in  the play who sleep in separate beds, until one night, for lack of room,  they are forced to sleep together and they realize: THEY LIKE IT. But they  have wasted years and years of sleeping in separate beds. Am I rambling  like a lunatic? Sorry. Just read it please or else I have typed all of this  for no reason at all.	1998-09-12

This was a great play about a lot of touchy issues  that were dealt with well. It shows that a lot of times families have a lot  of problems, and you can argue and fight over them, but in fact they are  very difficult to overcome. This is a family that will be torn apart  forever because of what has happened to them, and that's a very tragic  thing. BUT. My only complaint is that Eugene O'Neill, despite being very  courageous and brilliant in writing this play, gets a little wordy. I think  that the whole dialogue between Edmond and Tyrone at the beginning of the  final scene is uncomfortably long--some of the dialogue I believe could  have been cut. Then again, it's just my opinion. It is, however, a  wonderful play.	1998-09-12

This movie is  important because he doesn't show the case for or the case against  this  family of pornographers and drug users--he shows them as people, and lets  us make our own opinions about them.	1998-08-23

I particularly cared for Laura, who is clearly the most tragic of all the characters. I was near tears during the final moments of the play when she shows her glass unicorn to Tom, and even more touched when she chooses to give it up...the thought of a helpless girl alone in a world of glass figures is simply heartbreaking. &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; is simply a masterpiece, better than any of Williams' other plays because it depends more on human emotions than the others do.	1998-08-01

To those people obsessed with Stephen King and Dean Koontz and similar horror stories, try a real nightmare which is what Macbeth is. Filled with blood, black magic, witches, darkness, fire, unnecessary death, revenge, and madness, it is the first ghost story. I personally think Roman Polanski's film of the play is also very scary. In truth, I was failed to be frightened by &quot;Psycho,&quot; &quot;The Exorcist,&quot; or &quot;Halloween,&quot; this is a much more exciting, enriching, and entertaining read.	1998-08-01

For one, the best element is that the horror and suspense all come from seemingly normal, everyday things. A world where the bad guys are the quirky next door neighbors is a lot scarier than one where the ridiculous horned monsters are the bad guys. Two, his dialogue is sparkling. It's as if all of the characters are real flesh and blood, the way that they speak so realistically. Three, I found it very interesting that Levin approached writing it not by using big words and long, complicated descriptions. His sentances are short, precise, and sweet. It makes a nice &quot;relaxing&quot; read. Also, the movie adaption is one of the best films ever made and is brimming with excellent performances. Read it and see the movie. I totally agree with the reader who commented on the movie being the best adaption of a book to film.	1998-07-18

So I guess I can thank you for inspiring me to read &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot; probably one of the best things I've read. A very gentle and uplifting story that is exciting and not too long (only about 100 pages), that breaks the image of Stephan King being a stereotypical horror writer. The final pages of the story sum up all of its feeling. I also read &quot;Apt Pupil,&quot; an incredibly different story that I also liked though not as much as RH&amp;SR.

Most people would probably assume that the book sucks. Guess what? It does. I'm sorry, but Charles Dickens does not happen to be my cup of tea. He may be a master, but it's impossible to deny that his writing is dry and the story drags in many places. I counted numerous parts of the novel that could have easily been eliminated without affecting the rest of the book. And what the h*** is Pip thinking at the end when he decides to marry (person who I will not name)? Seems to me his only reason for doing this is that he's completely desperate and tired of chasing after Estella all that time. It totally came out of nowhere and wasn't very realistic. The book's really not that bad, but apart from the interesting episodes with Miss Havisham, it's pretty boring.	1998-05-30

I especially found the chapter about Garp, Helen, Harrison and Alice's little &quot;crisis&quot; to be a little appalling. Also, it's hard to sympathize with Garp when he's such a pathetic character.

For years the book sat on my shelf, always mystifying me. Just yesterday a friend of mine told me she just finished it. We had this amazing conversation and I realized (with her help) that everything really is a metaphor for something else (people who have read the book might understand when I explain). For example, the rose represents a child because the LP (little Prince) loved it and took care of it. When he found the rosebushes he realized that his flower was not special. But it was unique in the way that he had raised it and so it was different from all the other flowers.   The sunset = happiness. The LP searched for the sunset wherever he went like a person searching for happiness.  The boabobs = bad child. They needed to be tended to while they were little like a naughty child, so that they did not grow up and destroy the planet.  The snake = death. He befriends the LP but tells him in some metaphorical way that he is inevitable. Also, it explains itself at the end when the snake kills him.  The stars = faith, religion, God. There is a passage in the book that says, the stars are many things to many people. To the wanderers they are a guide, to the scholars they are a problem to solve, to the businessmen they are wealth. The wanderers are like lost souls looking for God, the scholars are theologans looking for proof if God exists, the businessmen are like evangelists who look to God for profit. Also, the king tried to rule the stars but could not because they belonged to everyone. No one can rule God, He belongs to everyone.  Lamplighter = devotion. He could have gone to sleep, but insisted on carrying out his duties.  The well = faith. The LP and &quot;I&quot; searched for the well in the desert and insisted on it being there, even though they didn't know for sure. This is like a person believing in God even though they've never seen Him.   The TurkishAstronomer = descrimination. No on!e listened to his ideas until he changed how he dressed. This represents how people judge other people by appearance.  Little Prince Leaving Flower = Child Growing Up. She had her thorns for defense but it was still a transition into life on her own, like a child going into adulthood.  King's Robes Covering the Planet = People's possessions cluttering their lives. There was no room for anything else because his robe was in the way.  Geographer = law, justice. He was like a judge, carrying out the orders after they were proven. He had his explorers report to him with their findings (like attorneys) and after he had confirmed what happened, he wrote them down. It also represents how he didn't care about the flower unless it was ephemeral--like a judge who doesn't care about anyone unless they have anything to do with his profession.   Message of Book = simplify your life. All that The Little Prince had on his planet was a flower and three mountains. He was extraordinarily happy, until he came to the other planets. Everyone else was busy with something, but his simple life made him happy. It was the sunset at the end of the day (or any time of the day) that made his life worth living. All of the other people on the other planets were preoccupied with alcohol, figures, reigning over everyone else, etc, all &quot;matters of consequence,&quot; and they weren't happy. The little Prince was happy.   Whew!	1998-04-10

I am writing a book now and am taking no crap from anybody on how to write it because it's my own creation.

John Irving is the most delicate, intelligent, exciting, engrossing, and endearing author to grace the earth. This was the first book I read of his, and the last two pages made me both burst into tears and burst out laughing. Everything comes together tragically and beautifully, along with some of the best writing in years. He surely deserves a Pulitzer for this novel, surely his best. I am severely surprised it didn't get the recognition it so rightly deserves. All of the characters will never leave your mind. As for the plot itself, it just takes one dramatic and jaw-dropping turn after another. The abortion theme is the whole setup of the novel, but I think what is really Irving's focus is just to tell these people's unbelieveable and heartbreaking stories and to get them through and touch lives. He has certainly touched my life and this book will continue to haunt me and forever remind me of what real writing should be.	1998-03-28

And I am a very tough critic when it comes to fiction. He is the only author who has ever made me cry while reading his novels. This is the only book that made me break down into tears twice automatically. His twists, his turns, the way he sculpts the plot and sets everything up is almost in the traidtion that Hitchcock used to direct his films. Everything comes together in the final chapter as surprise upon surprise is revealed. This book will open your eyes both literally and figuratively, despite a lot of boring political opinionated crap. Irving also has the amazing power to make you laugh out loud. These are some heartbreaking and hearttouching characters you will never forget as long as you live. PS--I liked &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; just a tad bit better.	1998-03-28

His characters, the way he weaves his spell is amazing. Also, I like his gentler side--he mixes in God and religion with an evil spirit and cats nailed to road signs. And we let himoff the hook for it! But really, he's one of my favorite authors, has been and always will be.	1998-03-28

Anyway, the ending of the book is better than the ending of the movie (the heart-stopping thing). Also I loved the final letter from that woman to her friend about her daughter...leaves one's mind open for maybe another Carrie?	1998-03-28
