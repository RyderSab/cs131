All of the above make for a fun romp were it not for the avarice and thievery the tale describes. But while this interesting and accurate record of the Internet boom and bust and the people who helped other people lose money shows how corrupt analysts were, it also shows how gullible and ignorantabout stock buying the public is.<br /><br />I remember everyone getting into the market. And it scared me off when the people on the assembly line came home at night and picked stocks to buy. So I sold. The level of stock analysis was on a par with the stock tips Joseph P. Kennedy received from his shoe shine boy in July of 1929. Joe Kennedy exited the market shortly thereafter, only months before the great crash. \\"When the shoe-shine guy gives you stock tips, it's time to get out\\", Kennedy said.<br /><br />Like Kennedy, I left the game while I had lots of chips. But people who had no knowledge of the market were playing a game for grownups and they got burned. Why did they blame the greedy, dishonest analysts in the first place? Because they believe someone looked out for them. No one did. I personally don't blame the analysts who had buys on all the stocks their firms brought to market. I blame the folks who bought the stocks based on their words.<br /><br />These people later blamed the analysts and anyone else they could place blame on when they should have taken responsibility for their own losses.<br /><br />But be that as it may, for those of you who want someone to blame and who love to see the mighty fall, this is an excellent book. It has everything from sex to greed to egos the size of Texas and brains the size of peas.<br /><br />Gasparino has chronicled the Internet boom and bust, the background and all the players. From mighty Mary Meeker who gave up a personal life to become rich to Henry Blodget who was on CNBC about as much as the anchors and all the others who had the power to make or break a stock and a company. These were the stars of the time. And this is their story.<br /><br />But it is more. It tells of a time when people like Barbra Streisand became day traders. Just about everyone thought they couldn't lose. People quit their jobs to trade stocks. Common people moved up --- only to later have to move out of luxury.<br /><br />The story it doesn't tell well enough, however, is that the analysts were all but forced to promote a stock and sell out in favor of companies who were clients of their respective firms. The analysts were, in fact, mere pawns in the whole game. The blame for the bad calls belong at the top of the firms from wince came the pressure.<br /><br />The bottom line --- if you buy stocks, do your own due diligence. Read the reports and if you must look at what some analyst says, see if the company is their client or if the analyst has some agenda. If you can't do that, beware. Just remember that no one cares about your financial security but you. The advice to keep your own counsel has always worked.<br /><br />Susanna K.

I just finished reading Maria Veloso's book, 'Web Copy That Sells.' This book provides the unique skills and techniques that enable a copywriter or anyone who writes online copy to flat out sell like never before. These techniques are so powerful and dynamic it's hard to believe.<br /><br />Having said that, I have to add that in my opinion, Maria's method of writing Web copy would not work for every site or product. There is not a set pattern or template that fills the bill for all sites.<br /><br />For example, she proclaims that the \\"editorial\\" style of Web site copy produces the most business. This is indeed a clever tool on \\"some\\" sites. But not all. It won't work on all sites and is too awkward for some.<br /><br />She also likes to use \\"involvement devices\\" on her sites. I agree that these are useful on some sites. But I noticed on one of her sites that you \\"involve\\" yourself by ticking off your desired answer only to have your e-mail client pop up. This is not good usability --- people want to know and should know when they're about to submit an e-mail. They may opt not to do that and they should know before they click the box what's going to happen.<br /><br />There are a few other things of this nature that I don't buy into. But, for the most part, this is a valuable book because it offers ideas that are fresh and not readily available and that most people will find exceedingly useful.<br /><br />I suggest you buy the book and take from it what will work in your own personal situation but don't take everything as \\"gospel\\".<br /><br />Maria Veloso has put together a wealth of knowledge that has not been made available before as far as I know.  I've read all the books on online copywriting and a few offered some valuable help and ideas. In fact, most have some good points that you can take away from your read.<br /><br />But 'Web Copy That Sells' is, by far, the very best to date.  I recommend this book to anyone who really wants to make their site sell or needs to understand how to write e-mail and get it through the spam filters as well as get it read.  This book covers it all.  Maria Veloso has done a great job and provided a valuable service.<br /><br />I highly recommend this powerful book to all copywriters and anyone who needs to write copy for the Web. But, as I said, take from it what will work for you and be sure you adhere to good usability in your quest to sell.<br /><br />One word of warning, at least one of the freeware products the author recommends you download is \\"loaded\\" with adware that will take your computer over. So beware.<br /><br />Susanna K. Hutcheson<br />Creative Director<br />Powerwriting.com LLC<br />[...]ugh the spam filters as well as get it read.  This book covers it all.

While this is a short book and easy to read, it does not lack substance. Being in advertising and marketing, I know the value of a brand. But as D'Alessandro points out in his book, branding is the business of everyone in an organization.<br />This book would be of value to a CEO of a large organization and all of its employees or the owner of a one-person shop and all advertising people. Branding, after all, is something everyone is responsible for. It is not the exclusive domain of the ad agency.<br />The book shows how a large, well-known brand can lose market share overnight to an Internet start up.

The author neither shows a bias to adore this large, well-known clan nor does he show a disdain for them. He simply tells the story as it is and leaves the reader to his own conclusions.<br />The main thrust of the book is the family's dealings with the Catholic church. We learn what many have suspected, that the Kennedy family paid off the churches leaders, providing them with much personal and institutional wealth, for the benefit of various Kennedy family members --- for special treatment and services.<br />The book covers just about all family members who were helped by the Catholic hierarchy but, of course, it spends more time on JFK who benefited from payments made by his father on his behalf. But it goes on to the more recent affairs including marriage annulments of lesser family members.<br />While this clan is of much less importance than it once was --- indeed it is of little importance --- this history and the new revelations add a good deal of knowledge for the student of politics and religion and leaves us with a distaste and distrust of both.<br />Susanna K.

But alas, there is so much more.<br />As a proud member of the advertising club, I have long believed in stirring the pot and not looking like everyone else. But I've never read a book that presented it so eloquently as Creative Leaps by Michael Newman.<br />Newman tells it like it is about clients who butt in and create more problems than they help solve. Ditto for others who involve themselves in the creative process. He shows by demonstration how to create ads that work, that stand out and that sell like hell.<br />I also admit that, even with some thirty years of solid experience under my belt, I got some new (to me) and very helpful ideas. This book was worth twice what I paid for it.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone in advertising, especially copywriters and creative directors. But also to anyone who might hire an ad agency or copywriter. It will help them to understand the creative process and to appreciate it more; to allow their creatives more freedom and to get the hell out of the way.<br />In fact, this book is totally different from any book about advertising or copywriting I've ever read and I totally love it.

It is in knowing the past that we can control the future.<br />Most books cover the human aspect of this period in American history and that's important. And most of the books cover the events leading up to the crash and depression. But this is the only book I've read that exposes the dynamics behind the scenes that caused the crash and it's terrible crushing length and enormous suffering.<br />Rothbard explains in great detail how government butted in where it was not needed and created untold suffering. He explains how we allowed England to dictate to us and how in our desire to help Her, our government intentionally hurt its own citizens.<br />Rothbard was a great economist and a great proponent of the libertarian cause. His belief in Laissez-faire economics is behind his philosophy. It is Laissez-faire that created this country and it is the loss of it that has and is causing us grief and loss of liberty.<br />This is an excellent book. Published by the Ludwig von Mises Institute, it is a book you'll want to read again and again. Austrian economics are exciting and workable and the Ludwin von Mises Institute is a dynamic proponent of this very workable economic philosophy.<br />If you are interested in economics and the Great Depression and its real causes, you must read this powerful, well written book.	2003-08-16

The idea isn't new but it's good to read it again.<br />Simply put, Seth reminds the reader to not be boring. To not be invisible and not even to be \\"very good\\" but rather to be remarkable. He says that people don't talk about or recommend \\"very good\\" products or services; that they expect very good. But people do talk about \\"remarkable\\" products or services. That's probably true and I tend to endorse that thought.<br />Furthermore, Seth claims that television marketing (among other types of advertising) is quite dead, thank you. He says that the old, established companies like P&G and General Mills made their names and sold their products with television advertising and that we still buy from old ads we saw thirty years ago. In other words, the Wheaties we bought because Billie Jean King was on the box still keeps us buying Wheaties today. (Whether BJK was on a box of Wheaties or not I don't know. But I can dream that a woman made the cover of the great cereal at least once in those days.)<br />Well, there's a dab of truth in that. But just a dab. Television still sells a ton of stuff. Granted, some of the ads are very bad. Some are cute and win awards but they don't win customers for the ad agency's clients. Television and radio and Internet advertising are not dead, however.<br />Now having said all that, I do agree with Seth when he says that to succeed today most businesses must be remarkable. But, unfortunately, that doesn't mean you can't have a bad product and still succeed.<br />Microsoft is known for its poor products and shoddy security but it's a rich, successful company while software companies with far finer products are struggling. Ah, but a Microsoft is admittedly the exception.<br />Seth knows how to market his books and this one is no exception. It will do well. Is this book better than the many other books on marketing? Is it unique or does it give new information? Not really.<br />One of the books on advertising that was a hot seller a number of years ago said that a product or service didn't have to be great to be a success. It just had to be \\"good enough\\". So who is right? Do you have to be remarkable or just good enough?<br />Well, you tell me. This book will make Seth some nice change. Maybe he'll go to France again on what he earns from it. Is it remarkable or just good enough? Well, it's good enough that it interested me sufficiently to buy it. It's good enough that I got a few ideas from it. But it's not remarkable enough that I'll give it five stars and suggest you run out and buy it.<br />Susanna K.

But I'm glad I did. I agree that some people might find some of the critiques nit-picking. I also agree that the authors are not qualified to give copywriting advice.<br />But the point about exclamation marks on the homepage is a good one. They are overused. I've overused them myself. And they do make a page look like so much hype in many cases. Copywriters get carried away with hype and the web is no place for that.<br />I don't think we can take anyone's advice in total all the time. But I can tell you this. After I read only a few pages in this book I saw changes that I needed to make.<br />After looking at the critiques in the book, I can easily see the small very fine details that can make all the difference in the world in usability and, moreover, in marketing.<br />Jakob does extensive testing with real people and I have a lot of faith in his findings. His word is not the last word. But I trust him and I think people who are involved with designing or writing Web sites should read what he writes.<br />They don't have to agree with everything. But not to read him would be a mistake.<br />The changes I've made due to his advice have paid big dividends. I don't hold 100 percent to everything he says. But I believe I have a site that is very user-friendly in part because I apply his principals and I pass them on to my clients.<br />If people would just read the intricate detail in each critique, they would see what one small change could make and why it should be done the way the authors suggest.<br />I would have given the book five stars but the book itself had some misspelled words and it used the word &quot;website&quot; instead of &quot;Web site&quot; which is the accepted way to write it. I don't necessarily blame the authors for that. It was probably a low level editor who let those errors happen. But they shouldn't be there. Especially in a slick, well designed book and a book about usability and perfection.<br />But to anyone involved in making decisions about a Web site --- especially designers and copywriters --- I highly recommend this book.<br />Susanna K.

And it starts out that way. It reminds one of the writing of Bruce Lee.<br />But as you read more, you discover that the words \\"God\\" and \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Holy Spirit\\" become more frequent until you begin to realize you're not reading a Buddhist text at all but a Christian text.<br />This is another example of a writer using the word \\"Zen\\" to sell books. In his defense, he did quote a few Buddhist passages and he mentioned Buddha a time or two. But the book is steeped in the Bible and Christianity. And that's okay. If that's what you're looking for.<br />Apparently the author felt the need to explain this dichotomy after page 102. He says, \\"As a warrior who began the Path in the Christian church, I never saw any reason to stop worshiping God in the same way as my fellow Christians, even though I later became a Zen-Dhyana Initiate. Church was my focus on God as being Supreme and Zen and the yogi paths reveal who I am as a single human being. The two do not conflict in any way when you actually practice.\\"<br />My point is that no school of Buddhism, to my knowledge, acknowledges a god or supreme being, a heaven or a hell. So to that extent, if that is the sort of book one expects, he'll be disappointed.<br />Having said that, this is a beautiful book with a lot of wonderful insight and a lot of help for the warrior of life. It helps one to understand a good deal about life and fear and death and how we can relate to them in a healthy way.<br />I expect I'll re-read parts of the book frequently. But I will have to leave out many parts of the book because it espouses thoughts that I can't buy into.<br />With all that out of the way, I highly recommend this book.<br />Susanna K.

While I'm not one who really enjoys jokes, I know that most people do. At least from time to time. This is not only a nice collection of jokes and knee slappers that have made the rounds on the net, but it is also a history of humor on the net.<br />I think this book would be good to keep handy if you give speeches or if you use humor in your work or in your writing as I attempt on occasion. This book will help me to come up with some cute stories very quickly.<br />And it would be nice to keep and give to your children and grandchildren as a memorial to the humor of the net from it's inception.<br />I would like to add that, while I'm not one who really enjoys jokes, I found some of these just incredibly funny. That's about as high a compliment as I can pay a book of humor.<br />Tammy has done a great job putting together a really great little book. The jokes and humorous stories are neatly organized so it's easy to find what you want. Highly recommended.<br />Susanna K.

And I don't doubt it.<br />There was some unnecessary material in the book I felt. Like how to run a business. I don't think selling books in most cases calls for information on insurance, getting a license and all that other sort of business-related stuff. If you're going into it big time, you'll need a much bigger book written by someone else.<br />Most of the stuff was pretty basic. Like where to buy books and that sort of thing. But there were some gems, as I said. So while I was a bit disappointed, I got value from the book and I do recommend it to someone just starting out. In fact, you really \\"should\\" read this or a book like it and save yourself lots of problems.<br />Don't expect this book to be great. It's good. And most sellers or want-to-be sellers can't help but gain something from it. If you're a pro --- skip it altogether. You don't need it.<br />If you have time to research the web, you can get the important stuff for free. But the book is quick and easy to buy and it's nice to have things handy just in case.<br />And hey --- you can always sell it as a collectible. The author signs it.

It answered 99 percent of the questions and concerns I had about designing a usable site. Whether you agree or disagree with Jakob, you have to admire the body of work he's given the Internet. And you have to respect his opinions. They are very credible.<br />If one cares about usability, this is a page turner. I could hardly put it down. And I'm sure this is one of the few books I own that I will use daily and keep handy and probably well marked. To me, that's the sign of a very good, very important book. One you live with.<br />When you've read this book, you'll know more about usability than probably 90 percent or more of the people on the web. And you'll be able to create a site that will be useful to people, which translates into more business.<br />Most of the sites on the web today are really pretty bad. Both the design and the copy are bad. When you understand usability you can make a site that works for everyone concerned.<br />This book is fascinating. It's easy to read and understand. It covers all the topics that are usability concerns. This is NOT a book about web design. It's about usability and incorporating it into your design and into your writing. So writers as well as designers should read it.<br />I read &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; by Steve Krug and I found it a very good book. I learned a lot from it. But after reading this book by Jakob Nielsen I really &quot;got it&quot;. And you will too.<br />I highly recommend this very valuable book.

So many are poorly written or have very little to offer. This book is one of the better ones. It combines some useful copywriting advice with usability advice. And the two really do go together. You can't know one without learning the other or you only do half your job as a creative.<br />I do think, however, that the book is written in a style that is rather confusing and unappealing. I think this comes from the authors trying to be all things to all people.<br />But this book hits on topics that the lesser books such as Net Words fail to cover. In their zest to get to market and gain new clients, those authors write lots of puff and little meat.<br />Hot Text offers the meat. So if you only buy one book on online copywriting and usability, make it this one. It doesn't cover everything but it gives you the basic background and the knowledge to do a good job on creating a useful Web site.<br />This book is suited for beginners or more experienced people who write for the web or would like to. But it is better suited for those with very little experience or who want a reminder of what works and what doesn't.<br />Those with a lot of experience will quickly do a read-through and pick up a few good ideas and be done with it.

I read this in a few hours. It was time and money well spent. As a copywriter, I do a lot of writing for the web. I'm not a designer, although I do design my own site and from time to time help clients with theirs. So my interest was perhaps from a different need than some other readers.<br />But I found a good deal of valuable information that I can instantly apply to my daily work, including my copywriting. Copywriters and designers almost always disagree which is more important, words or graphics. Of course, I vote the former and most if not all designers vote the latter.<br />But this book took no sides. It is something that both the graphics folks and we in marketing can adapt to our daily efforts to make the web useful. After all, we all want that. So there's no disagreement there.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has anything at all to do with a Web site. No matter if it's a one-person show or a corporate site, this book will be of value to you.<br />It's extremely well written.

Davis is all for it.<br />In fact, there are no hard and fast rules and we copywriters are not at all sure which way works.

This is a well written book and it is one that I recommend to folks who want the basics of writing for the web. Writing Web site copy is hard work and anything that gives you any help at all is welcome.<br />But I noticed that some of the people mentioned in the book as being helped by the authors or being in some way associated with the authors had sites that didn't apply the rules and tips and teachings that are offered in this book. Yet they have reviews here and in the book. Or some do.<br />I also ran the \\"we we test\\" on their sites that is on the author's site and all scored very low. So it appears that the authors were able to get some good recommendations and reviews but not necessarily by people who adhere to their philosophy.<br />Having said that, I think this is well worth the read. Don't expect the conversions that the authors seem to think their suggestions will provide. Unfortunately, conversions are much more difficult to get than by applying the advice in this book.<br />I also found it amusing that the author adheres to the concept of using lots of hyperlinks in the main part of your site (the center) and in his book, Net Words by Nick Usborne, Nice says that's not a good idea at all; that it causes you to lose people. Why is this amusing? Nick works with Future Now as a strategic partner. (Future Now is the site associated with the author of this book.) Future Now does, at least, follow it's own rules. It has lots of hyperlinks on it's page. It has useful tools and a high ranking in the search engines.<br />So I'm not sure how much stock you can put in either theory or in either book.<br />The information in the book will, however, be very helpful to those who are writing copy for their own sites or that of others. I just don't think you should believe everything you will read in the book as it all simply doesn't work. Some of it does and for that information, the book is useful.<br />When copywriters, or for that matter anyone in business, writes a book, it is with the intention of building their credibility and getting more business. And that's fine. But the advice they give sometimes has to be taken with a grain of salt. And the people who recommend the book on the back cover are often folks who write books for the same reason.

If you are very well versed in Buddhism, especially Tibetan Buddhism, this is a great book. But it's not for the casual reader. It's a hard read. But for someone with a good Buddhist background, this is a must-read. I did, however, has a problem with some of the guidelines laid down in the book. I felt they were not the true teachings that I have come to learn about Buddhism. For example, in the teaching about sexuality, it admonished men that it was okay to hire a prostitute. I didn't think that was an especially enlightened admonishment. Furthermore, it totally ignored how a woman should behave. This is quite a turn off as it is one reason many women turn off of all religions. It also didn't allow tolerance for other traditions. This goes against everything I hear HH The Dalai Lama speak about. So I did have some problems with the text and I'm not sure how true to the traditional oral tradition of Tibetan Buddhism it remains. I would welcome other thoughts on this.	2002-11-26

Most people who write a biography of someone, especially a friend or relative, have a vested interest in either making the person sound like a saint or a sinner.<br />The author of this amazing book, however, portrayed  her good friend, Maria Callas, in what can only be best described as a very  objective manner.<br />One comes away from this book with a very real sense of  the person who was Maria Calles, not particularly in the legend that was  Calles, the great Diva, the great voice of the 20th Century.<br />And I found  this book to be quite a spellbinder.  It was very hard to put it down.  My  feelings toward the subject ran the gamut from immense like and  understanding to immense dislike.  I found her at once fascinating and  brilliant and on the other hand somewhat stupid.  One minute I would think  of her as a simple, silly twitt  and the next I would find myself thinking  of her as a very loving and warm  rather intelligent woman.  In some  instances she was very stingy and other instances she was very giving and  generous.<br />But I think the thing that stood out most to me was the fact  that she had suffered from a good deal of betrayal in her lifetime.  People  had used her and emotionally and abused her. She was also financially used.  And I think this made up a good deal of the woman she later became.<br />Like  most people, Maria Callas was neither all good nor all bad.  She was  neither a saint nor a sinner.  What I like about this book was that it gave  her dignity and it gives the reader a feel for who the real Maria Callas  was.  Although it's written by a dear friend, someone who obviously thought  highly of her, the author was nonetheless very objective in writing the  accounts of Maria's life. She also told of the darker side of Maria Callas.  But she did not use her own words entirely.  In fact, she went to a great  deal of trouble to interview other people who knew Maria well and many of  them had very differing views from those of others who were  interviewed.<br />So in the end the reader is left to draw his or her own  conclusion about the type person Maria Callas was.  I personally came away  with a feeling of being quite touched by her life.  I felt that she had  suffered greatly, although she had indeed brought a lot of on herself, as  we all do.  I found her a very human person and quite different from the  legend that we know as Callas.<br />There is no question that Calles, the  legend, was the greatest soprano of the 20th century.  She was the divas  diva.  The living up to the legend must have been very difficult indeed.  And we find in this book an idea just how hard it was.<br />If you want a  history of the career of Callas this is not the book you want to read.  If  you want what I believe to be a very factual and objective rendition of  what her life as a woman was, this book has no equal.<br />And while you will  get glimpses of the glamorous life of the diva, you'll also be able to feel  the crashing reality of loneliness that was at the depth and center of the  person behind the great diva, Maria.who were  interviewed.<br />So in the end the reader is left to draw his or her own  conclusion about the type person Maria Callas was.  I personally came away  with a feeling of being quite touched by her life.  I felt that she had  suffered greatly, although she had indeed brought a lot of on herself, as  we all do.  I found her a very human person and quite different from the  legend that we know as Callas.<br />There is no question that Calles, the  legend, was the greatest soprano of the 20th century.  She was the divas  diva.    The living up to the legend must have been very difficult indeed.   And we find in this book an idea just how hard it was.<br />If you want a  history of the career of Callas this is not the book you want to read.  If  you want what I believe to be a very factual and objective rendition of  what her life as a woman was, this book has no equal.<br />And while you will  get glimpses of the glamorous life of the diva, you'll also be able to feel  the crashing reality of loneliness that was at the depth and center of the  person behind the great diva, Maria.	2000-06-02

It is one of a number of great sutras that make up what would be considered the equivalent of the Christian Bible.  This sutra, like all the  sutras and much of the Oriental writing such as the Bhagavad-Gita, is  written in the form of a conversation . . . in this case it's written  between the Buddha and , a monk by the name of Sabuthi.<br />Buddha is  speaking to a large group of monks and others but the conversation is with  this one individual.<br />The book is very intelligently divided into three  parts. The first part consists of a history of this sutra and Buddhism in  general.  And it very well written.<br />The second part is the Diamond Sutra  in a translated text and commentary and finally there is an appendix which  consists of the raw text of the diamond Sutra.  I find this an excellent  way to put the commentary together.<br />While the book itself is relatively  short with only 167 pages., it manages to give a tremendous amount of  valuable information about this delightful sutra.<br />I was pleasantly  surprised at the amount of historical data in this book.  The author, Mu  Soeng, gives a tremendous amount of historical background, as well as  explains the differences in some of the various schools of Buddhism. This  is most fascinating.<br />This material is written in a very easy to  understand way and it is exceptionally well researched.<br />The background of  the Diamond Sutra is well-documented in this book.  Its relevance to the  various schools of Buddhism are given quite a bit of space in the book,  which I found very useful.<br />The second part of the book is the translated  text and commentary.  I had some trouble with this section.  But perhaps  the reason I had this difficulty, is explained by the Buddha himself who  said in this sutra, &quot;This sutra will be called the . . .  The Diamond  -- Cutter Wisdom That has Gone Beyond, because it has the capacity to cut  through illusions and afflictions and bring us to the sure awakening, and  by this title you will know it&quot;<br />The Buddha also said in his  discussion with Sabuthi (the monk Lord Bud dah was talking to in the  sutra), that Sabuthi should know that the meaning of this sutra is beyond  comprehension and discussion.  He added that the fruit that results from  receiving and practicing this sutra is beyond comprehension and discussion  also.<br />So perhaps the fact that many things in this sutra  were still left  esoteric is because that's the way it was intended to be.<br />To give you an  example of just one of the hundreds of areas that I felt were not commented  upon enough for me understand is the following:<br />&quot;Therefore, Sabuthi,  a bodhisattva, detaching him or herself from all ideas, should rouse the  desire for utmost, supreme, and perfect awakening.  He or she should  produce thoughts that are unsupported by forms, sounds, smells, tastes,  tangible objects, or mind objects, unsupported by Dharma, unsupported by  no-Dharma, unsupported by everything.  And why?  Because all supports are  no supports.  This is the reason why the Buddha teaches that the  bodhisattva  should practice generosity without dwelling on form.  Sabuthi,  the reason he practices generosity is to benefit all beings.&quot;  The  Buddha also says that there is no Dharma by which he has fully known the  utmost, right, and perfect awakening.  And the Dharma  that he has fully  known and demonstrated is neither grasped  nor elusive.  Therefore he  teaches all dharmas are the Buddha's own special dharmas.  Finally to give  another example of the difficulty in understanding the sutra, allow me to  quote one more time from the Diamond Sutra.<br />&quot;Know, World Honored  One, he does not, why?  Because to create a harmonious Buddha field is not  to create a harmonious Buddha field, and therefore he is known as creating  a harmonious Buddha field.&quot;<br />Now I realizedthat this is written eons  ago.  I know that it is esoteric in nature.  But I would have liked the  author to explain some of these areas better.  I don't feel that a person  should have to be a Buddhist scholar with many years background to be able  to understand this lovely sutra.<br /> But having said that, I think the  author has done a superior job in writing a book that explains the  eloquence and the beauty and the deep richness of Buddhism.  Further, he  has described the history in such manner that it brings Buddhism alive and  makes it very real for the reader.<br />And so if a person is either well  entrenched in Buddhism of any school, or if an individual is very  interested in Buddhism and wants to gain a greater knowledge of it, I  highly recommend this book.  It is a wonderful work and well worth reading.  I would advise the reader to read it more than one time, however.  Because  that  will be the only way that he or she is going to be able to grasp the  full meaning of both the commentary and this sutra.<br />I would give another  star to the book if only it could explain what more of the text means or  even gave the reader a few options from which to choose. But this being an  ancient text and esoteric at best, perhaps that can never be done.<br />One  should be aware too that Mu Soeng comes from the Zen tradition and some of  the material cannot help but be colored by that. However, I found that he  did an excellent job at being objective. So people from other traditions  should be able to enjoy this book as well as people of the Zen tradition.that this is written eons  ago.  I know that it is esoteric in nature.

I had never heard of Michael Roach until I searched out Shoutcast (Internet Radio) and found the Tibetan Buddhist station. Being of that tradition, I was delighted to find the station.<br />The program that was on at that time was Dharma talks by Michael on The Heart Sutra, a most  important Buddhist teaching.<br />I was so taken with his messages and the way  he could get these deep ideas across so easily that I wanted to learn more  about him. That's when I discovered that he had a new book out, The Diamond  Cutter. So I bought a copy at Amazon.<br />Michael spent many years in the New  York Diamond industry. He explains that he was attracted to diamonds  because they are the hardest form in the universe.<br />This book is about  business. It is about the problems that we all encounter in business daily.  And it tells us how to handle the problem and why every problem has a  cause, perhaps not in this lifetime but in some lifetime.<br />Michael clearly  explains why some people who are greedy and unkind are successful. No, it's  nothing they've done in this life but rather they did something of merit in  another life that brought the wealth in this lifetime. But in another  lifetime they will reap the Karma they're now sowing.<br />He tells us that if  we wish to be wealthy, we need to be generous with our money and our  time.<br />Michael uses his vast knowledge of the diamond industry to teach  business ethics from a Buddhist perspective based on the all-important  teaching of Lord Buddha in His Diamond Cutter (Vajrachchedika sutra).<br />I  highly recommend this wonderful book to anyone who cares about their  business, their relationships, their finances and their life in general.	2000-04-27

If you apply for a newspaper job or just about any job as a writer or much else, you need to know Quark. And, if you're like me, you can't just jump in over your head! That's where this book can save your skin.<br />If you need  the basics fast, this book is for you. You can build on the knowledge you  get in this book.

Michael Lewis knows Silicon Valley and he's an excellent writer. That said, I got a belly full of Jim Clark in this book. Perhaps he is the personification of the creator of the New New Thing in the Valley. But I  have to think there are many other people who should have been equally  represented in this otherwise wonderful read.<br />What I think the book did  very well was to demonstrate the extreme mind set in the valley of dreams.  It shows us how the minds of the power brokers work and how things they  create get old quickly --- how disposable everything is. Like my Palm Pilot  that I bought at Christmas is old hat now. Hey, we've got color! The new  new thing. Gotta have it!<br />So read this book. It's really pretty great.  You'll tire of Jim. But hey, he's an important dude and the only bad part  is, you really won't like him at all when you put the book down. But he  won't care. He's on to the New New Thing.	2000-03-30
US	52688627	R2Q0W8ZYOMTMKN	096608280X	130667719	Advertising That Sells	Books	1	4	4	N	Y	A big disappointment.	This is a very basic instruction book. It is not well written. And not only the publisher, but just about everyone mentioned in the book, including all the resources that I glanced at, appear to be from Minnesota.  Not that that's bad. It's just very limited. And limiting. Not for a  national audience.<br />As a professional copywriter and consultant, I was  especially annoyed on page 60. The author talks a bit about outsourcing. He  advises the reader to make sure to hire someone who will &quot;adapt to  your layout desires&quot; and, in general, allow the novice business person  to dictate to the professional marketer or designer or copywriter how  things should be done. If a client did that to me, I would tell them to  find someone else. I'm the professional. Not them. That's why they pay  me.<br />I found the book clumsy; it is not put together in any order.  Furthermore, I felt some of the advice was actually very bad.<br />I was  highly disappointed in this book and very sorry I bought it. I would not  suggest it to even the most novice entrepreneur.<br />Susanna K. Hutcheson  Advertising &amp; Marketing Copywriter/Consultant	1999-05-08

This book officially marks the entry of a new kind of marketing for the new century --- the only kind of marketing that will work today and on into the next millennium.<br />Forget all you ever learned. Oh sure, you have to do  the old interrupt marketing to get people to raise their hands and show  interest. But after that, you have to have the consumer's permission to  market to them.<br />This book is well written and highly understandable. It  makes sense. It tells it like it is.<br />Anyone who has anything to sell must  read this book. Anyone who expects to survive in the business world today,  whether in a corporation or as an entrepreneur, must read this  book.<br />There will be more books written on Permission Marketing. And  hopefully they will go into more detail on exactly &quot;how&quot; to use  this lively and exciting new marketing. But this is the mother of them all.  This is the book that gives birth to Permission Marketing. And those who  don't read it will be sorry they missed out of this important  beginning.<br />--- Susanna K.

Discover the mistakes you make.	If you care about how you sound and the way you come across to other people, you'll want this book. It's a reference you'll want in whatever room you're in. You'll discover everyday words that are being mispronounced  by newscasters and, more likely, by you. At least I did. And I'm a writer  who prides herself on knowing words well! This book is for the American. It  gives American pronounciation that is accepted by the educated class. It  disdains words that are used for effect. And if a word is right in the UK  but not America it will tell you so. Words like Missouri, Vase, the days of  the week, yesterday, rather, begin and hundreds more are explained. You  will learn the background on the usage. You will learn how to correctly  pronounce February. Now that's a challenge! This is a terrific book and I  highly recommend it. If I could give it more than five stars I would! Buy  it!!	1999-04-18
US	52688627	R3GXUIVW4TR0R	0805057544	202484750	Barbarians Led by Bill Gates	Books	5	6	9	N	Y	Excellent Read!	This book, written by a former Microsoft developer and the daughter of a former Microsoft PR person, is an excellent view from the inside. At first one would be inclined to think this might be some PR itself. But after  getting into the book you realize that it's not. In fact, it's very  unbiased reporting for the most part.  If the authors seem to flatter  themselves in a couple of places they can be forgiven. They do it only a  time or two.  The fascination of the book lies in how we see a different  side of Bill Gates and Microsoft. Gates appears not smart, as we seem to  think of him, but rather as a not-so-bright nerd turned CEO who depends on  others --- in more ways than one.  He is smart enough to hire very  brilliant people who know their jobs. And he gives them quite a degree of  autonomy. By giving them stock options in the company they have a vested  interest in the success of the company.  On the other hand, the book  shows a side to Microsoft we seldom if ever see or know about. The unruly  side. The unorganized side. There is no strategy. Things happen by  accident. Windows, for example, was not a priority but a side effect of  sorts. The Internet was not important to Bill until the last minute. Than  it became a priority.  The secret to success at Microsoft, according to  the authors, is to copy, crush and kill the competitor. Microsoft doesn't  write code from scratch, according to the authors. But rather the  developers take good code from good programs of other companies and write  Microsoft programs. Or, if all else fails, they buy the company.  This  is an exciting read and highly recommended.	1998-12-24
