This is Sabrina Jeffries' final entry in her Royal Brotherhood series.  A series of books dedicated to three brothers, born on the wrong side of George IV (Prinny's) imperial blankets. Ms. Jeffries is an author known for her light, humorous writing style, and here she continues in that gifted vein.  ONE NIGHT WITH A PRINCE is light and at times it is humorous, but, as a story, it has little diversion and much predictability.<br /><br />Mr. Gavin Byrne is a womanizing gambler.  Throughout London, they know him as a man without a soul.  This 'Prince of Sin' does not believe in love, and he certainly does not believe in the sacrament of marriage.  He lives for pleasure, enjoyment, and satisfaction - his own! So what is it about the riotous little 'Colonel Christabel' that is turning his world upside down?<br /><br />Christabel, the Marchioness of Haversham, is desperate!  Her late husband's betrayal is rearing its ugly head. Stolen letters, entrusted to her, are currently being used in a blackmail scheme - a blackmail scheme against his royal highness.  A scheme fueled by her now-deceased spouse.  Christabel must get the damaging letters back and reluctantly, she must ask for help - help from the notorious Gavin Byrne.<br /><br />ONE NIGHT WITH A PRINCE starts with much pizzazz - the duel of wicked whist, in Lady Haversham's parlor, is delightfully lusty.  However, shortly after this delectable scene, Jeffries' story begins to stutter and stumble.  Although Jeffries' pace is even and her characters are spirited, her story becomes ordinary - plausibly because the author exposes intense background information far too early - nothing dynamic is left - nothing left to intrigue the reader.  Yes, as an author, Ms. Jeffries is a powerful force, but, this time, this talented writer exposes her cards far too early.  Keep `um guessing Sabrina, keep `um guessing!<br />Grade: B<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-10-13

Unquestionably, Diane Perkins' latest romance begins with a unique and dramatic opening that clearly caught this seasoned reader off guard!  Yet, Ms. Perkins didn't settle on sensationalism to uncover this romance story.  No, following her 'Edgar Allan Poe' opening, Ms. Perkins continued to guide THE MARRIAGE BARGAIN into the realm of gentle love.<br /><br />Spencer Keenan, the Earl of Kellworth and Emma Chambers are married, but married in name only.  Emma lives in destitution on the country estate of Kellworth and the earl, upon returning from the Napoleonic wars, lives untroubled in London.  He knows his countess is at Kellworth, but what he does NOT know is she lives in poverty.<br /><br />Through a misadventure, they return Spencer Keenan to Kellworth.  They return him to face his wife.  Reluctantly, he encounters Emma's meager conditions and gripping bitterness.  Guiltily, Spencer Keenan accepts the blame.  What he fails to accept is why?  Why does his wife live in such deprivation?  After all, Kellworth is a prosperous property and he is a very wealthy man.<br /><br />THE MARRIAGE BARGAIN is a pleasant read and Ms. Perkins tells her story by using wonderful Regency detail - which beautifies the gentle romance.  However, something is missing.  A prologue or some expansion chapters seemed necessary to further clarify the heroine's relationship with her mother, the lecherous uncle, and even the initial bond with the hero.  Without this background material, I felt I dropped into the story midway.  Nevertheless, Diane Perkins (AKA Diane Gaston) is a very gifted writer and I do look forward to more from this author in the future; she remains firmly planted on my 'auto-buy' list.<br /><br />Grade: B<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche<br /><br />This review is based on an Advanced Reading Copy.	2005-10-07

If you're a fan of Karen Marie Moning's Highlander series, you are going to love SPELL OF THE HIGHLANDER. I am and I did; so much so, that this is one author I do purchase in hard cover - I can't wait for that future paperback! Remarkably, Karen Marie Moning has a style of writing that very much appeals to this \\"Highlander\\" devotee!<br /><br />With his long, black hair and dark, erotic eyes, Cain MacKeltar is Trouble with a capital T.  He is Teasing, he is Tantalizing, he is Tempting!  Sigh, he is a woman's Total fantasy.  Eleven centuries ago, evil trapped Cian MacKeltar inside the Dark Glass - a cursed mirror plagued with unspeakable power.  Now, an ancient enemy will stop at nothing to hold the ninth-century Highlander firmly inside his deplorable prison.  Now, one woman may hold the key to setting MacKeltar free, but at what cost?<br /><br />Overworked, stressed out, and tired, PhD major Jessi St. James needs a life.  So when she suddenly finds herself confronting an insatiable Celtic warrior, mixed with her own relentless desire, she takes reluctant notice.  After all, what is a demented old curse mixed with a dangerous deadly evil? Everything! Yet the presumptuous woman is willing to pay the price, to win the kind of love that comes along but once . . .<br /><br />For readers who cannot get enough of the Moning's mucho-Alpha-male Highlander heroes, they will not be disappointed!

Unfortunately, the story's beginning has a Junior High School girl supremacy about it.  Kleypas fills the dubious beginning with wide-eyed innocence, protocol shirking, secret sharing, and best, best friends. It isn't until Kleypas allows her heroine to experience the hero's bedroom skills that her story finally turns satisfying.  At this point, the plot intensifies with familial secrets, raw jealousy, and smoldering emotion.  Even the humor matures!  Kleypas takes control and saves her story the moment her intoxicated heroine is caught trying to dig the pretty pear from the brandy bottle!  An adorable scene - by the way!<br /><br />Marcus Marsden, the Earl of Westcliff considers American heiress Miss Lillian Bowman a hedonist with the manners of a goat. In his very conservative English mind, Ms. Lillian Bowman is manipulating, domineering, and too bold.  Worse, she is part of the 'nouveau riche' squad invading English shores - wealthy American families who desperately want into the world of the British aristocracy.<br /><br />Lillian Bowman is a member of the wretched Wallflowers - a club originally numbering 4.  Four, unmarried girls who share one specialty: the failure to charm and hook a proper English gentleman's attentions.  As a result, the girls have decided to band together and share assistance.  Happily, success is theirs and accordingly, the group now numbers 3.  Next batter up: Lillian.<br /><br />Marcus Marsden and Lillian Bowman have much in common.  They are both intellect, stubborn, and physically gifted.  Of course, in their minds, they do not suit.  Lord Westcliff must find a bride with 'good blood' and Lillian must merely find someone appropriate - not lofty - merely appropriate. Nevertheless, the two challenge, tease, and anger each other relentlessly - obviously, to avoid painful, unimaginable desires!<br /><br />Pleasingly, Ms. Kleypas has improved from SECRETS OF A SUMMER NIGHT.  In fact, the second half of IT HAPPENED ONE AUTUMN is exactly what a Kleypas reader expects when they choose one of her books.  Yes, the story does have a dubious start, but Kleypas does recover.  Appropriately, the final pages open the door for the series' third book and this next entry has 'potential winner' written all over it!  Please, don't disappoint Ms. Kleypas, keep the rakish Viscount St. Vincent bonded to his devilish, outrageous behavior - behavior that hides treasures aplenty.<br />Grade: B (that weak start)<br /><br />(...)of IT HAPPENED ONE AUTUMN is exactly what a Kleypas reader expects when they choose one of her books.

One of my all-time selected authors is Lorraine Heath, from the moment I read TEXAS DESTINY, she captivated me!  This is an author, whose books I pre-order, months in advance.  So it is with great regret I review A MATTER OF TEMPTATION.  Although, the author's idea of 'The Man in the Iron Mask meets Victorian England' is a wonderful concept, the delivery is disappointing!<br /><br />Robert Hawthorne, the Duke of Killingsworth has endured eight, grueling years in London's Pentonville Prison, courtesy of his manipulative twin brother, John.  John Hawthorne wanted all that belonged to his older brother - his title, his assets, his life!  For eight years John lived a counterfeit existence, while Robert lived in agony.  Now, Robert's daring escape signifies freedom, vengeance, and a bride.  A bride, who upsets him, confuses him, and threatens his plans.<br /><br />Her new husband bewilders Victoria Lambert.  He makes her feel unwanted and miserable. She knew he had not married for love, but she thought they suited.  Yet, her new husband is so different from the man who had courted her.  He is a mystery, he is unfamiliar, he is a complete stranger. On the other hand, Victoria finds herself softly intrigued by his current unusual excitement, emotion, and passion.<br /><br />A MATTER OF TEMPTATION is comparable to a slow waltz.  Lovely, unhurried, and fatiguing. Yes, the hero is a good man, but his 'I will not take from my despicable brother that to which I have no right' attitude quickly grows exasperating and tedious.  The entire 'reluctant but falling in love' plot is just too slow-paced.<br /><br />Grade: C-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche,<br /><br />Reviewer for: RomanceDesigns.	2005-09-28

Although, THE DEVIL'S NECKLACE is not a prefect read, it is definitely better than its predecessor, THE BRIDE'S NECKLACE.<br /><br />The British privateer, Ethan Sharpe, will never forget.  Tormenting images make him seek revenge savagely - revenge against a traitor - the man responsible for Ethan's lost crew. Harmon Jeffries is that responsible man.  He is responsible for the horrific images that still haunt Ethan.  Ethan still hears his men screaming and still sees their wasted blood.  No, he will never forget his destroyed ship, his lost crew, or the miserable months he spent in confinement - his scars and the limp will forever remind him. Yes, revenge will be his, but for now Ethan Sharpe will take the woman who aided the traitor, who allowed his escape.  Ethan will take and have Jeffries' mistress!<br /><br />Though she barely knows her biological father, Miss Grace Chastain refuses to abandon the man. Whether Harmon Jeffries is guilty or innocent, he is her father and she will not desert him.  Shockingly, she aids his escape.  Immediately, Grace is guilty of a terrible crime and she is going to pay - pay the price set by Captain Ethan Sharpe. \\"I'm a man, Miss Chastain.  Men have certain needs . . .\\"<br /><br />Grace is not what Ethan imagined. She is ladylike, lovely, and doesn't have the usual world-weary look of a seasoned mistress. He grows to respect her and admire her.  On the other hand, Grace Chastain is foolishly in love.  She gives Ethan her body, her heart, and her soul.  When Grace inescapably tells Ethan she is Jeffries' daughter and not his mistress, Ethan's warmth and affection ends . . .  ends until the bewitchment of the Bride's Necklace takes hold.<br /><br />Kat Martin does a respectable job with this story.  Her primary characters are likable and the story is easy and entertaining.  And although, THE DEVIL'S NECKLACE is the second book in a trilogy, the reader will not suffer the 'who are these people' syndrome.<br /><br />Nitpicky nuisances:<br /><br />- pg. 65. \\"She . . . drew back and slapped him across the face as hard as she could.

Nightly they broadcast his two-timing ways, because this time Lonnie Butrell is pleasuring a movie star!  How often can Chiffon Butrell accept his infidelity, how often can this man crush her heart, how often can she hold onto her self-respect and keep her head up?<br /><br />Estranged sisters, Chenille Grace and Chiffon Butrell, have spent a lifetime sidestepping each other.  However now Chenille's kid sister needs help and hesitantly Chenille offers.  But it won't be easy for the 40-year-old spinster! Chenille Grace is a neurotic perfectionist who spends ALL her time and money on a spoiled little dog and Chiffon is an impoverished ex-beauty queen.  A woman who allows her kids to eat whatever, dresses like a floozie, and is married to the world's biggest jerk!  In spite of the cards life has dealt her, Chiffon Butrell is a good friend, a decent mother, but she is a resistant sister. However now she needs her big sister's help and hesitantly she accepts Chenille's offer.<br /><br />Sisters are sisters.  Two people who share the same bond - a mother - here a demanding mother.  Yet, it takes this public embarrassment to make Chenille Grace and Chiffon Butrell realize how important the sister relationship is . . . how important they are to each other.<br /><br />Karen Gillespie pens a realistic story.  Gillespie's town setting is strangely familiar.  Her characters are earthy and common.  However, the author's descriptive relationships are truly thoughtful and imaginative.

The Peabody's of Boston are a proper Bostonian family.  Isadora is their oddball.  She is dark, pasty, and plump.  Her siblings are stylishly fair, fashionably pale, and wonderfully slender.  Repugnance fills Isadora's soul.  Her family shuns her, she has no friends, and the man she loves ignores her.  She will never be part of the 'Charmed Bostonian World'.  They will never invite her to the dazzling mythical circle of acceptance - a fairytale place filled with light and beauty and laughter.  So why shouldn't Isadora Peabody seize the chance to journey, to journey into a wonderful new world?<br /><br />Ryan Calhoun is a reckless southern gentleman.  He is a charmer. In Boston Harbor, Captain Ryan Calhoun is the latest hot-shot skipper.  He is famous for his outlandish clothes, his rakish behavior, and for bringing in lucrative cargos.  As accomplished as he is, Ryan Calhoun has only one goal - to reunite his partner with his wife and children.  A wife and children bound with the chains of slavery.  This time Ryan Calhoun's destination is Rio de Janeiro and he desperately needs a translator.  Isadora Peabody fits the bill . . .<br /><br />However, Isadora Peabody confuses Ryan Calhoun. She makes him uncomfortable.  Usually, he is drawn to beautiful women, women who can't see him for what he is - a spoiled, aimless young man.  Isadora Peabody sees beneath his carefully constructed facade.  Undeniably, he means to intimidate her, to humiliate her, to make her sorry she forced her way onto his ship.  Yet, his plans misfire.  Ryan finds that sharing Isadora's friendship, trust, and respect is far more satisfying.<br /><br />Although THE CHARM SCHOOL has a humorous feel, the story lacks something much more important - emotion!  To fulfill the metamorphosis idea the reader must feel the heroine's pain and suffering -  both emotions seem lacking. Isadora's transformation from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan is never truly felt - so in the end, Susan Wiggs' overall significance was lost.<br />Grade: B-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche,<br />Reviewer for: RomanceDesigns.significance was lost.

THE EARL'S SEASON is extremely well written, but the assembly and the delivery are even better.  Emma Lange's handling of this story IS worth 'The Sacred 10' and this story is the reason I love this genre.<br /><br />Juliana Whitfield is beautiful and wealthy. Presently, Lady Whitfield is a young widow; a young widow who vows she will never marry again, for Juliana has been to hell and has no intentions of returning to its fiery flames.  She is exquisitely beautiful, blessed with violet eyes, but underneath, dark shadows linger.  Everyone knew of Sir Arthur Whitfield's murky history.  He was one of the richest men in England, but he was leagues beneath his young wife, in class, and decades older.  Juliana soiled her reputation when she took the sixty-year-old man into her bed.  Soiled herself for money, or so society thought . . . Sir Whitfield had a vulgar manner and a bully's temper.  When she was barely seventeen, Juliana was sold for cards and loose women, sold for five thousand pounds, sold as property by her 'loving' family. Yes, Juliana had paid heavily for her riches!<br /><br />The Earl of Hampton, is devilishly handsome, notably wealthy, and has been blessed with a charming lopsided smile.  However, it is his eyes that are Lord Hampton's most striking feature.  When he is content, his eyes are soft - like warm honey, but when the earl is upset, his eyes grow hard - like frozen amber. Presently, Hampton's eyes are frigid.  He is extremely irritated!  Reluctantly, he finds himself on the marriage mart, but he is more upset with Lady Whitfield's bewitching spell.  A spell his sister has fallen under!  Why can't his sister see into the vixen's witch eyes, see into the vixen's soul?<br /><br />Unquestionably, THE EARL'S SEASON is a phenomenal read.  Emma Lange fills the pages with brilliant poignancy; although there is little intimacy, this dazzling story needs nothing more.  If I have a complaint, Emma Lange did not need the little sub-story she felt compelled to offer.  Juliana and Alex's story can stand alone - no other dressing is necessary.

Garrick Rowe believes in reincarnation and has been waiting for Katy Burns his entire life.  She thinks he is crazy.  His tactics are self-serving, and his attitude is arrogant.  Still, the man's words and ideas intrigue her. His beliefs fascinate her.  Garrick Rowe believes Katy Burns will remain in this godforsaken frontier, she will help him build his town, and then she will fight to keep it prosperous.  Yes, Garrick Rowe intrigues and fascinates Katy Burns, but she still thinks he is a lunatic - an attractive, forceful lunatic.<br /><br />Garrick Rowe wanted to shake Katy Burns, but not nearly as much as this reader.  Rowe found Katy delightful, stubborn, and ornery; this reader found her selfish and unpleasant.  The idea that the heroine had enough grit and spirit to cover a dozen women grew tiresome.  However, that tiresome distinction was not nearly as bad as the sticky, syrupy, love-feast that eventually occurred.  So, why didn't this reader bail out?  Because Ms. Garlock elected to run some very good sub-stories and these provocative secondary stories are what saved NIGHTROSE from damnation.<br /><br />Dorothy Garlock remains a favorite author governed by another remarkable trait: as a writer, Garlock never makes her reader feel anxiety.

It seems every time I decide to read this gifted author, she impresses me further. Simply put: THE LISTENING SKY is a book I couldn't put down.  Ms. Garlock uses folksy charm, intense emotion, delightful characters, and homespun love to weave this charming novel.<br /><br />Jane Love arrives in Timbertown, Wyoming hoping to escape her shameful past.  She longs for friendship and respect; instead, she finds love and an enemy.  Dorothy Garlock spins Jane Love into a remarkable, strong heroine - yet this heroine has an air of vulnerability.  In THE LISTENING SKY, a deranged person stalks Jane Love. In fact that is the story's potency - the heroine's secret? To intrigue her reader, Garlock drops subtle hints alluding to Jane's past and subsequently her story whirls in entertainment.<br /><br />Garlock's hero, T.C. Kilkenny has Irish, English, and Blackfoot ancestry.  Accordingly, he is determined, dignified, and proud.  Garlock further accents his character by making Kilkenny strong and gentle.  A hero who immediately sees through Jane's veil of cover, he recognizes the terrified woman beneath, but before he can help her, he must keep her in his town. T.C. has no qualms about his matchmaking ideas. A lumberjack and a cattleman, he is determined to build a town and what better way than to find wives . . . for his men and for . . . himself.<br /><br />Dorothy Garlock hands her reader a literary treasure.  THE LISTENING SKY is a 'feel good' story.  Although, the author relies on intrigue and mystery, she does not keep her reader on the edge; she moves her characters and their problems along.  The reader is not subject to long moments of conflict and trouble; no Garlock writes a quick paced book filled with interesting predicaments and engaging secondary characters.

She works to live.<br /><br />Alexander Grantham, the Viscount Sheridan, sees his life in discontentment.  This is a man who wants change.  He is ready to quit his mistress, but more important he is ready to quit his 'unique' specialty. In his vision of change, what Sheridan doesn't see is a young person saving his life.  Lily Rose is that young person and now her three small friends beg for his help - their Miss Rose is dying . . .<br /><br />The hero, Viscount Sheridan, known throughout the story as 'Sherry' (a distractingly feminine nickname - by the way), is a gentle man with a dubious past.  If there is a regret with the 'Sherry' character, he is too gentle!  However, Lily jumps from Goodman's pages with intelligence, kindness, and humanity.  But, it is Goodman's handling of the three little pickpockets that is truly her shiny achievement.  The author's portrayal of these little rascals is pure delight.  They appear colorful and intriguing - too bad the author didn't elaborate further and enlarge their story . . .<br /><br />Yes, watching this love develop from zilch into a rich bounty is very touching and satisfying, yet this story does have problems. For this reader, the beginning seemed foggy; nevertheless it was THE ending that posed the biggest threat to true success.  Goodman's ending was FAR too chivalrous and her characters FAR too forgiving!  Could anyone disregard such a revolting beast and his acts as Goodman wanted us to believe?

He certainly would lend a hand, why he would even lend his bed!<br /><br />Claire Temple Whiting was a divine delectable angel, but it was her complex sister who truly fascinated the rakish earl.  Victoria was an intriguing puzzle - a puzzle Cord Easton would solve - he would unravel 'Puzzle Victoria' between his sheets!<br /><br />Finally, Miss Victoria was his.  He had captured her mystery, checked, and mated her!  But Easton's victory was short-lived.  Gravely, he had blundered!  For Victoria was not merely a servant, she was of noble birth.  Now Cord Easton was furious. The woman had lied.  He had shockingly comprised the daughter of a peer and now he must wed the penniless woman - the 'ruined' woman who not only had lied to him, but had stolen his heart too!<br /><br />Alas, Kat Martin has been around for years and yes some of her books are indeed winners.  But Kat Martin is an author who applies the 'Conflict Ideology' approach to her writing.  This approach generally has the lead characters in constant contention.  In THE BRIDE'S NECKLACE, Ms. Martin further accents her story by presenting the 'non-communication detour' - the two characters love each other, but refuse to say the words - forcing the reader to howl, \\"Say the words! Oh please Cord and Vic say the words! SAY THE WORDS - so we can move on!\\"  Yet, that is the remarkable genius behind 'Conflict Ideology' - it fattens a common story!<br /><br />Yes, this is a common story, still I liked the way Kat Martin handled her secondary characters, especially the sister, Claire.  The author chose to write this character as a gentle soul with a gentle heart - a different - yet very satisfying writing approach.

This was my first journey into Susan Wiggs' world and what a trip.  If this is Wiggs' normal measure, well welcome to MY revered author's list Ms. Wiggs, for THE HORSEMASTER'S DAUGHTER is first-class entertainment!<br /><br />Hunter Calhoun is a shattered man with a shattered family.  His life is in turmoil.  He was born into the privileged world of the south - the south before the Civil War.  His world was wealth, breeding and good manners, but that world shattered the day he inherited Albion Plantation; the day they read The Will; the day the creditors came calling. Oh, how well he remembered that day and the day he told Lacey his dream - his dream to turn Albion into a Thoroughbred breeding and racing farm.  He remembered his lovely, young wife weeping and begging him to reconsider.  Painfully, he remembered how his delicate Lacey left him.  How she left his home and their marriage. How she left him with a daughter to raise, a son to cope with, and a dented whiskey flask to hide in.<br /><br />Hunter Calhoun's last chance was the devil himself.  A devil hiding inside an Irish Thoroughbred - a prized stallion called Finn.  Could Hunter Calhoun grasp this last chance, could his stallion lose its demonic evil? Only if the rumors were true - a 'Horsemaster', living on a remote marsh island, had a gift!<br /><br />Eliza Flyte is a natural, unrestrained, untainted woman.  Her simple joy for life is infectious.  Raised by a mysterious man, in the middle of nowhere, Eliza Flyte is a gentle creature who lacks the refinements of a well-brought up lady.  She is a woman who dresses poorly and speaks oddly.  Yet, she is the most compelling woman Hunter Calhoun has ever met.  She makes him feel new again.  She makes him believe again - to believe that love is the greatest healer of all.<br /><br />THE HORSEMASTER'S DAUGHTER is a wonderful romance filled with understanding and compassion.  Although there is not much heat by way of passion and lust, Wiggs' manages to iron and smooth out this unimportant wrinkle through her great storytelling ability.<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.Wiggs' manages to iron and smooth out this unimportant wrinkle through her great storytelling ability. <br />Grade: A <br /> <br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-08-22

In WICKED FANTASY, Jordan DELAYS the hardcore intimacy and instead writes a story - a descriptive, satisfying story!<br /><br />His Christian name was Treylayne, a bequest from his mother's side; his father was a knight, but he chose to disobey him. Trey Deverill had the audacity to defy.  He felt the need to see the world and the desire to make his own way - and Trey Deverill was a success!  He was also handsome, sensual, and wealthy. Sadly, Trey Deverill was not the man for Antonia Maitland. Although, he had some blue blood, it was not enough; Trey Deverill did not have a title!<br /><br />Oh, how Miss Antonia Maitland fantasized about the dashing, adventurous Trey Deverill!  Four years was a long time to dream and imagine his unclothed body - his beautiful, hard, unclothed body.  It was four years ago when Antonia accidentally caught this man stepping from his bath - this man and his body - and oh what wicked dreams that memory triggered.  Wicked dreams that were simply a fantasy - a fantasy that would lead nowhere.  Instead, Antonia would fulfill her papa's dreams.  Finally the Maitland family would have its 'title'; Antonia was now engaged to the refined aristocratic Baron Heward.<br /><br />Yet, things were not right in the blue-blooded world; it was rumored Baron Heward was a cruel, possessive beast.  His marriage to the common, but very wealthy Miss Maitland, would allow control of the Maitland Shipping Empire!  And nothing would stop Heward's plans - not even the low-class founder of Maitland Shipping, Samuel Maitland . . .<br /><br />With Antonia's father dead, the demonic baron moves ahead with his monstrous plans - his plans for Antonia and her estate.  However, Trey Deverill has plans of his own!<br /><br />Nicole Jordan writes a beauty.  WICKED FANTASY is book three in Jordan's 'Paradise series' and although Trey Deverill is a member of the Guardians - a centuries-old order of protectors - that entire Guardian concept is not necessary or required.  No, WICKED FANTASY doesn't need any window dressing.  This is a story filled with its own strength and doesn't need or require the safety found in a series package!

Samantha James offers the final chapter in her Sterling Trilogy and although A PERFECT HERO is a pleasant enough read, somehow it doesn't satisfy!  Sadly, Lady Julianna's tale slips away.<br /><br />Julianna Sterling is getting on with her life.  Four years earlier, on her wedding day, Lady Julianna was abandoned by her fianc&eacute;.  Humiliated and embarrassed, Julianna promised herself she would never again allow a man to enter her heart.  Unfortunately, such a defiant direction means Julianna Sterling will never know a man's touch or have a child of her own.<br /><br />Dane, Viscount Granville, works undercover for the Crown.  He is the notorious highwayman 'The Magpie' and he is very good at his job.  He is always cool and collected - always - well until he is forced to take Julianna Sterling captive, forced to take her to his cottage in the woods.  Then suddenly Viscount Granville is simply a man.<br /><br />OK such a plot does sound promising!  Such a plot lays the necessary groundwork for a great romantic adventure, so what caused the story to slip away? The primary evil was the heroine's demeanor. It shouts childlike! Although, Julianna Sterling's age is twenty-seven, she radiates ten, she behaves ten, and the reader thinks ten.  Whereupon, identifying romance, with a lead female character assigned to childish behavior, is extraordinary hard.  The second crime is the blatant lack of the stringent social rules of the Regency period.  Whenever did it become acceptable for a strange man to carry a disheveled lady into her own house, past her servants, to her bedroom, undress her, spend the night, and have NOT one person raise an eyebrow?  And when did it become socially A-OK for a virtual stranger to announce to a lady's brothers (one a Marquess) that he is going to marry their sister.  Not ask, just state!  The consequences?  The lady's brothers swap a humorous glance!  Unquestionably, a historical romance must follow the rules of the era; the story CANNOT be altered to garnish the author's perception.<br /><br />Yes, this is the third and final book of the Sterling family trilogy and although it does have some major problems the story remains pleasant and the fairytale epilogue did bring a smile. And it is not necessary to read A PERFECT BRIDE featuring Sebastian Sterling, the Marquess of Thurston, or A PERFECT GROOM, the Justin Sterling story, to understand and follow the Sterling family history!  That feature is always an added bonus.<br />Grade: B-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.ANNOT be altered to garnish the author's perception.

I confess I couldn't put down Harlequin Blaze # 177 because Candace Schuler wrote a gem.<br /><br />Clay Madison is not used to being 'used'.  He is used to calling the bedroom scenes.  Why?  A): He is a big-time rodeo star and B): he is a man!  The man has a woman in every town and in every city - everywhere the rodeo plays!  The man likes flash, curves, and no fuss when the party is over.  So, why is this man allowing a serious-minded, prissy, skinny lady-rancher to direct his bedroom action?<br /><br />Miz Jo Beth Jensen has no time for cowboys.  Oh, they are fine as employees, and they are good enough to be friends, yeah they are ok, but they are just NOT bed-partners!  No way, Jose!  So why is she fantasizing about Clay Madison?  What is it about this man she can't leave alone - this four-time Pro Rodeo championship bull-riding cowboy man?<br /><br />Although her heroine is a tough little cookie, the author surrounds Jo Beth in vulnerability and the hero may bend, but under the surface Clay Madison radiates strength.  This story is delightful, the banter is first-rate, and the potency is electrifying. Good golly, Schuler writes some juicy scenes.  Hey, doesn't this author know paper burns? Yeah, Schuler's THE COWBOY WAY is one entertaining, humorous, and hot read!<br />Grade: A<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.<br />Reviewer for RomanceDesigns.com	2005-07-25

I've heard people say that too much of anything is not good for you!  In Julia Quinn's IT'S IN HIS KISS, too much tedious dialogue was not good for me! The story just had too much senseless chatter that didn't advance its plot!  Routine dialogue that turned boring; routine dialogue that felt strangely contemporary!<br /><br />IT'S IN HIS KISS, continues with the Bridgerton family saga.  This time Ms. Quinn tackles Hyacinth's story.  Hyacinth is the youngest of the Bridgerton clan, and like most 'youngest' in a family, she is a manipulator, who loves to get her own way -- and she usually does. She is spontaneous, devilishly outspoken, charming, and exasperating -- exasperating enough to provoke Gareth St. Clair.<br /><br />Gareth St. Clair was his father's contempt.  The man loathed him.  Gareth was a by-blow, nothing more than a whelp his mother obtained from another man.  Oh how, his 'legal' father delighted in that wounding confession.  Yes, someday Gareth St. Clair would inherit his father's title and properties, but first the old man would beggar the St. Clair estates.  Nevertheless, Gareth did have one endowment: his grandmother's diary - a diary written in Italian.  Bewitchingly smart Hyacinth Bridgerton offers to translate for Gareth.  Yet, as they attempt to solve the text, Gareth St. Clair soon discovers he wants Hyacinth Bridgerton!  If for no other reason than to show his father he is good enough for a 'ton' girl.<br /><br />After Quinn's victory with WHEN HE WAS WICKED, I looked to this entry with much anticipation, but I finished disappointed.  IT'S IN HIS KISS is reminiscent of Quinn's BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN and DANCING AT MIDNIGHT.  Lifeless dialogue plagues all three; all three are inglorious.<br />Grade: B-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.<br />Reviewer for: RomanceDesigns.com	2005-07-24

It is tastefully sizzling, gently suspenseful, and in the end, I wasn't ready to say goodbye.  Now, that IS the mark of a good romance book!<br /><br />Jamie Creed is a psychic with a troubled past.  He is a man who keeps to himself, living as a recluse in the mountains of North Carolina.  He fears people and their demands.  Jamie Creed is happy to be alone, he needs no one!  So he is not sure, what to make, of the woman he rescued; the woman he stripped naked; the woman he carried back to his cabin; the woman he examined physically.<br /><br />Faith Owen remembers Jamie from his days at the research center, the center where 'they' conducted cruel experiments on him.  Back then, Faith was attracted to him.  Yet, Jamie doesn't remember her.  Now, however, she tempts him!  Faith uses that temptation to improve her shaky position and to gain Jamie's assistance.  She confuses him by offering warmth, love, and understanding, but Faith Owen's friendship and intimacy are not without price! Faith needs his help!<br /><br />The cover boldly states, \\"EVERY WOMAN'S BEEN WAITING FOR . . . JAMIE\\" and indeed Lori Forster delivers.  Her attractive hero and affectionate heroine are one hot couple. Regrettably, I didn't read Foster's 'Visitation series' in order and therefore, I felt a little misplaced!  Ms. Foster throws in all the characters from her previous books, characters who are now Jamie's friends and protectors.  Definitely there is a feeling of strong attachment and for Foster's faithful readers this is probably a great deal of fun.  Unfortunately, it made me feel like an outsider looking in!  In fact, for the first few pages I felt a little lost. Yet, by the end of the book, I was enthusiastically there - there to share the good feeling. Hmmm, now to hunt down the other four books in this series!<br />Grade: A-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-07-20

In THE IMPOSTOR, Bradley's keen sense of style and her glorious humor definitely met with this reader's blessings.<br /><br />Dalton Montmorency, Lord Etheridge, is the spymaster of the Liar's Club.  The Liar's Club is a motley crew of thieves and misfits operating undercover for the Crown and the English government.  Montmorency gained the position when Simon Raines (THE PRETENDER) retired. However, the men, he now commands, hold him in suspicion.  He is a lord of the realm; a haughty gentleman who didn't earn the spymaster position; NOW they will force him to earn their loyalty.  He vows to take on the very next mission himself, he will prove to his men that he is one of them and that he is damn good at his job!  The next mission: to ferret out the notorious Sir Thorogood, the political caricaturist.  The drawings are a thorn in the government's side.<br /><br />So who is Sir Thorogood and who wants him dead? Hence, Celeste Bradley introduces gentle intrigue.<br /><br />Mrs. Clara Simpson is Sir Thorogood!  This gently-bred widow secretly pens the cartoons.  Her mission: to earn enough money to find a new home and rid herself of her overbearing in-laws.  So when a pompous impostor adopts the role of Sir Thorogood, Clara is determined to betray the flamboyant fraud!  But first Clara Simpson must camouflage her own appearance.<br /><br />Aye, there's the rub!  Which character is the true impostor?  Both!  And that is the story's essence. A story that is lusty, humorous, and charming.  Furthermore, Celeste Bradley's secondary characters are well drawn and only enhance the book's surroundings.<br /><br />However, in my mind, Bradley's THE PRETENDER and THE IMPOSTOR run side by side.  The storylines are fundamentally cloned. Although I liked both books very much, they are essentially the same.  Perhaps, if I had NOT read them back to back . . .  Nevertheless, on its own, THE IMPOSTOR is still great fun!<br /><br />Grade: A-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.eat fun! <br />Grade: A- <br /> <br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-07-14

Curious because it is SO NOT in the Regency period!  But what the heck, Celeste Bradley still delivers glorious fun in this `historical' set novel!<br /><br />Agatha Cunnington is a woman blessed with `charms'.  She is shrewdly deceptive, resourceful, cute and very pleasing to a man's eye.  She normally lives in the country raising sheep and growing prize winning apples.  Yet something is amiss in Miss Agatha Cunnington's life; she has not heard from her cherished brother in months. So off to London Agatha goes, to begin her search and to introduce her bogus husband - bogus until she meets the `chimneysweep'.<br /><br />Simon Montague Raines, aka Simon Rain, is a member of the Liar's Club, a renegade group of blackguards and thieves working undercover for the Crown and the English government.  Simon Rain IS the master of composure and control, or WAS the master - Simon Rain just ran into Agatha Cunnington - the mistress of aggravation.<br /><br />THE PRETENDER is an enjoyable book with a fresh and innovative storyline.  Celeste Bradley's lively plot has it all: delightful seduction, daring abduction, an artful rescue, and scheming characters.  Humor is the story's main thrust, but Ms. Bradley adds to the reader's gratification by wisely scattering poignant morsels here and there.

Johanna Lindsey was THE author who piloted me into the realm of romance heaven.  She was THE author that completely hooked me and she opened a whole new world of enjoyment.  For that - I am eternally grateful.  So it is with heavy heart that I review Johanna's latest entry.<br /><br />Lady Margaret Landor remembers Sebastian Townshend as a tall, dashing, and charming bachelor. Never did she dream that one day she would hire him to save HIS OWN father. Although Sebastian Townshend has forged a new identity, Maggie is certain he will come home, but Sebastian Townshend has vowed never to return to England.<br /><br />His own father banished him. His heartbreaking exile was the result of a tragic duel - a duel his father, the Earl of Edgewood, cautioned against - emphatically!  Now living on the continent, Sebastian Townshend is 'The Raven' - a deadly mercenary and Lady Margaret Landor needs his help.<br /><br />Like most of Lindsey's recent books, MARRIAGE MOST SCANDALOUS is unfortunate.  Heavy use of repetition assembles a bumpy jagged storyline!  So much of the book is spent trying to develop a conspiracy there is little build-up time for romance. The fake marriage is nothing but the author's excuse to get sensual passion into the story, unfortunately the reader never feels that emotion!  And believing the story's passion is this genre's foundation!<br /><br />Sadly, 'Love a Lindsey' was once the rallying cry among romance fans. Alas, not anymore. WHY? I want to know why!  Johanna Lindsey still has the talent to write, but it seems she has misplaced her technique! WHY?<br /><br />\\"If it ain't broke . . . don't fix it!\\"<br /><br />Please Johanna, reexamine your legendary PRISONER OF MY DESIRE, GENTLE ROGUE and TENDER REBEL and rediscover your formula - your tried and true formula.

ON THIN ICE is the final installment for the family, it continues with the anti-terrorist team of warriors known as T-FLAC, but as a love story it fails miserably.<br /><br />As a Canadian I understand snow, and ice, and wind, and I cannot imagine any of these elements inspiring romance.  Well maybe if the couple were snug and warm inside a cabin, with a toasty fire blazing and hot toddies on the menu, but racing in the Iditarod Sled Race just doesn't stir romantic visions.<br /><br />And then our couple . . .<br /><br />Dr. Lily Munroe is the woman Derek Wright loves.  Derek Wright is the man who dazzles Lily Munroe.  Six years ago, they dated.  Lily was terrified of the feelings Derek stimulated, so terrified, so overwhelmed; she decided to marry his \\"best\\" friend!  WHOA, run that again.  His kisses were too hot and his embraces were too powerful, so to be on the safe side, Lily wed another!  Wed another and on her honeymoon, in her husband's arms, she imagined she was with the man she'd fled (pg. 166)!<br /><br />O . . . K . . .<br /><br />And yes it was six years (pg. 47) and (pg. 77)!  Let's see - 1 week after the honeymoon, the doctor diagnosed terminal cancer; for 3 years Lily nursed the husband; then 6 months as a widow; ummm, that leaves 30 misplaced months?  What she dated this lying, cheating fellow for 3 years and super T-FLAC agent Derek Wright - who prided himself in his ability to size someone up - stepped aside?  Exactly how smooth, how smart, how much in love was this guy?<br /><br />Alas, all I ask from an author is one basic requirement: I want to believe that the romance is truly there!  I want the romance to feel real.  In ON THIN ICE, Lily Munroe is just not a convincing participant.  And why, oh why, Derek Wright loves her is beyond this reader.  How many times can a woman insult and slam a man's feelings? Six years is a long time for a man to cling to a dream.  Sorry, I don't buy it!

Although, the foundation of the story is ordinary - an enchanting forceful hero kidnaps a fair maiden -  his motive: retaliation - her fianc&eacute;'s father murdered his parents.  Still, Ms. Jordan manages to spin an interesting tale.<br /><br />Jordan's setting is first-rate.  The reader senses the author has taken time to research the customs of the Middle East.  Her results: an exotic atmosphere.<br /><br />Alysson Vickery was an English rose searching for passion and adventure.  In Algeria, she found both, much to her sorrow.  Jafar el-Saleh was a Berber prince; the royal blood of fierce rulers flowed through his veins.  Alysson Vickery and Jafar el-Saleh were silently in love, but they had no future.  They had nothing in common. She was his prisoner; her value was planned.  He was her jailer; her use calculated.<br /><br />LORD OF DESIRE is a pleasing read, even though the story tends to run in circles (a good editing job would serve!) and the prologue is questionable (did someone advise its insertion at a later date?).  Alas, this book is no longer published, but it is available on the secondary market (pricey online), so do check out those yard sales and flea markets and witness the developing talent of Nicole Jordan.<br />Grade: B<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-06-18

Some women like to discuss politics and world events; some women like to discuss nonsense and men.  The first group holds my respect, but the second group holds my interest.  Cheryl Sawyer's THE CHASE belongs to the first group.  This is a book steeped in history, detail, and description.  Is it my kind of book? No.  However, Cheryl Sawyer worked far too hard on research, time, and effort for me to slam this endeavor!<br /><br />The Italians have an expression \\"Colpo di fulmine\\" meaning A THUNDERBOLT OF LOVE or LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.  This is the premise Cheryl Sawyer unravels in her history laden novel, THE CHASE.  Jacques Decernay is a \\"Chasseur\\" - a captured French soldier who now fights with the British, against Napoleon.  However, such a soldier is considered a betrayer and assigned to the lowest ranks.  This is the military distinction Jacques Decernay holds when he encounters the lovely widow Lady Sophia Hamilton.<br /><br />Sophia Hamilton is disgusted with her reaction to the French gentleman, Jacques Decernay.  No one has ever affected her so, now she feels guilt, shame, and betrayal.  After all, the French murdered her husband - her friend, her lover, the father of her son - Harry.  Now someone is trying to murder Harry - could it be the Frenchman who has writhed into her heart?<br /><br />Cheryl Sawyer tells her love story through Sophia Hamilton - a woman who detests war.  More important, Sophia Hamilton detests the weakness found in women. The weakness when they do not speak out, when they sacrifice in silence, when they betray those they love - as  their men go off to war - for Sophia Hamilton, too, was guilty of weakness.  Cheryl Sawyer may use the backdrop of the Napoleonic resurgence to tell her story, but she lets her reader know this weakness is an age-old problem despite a woman's country or race.<br /><br />This writer definitely did not follow the normal path attributed to this genre.  It is obvious, Ms. Sawyer researched this era fully and her love of history shines through brilliantly.  So if instructive history is your forte, then you will likely enjoy Sawyer's sweeping historical work, but a warning: it is intense.<br /><br />Grade: B+<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.y and her love of history shines through brilliantly.

Ultimately, every reader has different feelings regarding any given book.  Opinions make the world go round and sharing thoughts and opinions with fellow book lovers and readers is always great fun.  Giving an overall rating to an anthology is usually VERY difficult. Not all the stories are to one's liking; yet, I always enjoy anthologies, because FREQUENTLY one comes across an unfamiliar author . . . someone satisfyingly new.<br /><br />MOONLIGHT LOVERS: FIVE LOVE STORIES TO ENCHANT YOU is a paranormal anthology released in September, 1993, five short stories written by five romantic \\"big guns\\" . . .<br /><br />1). Mary Balogh: \\"THE NORTH TOWER.\\" - Rating: B- (4 Stars).<br /><br />The setting is Balogh's calling card: the Regency period.  Daphne Borland's maternal grandfather bequeathed Roscoe Castle to her - unexpectedly.  Roscoe Castle was magnificent, so magnificent the Earl of Everett wanted it.  Craftily, on his deathbed, Daphne's grandfather agreed the property would pass into the earl's possession, if his lordship and his granddaughter married within three months, if not, the ownership passed.  Forthwith, Daphne felt a bond with \\"her\\" castle.  The \\"North\\" tower provocatively lured her; lured her into the arms of a sexy, passionate ghost - a ghost very familiar to Daphne.<br /><br />THE NORTH TOWER is a pleasant read, but it lacks the familiar Balogh poignancy.  Usually, this author penetrates her reader's heart through sensitivity and sympathy.  Regrettably, both emotions are absent in this story.<br /><br />Grade: B-<br /><br />2). Maura Seger: \\"REFLECTIONS.\\" - Rating: A- (5 Stars).<br /><br />The setting is the late 19th century.  With the sole responsibility of two younger siblings, Nora Butler is desperate.  So desperate, she hires herself out as a \\"party\\" psychic.  Bram Hayes intends to expose Miss Nora Butler as a fraud.  He believes she is a charlatan exploiting the spiritualism fad. Instead, he finds he is totally captivated by this young innocent woman, this attractive woman with the soft auburn hair.<br /><br />REFLECTIONS is a gentle, well-written story - \\"page turner\\" material.  The story's weakness: the brisk conclusion, which is all-too common short story annoyance.<br /><br />Grade: A-<br /><br />3). Jo Beverley: \\"THE DEMON'S BRIDE.\\" - Rating: C (3 Stars).<br /><br />Rachel Proudfoot is the Vicar's daughter.  She is intelligent, innocent, and as her surname suggests \\"proud.\\"  The Earl of Morden thinks she is magnificent and should be in his bed.  Wickedly, the Earl of Morden pursues Rachel throughout THE DEMON'S BRIDE.  Rachel has enough trouble resisting the temptation of rakish Lord Morden without supernatural intervention, but this is a paranormal anthology and supernatural forces are at work.  The story begins with the Earl of Morden discussing the annual celebration called Walpurgis Night. Rachel's father is the new vicar in Walberton, a small town in Suffolk.  In his spare time, the vicar studies peculiar, local customs.<br /><br />Sexual tension flows throughout.  Magnificently, the pages are set to burn whenever the hero and heroine get together. This potency makes for great romance fun.  However, Jo Beverley tells the story, solely, from the heroine's viewpoint.  I am not a big fan of this writing style.  Such an approach, generally, SLOWS the development of the other lead character.  Therefore, in THE DEMON'S BRIDE, Mark Brandish, the Earl of Morden, appears vain and shallow - not an inspiring strategy for a romance hero.<br /><br />Grade: C<br /><br />4). Anita Mills: \\"THE HAUNTING OF SARAH GORDON.\\" - Rating: A (5 Stars).<br /><br />THE HAUNTING OF SARAH GORDON is absolutely wonderful.  David Gordon went to war, but he promised his new bride he'd come back to her.  He promised he'd return a complete whole man, but David Gordon died.<br /><br />Now, Anita Mills soundly displays her writing talent.  The reader shares Sarah Gordon's complete misery.  This is great writing.  THE HAUNTING OF SARAHGORDON is heart wrenching; yet as the story kindles the reader feels life again.  Adeptly, the author wraps up this paranormal story with a truly happily-ever-after ending.  Lovely. No wonder, I am hooked on this genre.<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />5). Patricia Rice: \\"MIDNIGHT LOVERS.\\" - Rating: B+ (4 Stars).<br /><br />An eerie story charged with enchantment, mystic concoctions, and magic. MIDNIGHT LOVERS is set in Louisiana, shortly after the civil war. Adrian Doncaster's spirit is dead.  He regrets the state of war.  He regrets the killing, the destruction, the hate.  Adrian Doncaster is in New Orleans to visit a friend; he yearns for a reason to live.  Instead, he finds Camille LeFebvre, a frail individual, who also fights the daily chore of living.  MIDNIGHT LOVERS is the story of two hopeless people suddenly thrust into a supernatural web.  Two sad souls exposed to the strange, unexplainable forces of the bayou - forces that grant the strength to love and to hope again.<br /><br />Patricia Rice brandishes a good colorful, descriptive pen.  Her setting skills are first-rate, and the story's sexual tension is sultry.<br /><br />Grade: B+<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.heart wrenching; yet as the story kindles the reader feels life again.

Romance is very difficult to write and although HERE COMES THE BRIDE is fun, it is a book with problems. Nevertheless, Ms. Drewry's plot did make me turn the pages anticipating the next high-spirited event.<br /><br />Tess Kinley is spunky and cute. When nervous she talks, she rattles, she rambles, she jumps from one subject to the next, her listeners: overwhelmed. Tess Kinley is spontaneous, candid, and bewitching. Tess Kinley is a great heroine.<br /><br />Gabe Calloway is a rugged Montana rancher. Gabe Calloway has no time for highfalutin' gals from Boston. He has no time for alluring, sweet little ladies who drive him crazy. No time at all - well - maybe he can spare a moment. Is Gabe Calloway a great hero? No. Why? Drewry never shaped his \\"sturdy\\" character. He is supposed to be rugged, yet when our hero finds a heathen violently raping Tess, Gabe simply clubs the brute over the head! This is 1885 Montana, why not shoot the (b..tard)? Gabe claims he loves Tess, yet he looks the other way when she spends her nights in a run-down hotel with lecherous drunks prowling the halls! But the final miscarriage of hero construction? Tess' ex-fianc&eacute; coerces HER to return to Boston. Keep in mind, Tess is now married and pregnant with Gabe's child. And what does Gabe do? Well . . . FINALLY, FINALLY he goes after her! Their reunion scene? The \\"Boston Beast\\" is slapping Tess around, throwing her to the ground, and hog-tying her, yet when the \\"western smoke\\" clears, the only person dead is her father! Now, don't get me wrong, I am not a person who justifies killing, but this is 1885 Montana!<br /><br />In the future, Laura Drewry will probably enjoy a successful career in romance writing, but HERE COMES THE BRIDE will NOT launch it. Leading romantic characters must bury themselves in a reader's heart, the romance must be felt. Romance is lust, desire, sensuality; elements not easily achieved without reader confidence in the lead characters.<br />Grade: C-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-05-22

I won't write the storyline; many fellow reviewers have already screamed out the novel's game. No, instead I will write a reader's outlook.  A Reader: the person BUYING the book.<br /><br />The first section of this book is SO fabulous!  The beginning has a \\"Can't Put This Book Down\\" feeling.  Jackie Ivie has written a masterpiece.  LADY OF THE KNIGHT is reading heaven; Jackie Ivie has me . . .<br /><br />How wonderful, how uncommon.  A heroine and hero who are equal in stamina, in strength, in vigor.  Equal!  Yet, the heroine is still vulnerable, still innocent, still sensitive. Oh, LADY OF THE KNIGHT catches me, it intrigues me, and it fascinates me.  Yes, Jackie Ivie has me . . .<br /><br />Then part 2 . . . suddenly I realize Zander FitzHugh DOES believe Morgan KilCreggar is a lad. Oh, NO.  Don't do it Jackie Ivie!  Until that moment, I honestly thought Zander FitzHugh was teasing, badgering, playing with the bonny lass Morganna.  Boy, was I wrong, (wrong) wrong (wrong) . . .  Zander FitzHugh DOES believe Morgan is a lad.  Good grief!  And he, Zander a sinner for he entertains sexual feelings.<br /><br />\\"ZANDER SAYS YOU'RE A LAD,\\" he (Zander's brother) said softly.  \\"IS HE BLIND?\\"<br /><br />This reader shrieked aloud, \\"No, your brother is a dimwit!\\"<br /><br />Ahh, Jackie!  Why couldn't your perfection keep flowing?  Why couldn't you hang onto your fabulous beginning?  Why drag out THE farce?  Surely, readers don't want to believe their heroes are that lacking!  Gol . . . lee!  Surely, Zander would come to realize this was not a boy, a lad, a fellow, a chap, or a young man who shared his bed chambers . . .<br /><br />The second part of \\"Lady of the Knight\\" is unfortunate!  What started so GOOD simply ran out of story. I began skimming!  LADY OF THE KNIGHT no longer held my interest.  What a tragedy!  For a while, Jackie Ivie's debut book had keeper shelf written all over it . . .<br /><br />Five stars for that beginning!<br />NO stars for part 2.<br />Final Grade: C<br />2.5 stars<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-05-06

Dorothy Garlock manages to write a very good book and she does not rely on sex to keep reading interest.  This is a story with a \\"Walton Mountain\\" feel and displays a vivid homespun quality.<br /><br />In the town of Harpersville, Tennessee, Jesse Forbes wore her nurse's uniform proudly.  She was pleased and honored to serve in her father's surgery.  She was proud to be a nurse and her desire to care for the sick was worth the two years she had spent away from home.<br /><br />Wade Simmer lived in the hills surrounding Harpersville.  The people in the town commonly called him a hillbilly or hill trash.  They had hanged his father for murder and some people figured Wade Simmer had naturally inherited bad blood.  He had a reputation for being wild and difficult.<br /><br />So, exactly why did Wade Simmer stop Jesse Forbes' buggy on that cool spring day?  Curiosity? No!  It was fascination. The town doctor's daughter fascinated and intrigued him.<br /><br />Yes, TENDERNESS is a good story.  Strength enhances Dorothy Garlock storytelling ability.  Strength gained with her use of strong characters and a variety of effective storylines: a town pervert, a wicked housekeeper, and a snooty \\"first-family.\\" No, Garlock does not tax her reader by using a one-dimensional outline; instead she runs a collection of lively storylines and, thus, maintains her reader's total interest.<br /><br />This book is completely recommended for readers who cherish good writing, honest storytelling, and gentle romance.<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-05-04

Ranney regularly fills her books with beautiful words and powerful sentences.  Again, in TILL NEXT WE MEET, the author presents her exquisite writing style.  Her words flow with artistic form and vivid description.<br /><br />Catherine Dunnan is lonely.  Married only one month, Catherine is overwhelmed when her new husband goes to war.  Yet, his letters give Catherine a reason to live, to dream, to survive.  He fills her heart with sincere tenderness and promise, bringing her comfort and hope, allowing Catherine a future.<br /><br />Colonel Moncrief's first letter to Catherine Dunnan was easy to write.  He penned it from pity.  Colonel Moncrief felt sorry for Catherine; after all, her husband was the most unethical man he had ever met!  No man, such as Harry Dunnan, deserved such loyalty, such compassion, such love as Catherine dispensed.  Signing Harry Dunnan's name was easy; it was done to reassure Catherine Dunnan.  However, one letter quickly turned into a year long secret relationship, a relationship built on fraud.<br /><br />Colonel Moncrief of the Lowland Scots Fusiliers was now the Duke of Lymond. He was back in Scotland to assume his duties and obligations.  It was his duty to call upon the grief-stricken Catherine Dunnan.  He went out of protocol and honor.  He often called upon relatives of fallen comrades - to express regret.  Catherine Dunnan was no different - or was she?<br /><br />Karen Ranney writes a beautiful story.  The intimate letters are tender and stunning.<br /><br />To further enhance her book, Ranney spread \\"story secrets\\" throughout. However, the secrets disenchanted me; these \\"story bombshells\\" seemed to lack the passion and intensity found in the rest of Ranney's story. Still, the author is right on track with this lovely love story. TILL NEXT WE MEET is very impressive.<br />Grade A-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-05-02

Prowling through Chapters, Canada's largest bookstore, I suddenly saw it - Teresa Bodwell's LOVING MERCY.  Was it the author's name that stopped me cold? No!  Was it the title?  No!  Was it the rave reviews?  No!<br /><br />So what made me stop?<br /><br />That cover!  That fantastic cover!<br /><br />Mercy Clark is a rough and tough woman. A western lady who wears a forty-four strapped to her hip.  A no-nonsense woman determined to run her life, her ranch and the men who work for her. Her Christian name is Mercy, but this lady knows precious little about the meaning!  Mercy Clark is a woman who is quick to judge, quick to condemn and can hold a grudge better than most!<br /><br />Thad Buchanan is determined to get to Colorado. He feels obligated to see his sister again. He hopes that this journey will enable him to start over, to fulfill their Papa's dreams. After all, Papa's sons were the family's future. Sons meant the continuation of the family name and the family heritage. Now all Thad Buchanan has to do is to find a little woman to marry. A little woman who will provide sons, support the family future and continue the Buchanan legacy!<br /><br />For seventy-five dollars, Mercy Clark will guide Thad Buchanan to Fort Victory, Colorado.<br /><br />Teresa Bodwell's heroine is difficult to enjoy.  Mercy Clark may be admirable, but romance heroines should be a little more delicate or MAYBE a little more breakable.  A strong heroine is always meaningful, but strength should not rely on: slugging a man in the stomach, dispensing relentless orders, and making every important decision!  Such behavior, in romance reading, grows tiresome and annoying . . .<br /><br />Oh, but that cover!  That glorious cover! A bonus star added just for that cover!<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-04-29

Some stories hit and some miss.  Yet, I always enjoy anthologies, because you USUALLY come across an unfamiliar author . . . someone new and satisfying.<br /><br />THE TOPAZ MAN PRESENTS: A DREAM COME TRUE was an anthology released in March of 1994, five stories by some of romance's \\"bigger stars\\" . . .<br /><br />1). Jennifer Blake: \\"DREAM LOVER.\\" - Rating: 9 (5 Stars).<br /><br />Modern day real-estate agent, Erina Littlefield, lives a fantasy.  Her mind fabricates the perfect hero, the perfect man, the perfect lover - she calls him Sinclair.  Now she stands staring, in disbelief, at an old oil painting.  Her desire had really lived . . . once . . . but in another age, in another time.  Shockingly, her dream lover is St. Clair Nicholas Antoine Rouquette.  Date of birth: August 3, 1815.<br /><br />Jennifer Blake creates a beautiful love story in DREAM LOVER.  This truly is a polished short story with just enough tender essence to bring the reader to a most satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />2). Shirl Henke: \\"LOVE FOR SAIL.\\" - Rating: 8 (4 Stars).<br /><br />Samantha Goode and her twin brother live in San Francisco's Barbary Coast.  They are poor and make their way by working in the kitchen of a brothel.  The madam decides Samantha Goode should learn the house trade and offers her to Captain Kit Warfield and the frolic begins!<br /><br />What can I say, Shirl Henke's story was just really dumb, yet it was fun.  Yes, LOVE FOR SAIL is entertaining, but don't expect a lot, even the ending is noticeably corny.  Yet I turned the pages, I read the words, I found I JUST had to finish this surprisingly enjoyable short story!<br /><br />3). Becky Lee Weyrich: \\"OLD LOVE AND LILAC LACE.\\" - Rating: 6 (3 Stars).<br /><br />In rough, coastal water surrounding Georgia's Jekyll Island, Paxton Carmichael died pursuing his love, Lydia Bennington Aynsley.  Generations later Lydia Winslow (the great-granddaughter) receives an invitation inviting her to the coastal isle - the Jekyll Island Club Hotel is celebrating a special anniversary.  Upon arrival, Lydia struggles with feelings of deja vu.  At first she resists the strange feelings but then indulges the haunting memories.<br /><br />Becky Lee Weyrich wrote a touching tale in OLD LOVE AND LILAC LACE, but at every angle, at every turn, this reader wondered why they used the great-granddaughter!  Why couldn't it be Paxton's genuine love - the real Lydia Bee?  The author explains the great-grandmother was too weary and too old to return. Upon death, why couldn't Lydia Bee grow young again.  Imaging Paxton loving another woman dampened the romance.  Yes, the new Lydia was a descendant, but so what?  In romance . . . true love MUST BE TRUE.<br /><br />4). Anita Mills: \\"JOURNEY OF THE HEART.\\" - Rating: 6 (3 Stars).<br /><br />Anita Mills begins this regency tale in her usual poignant fashion.  Georgina Esmond is the daughter of a duke, a man who despises her and wishes her out of his life.  Max Durant is the boy who loves Georgina as a child, the man who loves Georgina as a woman, and the husband who helps Georgina find love and happiness.  Although JOURNEY OF THE HEART starts with a bang, it falters.  A pleasant story but it seemed to run out of room . . . it seemed too crammed for its short story outline.<br /><br />5). Georgina Gentry: \\"CHEYENNE DREAM CATCHER.\\" - Rating: 9 (5 Stars).<br /><br />Now this was fun - a bit of a stretch, but fun. New Jersey native, Sharyl Nuemann, is enjoying the sights and sounds of Oklahoma, hoping to capture a little of the fantasy blazing from her favorite romance books. Not only does she capture the fantasy, but she actually lives the enchanting dream, finding love and romance with her very own elite Cheyenne warrior.  Georgina Gentry does a great job with CHEYENNE DREAM CATCHER, turning this fanciful confrontation into an amusing read.<br /><br />MaryGrace Melocheves an invitation inviting her to the coastal isle - the Jekyll Island Club Hotel is celebrating a special anniversary.

Elizabeth Lane easily draws the reader into her story by using wonderful description and expression.<br /><br />In the year 1884, Brandon Calhoun is the richest man in Dutchman's Creek and he wants the best for his only daughter.  And the best is not poor, young Will Smith.<br /><br />Harriet Smith is Dutchman's Creek's unpretentious schoolmarm.  She is also Will Smith's straightforward older sister and she is not impressed with Brandon Calhoun's snide remarks or his attempts to manhandle her family.  Why the self-righteous prig even tried to buy her!<br /><br />Jenny Calhoun and Will Smith are young and in love.  Too bad no one will endorse their happiness or their desired marriage.  Now, the two youthful sweethearts have no other choice - they must elope!  After all, a baby needs a family.<br /><br />The author writes a wonderful heroine in Harriet Smith; her leading lady is witty, strong, and kind.  Her hero, Brandon Calhoun, is cast as a gruff, no-nonsense man on the outside, but inside his heart is full of love - a love he tries to hide from his estranged daughter.  Yet, it is the growing love Calhoun feels for the cantankerous Miss Harriet Smith that truly has him befuddled!<br /><br />Elizabeth Lane does an attractive job building Brandon and Harriet's relationship.  The reader knows where that relationship is going, but the ride there is still fun and sparkling. Admirably, Ms. Lane never allows her story to drag, she keeps it moving at an even pace, and allows the reader to finish satisfied - sometimes the simple things in life are clearly rewarding.  Nicely done Elizabeth Lane.<br /><br />Grade A-<br /><br />This review is based on an Advanced Reading Copy.<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche	2005-04-25

Oh what fun Liz Carlyle must have experienced while writing THE DEVIL TO PAY especially as she created her heroine, Sidonie Saint-Godard.  From the unusual first name, to the daring breast tattoo, to the marauder spirit, Sidonie (Si-doh-NEE) Saint-Godard is a reading boon.  Carlyle then devised her hero, Aleric Hilliard, the Marquess of Devellyn.  She fashioned a rough around the edges guy, more coarse than refined, more masculine than cultured. Oh, what blissful reading fun . . .<br /><br />Sidonie Saint-Godard lives life on the edge.  She is the \\"Robin Hood\\" of intimidated women; she slays their dragons for them; she hunts down their offenders; she collects their dues; she makes the noble gentlemen of the ton pay . . . pay for the abuse, the indignity, the mistreatment of impoverished women everywhere.  Well maybe not everywhere, Sidonie's world is only so big . . .<br /><br />The Marquess of Devellyn uses and discards women as he pleases, he is an aristocratic blackguard, he is a blue blood scoundrel . . . or so the vindicating \\"Black Angel\\" believed . . . a belief that would be the Angel's undoing . . .<br /><br />Liz Carlyle does a good job with this familiar idea (Connie Brockway's ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT).  Her characters are witty, fun, and entertaining. The plot moves along quickly, everything is great . . . until the big love scene . . . then Devellyn spots that notorious tattoo!  Oh, oh.  Hang on Lizzie . . . don't lose it . . . hang in there girl . . . finish what you started . . . a good, fun book . . . don't turn our hero into a nitwit . . . oh heavens . . . the last 86 pages are LONG and SILLY.  What started as a 5 Big Stars rating quickly dropped to 4 . . .<br /><br />However, this reader still recommends THE DEVIL TO PAY.  Liz Carlyle does a fine job on this matched pair of characters and that delightful pleasure is first rate!<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-04-21

OK, I will probably be in the minority, but I was truly uncomfortable reading this story.

Kenleigh has suffered greatly at the hands of his enemy - an enemy who is desperately attempting to survive, to survive in the ways of their ancestors.

Ah, Mary Balogh begins her new, much anticipated series - a quartet of books about four teachers at Miss Martin's School for Girls in Bath. Ok, so what did I think of the first entry? Although, SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE is pleasant, it is too tranquil, too restrained, it is like warm milk before bed. Sadly, Balogh's romantic spark and familiar poignancy are missing. After all, this is an author who can bring tears simply by describing a faded gown or a frayed hem. Regrettably, SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE may be enjoyable but it is lifeless.<br /><br />Mary Balogh brings Miss Frances Allard and Lucius Marshall together on a snow-clogged road. Was it fate or coincidence? Who knows? Nevertheless, that random accident changed their lives forever.<br /><br />Frances Allard loves her life in Bath. She is content. She enjoys teaching and feels she is doing something useful. She enjoys her independence and enjoys her solitude. Yes, Frances Allard is content, but is she happy?<br /><br />Lucius Marshall is wealthy, fashionable, and handsome. He is also the Viscount Sinclair of Cleve Abbey, but he is restless. He has promised his aging grandfather he will take a bride. So what is it the viscount now offers to Frances Allard? He offers to pay for her lodgings, her clothes, her jewels, is she to become his mistress? Alas, it does not matter, for Miss Allard walks away. Yes, Lucius Marshall is restless, but he is persistent.<br /><br />That persistence is the governing focus of Balogh's story. Lucius Marshall will not give up Frances Allard. Is it fate that continues to bring them together, or is it the viscount's determination? Is it coincidence that continues to bring them together, or is it the viscount's tyranny?<br /><br />Mary Balogh writes this story with her usual polish. Her words flow over the pages, and her story is easy to read. This devoted fan recommends SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE for true Balogh readers, but don't expect the usual Balogh flair. Although I was disappointed, the blandness did not discourage me, I certainly will be buying the next book in this series.<br /><br />Mary Balogh has been around a long time, and has quite a large following of faithful fans. Of course, loyal readers know exactly who the secret patron to Miss Martin's School for Girls is, but don't miss the delightful reference to Baron Heath, the musical connoisseur - he is the hero, from the novella THE BOND STREET CAROLERS, from the 1997 anthology 'A Regency Christmas Carol.'

A dear friend recommended this story and I could no longer avoid her interrogations.  Ok, she was right; LORD ST. CLAIRE'S ANGEL is a wonderful story.<br /><br />Justin St. Claire is the younger brother of the Marquess of Ladymead.  He is stunningly handsome; he is a devil-may-care womanizer; he is a playful gambler and he is a remorseless rogue.  He lives his life breaking the hearts of countless beautiful women; he enjoys making them fall hopelessly in love with him and then guiltlessly walks away.  Justin St. Claire is a cad.<br /><br />Celestine Simons is a poor, plain spinster.  In her life, she has lost a great deal: her father, her home, and her position in society.  Now, she works as the governess for the Marquess and Marchioness of Ladymead.  They hired her because she is so satisfyingly homely and that unattractiveness will be her best protection from the flirtations of Justin St. Claire.  Yet, under the cloak of plainness, lives a beautiful, cheerful woman, a woman accustomed to helping others, a woman who lives her life with optimism despite the cruel hand life dealt her.  For not only is Celestine Simons ordinary and plain, she painfully suffers from rheumatoid arthritis - a chronic disease marked by stiffness, inflammation, and deformity.  Her hands are especially bad, her knuckles are swollen and red, her fingers malformed.  Yes, Celestine Simons' shortcomings would definitely protect her from the advances of that libertine, Justin St. Claire!  Or would they?<br /><br />Justin St. Claire is bored; he is bored with his life.  What started as a lark to irritate his tyrant sister-in-law abruptly turns into much more.  Suddenly, Justin St. Claire yearns for stability and permanence in his life. Perhaps he should start looking for a wife and begin making little St. Claires to populate his unattended estate.  After all, a few of his friends have succumbed to the matrimonial cause.  Suddenly, Celestine Simons intrigues him.  She is like a beam of dancing sunlight, a herald of joy and spirit.  So, why does she refuse his suit?<br /><br />Donna Simpson did an incredible job on this gentle Regency story.  She did, however, gravely abuse English Titles, but I wouldn't dwell on that problem; except, to say WHERE WAS THE EDITOR?  Nonetheless, this author did impress me.  She has a wonderful writing style and her plot development is first-rate, but it is her application to her heroine's crippling disease that truly is unique.  And her brief reflection to dear little Gwen, the Marquess' child - a child with special needs - is decidedly original.  However, in the end this reader wondered who would NOW take care of little Gwen?  Who would protect her from her cruel, demanding mother?  I must check Simpson's subsequent books; surely she does not leave her readers dangling!<br />Grade: A-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche<br />Reviewer for: Romance Designs.comtrigues him.

JOSIE DAY IS COMING HOME is every woman's whimsical dream: to sport 'Clairol Sedona Sunset' hair; to have a Harley driving, rough-and-ready guy to hang with; to wear a hot pink mini on her Vegas showgirl body; and to be able to dance like JLo.  Could life get any better?  Well perhaps, if that Harley bad boy was as rich as 'The Donald'?  He is!  Ummm, life is sweet!<br /><br />Josie Day is a Vegas Barbie doll - dazzling.  Luke Donovan is every little girl's Ken doll - drop-dead gorgeous.  He's a bad boy; she's a naughty girl, and together they are fun.<br /><br />Josie Day is indeed a Vegas showgirl.  One fateful night Josie saves her boss' life. Totally grateful, that boss rewards her with an estate.  An estate located in Josie's old hometown - the small-minded hometown Josie ran away from.  Feeling victorious, Josie returns home and is promptly given the social cold shoulder.  Her only friend is the estate's 'handyman' - Luke Donovan.  A 'handyman' who happens to be her benefactor's nephew and the estate's bona fide owner.<br /><br />Luke Donovan is also a runaway.  He is running from the wealth and social commitments of his prominent family. Is Luke pleased with Josie's sudden appearance?  NO!  But boy does Josie enthrall this so-called 'handyman'!  His new philosophy: what is a little deception among friends?<br /><br />The author, Lisa Plumley, does a fun job with this merry light tale.  Josie Day is a delight.  Plumley writes her lead character using determination, beauty, and notorious appeal. Luke Donovan is simply sexy, dangerous and fun.  They are a wonderful couple.<br /><br />Surprisingly, although the story is light and merry, Plumley manages to strike with a great deal of sensitivity.  At times my heart ached for Josie.<br /><br />The story's weak points: Our hot couple should have 'gotten it on' earlier in the story - this reader grew frustrated with the wait.  And it would have been more fun to see the jealous, mean spirited town-people get their just dues!

I just penciled Susan Crandall's name on my automatic buyer list.  This author has an easy style of writing and an amazing talent for storytelling.<br /><br />Lazy adventure, liberation, and future memories usually fill a teenage summer.  But then again, some memories are hard to forget!  How well Lily Boudreau remembers the summer of her eighteenth year - she has a keepsake - her son, Riley!<br /><br />Clay Winters was an element of Chicago wealth.  He was a kid from a rich, successful family.  Every summer he vacationed in Glens Crossing, Indiana and enjoyed the pleasures of summer.  Lily Boudreau was one of those pleasures.<br /><br />As the years slipped away, Clay Winters continued to dismiss Lily Boudreau from his mind.  He dismissed her betrayal, her disloyalty, and her marriage to his best friend.<br /><br />Susan Crandall takes that betrayal and runs with it and the reader is along for the glorious ride. Crandall's journey is gentle and convincing, displaying the power of dishonesty and its lifelong influence.  THE ROAD HOME is storytelling at its best and accented with her Crandall's ability to write strong secondary characters.  These traits make for great reading.<br /><br />My complaint?  The hurried feeling surrounding Riley's golden moment in the sun.  This entire affair felt brisk and jagged.  And I wish the author had not finished her dazzling story with that wide open ending . . . setting up for a sequel . . .  great . . . but this should never be done at the expense of closure!<br />Grade A-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche<br />Reviewer for: Romance Designs.com	2005-03-11

Nicole Byrd and I had such a good time with VISION IN BLUE. I relished Byrd's double storyline. I loved the two heroines and their military men! The connection between the two storylines - the shared friendship, the mutual respect, the wonderful spirit - made this reader feel good!<br /><br />Gemma Smith is an orphan, or so she thought.  On her twenty-first birthday she received a letter from her mother informing her she was not alone in the world.  Gemma has a brother - an influential highborn brother - Lord Gabriel Sinclair.  Gemma Smith headed to London and hoped Lord Sinclair would receive her.<br /><br />Louise Crookshanks is a cit's daughter - a cit - a man who makes his money in trade.  Desperately, Louise Crookshanks wanted the TON's acceptance, so she headed to London to experience a 'season'.<br /><br />Along the way, Louise and Gemma cross paths and become fast friends.  Nicole Byrd develops a wonderful story regarding trust and budding friendship.  The reader senses these two friends will survive the years, grow old together, and share life's many ups and downs.<br /><br />Lieutenant Colin McGregor is a dream come true.  A caring, forthright gentleman, a gentleman who quickly steals Louise's heart.  Captain Matthew Fallon is the perfect man to enter Gemma's fragile life.  A man who loves the woman Gemma is, not the regal lady Gemma may become.  Two ex-military men who glide into Byrd's story with chivalrous precision and composure.  This bright story has two heroines and two marvelous heroes.<br /><br />Oh, how I felt VISION IN BLUE WAS 'A' material, then chapter seventeen opened!  Now, this was an interesting downfall - a virtual sore thumb!  It came across as a chapter intended for the end, but someone decided to move it and insert it at a midpoint!  However, for a middle chapter, it was too climactic!<br /><br />And this fumble - Miss Gemma Smith spent her life avoiding disgrace, always acting the part of a lady, now she has achieved her dream - an accepted family - a genteel brother.  So how was it on her first outing as Lady Gemma Sinclair she danced her first waltz without the permission of an Almack's patroness!  And to boot - attending was Almack's cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me, Lady Jersey!  This was a grave faux pas. And no, the author never alluded to it as: thumbing one's nose at social restriction!  Tragically, this mistake shredded the Regency storyline!<br /><br />Therefore, chapter seventeen's misplacement and social error reduces VISION IN BLUE's grade to B+.  Still, Nicole Byrd does write an entertaining book!

Ms. Heath has the outstanding ability to firmly put her reader into a story's setting . . . DIAMOND DREAMS basks in Heath's unique golden touch.<br /><br />Athan, Lord Griffin is a wealthy landowner.  In the Welsh county of Glamorgan, Castle Griffin rises above rich Celtic land.  Ancient land charged with legends, myths, and magic.  London, England and Lord Griffin is a tender morsel in the Marriage Stakes.  So sought after is Lord Griffin, he decides to invent a wife - a fictitious bride to ward off pursuing females.  His fake bride takes on a presence when Griffin purchases a portrait from a London gallery.  Soon the portrait's essence captivates Griffin and in time he realizes the painting's mysterious charmer holds his soul - his bridal fantasy is now firmly rooted deep within his heart - his fictional 'Caroline'.<br /><br />So who is Ellie Rutherford?  Is she Griffin's 'Caroline' come to life?<br /><br />In the Welsh mountains, on the estate of Castle Griffin, lives the potter, John Bailey.  A gentle man who takes in his penniless niece, Ellie Rutherford.  However, Ellie's Uncle John has a troubled history and one man's evil calls.  John Bailey is forced to surrender.  Heath now opens her story and allows blackmail, treason, and smuggling to proceed.  Remarkably, through the magic of this author's pen, the sightseeing reader journeys through the Welsh countryside, into the Tower of London, and over the wintry seas to beautiful St. Petersburg.  DIAMOND DREAMS is a gentle adventure filled with corruption.<br /><br />Sandra Heath has an enjoyable style.  The reader senses, throughout this story, this is an author who takes the time to research, an author who cares deeply about the era she so elaborately writes about. Her background material is first-rate.  However, DIAMOND DREAMS seems to lack something - it doesn't have enough bite, enough tingle, enough pizzazz.

Yes, it is an OK book, but it is far from being splendid - yet, Holt's talent whispers through - teasing, promising!<br /><br />Katie Duncan was the daughter of an earl, but a selfish, malice woman raised Katie.  Katie's guardian is a tyrant, a woman saturated with cruelty, theft, and gluttony.  Gluttony?  Yes, brutality knows no bounds if this monster's 'petit four' plate becomes empty - and this wicked woman controls Katie Duncan's life!<br /><br />Marcus Pelham, the Earl of Stamford lives a joyless life.  A life saturated with woman, drink, and other empty diversions.  The Earl of Stamford enjoys his carefree, malignant existence until the night he encounters the lovely, innocent Katie Duncan, servant extraordinary.  For the first time in his empty life a woman bewitched Stamford - could it be the love potion purchased from a local apothecary?<br /><br />Cheryl Holt runs a variety of storylines throughout these pages.

It is obvious the woman does not want her identity exposed.  Without warning, the mysterious woman is found ruthlessly murdered.  Now, Molly has the responsibility of protecting the baby!<br /><br />His unhappy editor orders hotshot journalist Dean Coletta to return to the USA.

He returns to discover his only sister, Julie, is missing and presumed dead. Coletta's journalistic skills kick in and the baffling trail leads straight to Dr. Molly Boudreau of Glens Crossing, Indiana.<br /><br />PROMISES TO KEEP is a splendid, evenly paced story and absorbs the reader in its ever twisting plot.  In addition, Ms. Crandall does an attractive job: her chapters are united, yet carry various storylines.  Nevertheless, it is the secondary characters that really sell this story!  Crandall has created wonderful characters bursting with believability.  The reader knows these people; these are characters that frequent every small town!<br /><br />Though this was an enjoyable story, a page turner if you will, it lacked the love and the sensuality that were found in its predecessor: Crandall's MAGNOLIA SKY.

It is little wonder, the merchants play up the joy and romance of Valentine's Day, and what better way to pass the month's long, bleak days then to read a perfectly timed anthology written by five romantic authors.  A REGENCY VALENTINE II, was a seasonal-focused anthology first released in January 1992 . . .<br /><br />1): CAROL PROCTOR: \\"A Task for Cupid.\\" - 4 (2 Stars).<br />Definitely, this story contained a disturbing image . . . Denzil Huntingford lacks suavity around the ladies.  He is too shy, too timid, and he agonizes over idle chatter.  Nevertheless, he is in love, in love with Miss Amabel Penworth.<br /><br />So his Grandmama, the Marchioness of Witley, comes to Denzil's rescue and gives personal instructions:<br />** \\"Kiss my hand.  No, no, no, I mean kiss it as if I were Miss Penworth! Now look into my eyes! I want to see that you can do it properly!\\"  **  EAUWW!<br /><br />And when that didn't work, Grandmama tried the browbeating approach:<br />** \\"Stop acting as if you're pigeon-witted! . . . Imbecile! . . . Close your mouth, you look quite idiotic!\\"  ** EGADS!<br /><br />Of course, Grandmama lends the instruction to woo Miss Penworth, and in the end all is well; nevertheless A TASK FOR CUPID is my first CAROL PROCTOR read and with that statement I will say no more  . . .<br /><br />2): MARY BALOGH: \\"A Waltz Among the Stars.\\" - Rating: 10 (5 Big Stars).<br />Get the tissues out, Mary Balogh pierces the heart with this tale . . . Lady Barbara Hanover is the Duke of Durham's daughter.  She is the mother of little Zachary and she is unwed and rejected. Lord Caleb White is the Viscount Brandon and a lonely widower.  He is at Durham Hall to ask permission to court Durham's daughter - Eve.  But then he meets Barbara - beautiful, shunned Barbara. MARY BALOGH wrote A WALTZ AMONG THE STARS in her classic style - dignified, sensitive and gentle.<br /><br />3): CARLA KELLY: \\"The Light Within.\\" - Rating: 6 (3 Stars).<br />This was a pleasant story, but it bordered on silly . . . Lord Thomas Waggoner would stop at nothing to end his brother's foolish endeavors.  Lord Thomas would even kidnap a woman.  The impeccable Blessing Whittier was in England searching for answers and legal documents.  The British authorities ignored this gentle American-born Quaker at every opportunity. No one would help her, no one until Lord Thomas Waggoner accidentally kidnapped her! THE LIGHT WITHIN is a CARLA KELLY!  So the reader can expect a skillfully written story.  Even the speech patterns of  \\"Thee and thy\\" are fun.  Yet, by the end, the entire affair screamed cockeyed.<br /><br />4): SANDRA HEATH:  \\"The Midsummer Valentine.\\" - Rating: 8 (4 Stars).<br />This author can write description! If you truly want to visit Regency England, pick up a Sandra Heath story . . . A memory enchants Georgina Hartford  - a Midsummer dance that ended in a kiss. The captivated dancers exchanged no names and arranged no plans.  Instead, the tormenting man quietly disappeared. Yet, he returns, if only to haunt Georgina's dreams.  Sir Richard Marriot will announce his betrothal at his Valentine's Ball, until he recognizes the beautiful stranger with the lavender eyes?  In THE MIDSUMMER VALENTINE, SANDRA HEATH once again displays her masterful proficiency at gentle romance.<br /><br />5): EDITH LAYTON:  \\"The Legacy.\\" - Rating: 4 (2 Stars).<br />This is a strange, grim story . . . Valerian Blackwood, ex-Captain in His Majesty's Light Hussars,  and his cousin Bolton Blackwood are struggling with their eccentric uncle - a collector of antiquities.  It seems the old baron has nothing of value.  Bolton Blackwood is sure the old man is selling off his legacy, while Valerian Blackwood doesn't care!  In fact, very little sparkles in Valerian Blackwood's life these days . . .  nothing . . .  until he gazes into the eyes of the gardener's daughter - Sybil Prentice. EDITH LAYTON wrote THE LEGACY with a sluggishhand.  The results: a dreary story.<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche<br />Reviewer for: Romance Designsesigns	2005-02-26

Yet, I always like to read the anthologies, because usually you come across an unfamiliar author, and you never know what's lurking in the unknown.<br /><br />A REGENCY VALENTINE is an anthology released in February 1991, five stories for that special time of the year, by some of the genre's \\"big guns\\" . . .<br /><br />1). MARY BALOGH: \\"Golden Rose.\\" - Rating: 7 (4 Low Stars).<br />Pleasant, but where was Mary?  Bath, England and the month of February is cold, wet, and windy. For the Honorable Roger Bradshaw life is wretched!  Recently Bradshaw experienced a rather uncomfortable situation with a married 'lady'.  Now he is forced to endure the sparse entertainment in this elderly town.  Why even the promise of the annual Valentine's Ball, did not brighten Bradshaw's spirits.  That is until he encountered the lovely, virtuous Emily Richmond - his aunt's paid companion.  But alas, the innocent Miss Richmond was too pristine to accept his tarnished valentine or was she?  With the manipulative help of his mischievous nephew, Roger Bradshaw may be in for the surprise of a lifetime. Although, GOLDEN ROSE was a comfortable read, it lacked the tender sensitivity usually associated with a Mary Balogh story.<br /><br />2). KATHERINE KINGSLEY: \\"The Secret Benefactor.\\" - Rating: 5 (3 Low stars).<br />A story that was written with a heavy hand . . . George Asquith was born with a deformity.  He was an embarrassment to his father.  George spent most of his childhood, with the family, from the neighboring estate.  Aubrey de Salis loved George as a young child and she loved him as a young girl.  Through the years, Aubrey never forgot the kind and tender George Asquith.  By chance they meet again; Aubrey is open and warm; George is cold and harsh.  THE SECRET BENEFACTOR was just not fun.  Katherine Kingsley's story was too analytic, the dialogue too grave and strained.  Regrettably, the entire read lacked enthusiasm.<br /><br />3). EMMA LANGE:  \\"Lady Valentine's Scheme.\\" - Rating: 10 (5 Big Stars).<br />NOW, this was a wonderful story . . . In LADY VALENTINE'S SCHEME, Emma Lange pens pure romance using a scoundrel for her hero.  Alexandra Talbot is penniless and is forced to marry wealth.  Jocelyn Staunton returns to England; he returns to reveal his love for his childhood friend - Alexandra.  Only to discover, Alexandra has an agreement with his adversary - his cousin - the Viscount Addington. This is my first trip into Lange country, and what an enjoyable junket.  Skillfully, the author slices the reader's heart with this delightful Valentine's story.  Emma Lange has definitely moved to my \\"Search For List.\\"<br /><br />4). PATRICIA RICE:  \\"Fathers and Daughters.\\" - Rating: 9 (5 Low Stars).<br />OH, this was well written! Jack Chatham was young and heavily in debt; Carolyn Thorogood was the daughter of wealthy man.  Two people who were very much in love.  However, her protective father shattered their hearts and their dreams.  Five years later Jack was home and he found Carolyn Thorogood still unmarried.  Yes, Jack was home, but this time he returned with his young daughter. Patricia Rice handles FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS beautifully.  This is gentle romance with an adorable child to pull at the heartstrings and to ease the romance.<br /><br />5). JOAN WOLF: \\"The Antagonists.\\" - Rating: 9 (5 Low Stars).<br />This is a Regency romance written in the first person.  For this reader, Joan Wolfe is a new author and the first person tense was definitely something new . . . Hugh Lesley St. John Lydin was the fifth Earl of Thornton.  They simply called him \\"Thorn.\\"  As a young child, Dinah came to live at Thornton Manor.  Much to everyone's dismay, the fiery haired Dinah was a complete hoyden. Instantly, Dinah and Thorn were rivals, always competing, always trying to outdo the other.  So what happened the spring of Dinah's 'coming-out' season? Why was Thorn so reserved and angry? Joan Wolfe develops this story into a fun read, but did I like the first person tense?  I'm not sure, I believe it gave a contemporary feel to the plot, and yet it fascinated me.  Regardless, Joan Wolfe and her different style made THE ANTAGONISTS enjoyable.<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche<br />Reviewer for: Romance Designsinto a fun read, but did I like the first person tense?

Grade: A	Jodi Thomas is an author who launches her stories by using soothing enticement.  Immediately, this writer pulls the reader into her plot.  Regrettably, in the past, I found her stories generally limp to the finish line.  However, in TWILIGHT IN TEXAS the author leaves 'limp' behind and finishes with a winner.<br /><br />The American Civil War rages - North against the South, brother against brother, father against son.  In a crowded Philadelphia train station two strangers spontaneously embrace and kiss, a moment in time, but a moment so powerful it would carry them through the horrors of war.  Call it fate, call it love, or call it survival, but neither party would ever forget.  Two strangers touched by love's whisper, two strangers from opposite sides.  Benjamin \\"Wolf\\" Hayward is a Confederate spy and Mollie Donivan is the daughter of a Union general.<br /><br />Eight years later, both still live with that cherished memory.  Once again, two strangers meet, but in a different time and place.  Now Wolf Hayward is a captain in the Texas Rangers; he has a full beard, long hair, and fifty more pounds. Mollie Donivan is a struggling pharmacist/doctor.  Wolf immediately recognizes Molly as the vision from his past.  Molly regrettably fails to recognize Wolf as her fantasy soldier.<br /><br />So Thomas begins her love story and this is gentle, soft romance at its finest. Although Wolf is delighted to find his Molly again, he is terrified to reveal who he really is.  He is afraid because they once dwelled as enemies; he is afraid because Molly knows nothing of his wartime spying and betrayals.  But amazingly, with Thomas' magic, what could have been unreasonably ridiculous turns into spellbinding fascination.<br /><br />Adding further delight, the author builds her story around exceptional secondary characters.  From the adorable child known as Callie Anne, to the gruff old veteran who acts as Molly's protector, Thomas weaves them warmly into her reader's heart.<br /><br />In the past, I have always liked Jodi Thomas as an author.  She has a simple direct style, a tender quality, and great homelike characters.  So what made TWILIGHT IN TEXAS a better book?  Because this time, Thomas wrote an entire book strongly, not just a few chapters.<br />Grade: A<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche<br />Reviewer for: Romance Designsdi Thomas as an author.

Whew!  Hot words.  Hot characters.  Hot story.  So what happened?  The story fizzled!  A storyline that started with sparkling fire suddenly cooled!<br /><br />In the waning hours of night, Aveline Stoddard solicits Lucien DuFeron.  At dawn, two men will fight a duel - a duel over honor and gambling.  Lucien DuFeron is the ruthless rogue who will, no doubt, win!  Aveline's selfish father will, no doubt, die.  So bravely, Aveline draws her own wager: her innocence for her father's life.  DuFeron's answer: three nights in his company and her father will live.  Agreed!<br /><br />At the end of those three nights, the lovers ANGRILY separate.  But three nights have left them sensually mesmerized.  Yet, their memories are saturated with remorse and torment.<br /><br />Two months later, Aveline realizes she is pregnant, scoundrels have shanghaied Lucien, and Mullins' hands her reader a floundering story.<br /><br />Five years pass, a disfigured Lucien returns to England and is determined to inflict punishment.  His first stop: the home of the Lord Chestwick, Aveline's father.  His second stop: London, accompanied by his wife and child.<br /><br />The remaining pages embroil loyalty, suspicion, and frustration.  Aveline Stoddard's position: firmly behind her pathetic father.  Lucien DuFeron's position: firmly behind his festering revenge. The reader's position:  firmly in the spoiling hostility.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Mullins writes the first few chapters with open and enthusiastic glory, but then reckless loyalty and steadfast vengeance take over.  The results: the book's romantic essence struggles and fails.<br />Grade: B-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche<br />Reviewer for: [...]	2005-02-15

Not many debut writers would undertake this project: choose a (wh.re) and invent a heroine. Amazingly, author Diane Gaston not only tries but succeeds! And what a success! Gaston's THE MYSTERIOUS MISS M is charged with sensitivity, feeling, and love and the reader basks in  strong emotion.<br /><br />Mini Synopsis:<br />Lord Devlin Steele is the younger son of the Marquess of Heronvale. As a youth Steele was reckless, carefree, and unruly. When he was of age, he defended England against Napoleon's evil. In the days leading up to Waterloo, in a seedy gaming house, Steele enjoyed the charms of a beautiful soiled dove. Four years later their paths cross again.  In lieu of a gambling debt, the beautiful Madeline now belongs to Devlin Steele.<br /><br />Madeline was the victim of circumstance and the evil of one man. She lived her youth servicing men, men who earned her - earned her by gambling. Now she is free, thanks to the tenderness of one man - her fantasy man - a man who has lived in her heart for four long years!<br /><br />Reviewer's Comments:<br />Diane Gaston wrote THE MYSTERIOUS MISS M with a gentle hand. The author's words flow effortlessly across the pages. Her characters, her setting, and her storyline mesmerize the reader. There is none of the \\"usual\\" bickering so prevalent in many \\"romance\\" stories and for that, I am grateful!<br /><br />During the last few years, I have read countless romance books and I felt only one book: Lisa Kleypas' WHERE DREAMS BEGIN was truly \\"romance perfection.\\" Today, I found my second perfect story!<br /><br />Diane Gaston's THE MYSTERIOUS MISS M is a masterpiece. It has every element needed for a \\"true\\" romance book - love, sensuality, and merit.<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2005-02-15

In my opinion, in my mind, in my heart, this is your finest. WHEN HE WAS WICKED is everything a romance book should be: wanting desire, total obsession, and cherished love.<br /><br />Michael Stirling fell in love the moment he met her, but she was forbidden. She belonged to someone else - his cousin. A cousin they raised him with, a cousin he respected, a cousin he loved. And then the inconceivable happened: his cousin died and she was free.<br /><br />Francesca Bridgerton was beautiful and lovely. She adored and loved her husband, John Stirling. They were happy; they had a marriage made in heaven - a marriage the angels kissed. And then John died and she was alone. But she had Michael, she was not alone, she had her best friend.<br /><br />Truly, Julia Quinn writes this story from her heart.<br /><br />Of course, this is Book 6 in the 'Bridgerton series'. Shamefully, this novel sat on my 'To Read Shelf' for several months, continually being shoved aside. Why? I was SO disappointed in Quinn's last entry: TO SIR PHILLIP, WITH LOVE, I did not want to experience another letdown. I felt the 'Bridgerton series' had run out of steam. I was wrong!<br /><br />This time Ms. Quinn delivered. This time Ms. Quinn abandoned the COMPLETE history of the Bridgerton clan. This time the author chose to whisper the family through the pages. Here big brother Colin Bridgerton is a crucial character, yet his presence does not take over. For this I thank you, Julia. We fans know the Bridgerton history. Thank you for simply writing Francesca's story! A story that is romantic, beautiful and sensual. WHEN HE WAS WICKED is pure 'Keeper Shelf'.<br />Grade: A<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche<br />Reviewer for: [...]	2005-02-10

Can we all scream \\"Cheesy Title?\\"  After devouring this book, I am baffled, for THE CARE & FEEDING OF PIRATES is hardly a cheesy book.  It is well-written and shows considerable artistic strength.  So why the shoddy title?<br /><br />Christopher Raine is a pirate - a rough, stormy, pirate.  Not a pirate with a warm manner, not a pirate with a kind heart - no Christopher Raine is a rough, stormy pirate, and Christopher Raine is stimulating!<br /><br />Honoria Ardmore is a southern belle.  She is a proper lady in the parlor, and a shocking hussy in Raine's bed.  And Honoria Ardmore is the sister of Raine's archenemy.<br /><br />Honoria's big brother, James Ardmore, sent Christopher Raine to his death - via the hangman's noose.  Four years later, the devious Raine turns up, in London, to claim his property - Honoria - his wife!<br /><br />Open waters, passionate nights, and pirate treasure now await the reader.<br /><br />Ashley does a good job with this book.  Her hero is rousing, exhilarating, overbearing, and filled with the desire to possess Honoria. On the other hand, Honoria is a reading enigma - did I like this heroine or not?  I'm still undecided, but I do know, I liked this book!  It is steamy, but the author holds the line, and although the hero is controlling, I still found him refreshing.<br /><br />The weak points: that title, an iffy plot, and an unsubstantial epilogue.  Still, it is a page turner and this author displays a commanding writing style - certainly, she has piqued my interest!

CRY OF THE WILD is one of those easy, compact books.  This is a light mystery set in the Alaskan wilderness.<br /><br />Crysta Meyers and her twin brother Derrick are blessed with the uncanny ability to communicate telepathically.  Over the years, when needed, they have summoned each other.<br /><br />Waking from the depths of a terrifying nightmare, Crysta knows Derrick needs her NOW more than ever -- someone is trying to kill him.  However, first she must convince everyone: Derrick is not dead -- yet!<br /><br />Sam Barrister is Derrick's best friend, and he will listen to Crysta's defensive reasoning - up to a point!  However, that point expands when Crysta's life is threatened -- now he must believe her!<br /><br />Anderson's imagination and her smooth style of writing allow the reader to journey and enjoy the emptiness of Alaska.  This is an author who never ceases to amaze with her descriptive powers.<br /><br />Although this is a pleasing gentle suspense story, I am relieved Ms. Anderson went on to write eloquent romance.  In 2005, my fantasy cosmos is truly richer because Catherine opted for this latter genre.  Without a doubt, today Catherine Anderson is one of the best at creating a 'romance hero'.  Her leading men are always the ultimate: in masculinity, in ruggedness, and IN sensuality.  Sigh!<br />Grade: C+<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche<br />Reviewer for: [...]	2005-01-31

And if ever, there was a more spoiled, childlike heroine than Lady Lilliane of Castle Orrick, I have yet to discover her!<br /><br />In 2005, Rexanne Becnel is considered a personal favorite, her books are a must buy for this 'poor' reader.  However, in 1990, when Becnel released this medieval romance, she certainly hadn't attained her future expertise.<br /><br />Corbett of Colchester is a robust, arrogant knight.  He returns to England a veteran of the hard-fought Crusades.  Corbett is regarded as a favorite in the King's court.  His assigned duty: to keep peace in England's volatile northern territories. To achieve his goal, he weds his enemy's daughter: Lady Lilliane.<br /><br />Lady Lilliane of Orrick, the eldest daughter of Lord Barton, is not happy with her arranged marriage.  Definitely, not happy - until she hits the marriage bed.  Ah, then she is stroked and pacified . . . until the morning light . . .  and then . . .  I hate you, my lord . . .  And . . . Bed me, my lord . . . I despise you, my lord . . . AGAIN . . . Bed me, my lord . . . And . . . so goes MY GALLANT ENEMY . . .  Good grief!  Grief: deep mental anguish, annoyance, or frustration - exactly!<br /><br />The book's friction is hung right around Lady Lilliane's pretty little neck!  Becnel created a 'child' in this heroine.  This confused, impertinent, young woman consistently scoffs at sound advice regardless of the ramifications.  On the other hand, the reader REALIZES the consequences, consequences which create an uncomfortable read.<br /><br />The years have been good for Rexanne Becnel; she has sharpened her skills nicely, developing into a very good author.  To fully appreciate this rewarding author, check out: \\"The Bridemaker\\", \\"The Heartbreaker\\", \\"Christmas Journey\\", or \\"The Maiden Bride\\".  These books shine with Becnel's talent; on the other hand, MY GALLANT ENEMY is dim in comparison.<br />Grade: C-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.<br />Reviewer for: Romance DesignsDesigns	2005-01-26

It is a story charged with hidden secrets, which is how Mary Balogh lures her reader.  The story's major strength -- the writing - Mary Balogh can write a story. The story's major weakness - the length -- repetition prowls.<br /><br />Gently born, Isabella Fleur Bradshaw has a secret -- a terrible secret.  She flees her sheltered country life and seeks refuge in London.  To survive - she sells all that she owns -- her body.  Her first customer is the wealthiest lord in England, the scarred and bitter Duke of Ridgeway.<br /><br />Adam Kent, the Duke of Ridgeway, approaches the common street harlot, his marriage is essentially non-existent, yet the sin of adultery threatens.  Furthermore, the duke is angry.  He is angry with his own weakness, and angry with the strumpet's strength. He is angry that he feels self-conscious and ashamed, and angry she shows no revulsion.  So angry is Kent, the Duke of Ridgeway, that he brandishes brute force as he takes her.<br /><br />Now Adam Kent feels guilt.  He is unable to rid his mind of the girl's thin body, her dark-circled eyes, or her calm courage.  He now feels responsible and sets the course -- Fleur will become his daughter's governess.  All is well, until the duke returns to his country estate -- to his wife, to his daughter, and to the governess . . .<br /><br />Overall: an excellent story.  Mary Balogh can draw a tale. She knows how to set a scene, she knows how to create a ghastly villain, and best of all she knows how to play her reader.  This author can hold a reader with her heart-rending words and THE SECRET PEARL has an abundant supply of gentle, touching words.  Nevertheless, it is the length and the demand to fill this story that IS a problem.  Therefore, THE SECRET PEARL is classified as a splendid read, not phenomenal but splendid!<br />Grade: A-<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.<br />Reviewer for: RomanceDesigns	2005-01-23

I'm a sucker for kindness, and TO KISS A TEXAN definitely has it, yet it is a story that boils over with promise but holds little excitement.<br /><br />Wes McLain has lost everything: his money, his dreams, and his spoiled, rich fiancee.  Her bodyguards have beaten the hope of marriage and the illusion of love right out of Wes McLain.  Wes has given up on all female attachments until he spots the little creature inside the wooden cage.  A small, dirty creature meant for display and entertainment.  If it cost him everything, including his life, Wes would not allow this caged woman to suffer one more degradation.<br /><br />Allie Catlin is a victim to man's cruelty.  Allie watched her parents' slaughter, then suffered under the powers of slavery, and finally endured the brutality of religion gone amuck. Now she covers her face, whimpering, would she be the next victim to this mad man entering her cage?  She listened, he whispered, and he raised his hand slowly . . . and so the first meeting of Wes McLain and Allie Catlin happened.<br /><br />This book has definite strengths. Wes is appealing. His honesty, strength, and kindness make him an admirable match for the reserved, cautious Allie.  The story itself is nicely paced and Allie's abuse and background provide plenty to keep the story going, but with this author's talent, I wanted just a little more.  Yes, Thomas lets her reader see the stars, but I wanted to reach out and touch them.<br />Grade: B<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche<br />Reviewer for: Romance Designs	2005-01-21

Generally,`Road Romances' are storylines filled with countless, entertaining, and varied escapades highlighted with occasional danger and excitement.  For a romance setting, it allows the hero and heroine to be alone, giving them ample time to get to know each other.  Cathy Maxwell's ADVENTURES OF A SCOTTISH HEIRESS does not stray from the `Road' criteria, therefore, the story pivots into a light and generally fun-filled romp.<br /><br />ADVENTURES OF A SCOTTISH HEIRESS tells of the adventures and misadventures of Lyssa Harrell and her traveling companion, Ian Campion.<br /><br />Lyssa Harrell is the spoiled, rich daughter of Dunmore Harrell.  \\"Pirate\\" Harrell is a man who has made his fortune and name in trade through hard work and exceptional investments, a man who wants to be accepted in the highest circles of the upper class.  To further gain that acceptance, Dunmore Harrell decides to purchase a titled lord for his daughter - much to her chagrin. So angry is Lyssa Harrell, to be matched and paired, with the insufferable Robert, Viscount Grossett, she runs away and joins a Gypsy caravan. Gleefully, Lyssa Harrell flees north to Scotland, the birth place of her mother.<br /><br />Ian Campion is Irish, Catholic, educated, tall, good looking and dirt-poor.  This once-promising barrister will do almost anything for money - money he uses to feed his loving and devoted family.  Dunmore Harrell commissions, with the lure of heavy cash, Ian Campion to find his wayward daughter and to return her to her titled betrothed.<br /><br />Cathy Maxwell's writing style is smooth and the story moves along at a good pace.  But beware, the author does fill her narrative with small moral seeds - the Catholic / Protestant plight - the English / Irish issue -- and these turbulent challenges do break in and disrupt the light, humorous feel of the book.  Moreover, the sensual flare is a problem; disappointingly, the sparse passion scenes feel little more than added window dressing.  Still, Maxwell's style is skillful and her story is still charming.

Usually this truly gifted author can do no wrong, but COMANCHE HEART and its plot just didn't ring true.  Swift Antelope, the strong and noble Comanche warrior, promised Amy Masters he would come back for her.  Swift did keep his promise, he did return, but fifteen years too late.  Time had moved on and these childhood lovers had changed.<br /><br />Amy Masters is a survivor.  As a child, she was brutally kidnapped and violently raped by savage men and yet she survived.  Amy Masters is a victim.  She was cruelly abused, mentally and physically, by her stepfather and yet she escaped.  Yes, Amy Master is both a victim and a survivor, but Amy Masters is hardly normal.  She quietly lives in her sheltered life, and hides behind safe daydreams, while she endures inhuman nightmares.  She trusts no man, especially when her daydream has turned into a nightmare.  Swift Antelope is back!<br /><br />Anderson again pulls out her ultimate male hero.  Swift Antelope is understanding and compassionate; he is tough when required, and a sweetheart when needed.  And when it comes to dealing with Amy Masters, being a sweetheart is very much needed.  Upon his return, Amy Masters does not fall gratefully at his feet, nor is she glad to see him. Amy has learned to live a free safe life -- alone.<br /><br />But what brought them together in the first place is still there -- the deep-seated respect, the loyal friendship, the romantic spark. But before the lovers can go on, Amy has much to overcome.  Now the reader questions the author's logical.  Could Amy EVER get over her past?  Could any woman EVER get over THAT past?  Yes, Swift Antelope IS tender and gentle and yes he IS the man to fall in love with, but would that EVER be enough?<br /><br />Catherine Anderson uses a slow, excruciatingly pace to convince her reader that the healing can and does take place, but somewhere along the way, Anderson mission fails. Yes, the idea of reuniting lost lovers has great appeal and both Amy and Swift are very likeable characters, but the core of the story just doesn't sell.<br /><br />This is the second in Anderson's `Comanche series', but regrettably this entry seems too illogical and too inconceivable to recommend.  I truly want to believe in Amy's healing - that a handsome, kind man could rescue her from her haunting horrors, but somehow I can't!

Yup, at page 300, I bailed out of Rosanne Bittner's OUTLAW HEARTS.  Not something I'm proud of, but something I had to do.  Why?  The story is too gritty, too depressing, and too filled with raw emotion. But boy, can Rosanne Bittner write one hell of a story.<br /><br />Jake Harkner is the product and the result of a miserable childhood.  A dark childhood filled with relentless beatings, rape, and finally murder.  He is a hard-fisted, gun-toting outlaw who defends his property, gets revenge, fears nothing, and most of the time is downright nasty.  BUT cold-hearted Jake Harkner loves sweet, gentle Miranda Hayes.<br /><br />Miranda Hayes is a proper woman, living the hard-life, in the American West.  This proper woman should disapprove and avoid Jake Harkner, but instead she finds herself attracted to, lusting after, and loving this hard, violent man.<br /><br />Realistically, and this is a bonus for Bittner, the author did not suddenly reform this turbulent man.  Instead Rosanne Bittner, showed her reader, Jake Harkner's flawed and gentle side, as he struggled with his feelings for Miranda -- here Bittner demonstrates a brilliant writing maneuver.  This maneuver, combined with a great writing style, and her excellent storytelling ability, makes OUTLAW HEARTS choice material.  So, why the bail out?  For this reader, the story proved to be too much of an epic, it was too much of a journey, and it just took too much inner strength to go on.<br /><br />When I decided to stop, \\"The Wild Bunch\\" came to mind.  This movie was Sam Peckinpah's provocative, brilliant, yet very controversial western -- an unrelenting tale of the savage American West.  It was shocking, yet truly realistic!  How well I remember my husband praising the action, while I sat there stunned.  So, I guess my vision of the old west lays more in the \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" mode of thinking -- westerns with a little humor and a little milder, perkier type of gun play.<br /><br />OUTLAW HEARTS may not be everyone, but it confirms that Ms. Bittner is a very talented author and I will read her again.

Both know the score.  This will be a three-day love affair, a harmless liaison, a mutual enthusiastic encounter, which will and must end.  Their plans sound so mature, so civilized, but Fate has its own plans.<br /><br />Mary Balogh writes another interesting story.  It is rare to discover a poorly conceived story from the Balogh pen.

A story that carries a clear message for today's fast-paced lifestyle.<br /><br />Charles and Judith Montgomery have everything -- success, money, and the million dollar family - one boy and one girl.  But Charles, Judith, and their children are living a nightmare.  They are running on the treadmill of modern life.  Living together in a family home, living apart as a family.  A family that is too busy, too stressed, and too filled with conflict.<br /><br />Charles Montgomery did not reach the top of his profession without insight and he has enough insight to know his family is presently falling apart.  He must do something.  He elects to give his family an old-fashioned Christmas, a Christmas in the mountains, a Christmas together.  What he gives them is a disaster, for the Montgomery family needs far more than a bandage to hold it together.  What they need is an example of wholesome values and love.  What they acquire is the Walker family.<br /><br />The Walkers, a ragtag crew of five, stranded and asking for help.  The Walkers, a family who love and respect each other.  The Walkers, a family with nothing, yet a family with everything.<br /><br />A sudden and unforeseen blizzard forces the two families together, to live and to learn about each other.  To fend without the convenience of modern amenities.  To provide, to survive, and to support each other.  An uncomfortable situation?  Yes.  An enlightening situation?  Oh, YES.<br /><br />Rexanne Becnel writes a gem of a message.  This is an uncomfortable read, for it hits very close to home; still it is a lovely story and it is a very worthy read.

In these pages, Rexanne Becnel has captured the frustrating, emotional teenage years.  Yet, the author maintains a light, fast pace, which manages to hold her reader steady.<br /><br />Lucia V. is a top international model, a woman of the world, a celebrity, a jet-setter, but seventeen years ago, Lucia V. was simply Lucy Ann Vargas -- a pregnant small-town girl.  Today this world renown beauty is back to meet the child she gave away.<br /><br />Gil Cooper is simply known about town as Mr. Cooper, the high-school principal.  A handsome, down-to-earth man who is not happy with Lucia's plans.  At every step, this determined man interferes, but what right does he have?<br /><br />Rexanne Becnel takes on both sides of the adoption issue and handles it well.  The reader feels the frustration and anger from both `parents' viewpoints.<br /><br />There is a light touch, throughout the pages, gained by the author wisely adding little Polly Cooper, Gil Cooper's small daughter.  Polly is a charmer and she is simply adorable.  Yes, THE CHRISTMAS WISH is page turner material, but there are some story problems.  Why would a doting father, such as Gil Cooper, allow his child to go shopping alone with a woman he has known for only a few days?  A woman who butts heads with him, argues with him, and opposes him. A woman who objections and questions his guidance.  A staggering concept?  No, the author declares these confrontations are simply the seeds of true love budding!<br /><br />Still Ms. Becnel does manage a good read and manages to hold her reader right till the end.

For this unwavering reader, Mary Balogh's words usually have this penetrating influence. Mary Balogh is a stunning writer and the last forty pages of Balogh's CHRISTMAS BEAU are simply magnificent.<br /><br />Judith Easton was once betrothed to the Viscount Evendon; however, she foolishly eloped with another man.  Eight years have gone by.  Now the viscount is the Marquess of Denbigh and now he is able to seek his hard-core revenge against Judith -- the woman he once cherished and loved.  Yes, for eight LONG years, the marquess has planned his vengeance.<br /><br />Judith Easton is in London with her two small children. Judith is now a widow and is trying desperately to escape the nightmare that was her marriage.  The Marquess of Denbigh is in London also and his plans for Judith's punishment are moving forward.  What the marquess does not understand: his avenging mind seeks retaliation, but his foolish heart seeks love.<br /><br />Mary Balogh allows her reader to journey to the English countryside to enjoy the fun of a Regency Christmas.  She gives her reader the experiences, the traditions, and the customs of Christmases past. So effective are her words that the reader CAN see visions of sugar plums dancing . . . such colorful written words . . . and then . . . Balogh unfolds her heart twisting pen.<br /><br />CHRISTMAS BEAU is another Signet Regency classic from the Balogh writing desk.  Although not a phenomenal read, it is still a splendid read.  What happened?  Perhaps the Christmas party went on a little too long before Balogh's poignant pen, once again, stirred the pages, and it is this poignant pen that is Mary Balogh's strong suit.<br /><br />With a release date of December 1991, this book is no longer published and is very hard to find.  Check the secondary markets and be prepared to pay, but do get a copy, for CHRISTMAS BEAU is still a wonderfully written story.

All little Katie Berlinton wanted, for Christmas, was a papa.  Of course, she told everyone, who asked, she wanted a doll.  Because in her little heart she knew that was what they wanted to hear, but in her prayers she asked for a daddy.  Mary Balogh delivers a beautiful seasonal story in THE BOND STREET CAROLERS.  The author writes her tale using little Sarah's point of view, an idea which proves to be ingenious.<br /><br />Edith Layton: \\"The Earl's Nightingale.\\" Grade: B<br /><br />A gentle story.  Impoverished Eliza Dumont sadly pawns a family heirloom - a delicate golden cage, containing a tiny jeweled bird. Truly, an exquisite piece shimmering with magic. Hopefully Eliza will reclaim this token of love.  A token of love from her grandmother.  But alas, the shop's unscrupulous proprietor sells Eliza's dainty treasure.  The buyer -- the roguish Earl of Elliot.  The author's clean writing style spins THE EARL'S NIGHTINGALE into a very nice holiday read.<br /><br />Elisabeth Fairchild: \\"The Mistletoe Kiss.\\"  Grade: C<br /><br />Good heavens, THE MISTLETOE KISS is a dark dreary story.  Constance Conyngham is the governess of Leland Manor and a lonely widow.  Her husband, of three months, was taken by the unforgiving sea.  Lucian Deleval is soured with memories of a runaway bride, for Lucian Deleval was abandoned at the matrimony altar.  On the 21st day  of December, Mrs. Conyngham's three small charges think Lord Deleval is in need of some blessed goodness and they employ their governess to help them deliver the honor.  This story is too melancholy for the joy of the Christmas season.<br /><br />Carla Kelly: \\"Make a Joyful Noise.\\"  Grade: A-<br /><br />A beautiful story.  This is the Carla Kelly I love to read - poignant and touching.  Peter Chard, the Marquis of Wythe, lives the life of a doting father, a successful landowner, and a very lonely man.

Over a misunderstanding, Miss Elizabeth Walker gladly offers support to a bewildered Lord Lennox.  Soon they are fast friends.  Friends who discover they can escape life's loneliness together.  Mary Jo Putney's SUNSHINE FOR CHRISTMAS is good, but it is the moments of painful tenderness that truly save the story.<br /><br />Anita Mills: \\"The Last Wish.\\" -- Rating: B<br />Repeatedly I am amazed at Anita Mills' talent to insert her reader into her story's setting and in THE LAST WISH this adept author once again capitalizes on her extraordinary skill.  Sir John Grey is dying; he waits for death while he reflects on his life.  His money-grubbing heirs gather for his death; all, but one, are ready to pick over the remains of Sir Grey's prosperous life.  What they don't foresee is the arrival of a gentle woman and a small child.  An unlikely pair who will forever change their lives.  A well-written story, even though some of the slang was a struggle.<br /><br />Mary Balogh: \\"Playing House.\\" -- Rating: A+<br />PLAYING HOUSE is simply a wonderful story.  There is not a drop of sexual activity found among these Balogh's words, but with this author's skill who needs it?  Stephen, The Marquess of Bedford returns to his childhood home, the estate of Bedford Hall.  He returns, with his small daughter, to relive the happy memories of carefree youth.  He will give his child her own joyous memories.  Instead he finds his first love, Lilias Angove.  How dare poverty-stricken Lilias interfere in his renewal of happiness?  Balogh pulls at her reader's heart with this touching and beautifully written story.  Well done!<br /><br />Clara Kelly: \\"The Three Kings.\\" -- Rating: C<br />Too somber!

For me Cathy Maxwell is new and if TREASURED VOWS is a sample of her work, I'm wondering - `what took me so long to find her?'  This is a fun, easy read and at times I found myself laughing out loud.  Yet, in the words, there is a somber message for today's women - `all that we women take for granted was once NOT so available.'<br /><br />Phadra Abbott is an eccentric young woman living each day her way.  A young woman disgusted with society's views on the treatment of the female sex.  Phadra Abbot has a big and caring heart; the Phadra Abbots of the word take up the plight of the downtrodden.<br /><br />Grant Morgan is Phadra Abbot's reluctant white knight.  Thoughtful and handsome, he borders just outside the titled ranks of the upper class. Grant Morgan wants nothing, but to live each day quietly and respectfully.  However, he is a victim caught under Phadra Abbot's charismatic spell.<br /><br />Phadra must accept Grant Morgan's assistance.  He works for the Bank of England and the Bank of England is Miss Abbot's legal guardian.  A guardian realizing that the only way to clear off its debt-ridden ward is to marry her off.<br /><br />Ms. Maxwell has indeed written a very agreeable story - a simple love story.  Phadra Abbot is a delightful heroine -- intelligent, brave, yet vulnerable.  Grant Morgan is a reserved, take-charge kind of man, yet is filled with hidden kindness.  Gloriously, this author DOES NOT rely on tricks to tell her story; instead she relies on writing talent.

Her target is England's upper class and culture. She loves to trouble and demean the rich and highborn.  Her number one victim is James Trenton, the Marquess of Angelford.  Why is Calliope so ruthless?  Because she and her mother were once victims of a scheming rogue -- or so Calliope remembers!<br /><br />Angelford may be a marquess, but he is also a member of an elite society.  Men who serve England's foreign office; men who protect the British Empire from distress . . .<br /><br />For Calliope and James, their attraction radiates and heated sparks fly.  Everyone, IN the story, can feel the pull - everyone except James and Calliope.  Antagonistically, the two are forced to work together to solve the disappearance of a mutual friend which only leads further into the depths of a dark mystery.<br /><br />Disappointingly, a contemporary weight is felt throughout the story.

Shrewdly, the author delays the sexual fulfillment, and in doing so creates a richer, more developed romance.  This is where LORD OF SEDUCTION masterfully outshines its predecessor!<br /><br />Of course, this is book two in the \\"Guardians of the Sword\\" and duty equals assignment.  Predictably, Diana Sheridan becomes a willing participant.  Actually, I found this subplot and the ending anticlimactic and clich&eacute;.  Nevertheless, this is the book's direction!

And just as casually, they refer to his brother Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex, as Edward Windsor.  Windsor IS the royal family's surname.

This is one author who continues to push the romance genre forward by blending sweetness with remarkable insight.<br /><br />Isaiah Coulter is the youngest Coulter -- successful, attractive, and very desirable.  Isaiah has his life planned, and his planned life does not include a wife - at least not anytime soon!  Veterinary medicine is a demanding field!<br /><br />Laura Townsend is attractive and very lonely.  Once Laura Townsend was an environmental scientist, today she is happy to be a kennel keeper at the Coulter Animal Clinic.  Laura Townsend refuses to dwell on life's `what ifs' and instead lives each day within a sunny outlook.<br /><br />Ms. Anderson develops a wonderful, warm romance for Isaiah and Laura.  Isaiah realizes his life is empty and little Miss Sunshine is the antidote. Laura would love to be in Isaiah's life, but Laura is also a realist.  She has aphasia, five years ago a diving accident damaged her brain's left lobe, and sadly Laura realizes she must deny Isaiah.  What Isaiah needs is an accomplished woman, who can complete his potential, he must not settle for less.<br /><br />MY SUNSHINE is an admirable read.  Catherine Anderson writes with respect and shrewdness for the aphasia condition.  Again I discovered Anderson can bring her reader a new understanding for a perplexing condition.  Anderson's books are always worthy of notice and MY SUNSHINE is very noticeable.

Lynn Erickson's tale may be a suspense thriller -- a classic `who done it' -- but HUSBAND AND LOVER is also the story of a woman falling OUT of love with her husband.  The story of a woman regretfully examining her life, her marriage, and her future.<br /><br />Julia Innes has it all.  She is a deputy DA and married to a wealthy, important man.  She has an agreeable stepdaughter and Julia Innes is one of the beautiful people who calls Aspen, Colorado home.  Yes, she has everything until one sunny, spring afternoon they arrest her husband and charge him with murder - the murder of his first wife, a crime executed twelve years ago.<br /><br />Today, Cam Lazlo is a best-selling novelist's private assistant and he is only too happy to be assigned to the Innes defense team!  As a former Denver homicide detective, Cam Lazlo is sure, twelve years ago, they convicted the right man!<br /><br />Through long tiring days, working side by side, Cam and Julia slowly fall in love.  Lynn Erickson does a staggering job disclosing this suppressed desire.  The author writes the romance using a gentle hand and, in doing, avoids offending her reader - marriage is a sacred undertaking and Erickson is marvelously respectful.<br /><br />Lynn Erickson draws a smooth, tight story.  This author delivers the tension effortlessly, yet the pressure is on.  She controls with evenly paced words using catlike stealthiness - `Is the good doctor a clever killer?'<br /><br />Husband and Lover is a polished suspenseful story and it is a very good book, but it lacks sexual heat.  Take note: I may not read it again, but I would recommend it. Grade: A-<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.<br /><br />This review is based on an Advanced Reading Copy.	2004-11-29

I found Judie Aitken's tale entertaining and creative.  The author's writing style is smooth and glides along at a very quick pace.  But I think Aitken's strong suit is her ability to move on, this author does not bog down her storyline by overemphasizing.  Although, the story is suspenseful, the author avoids reading anxiety and I found this approach very satisfying.<br /><br />Dane White Eagle is a modern day Sioux warrior.  He is Lakota.  He is also an enigma; he is not what he appears.  Dane White Eagle is an FBI agent who is working undercover, filtering through the narcotic underworld.  An agent who hopes to penetrate the flagrant drug ring operating on the Cold Creek Lakota Reservation -- the reservation where his mother and his young sister live.<br /><br />In the local hospital, Dr. Claire Colby spends every waking moment in the emergency room, dealing with the wounded and the dying.  Claire Colby is also moving on with her life; Claire Colby is recently and happily divorced.  On a cold December night, Dr. Claire Colby and Dane White Eagle collide.<br /><br />Judie Aitken further attracts her reader by allowing Lakota culture and words to filter throughout.  This is a respectable touch.  So why not a higher rating?  I waited too long for the romance; I wanted more for Dane and Claire.  And in the end, there were too many open questions, I found the tidied up conclusion too evasive.  I couldn't believe the actions of White Eagle's mother and I didn't understand why Aitken brought up Claire's abusive husband when that storyline went nowhere!<br /><br />Still, Judie Aitken delivers a good tale and she has piqued my interest in her work.

However, in the romance department it lacked strength.  Oh, there is sex, but no spark.  There is a mystery, but no depth.  Yes, I read it, but I was disappointed.  Although Adele Ashworth is a good author and her writing style is very pleasant, DUKE OF SIN was just ordinary.<br /><br />Lady Vivian Rael-Lamont hides away in southern Cornwall.  She lives a quiet life, growing beautiful flowers for the local community. She lives a lie.<br /><br />William Raleigh, the Duke of Trent hides away at his Cornwall estate, Morning House.  He lives his life avoiding society.  He is a murderer, or is he?<br /><br />Adele Ashworth tries to create a cloak and dagger scheme surrounding the death of William's wife, a scheme that includes the widow Rael-Lamont.  However, the author reveals her cards far too early, thus, making the story weak and empty. Instead, for this reader, the story's \\"mystery\\" surrounds the physical innocence of  Vivian Rael-Lamont!  From the start, a sexual firmness ruled this inexperienced lady's bedroom conduct!  Supposedly reserved and pure, Vivian knew what she wanted and she got it!  The story's \\"riddle\\" -- believing such a sexually aggressive thirty-five-year-old woman would enter William's life and be inexperienced!<br /><br />Sorry, although DUKE OF SIN is a pleasant read, the story is inadequate.  Ok, I'll take the whipping; I know I am going to receive negative votes for this opinion.  Grade: C+<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-11-21

I don't give it very often, but I'm giving it here - the sacred 10.  THE IMPROPER WIFE is a beautiful story and Diane Perkins has honed her craft nicely.  Her characters are well drawn and the story's sensitivity is brilliant.  Yes, I liked this book.<br /><br />Maggie Delaney is a sparkling heroine.  She unfolds through the pages as a gentle loving mother.  Maggie Delaney would do anything to protect her son - even lie.  Captain John Grayson is a marvelous hero.  He unfolds through the pages as a gentle man.  John Grayson believes Maggie Delaney has deceived him, but the question is - why?<br /><br />Diane Perkins creates Maggie Delaney as a strong, capable woman.  The reader will not find a sniffling little creature in this story.  Maggie Delaney is living under a huge misrepresentation at Summerton Hall, the country estate belonging to John Grayson's father.  The old earl believes Maggie Delaney is his son's wife.  At Summerton Hall, everyone loves Maggie Delaney and her chubby little son, Sean.  All is well, until Captain John Grayson returns home to England and to Summerton.<br /><br />Diane Perkins has used superb pacing, realistic dialogue, and gentle humor to enhance THE IMPROPER WIFE. The episodes with little Sean are simply delightful! However it is the sensitivity the author applies that lifts her story into the reader's heart. Such a ploy is a brilliant move; it causes the reader to turn the pages with zeal. The results? The reader cannot put the book down! Well done, Ms. Perkins.<br />Grade: A+<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2004-11-02

Sigh, at first I had such high hopes, but by the end, the story's majesty was gone.  Susan Kay Law is a very good author.  She has the ability to sculpt a scene.  She has the talent to develop likeable characters and she has the skill to unfold romance . . .<br /><br />Laura Hamilton is a wonderful heroine.  She is spunky, she is straightforward, she is trustworthy, and when she falls in love -- it is forever.  Sam Duncan is Laura's forbidden dream. He is ruggedly handsome, he is rough around the edges, he is not the man her father would choose, but he is the man Laura Hamilton loves.<br /><br />Sam Duncan has chosen to enter Laura's pristine world.  He sees her as an end to his present problem.  What he doesn't see is falling hopelessly in love with this delightful eastern heiress.<br /><br />Yes, Susan Kay Law pens a good story.  The primary romance develops brilliantly.  The amorous affair unfolds gently and attractively.  So what happened?  The ending!  This is where Law kicked the story into high gear.  It became rushed and with this acceleration the romance slipped away.  What a shame, for this book had such potential.<br /><br />Effectively, the author even teased her reader with a wonderful budding secondary romance.  Oh, how Ms. Law titillated with this overlapping fanciful love story . . .  but regrettably she decided to toss this additional romance onto the back burner.  Shamefully, the reader was left hanging, gasping, wondering what happened?  Nevertheless, at the end, the author neatly ties up this loose end, by inserting two OBVIOUSLY arranged sentences.  Yes, two brief sentences!  How very unsatisfying!  What a shame!  But then the whole ending was awkward.  Grade: B-<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-10-31

Sex is the main focus, sex is the secondary focus, and sex is . . .  well you get the picture.<br /><br />Traveling from Marseilles to the shores of England, Barbary pirates abducted and sold the exquisite Lady Willow Foxburn to an Algerian slave master.  Her final destination: the harem of Ibrahim, a ruler in the Ottoman Empire.  Willow Foxburn will be the source of the sultan's endless pleasure.  However, Ibrahim's younger brother, Prince Dariq, has other plans for this rare beauty.  He steals her and plans to barter Willow in exchange for his mother's freedom.  But, first he must show this little virginal vixen what secret delights her body can give.  And that, my friends, is THE PIRATE PRINCE.<br /><br />It is an easy book to read and I did turn the pages, but it is not a solid book.  Regrettably I found the storyline preoccupied and flimsy, the dialogue weak and contemporaneous, and the credibility a pivotal issue.<br /><br />Credibility?  Well, if I have my calculations correct, it seemed Willow learned the Turkish language in less than three weeks; remarkably, she was articulate enough to ask and answer probing questions.<br /><br />And then this little blunder found on page 321 . . . \\"but once his past became known, he would not be accepted by the 'TON' \\". . . and again on page 349  . . . \\"Robbed of speech, Willow merely stared at Dariq.  Stylishly dressed, his hair trimmed, he could easily pass as a member of the 'TON'\\" . . .<br /><br /> The term 'TON' meaning  \\"upper class\\" or  \\"the fashionable set\\" first appeared in England around 1770, Mason's book takes place in 1564. Ouch!<br /><br />THE PIRATE PRINCE may be easy to get through, but it is weak.  Would I recommend it?  Not unless you are a Connie Mason fan.  If you are curious, first check out the library or the used book stores.

The three young women were simply left behind.  The rejected trio headed south, toward Texas, and came across one bad hombre, Zeb Whitaker.  Whitaker was an evil man, who tried to exercise his manhood on Lacy, a man who thought nothing of rape, abduction, and murder.  Violently, the women reacted; they took turns and clubbed this monster to death.  Bravely, in Cedar Point, Texas, they surrendered.  Except, the local sheriff couldn't find a body and he couldn't let them depart!  Instead this sly, old sheriff held a wife lottery; it seemed Cedar Point, Texas needed women!  Lacy married Captain Walker Larson -- by proxy.  In his distant army fort, Captain Walker Larson was unaware of his new marital status, was unaware that his father had purchased him a lovely, young wife.<br /><br />They pulled Captain Walker Larson from his military duties and assigned him a one month leave.  They told him to protect his estranged wife, Lacy -- Zeb Whitaker was out of prison.  The Captain and Lacy were not happy.  Neither wanted the interference, both wanted to forget the other existed.  Captain Walker Larson did not want a wife.  He was romantically wounded once and was not eager to jump back into the fire.  What right did his father have to buy him a bride?  Lacy Larson was not happy.  She tried once, to reach out to her soldier hero husband, to fulfill her dreams of a happily-ever-after marriage, but the Captain's cruel rejection crushed and humiliated her.  For all she cared, the Captain could take his life and her dreams and stuff them.  Who cared if she was lonely?<br /><br />Whew, Jodi Thomas tantalized me with the opening of her book and I was planning to grant my sacred 10 rating!  But somewhere along the way my tantalization stumbled and I think I know why.  Although Jodi Thomas wrote a wonderful homespun western, it had a major drawback - the romance was too slow in advancing.  The couple's reluctance grew thin.  The `I don't want to be married to you' theme was overworked and the `let's JUST kiss and cuddle' was a MAJOR unlikely happening and overplayed.<br /><br />Yet, the writer's words are very nice, sometimes tender, sometimes sweet, and the cast of secondary characters is great!  Yes, I liked A TEXAN'S LUCK very much.  This was a `make you feel good' kind of book.  It came close to being splendid but the author delayed the romance a little too long.  Nevertheless, with her simple comfortable style, Jodi Thomas kindled my interest in her work and I DO plan to read this author again.

I think the reason it was so good - was the fact it was loaded with a storyline.  Reader boredom is not an option!  Jo Goodman can tell a story and I had no idea where this tale was going and I loved it!<br /><br />Rand Hamilton is the last male in the powerful Hamilton family.  A family cursed, yet lured by a long-lost treasure.  Claire Bancroft's godfather, has agreed to finance the Hamilton treasure expedition.  However, Rand Hamilton must bend to one reluctant term.  He must allow Claire Bancroft to accompany him on his crusade.  Claire Bancroft is determined to unlock the haunting secrets of her past, but first she must convince Rand Hamilton to allow her participation.<br /><br />Jo Goodman takes her reader on a wondrous nautical journey.  The author begins her story in damp misty London, travels to beautiful Charleston, South Carolina, and then sails onward to the sun islands in the South Pacific.  Ms. Goodman unfolds a magnificent descriptive voyage, a voyage that enables two people to fall in love.<br /><br />MORE THAN YOU KNOW has one astounding element.  Creating a unique twist, Goodman reveals her shocker earlier on and I refuse to expose the startling surprise.  I wasn't expecting it, it caught me off guard, and I will not spoil Goodman's coup for another reader.  This was a GOOD writing ploy, Jo Goodman!<br /><br />Ms. Goodman writes a romance/adventure - a treasure hunt, and what is a treasure hunt without a villain?  But is the obvious villain the villain? The uncertainty constantly intrigued me.  Yes, the story is a fine mystery and an enjoyable read. Goodman's heroine, Claire Bancroft, was a wonderful creation.  She is feisty, yet vulnerable, and at first, Rand Hamilton was the typical composed hero.  However, in the end, he was loving, he was protective, and he was Claire Bancroft's friend.<br /><br />My sister recommended this author to me, and I thank her.  Yes,  MORE THAN YOU KNOW is a good read; however, as a reader I felt the ending was open.  Jo Goodman didn't seal it; she left loose ends.

Jonathan Hayes, Viscount Whitley is going home to his country estate, Esdale.  He is going home to see Constance Manning again.  Jonathan Hayes  has been in love with Constance since they were children.  Constance Manning is in love with Jonathan's younger brother, Sidney.  Sounds like a winner?  Nope, only a page turner, there just wasn't enough sparkle to get past the rating of 8.<br /><br />Charlotte Louise Dolan: \\"Summer Escapade.\\" --  Rating: C-<br />Oh, oh, SUMMER ESCAPADE is troublesome.  Terrence Kinderley was a young bachelor, living the good life, until he `inherited' his niece, Marigold.  Kinderley so wanted to be the perfect guardian that he drew a bubble around his young ward.  He forbid Marigold to experience life.  He feared something dreadful would happen to her.  His love and concern were literally suffocating her.  Today such behavior would be child abuse.  Good heavens, but the author created a monster in her hero.  Therefore, this reader could not accept the idea that this man spontaneously fell in love and everything turned perfect in the Kinderley world!  Not fun.<br /><br />Sandra Heath: \\"Brighton Betrothals.\\" --  Rating: C<br />Sandra Heath may have a smooth pen, but BRIGHTON BETROTHALS is lacking spice.  Her aunt has summoned Patricia Fairbourne to Brighton.  Why the summons?  Her aunt wants to get Patricia out of the country, away from her books, and into THE social mix.  After all, the girl must get married.  Lord Robert Haldane has a reputation and though her aunt has advised Patricia to avoid his company, she finds herself very attracted to this cordial and courteous gentleman.  Sandra Heath can write, but here her story lacked fire.<br /><br />Melinda McRae: \\"A Country Wedding.\\" --  Rating: C<br />Melinda McRae has penned a rather pleasant story.  When she was twelve, Cecily Montford declared her undying love for Ainsley Powell.  As a twenty-two-year-old, man about town, the declaration appalled him.  Cruelly, he lashed out.  The rejection crushed and mortified the sensitive twelve-year-old.  Ten years later, they meet again at a family wedding.  Who should offer the first apology?

Still, Mary Balogh always seems to write a better than average happily-ever-after. In PRECIOUS ROGUE, the unjust get their dues and the reader rejoices. Patricia Mangan is her aunt's overworked companion, a pathetic creature existing in life's shadows.  Josh Bancroft is a notorious London rake and libertine; he is also her spoiled cousin's beau.  Unbeknown to Josh Bancroft, he is also a kind and good man.  Compassionately, he observes Miss Mangan's daily existence.  In the end, Mr. Bancroft becomes Patricia's much-needed champion.  At first, Mary Balogh portrays this hero as a cool rogue, but with her last word, Balogh has placed him firmly in her reader's heart.<br /><br />Edith Layton: \\"Buried Treasure.\\" --  Rating: C-<br />Long Island 1699, in the cloak of night, Captain Kidd and his motley crew bury a stolen treasure.  A fight ensues and a comrade viciously stabs the story's intended hero -- Dancer.  Now considered dead, the pirates unceremoniously bury Dancer with the stolen riches!  Oh, but wait, this severely wounded marauder manages to dig himself out of his sand grave! Good Samaritan Jedidiah Jenkins discovers him and drags him home.  Jenkins then permits his innocent daughter, Hannah, to be this sea wolf's nurse!  Cry foul to Edith Layton and skip this entry! BURIED TREASURE is too abrasive.<br /><br />Melinda McRae: \\"Sweet Revenge.\\" --  Rating: A+<br />Oh, this was a terrific short story.  A story filled with  lust, revenge, and hidden love.  David North and Chloe Ridgefield were childhood sweethearts.  When the war department reported David missing and presumed dead, Chloe quickly wed Jonathan Ridgefield.  David, however, was still very much alive.  Fifteen long years have slipped away, Chloe is now a widow, and David will make sure she pays for her hurtful maneuver.  Melinda McRae pens a winner with this little tale of SWEET REVENGE.<br /><br />Anita Mills: \\"A Good Woman.\\" --  Rating: A-<br />Now this is the Anita Mills I love to read.  Jack O'Neal has served eight years, in a Texas Petitionary, for armed robbery.  He is out and headed to San Angelo.  O'Neal shares the stagecoach with the widow, Beth Morgan, and her two small children.  A hard, bitter Jack O'Neal may have gotten on the stage in Huntsville, but a kindhearted Jack O'Neal will get off in San Angelo.  Kindhearted enough to want to help the destitute Morgan family.  When Anita Mills is on the mark, she is razor-sharp and here the author is dead on.  A GOOD WOMAN is a well written, sensitive story displaying Anita Mills' enormous ability to write a solid western.<br /><br />Mary Jo Putney: \\"The Devil's Spawn.\\" --  Rating: B+<br />This was a fun little story.  Dominick Chandler and Roxanne Mayfield are young and very much in love.  Roxanne's father is selfish and outraged.  He plots to separate the young couple and succeeds.  Ten years fall away, Dominick is now a viscount, wealthy and has his own plans. Now, this is the fun section!  Dominick returns to England, under the cover of a Polynesian native.  Why?

Oh yea!<br /><br />Mary Balogh: \\"The Anniversary.\\" -- Rating: A+<br />This type of tale is a Mary Balogh specialty, a well-written, short story set in Regency England. THE ANNIVERSARY is a gentle romance with intense sensuality, yet the author does not rely on powerful bed scenes to draw that sensuality.  Amy Richmond, the Countess of Reardon, exists on the country estate belonging to her estranged husband, Hugh.  They have never spent one married day or night together.  However, on this the eve of St. Valentine's Day, the earl is returning to Reardon Park to attend to his wife and THEIR son.  If I have one complaint, with this short story, it is exactly that . . . too short!<br /><br />Anne Barbour: \\"The Wooing of Lord Walford.\\" -- Rating: B+<br />Charles Darracot and Sarah `Sally' Berners have always been friends.  To win a contest, Charlie asks his old friend to set her sights on the very available Sedge Horne, Lord Walford.  Is money that important to Charlie when his long time friend takes him up on his request? THE WOOING OF LORD WALFORD is a tranquil, yet amusing love story written with Barbour's smooth pen.<br /><br />Melinda McRae: \\"Cupid's Dart.\\" -- Rating: B<br />Now this was charming. CUPID'S DART is a fun little valentine's story about two friends, who unknowingly have loved each other through the years.  Everyone is enjoying the Valentine's party set in the English countryside.  A party energized by games, merriment, and romance.  Suddenly, confirmed bachelor, Sebastian Cole, comes to his senses and asks his long time friend Wilhelmina, the widowed Lady Taunton, to marry him.  Melinda McRae pens an easy, delightful short story.<br /><br />Anita Mills: \\"Devil's Luck.\\" -- Rating: B-<br />Anita Mills' strong suit is her ability to thrust a reader into a scene.  Again, in DEVIL'S LUCK, Mills' untouchable ability shines through.  From the opening words, Mills moves her reader to The Red Ram Inn, in February 1795.  Gentlemen are gambling in a smoky, deserted taproom.  One gentleman wins; the others lose - one so greatly his daughter is forfeited.  Garth Rowland, Viscount Trevaney, has won Melisande Merriweather in a card game!  Although the story's idea held great promise, it gets only a 7 rating - there just wasn't enough tingle in the delivery.<br /><br />Sandra Heath: \\"The Imposter.\\" -- Rating: A-<br />As an author, what Sandra Heath does brilliantly is to offer historical facts, yet still manages to keep the romance front and center.  This is not a simple task and as a reader I am most appreciative.  After all, this is the nature of the genre - romance. THE IMPOSTER is simply a tale of what can happen when we try to deceive. A debt of honor has obliged Felix Vestey, the future Viscount of Northwood, to fib for a foolish `friend.'  The victim of the deceit is his `friend's' betrothed, Miss Jane Martin.  However, upon meeting Miss Martin, Felix finds he cannot lie to her; instead, Felix finds himself very much in love.  Sandra Heath delivers a fine story, holding her reader's interest from start to finish.<br /><br />A word of advice: check out that discard table, you never know what you'll find  . . .<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.Mills moves her reader to The Red Ram Inn, in February 1795.

AN AFFAIR MOST WICKED is a 7.  Seger Wolfe (Wolfe - how appropriate), the Marquess of Rawdon, is a sleaze.  The Marquess is the equivalent of a high school senior who has everything: good looks, money, a car, and a varsity letter in every sport including the backseat rhythm.  Clara Wilson is the inexperienced sophomore whom everyone has warned.  This charismatic guy only wants to use her -- but Clara just knows she is the gal who can reform this sleaze artist.<br /><br />American heiress, Clara Wilson, has journeyed to England to find a titled husband and to escape the scandal of a social faux pas.  It seems Clara almost eloped with an embezzler.  Seger Wolfe is living the good life, in and around every available \\"lady's\\" bed in England.  Seger's scandalous behavior is the direct result of a lost love.  Through social blunder, Clara and Seger meet . . . arousal has them both curious.  In other words, Clara Wilson and Seger Wolfe are hot for each other.  They marry quickly because they can't stay apart.  Clara fancies herself in love; Seger knows it is a state of desire.  The reader has now reached the halfway mark and marital problems become the story's focus.  Woe is me.<br /><br />At first, the relationship is romantic and wicked. Julianne MacLean has filled the pages with scandalous words and abundant love scenes. But after awhile, too much of a good thing is . . . is just that . . . too much.  Some of the love scenes are superficial and pointless.<br /><br />MacLean has chosen to draw her heroine, Clara, from the innocent, sympathetic and understanding mold -- a nice touch.  Seger Wolfe, on the other hand, becomes a bore after the wedding vows.  He is not fun anymore.  However, the biggest problem with the book is the contemporary feel both in the dialogue and the attitude.<br /><br />No doubt, Julianne MacLean is on her way.  This lady will probably become a big star for the Avon publishing house.  Her writing style is smooth and easy.  However, in AN AFFAIR MOST WICKED, the author just hasn't found the historical niche.

US	25613486	RO9VL46KBR1QS	0312992831	21363897	More Than Seduction	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Somehow a Letdown.  ** Grade: B **	Cheryl Holt and Nicole Jordan have a lot in common. Both authors can write steamy sex scenes, but their stories generally lack something.  Most of their books leave this reader unfulfilled.  Cheryl Holt filled MORE THAN SEDUCTION with sweltering sex scenes, but in the end I was disenchanted.<br /><br />The story opens in 1813; Anne (Paxton) Smythe has inherited property near Bath -- Bath famous for its mystical hot springs; waters believed to have mysterious healing properties.  Anne Smythe works hard to maintain her successful healing spa/bathing business.  A business open for women and for women only!  Lady Eleanor Chamberlin Dunworthy will hear none of it.  She begs Anne to take her brother in, Captain Stephen Chamberlin, a crippled war veteran.  When Anne refuses, Lady Eleanor literally dumps him on her doorstep . . .<br /><br />Anne Smythe is a feisty woman; she refuses to put up with Stephen Chamberlin's childish behavior.  Of course, Stephen and Anne become lovers. Unfortunately, Captain Chamberlin knows that he and Anne cannot be.  They are from different worlds.  He has nothing to offer Anne.  So they must be content for the moment and not look to the day Stephen will leave.<br /><br />Cheryl Holt writes the beginning of her book with vigorous spirit.  I enjoyed Anne in the starting pages; in fact, the female characters carry this book.  Stephen's sister, Eleanor, and her tale are a wonderful addition to the story.  I almost wished Eleanor had her own book!  And I must applaud Cheryl Holt for her handling of the homosexual relationship she chooses to explore.  Regardless of your feelings on this subject, Holt does write this section well.<br /><br />My discontent?  I wish Holt had delayed the sexual fulfillment, relying instead on desire and lust while Anne helped Stephen recover.  With the hurried sexual activity, the characters never seem to grow in the reader's mind or heart.  Instead, they remain cold.  There just isn't enough depth to their personalities.  The story is sexual, but insensitive.  Finally, Holt astounded me with the handling of the villain.

She wrote four books for this company before moving over to Avon Books.  LOVE, COME TO ME was the second of the four.  Recently,  I found a rare copy. It contains 411 pages, typed in a small font, and reveals Kleypas' budding bright future.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not the time Kleypas achieved brilliance.  Why?  Anytime I can close a book in the middle of some defining moment to go do housework -- well!  LOVE, COME TO ME is such a book.  Yet, I don't think it was the writer's fault, no I think the editor should take the blame.  The romance was never allowed to grow, to build, to hold the reader.  Instead, the reader is subject to lengthy discussions surrounding the country's problems after the Civil War and the newspaper scene of 1870's Boston.  In a romance book, historical facts are fine as a backdrop, but such details shouldn't take over the story. The editor should have edited this book better, cutting down on the educational lessons, editing to create a better romance.<br /><br />Lucinda Caldwell is a New England lass.  Her doting father raised her, a father who pampered and spoiled her.  Fate has nicely tied up Lucinda's future.  She will marry her childhood love and become part of Concord, Massachusetts' elite society.  She will marry -- if only her beau will commit himself.<br /><br />Heath Rayne is a displaced southern gentleman.  He is very interested in Lucinda.  He remains in Concord, watching the engaged couple, hoping for cracks in the relationship.  Fate grants Heath his wish; Lucinda is now his.  Now his mission is to humor his spoiled wife.  Kleypas's strong suit is her ability to write a love scene, and here she shows her fine beginnings.  The best parts of this book are our couple in solitary confinement.<br /><br />Would I recommend LOVE, COME TO ME?  Only if you find it at a very reasonable price.  Don't go to the secondary market and pay big dollars.  Too many current books deliver far better romance.<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.urrent books deliver far better romance.

THE WALLFLOWER is America's own version of a \\"Regency Romance\\" -- ok, ok ignore the different time frames.  The setting is New York City.  The heroine is Texas born Persy Daltry.  The hero is poverty born Jake Devlin.  A self-made man and the owner of the Dusty Rose, a New York City establishment filled with dancing girls and gambling men.<br /><br />In Texas, on her twentieth birthday, her grandmother has given Persephone \\"Persy\\" Daltry an extraordinary gift -- `go east young lady -- east to New York City.'  Persy's task?  To find herself!  Instead, this little Texas miss finds: all that glitters is not gold and love can be found anywhere.<br /><br />Linda Francis Lee does a beautiful job with this simple storyline.  She draws a quiet story, resulting in a light fun read.  Persy Daltry and Jake Devlin are a good couple to drift with.  The author does not rely on conflict to enhance her story; instead, she uses soft humor and a gentle hand.  This is just an easy story about two people, from different walks of life, who fall in love.<br /><br />Unfortunately, only a B+ rating because a nagging disbelief floats through the book:<br /><br />a):  why didn't Jake ever follow Persy home?<br /><br />b):  how come, soon to be a New York debutante, Persy has every afternoon open -- as in NO social commitments?<br /><br />c):  and what woman could possibly cook a meal, without help, for 150 men, in less than 2 hours, in a strange kitchen, in 1879?  The meal? Cornish game hens served with a cranberry sauce!  Did I mention disbelief?<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-09-29

Three little girls, who have one thing in common, they share the same biological father - Viscount Farley.<br /><br />Desperately, James Lindford, Viscount Farley is trying to amend his rakish ways.  He is taking responsibility for his illegitimate offspring. He has acknowledged their existence; he has purchased them from their greedy  mothers; and now he plans to raise them himself.  It all sounds so neat and tidy - it is anything but . . .<br /><br />Phoebe Churchill is a pure country woman, a woman with a loving manner, and a kind heart.  A woman who just happens to have raised one of the viscount's \\"by-blows\\" as her own.  Phoebe Churchill is not happy when the lustful viscount comes calling.<br /><br />Rexanne Becnel does a good job with this simple storyline.  Phoebe Churchill is a wonderful creation from this writer's imagination - a simple, pure figment. On the other hand,  James Lindford is a scoundrel.  Becnel writes him as an experienced \\"man about town\\", a man who has never heard the word \\"No!\\" uttered from a woman's lips.  The reader gets to share in the fun as Becnel and Phoebe bring this rogue to his senses.  My, my!  What diversion the reader has because the author takes her time with this knave.  She does not reform him overnight; no, by delaying, the author creates a more digestible story.<br /><br />However, it is the three little girls and their manner that steal the book's thunder. Becnel has captured the very essence of childhood and the reader gets to savor every minute.  A good story, very nicely drawn by Rexanne Becnel.

This is one author that is on my automatic purchase list, so what about THE PERFECT BRIDE?  I liked it!  This is light easy reading, this is page turner material, this is \\"make you feel good\\" entertainment.  And that is the joy of reading -- entertainment.<br /><br />Devon St. James is a victim of circumstance; Devon St. James lives in a London slum.  Sebastian Sterling is a marquess; Sebastian Sterling lives his life above reproach. Devon and Sebastian are destined to share a life together.  Ms. James manages to surround her romantic couple employing small doses of humor, light distress, and desire.  The author even winds an air of poignancy into the story as Devon emerges from society's sidelines.<br /><br />Yet, there are problems with the story.  A contemporary feeling prevails.  Questions surround the lack of a female maid to help with Devon's introductory care.  Questions surround the long hours Sebastian donates to Devon's refinement - after all this man is a marquess  -- why not hire staff? And finally Harry's corny return.

And oh how well the author intrigued her readers with this couple -- so skillfully setting the stage for their story.  So skillfully, that when I finally tracked down James and Madeline on the secondary market I immediately placed my order.  After all, what are a few, big dollars?  I JUST HAD to find out what happened to this couple.  Mary, Mary, Mary!  Oh my goodness!  James and Madeline's story, THE DEVIL'S WEB, is a disheartening read.  It is the story of two combatants, two people who should never have married!  I don't care how much Balogh claims they share a hidden love deep in their hearts!  The depth is too great!  These two people FIGHT, FIGHT, and FIGHT some more, and when they are not fighting they ignore each other!<br /><br />An overzealous religious father raised James Purnell.  Love and friendship raised Madeline Raine.  Everyone liked her -- everyone except James Purnell.  \\"Obsession\\" is the key word in this novel.  A novel about two people who share this unwanted emotion, two people who can't let go, two people who drag each other through the gutter of despair.<br /><br />No doubt, Mary Balogh can write a story.  Her writing skills are always first-rate.  She pulls her reader into a story.  There is no question Mary Balogh is one of my all-time favorite authors.  I don't think there is anyone else who can write such diversified characters as this lady!  Balogh's \\"Signet Regency\\" collection may be similar in setting but each story is OH SO different.

This is book four in Macomber's \\"Cedar Point saga\\" and I found I enjoyed it.  Of course, I was THE FAN of the \\"Dallas, Knot's Landing, Falcon Crest\\" etc. television era.<br /><br />Granted, the story's start was difficult because I missed the author's previous entries, therefore, I relied heavily on Macomber's entrance list of characters.  Nevertheless, I soon settled in and before long I was a regular occupant of Cedar Cove, Washington.<br /><br />Skillfully, Debbie Macomber writes each chapter akin to a television episode and from chapter to chapter I was caught up in the lives of the Cedar Cove citizens -- lives with no beginning and no end, just a continuing existence.<br /><br />Macomber does a good job blending the residents -- all age groups dwell and all forms of predicaments arise. Macomber's \\"Cedar Cove series\\" is truly a different approach and it is neatly packaged!  So why not a higher rating?  Just like year four in the series \\"Dallas\\", it was fun the first time around, but I wouldn't repeat the viewing.  5 Star ratings are for the supreme keeper shelf -- books that earn a repeat reading.

No, the problem is in the handling.  A reader should never feel the story is a rehash.  Granted \\"love and seduction\\" are as old as the hills, but for a romance reader their unfolding should always feel fresh and new. In \\"IN THE PRINCE'S BED\\" the presentation was overdone.<br /><br />Lacking, in this much anticipated novel, is the joyous humor, the freshness, the \\"cannot put this book down\\" feeling found in the author's previous books.

What is a Carpathian (besides being a Christine Feehan specialty)?  A Carpathian is a race of quasi-vampire creatures. Who, while sustaining on human blood, never actual kill their prey.  They are simply benign creatures trying to blend into the human race.<br /><br />Now according to the Feehan theory of \\"vampiring\\" - a \\"vampire\\" is a Carpathian gone insane, a creature that enjoys killing his prey -- which is a very bad thing. A love-starved Carpathian can turn into a wicked vampire if he doesn't find his soul mate.<br /><br />Fortunately,  Juliette came along to free HER Carpathian - lucky indeed -- for she is his predestined soul-mate!<br /><br />Detour around this entry!<br /><br />EMMA HOLLY'S -- THE NIGHT OWL.

So with that in mind, I offer my humble opinion . . .<br /><br />The book's heroine is wild and kooky Aisling Grey.  Aisling Grey may be foolhardy and nutty, but she is lovable in a strange way.  Her assignment: to deliver a medieval statue to a Paris client.  She arrives in an affluent apartment only to find her customer dead. Troubling?  Yes, especially when the dead buyer is hanging inside a black circle of ash with a silver object piercing her heart!  Could our heroine's assignment get any worse?  Oh yea!  The perfect antidote to an otherwise miserable morning - the drop dead handsome Drake Vireo, the book's hero, enters the room.  Sexual tension fills the air and MacAlister's satanic adventure takes off . . . well sort of.<br /><br />In the opening of the book, MacAlister has Aisling in the deny mode.

In LARKSPUR, Garlock held my interest from the opening page to the final word.<br /><br />Kristin Anderson is a Wisconsin charmer, blessed with Nordic features, and a Montana ranch.  Tired of being an unpaid servant, Kristin firmly says goodbye to her wretched brother, his insipid wife, and their spoiled children.  She leaves with both dread and delirium and heads west to her inheritance -- a Montana ranch called Larkspur.<br /><br />In Montana, things are complicated.  It seems others would like to own Kristin's land.  It seems someone else already owns a section -- the ranch house. Buck Lenning does not relish sharing his house, let alone his life with an intruding woman.  However, through necessity, they join forces and finally join their hearts.<br /><br />Dorothy Garlock does a fine job on this story.  Kristin Anderson is hardworking and kind, yet the author holds the line and does not turn the heroine into a \\"superwoman\\".  Buck Anderson is understanding, tender, and tough.  Dorothy Garlock wonderfully depicts his gentle care for the old man suffering from Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />Dorothy Garlock built a wonderful gritty western romance.  This author stirred this reader with talent and storytelling ability.  Yes, LARKSPUR was a splendid book.

Stephen Kenyon, the Duke of Ashburton, learns he has only three months to live and decides to enjoy his remaining days minus responsibility. Stephen chooses to escape the strict enclosure of his title, to experience life as an ordinary man.  So he simply disappears into the world of commonplace.<br /><br />Spontaneously, he attends an amateur theater presentation, where the Duke of Ashburton encounters the lovely actress, Rosalind Jordan.  His aristocratic title is cast further aside when Rosalind misunderstands his introduction.  Refreshingly, for the first time in his life, Stephen Kenyon, the Duke of Ashburton is merely a man.<br /><br />Rosalind Jordan is the gentle core of the theater's well being. She is in charge of the wardrobe, serves as stage manager, and when necessary becomes a skillful actress.  A skillful actress yes, but Rosalind acts without passion.  Rosalind accepts the make-believe world of drama but longs for the real world of certainty.<br /><br />Their growing attraction captivates Stephen and Rosalind, he with her beauty and character, she with his charm and kindness.  They struggle against this growing attraction, he because his time is limited, she because he is not of her vagabond world.<br /><br />In ONE PERFECT ROSE, the author provides a good storyline and presents good secondary characters.  Rosalind's parents are delightful; they fuel a potential somber story. Yes, Putney's story idea is inventive and moving, yet somehow it lacks substance.  Yes, it is a pleasant read, but it is bland.  It needs more fire and thrust to be a real page turner.  Grade: C<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-08-24

Jill Marie Landis did some wonderful things with BLUE MOON.  She masterfully used a disfigured hero, a tarnished heroine, and a captivating villain. The results: a good story.<br /><br />Mutilated by an accident, Noah LeCroix chose to spend most of his life alone.  However, his solitary lifestyle changed the day he found the lovely unconscious Olivia Bond.  Hesitantly, he brought her to his cabin, to care for her, to make her well again, but now desire fills him.<br /><br />Experienced with the wiles of men, Olivia recognizes Noah's attraction, but thinks that her wantonness breeds his desire.  To hinder his attraction, Olivia reveals her dishonorable past, a past spent under the control of whoremonger, Darcy Lankanal.  Olivia Bond was Darcy Lankanal's personal toy. Now all she wants is to go home, but how will her family accept what she has done? Will they welcome her or ask her to leave?<br /><br />Darcy Lankanal is angry that his bedtoy has run off.  He is obsessed with his little student.  She must be returned to his private quarters in New Orleans so they can continue with her instructions.<br /><br />The story's favorable factors:<br /><br /> Jill Marie Landis' depiction of the harsh living conditions is first class.  Landis' dialogue is top notch and the author cleverly nourishes the sexual tension between Olivia and Noah.  But it is the portrayal of Darcy Lankanal that carries the book.  Landis has created an enticing villain in Lankanal.  His charming, scoundrel behavior is the story.<br /><br />The story's non-favorable factors:<br /><br />Olivia Bond's relentless struggle with her past becomes tedious.  But it is the character of Noah LeCroix that is the big disappointment.  Noah unfolds as a big mule - something akin to Li'l Abner or Jethro Bodine.  His confusion and uncertainty are too much.  Reality is good, but romance heros have to be divine beings.  Grade: B<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-08-24

In HAZARD, Beverley stuck with tradition but decided the rhythm of speech would be the noble approach, the results: They talk too much.<br /><br />Finally, Lady Anne Peckworth has her story.  Sequel readers know Anne is the jilted candidate from Beverley's FORBIDDEN and THE DRAGON'S BRIDE.  Although jilted twice, surprisingly Lady Anne is hardly heartbroken, for marriage was never her life's goal.  Born with a twisted foot, Anne has spent most of her existence being pitied.  Nevertheless, Anne is content with her life.  She enjoys blissful hours researching her familial ancestry.<br /><br />Race de Vere is a polished nobody, a commoner, a tradesman's son.  Still, Race de Vere is concerned. As friend and secretary to the Earl of Wyvern, he has taken it upon himself to make certain that Anne Peckworth is all right after Wyvern discarded her.  Mischievously, he becomes a fast friend to Anne's younger brother to gain Anne's acquaintance.<br /><br />Sparks of attraction fly between Race and Anne. Race awakens in Anne the pleasures of lust.  It is with this realization that Anne discovers a need to find a husband - a man worthy of a duke's daughter.  Of course, Racecombe de Vere isn't in the running. His social position is far below Anne's.  Both realize he is not worthy.  Regrettably, Anne sets off for London to shop in the season's marriage mart, repeatedly dreaming of Racecombe and his wicked advances.<br /><br />As a writer, Jo Beverley always remains firmly rooted in the traditional Regency form.  Jo Beverley is one author who does not rely on fashionable trends to write her historical novels. However, in HAZARD Beverley decided endless rounds of conversation would carry the story.  After finishing HAZARD, the phrase \\"Too much of a good thing\\" comes to mind.  Woefully, HAZARD is talkatively boring something similar to a long-winded person.

There I stood, in Canada's largest bookstore, holding THE IMMORTAL HIGHLANDER, Karen Marie Moning's newest novel - Hardcover form, Hardcover price.  Um, should I wait for the paperback?  Then I asked myself:  Have you read all of Moning's books?  YES!  Has Karen Marie Moning ever let you down?  NO!  Have all the reviews been positive?  YES!<br /><br />Now I ask myself.  Was the book worth the Hardcover price?  YES!  Yes, it was!  Moning's newest novel is excellent.  It is almost frightening how good this author has become. Moning continues to grow with each new publication.  This is an author who understands the field of romance.<br /><br />Moning has given Adam Black his story.  Adam Black belongs to the highly advanced race of immortal beings.  He is dangerous, unpredictable, and lethally seductive.  Aoibheal, The High Queen of the Seelie,  is fed up.  Adam has gone too far toying with the human race.  She retaliates by trapping him in human form; furthermore, she forces him to live drearily on the outer regions of humanity without his diabolic powers. Worse -- most humans do not even know Adam Black exists - for no one can see him - no one that is except Gabrielle O'Callaghan.  And with that, all I have to say is -- sweet heavens!  Sexuality oozes from the page as these two humorously hook up.  Oh -  this is what makes romance reading such terrific fun.  It is not the actual sexual act.  No it is the lust, the desire, the wanting.  Here Moning delivers big time!  She flaunts the fine art of seduction and captivates her reader.<br /><br />A word of caution -- do not attempt to read this book, unless you have time set aside.  This is truly an \\"I'm reading, nothing else exists\\" type of story.  Very nicely done, Karen Marie Moning!  Grade: A+<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-08-10

With much reluctance, the Earl of Falloden accepts the coal merchant's terms.  He will wed Eleanor Transome, a young woman he has never met.<br /><br />Two very different people from two very different worlds.  Two very separate entities. They were man and wife, a stranger from a class she hated and she from a class he despised.  Yet, there was more to it than that. They had to make a life together.  They could derive mutual satisfaction from each other.  He would take pleasure from her and she would take pleasure from receiving him.  For Eleanor did not want to be alone. Eleanor wanted to love someone, Eleanor wanted children.<br /><br />Balogh again hits the jackpot.  A CHRISTMAS PROMISE is delightful.  It is a quiet story about two people who: meet, observe, and fall in love with each other.  Nothing unusual -- except these two people are already married.  Balogh relies on a Christmas theme to enhance her story delighting her readers with the traditions of Christmases past.  A time when families gathered, for days, to celebrate the joy of the season.  A time when Christmas celebrations revolved around life's simple pleasures: horse drawn sleighs, sledding at night, gathering yule logs, or rejoicing in a star-filled Christmas sky.<br /><br />Again Mary Balogh proves she can write a romance book.  At the end of A CHRISTMAS PROMISE, Mary Balogh wisely chooses her poignancy pen.  Quietly I wept as Eleanor opened her father's final gift and then I rejoiced when the hero offered his heart.

Lady Helena must ask for the blackguard's assistance in a very personal family matter.  Her younger sister, Juliet, has eloped with a fortune hunter. Of course, Daniel thinks Helena is overreacting. Yet, Daniel cannot refuse this very prim and proper lady, even if she has the razor sharp tongue of a viper.<br /><br />Posing as a married couple, Daniel and Helena embark on a rescue journey.  They must find that little runaway and her notorious sweetheart.  Of course, they find themselves very attracted to one another.  Yet, annoying problems get in the way -- social class differences, Helena's physical weakness, Helena's tight-laced attitude, and finally Daniel's insecurity.  Still, the author allows some humorous moments.  Unfortunately, there just aren't enough of these moments. Although, this is page turner material, with a little more humor the author could have made her story a phenomenal adventure.<br /><br />Daniel Brennan has the makings of a fine hero -- a rough around the edges kind of guy.  However, the stuffy Helena takes too long to let down her hair.  This heroine spends too much time whining and complaining.  It wasn't until Helena consumed the beastly ale that the reader finally jumped into her corner.  One of Sabrina Jeffries' strong suits is her ability to write humor.

Grade: B+	In true Mary Balogh style, the author has written another powerful romance. Several years ago, Lady Christina spurned the impoverished Gerard Percy and married his wealthy cousin, Gilbert, the Earl of Wanstead.  The puritan and callous Gilbert made life miserable for Christina.  However, fate intervened and the rejected Gerard Percy is now the Earl of Wanstead.  Balogh opens the story with the new earl returning home to claim the Wanstead estate.<br /><br />Mary Balogh writes this regency tale using her best poignancy pen. With timed precision, Mary Balogh permits flashes into Christina's deplorable marriage and the torment she endured. Fortunately for the reader, the author placed Christina's daughters into the pages, adding essential color to a dark story.  Furthermore, Mary Balogh handles the inevitable marriage proposal extremely well.  She uses her many writing skills to design a delightful uncommon approach.<br /><br />The Last Waltz is a melancholy story but in true romantic fashion, Balogh turns love into the victor and the reader enjoys the conquest. Yes, Mary Balogh has written her usual page turner; although, it is a sad and dark story, Balogh makes it irresistible.  Astutely, Mary Balogh uses a Christmas setting.  The author entertains the reader with descriptive seasonal traditions from the regency period.  Balogh allows the boisterous, festive crowd to pull the reader into the many celebrations enjoyed in the earlier part of the nineteenth century.

A DANGEROUS LOVE is book one in Sabrina Jeffries' SWANLEA SPINSTERS series.<br /><br />Griff Knighton is a wealthy businessman, powerful and passionless.  Rosalind Laverick is a voluptuous, vivacious country lass and the second daughter of the Earl of Swanlea -- the man who ruined Griff Knighton's father. Griff is extremely entertained when he receives a summons to the Swanlea estate.  The old earl is offering one of his daughters to Griff as a potential mate!  Griff is delighted with the old earl's proposition.  He accepts the invitation, but he accepts with ulterior motives -- vengeance.<br /><br />Rosalind is not happy with her father's plans!  Her first encounter with the notorious Griff only confirms her anxiety.  She just knows Griff is a ruthless scoundrel and his hostile behavior speaks for itself.<br /><br />However, this is a romance novel and temptations abound.  Rosalind and Griff have no idea what to do with their mutual attraction.  They hide their amorous feelings by engaging in clever repartee and oh how artfully these two adversaries spar.  Their outrageous banter is witty and fun - I never suspected William Shakespeare could be quoted so effectively!<br /><br />This was a good book.  It could have been a splendid book, but Jeffries resorted to repetitive discussions toward Griff's ambitions.  These drawn out discussions caused dreariness to rear its ugly head.  Although this repetitive weakness lasted only through a few chapters, it still clogged the reading journey.  Still Jeffries manages to produce a good book and I look forward to sister Helena's story with much anticipation.

She is trying to hold onto a wretched man - a wretched man with a wretched daughter.  In a rare moment of strength Dougless disagrees with the obnoxious daughter.  The result - Dougless is left behind -- stranded in the English countryside.  Heartbroken Dougless breaks down in tears and cries out for a knight in shining armor - presto, Nicholas Stafford, a knight from the sixteenth century appears.<br />Now Deveraux has great fun with her reader.  We explore the twentieth century with Nicholas.  Dougless may be a reluctant guide but she is hooked -- hooked on this adorable, handsome man.  Of course, Nicholas and Dougless fall deeply in love - a love that has dire consequences.  These consequences force our lovers back to the sixteenth century.<br />Now the reader explores Tudor England with the twosome; however, this exploration is not nearly as amusing.  Nicholas Stafford does not remember their initial attraction and the couple is forced to begin anew.  The results?  The reading becomes long.  Nicholas' denial grows tiresome.  When our duo again finds love, Deveraux also takes control.  The author now writes some of most romantic words I have ever read -- sigh!  Yet this is not a happily-ever-after story.

The attentive reader soon realizes all that glitters is not gold.  If we believe Rita Ewing and Crystal McCrary Anthony's words -- adultery, homosexuality, the woes of interracial relationships, out of wedlock children, and gambling problems are common elements in the life of a professional athlete.<br />The New York Flyers are on their way to the NBA championships.  Basketball is a team sport and the team must pull together, along with their wives, girlfriends, and even their children.  To win -- everything must be in perfect harmony.  In other words, one big, happy, stress free, winning family -- not an easy goal when the players are running amuck having out-of-town affairs, inflated egos, and bigger attitudes.<br />This story is realistic and well-written.  However, if you are looking for romance -- this is not the book.  An interesting note: throughout the many sub-stories, the reader gets the message, loud and clear, that these wives do not want to be -- simply an extension of their famous husbands.  No, they want their own recognition, known for their own importance and value.  Yet, on this book's reverse cover the reader immediately ferrets out who these two women are and whom they married.  Their famous husband's athletic names are definitely front and center.  Hum, to encourage sales, I suppose!

As head and guardian of the Bedwyn family, Bewcastle has always appeared aloof and arrogant - frequenting the previous books as a cold calculating man. Admirably here Mary Balogh has not drifted from that image.  Instead she chooses to allow the reader a glimpse beneath the permanent Bewcastle shield.<br />Mary Balogh captures the essence of the word hoyden in her heroine, Christine Derrick.  Christine is impulsive and rash, never thinking beyond the moment.  Deplorably, Wulfric Bedwyn finds himself enticed by Christine Derrick's spontaneous charisma.<br />What Mary Balogh has done is create the perfect woman to blend with the Duke of Bewcastle.  After all, this is the boisterous family first introduced to the reader in A SUMMER TO REMEMBER.  Even though the duke is the family's authorized commander, he is first and forever a Bedwyn.  Christine Derrick allows him to embrace that fact again!<br />Mary Balogh has written a page turner from the start and a fitting conclusion to this robust family.  Wulfric Bedwyn finally flings his reserve aside and finds his complement.  An added bonus: Balogh's epilogue is a satisfying finish - fulfilling her reader's every yearning!<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-06-24

There is no lust here -- none. There is no ROMANCE here -- none.<br />It is the story of two identical twins. We have the good twin and the evil twin, but what twin is what twin? Ah, yes, use the secret number code. Whatever was I thinking? The first twin, Marian, for personal asinine reasons, chooses to don a dreadful disguise. She is rude, indifferent, and boorish to our hero. The second twin, Amanda, is beautiful, spoiled, and shameful. Our poor, poor hero, Chad Kinkaid - whatever is a man supposed to do? Fear not, Chad's sixth sense kicks in and he knows Marian is the one! Why? Who the devil knows? Certainly not this reader!<br />Now the book's strategy -- Chad is aroused, when he attempts to teach Marian how to ride a horse. He drags her into the hay mow, and well, one thing leads to another. But wait, which twin is she? He thinks he knows, but no, he doesn't, or does he? Confused? So was I.<br />There is no story here -- none. The book's copy is double spaced and essentially blank pages complete chapters. I read the hardcover in one day -- not because I couldn't put it down -- simply because there is nothing here.<br />To be effective, the romance should have been explored more. Maybe explain how Marian wins Chad's affections. Perhaps have them spend time together. Or possibly, show Marian being kind and compassionate to another person, maybe the cook or the cook's daughter, or some pathetic ranch hand -- while Chad quietly observes. However, just to inform the reader that Chad knows she is his soul-mate, well it just doesn't warrant.<br />Sorry, for all the Johanna Lindsey fans -- out there in romance land -- and I am one of her biggest, this book misses the grade. For entertainment, seduction and lust, read Lindsey's &quot;Prisoner of my Desire&quot; or &quot;Gentle Rogue&quot;.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-06-23

A PRECIOUS JEWEL is simply a wonderful novel filled with gentle sex, yearning, and poignancy. Yet, it is a  painful story which beckons two disheartened people to break free from lifeless serenity.  Mary Balogh THANK YOU!<br /><br />Destitute and alone Miss Priscilla Wentworth earns her living in a brothel. She accepts the condition of her life by shoving all the ugliness into  dark corners. Instinctively, Prissy reflects on spring days, warm sunshine, and quiet walks.  Only through these gentle reflections can Priscilla Wentworth escape.<br /><br />Sir Gerald Stapleton endures his cynicism and wariness of women. However, Gerald Stapleton is a man, with male needs.  When he seeks pleasure, he seeks out the girls in the brothel and his favorite is the pleasing Prissy. She is the only working girl who can effectively attend to his requirements.  Suddenly, Sir Gerald Stapleton no longer wants to share her and makes Prissy an offer.  She accepts it and becomes his exclusive mistress.<br /><br />Mary Balogh writes a brilliant story, provoking her reader's emotions.  A fresh uniqueness flows throughout, as Balogh gives her reader a view from a Regency mistress' life.  The reader experiences the enduring submissiveness and availability the mistress is forced to give and the mocking disdain and ridicule she must suffer. A PRECIOUS JEWEL is very good!<br />Grade: A+<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2004-06-22

Mary Balogh is one of my favorite authors and DARK ANGEL is one of my \\"I love Mary\\" books.  This is NOT a situation of \\"first comes love; then comes matrimony,\\" no this is a case of revenge.  In typical Mary Balogh style, the author has penned another wonderful romance.<br /><br />Jennifer Winward is engaged to the man of her girlhood dreams, the devastatingly handsome and distinguished Viscount Kersey. However, THEY soon shatter Jennifer's fantasy world, she finds herself ruined and devastated. THEY have destroyed and humiliated her -- all in the name of revenge.  THEY are two members of the English realm, two men playing a game of vengeance and retaliation -- a game with Jennifer posed in the center.<br /><br />Gabriel Fisher, the Earl of Thornhill, has recently returned from the continent.  He arrives in London with a mission - to destroy a man.  The man?  Jennifer Winward's betrothed.  The viscount may be the intended target, but he is also a man ready to execute a counterattack.<br /><br />Again Balogh draws a well-written story filled with richly sketched main and secondary characters.  Jennifer Winward is a beautiful innocent with a sharp mind.  Gabriel Fisher is your typical romance hero -- rich, handsome, and human -- Mary Balogh writes my kind of romance citizen!  Yet she handled Viscount Kersey with a brilliant flare.  Kersey is a fascinating villain.  He is evil but his character is not over the top -- a villain who is vile and interesting but does not distract from the hero and heroine.  Well done!<br /><br />Another regency classic from the Balogh pen.<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-06-17

Although the story's introduction promised much, that potential quickly turned into a dopey quandary.<br />Evangeline Peyton Howell is a beautiful young woman searching for her past.  Who is she?  Her answer lies in a sleepy town in Texas.  To get there, Evie needs an escort -- a protector of women and children.  She needs a hero -- a champion found in her dime novels - a champion living in Evie's fantasies and dreams.  Instead she finds sweet-talking, handsome as sin, notorious gambler Tyler Monteigne.<br />It is imperative Tyler Monteigne leave Natchez as quickly as possible.  This smooth gambling man has irritated one too many ladies.  Evangeline and her circumstance are his much-needed ticket out of town.  Tyler can be her dime novel hero, why Tyler Monteigne can be anything this delicious little lady wants.  What Tyler Monteigne can't be is a husband, a father, or a dedicated man!<br />Evie's knack for trouble and her ability to escape are at first delightful, but soon her endless troubles begin to weigh on the story's quality.  Stagecoach robbers, downcast orphans, and a villainous lawyer break from the story's basis - Evie's plan to understand her beginnings -- to embrace and accept completely.<br />Patricia Rice has a pleasant writing style, punctuated with adequate humor, but in PAPER ROSES she missed the delivery -- what started as noteworthy turned into sluggish.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-06-15

BRIGHT EYES launches easily -- prompting the reader to settle back, fully anticipating another Anderson gem.  Unfortunately, half way into her story Anderson flounders.  This gifted writer usually delivers heartwrenching, poignant stories -- but here she chose 'cutesy' -- coupled with a predictable crisis.<br /><br />The rugged Coulter family continues. BRIGHT EYES is Zeke's story.  Zeke Coulter is the normal Anderson hunka-hunka burning love male -- gorgeous, sensitive men who ooze toughness.  Zeke is a busy bachelor who is content with his life and his new acreage.<br /><br />Fortuitously, Zeke's new property borders Natalie Patterson's land.  Mrs. Patterson is a sexy mom with two children and a worthless ex-husband -- a jerk who continues to make life miserable for Natalie and his children.  Natalie Patterson and the kids find Zeke Coulter equal to a knight in shining armor.  A spectacular man who bolsters their confidence, builds their self-worth, and brings new hope to their bleak lives.<br /><br />As usual, Catherine Anderson draws wonderful characters.  Natalie falls from the pages as a normal woman, a woman who tugs at her summer shorts, frets over 10 pounds, yet is determined to lose 20.  However, the true character prize is little Rosie Patterson, Natalie's young daughter.  This four year old is adorably precocious and has enough charm to leap from Anderson's pages straight into the reader's heart.  Oh how, I cherished the pages this child inhabited.<br /><br />Yet, somewhere around page 200, the story became ordinary.  A predictable crime soared to the foreground changing Zeke and Natalie into grisly sugar-coated lovers -- I love you -- I love you -- say you love me -- say it again --.<br /><br />The beginning saved the rating, but that ending!  Oh, Ms. Anderson pull out that heart-rending pen!  Save the syrupy-sweet for another author -- nobody does poignancy better than you!<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-06-09

Kitty Robertson is hiding from her passion.<br />Richard Stanbury, the Duke of Weddington is a passionate, controlling man - a man who wants Kitty.  Richard Stanbury just happens to be Nicholas Glenville's best friend!<br />Skillfully, Lorraine Heath draws a Victorian courting game.  The writer presents a fascinating dilemma.  While indulging in Nicholas Glenville's charm, the reader still wants Richard Stanbury to win Kitty's affections.  This is page turner material.  Although the reader senses the direction Heath will take, the journey is still irresistible.<br />A good story but there is a stumbling block!

Tragically, I think the Bedwyn family is running out of steam!  The family saga is down to the crucial last book (A June 2004 release date -- Wulfric's story) and I am afraid!  If SLIGHTLY SINFUL is any indication - I should be terrified!<br />SLIGHTLY SINFUL is Alleyne's story.  Lord Alleyne Bedwyn is the fourth and last son in the Bedwyn clan.  Stationed at the British embassy in Brussels, Alleyne is shot when returning from the front lines and left to die in a Belgium forest.  Rachel York comes upon his naked body; Alleyne's next stop -- a Brussel brothel -- minus his memory.<br />Of course, Alleyne and Rachel are the main love interest; regrettably, their relationship lacks substance.  Significantly missing is the romance, the lust, the sensuality between the two.  In fact, the entire book just doesn't have enough interesting content.  Tediously, I read to the end hoping to enjoy the Bedwyn family and their reaction when Alleyne returned to them.  Letdown notice  -- the family ONLY appears briefly in the waning pages.  What a shame!  The energy from the vivacious family would have given much life to this lackluster story.<br /><br />Is there a highlight?  The ladies of the brothel and a crusty  sergeant are delightful people.  Yet, is their participation enough to recommend this book?  Sadly, no.<br />I am disappointed!  Mary Balogh is one of my all-time favorites.  Presently, I am tracking down her Signet Regency Romance books.

On the whole, this is not a bad book, but it is the weak link in Jeffries' \\"Lord Trilogy.\\"  Unfortunately, THE DANGEROUS LORD lacks the brilliance and wonder of its predecessors.<br /><br />Left penniless and in debt by her father, Felicity Taylor replenishes the family coffers by writing a gossip column for a London newspaper - incognito.  (Sound familiar Julia Quinn fans?)  When her mousy little friend is about to marry the notorious rake Ian Lennard, the Viscount St. Clair, Felicity strikes out wielding her wicked gossip pen.  In her scandalmonger column, Felicity accuses the viscount of keeping a mistress. After all, the devilish man does own the home, and an attractive woman does live there - with an infant!  Such a vicious attack inflames St. Clair and he sets out, for revenge, against the camouflaged columnist.<br /><br />Though Felicity and Ian are both likable characters, their likableness is just not enough to carry the story. The author casts them as two people who analyze every situation.  They examine every circumstance -- either together or solely.  They talk, they scold, and they sermonize.  Their endless moralizing completely clouds whatever chemistry the two lovebirds might have.<br /><br />What a shame the author chose this path, because her story had great potential.  Felicity's four young brothers are one of the story's highlights.  Each scene with these little devils is marvelous; too bad the author didn't exploit these rascals further!  Jeffries' earlier books in the trilogy - THE PIRATE LORD and THE FORBIDDEN LORD supply the other secondary characters.  Unfortunately, the author did exploit these supporting characters.  The drawback?  If not familiar with Jeffries' earlier books, the reader may have trouble figuring out whom all these people are.<br /><br />And that incredible ending!  Egads, but Felicity Taylor is marvelous - what a woman, what a wonderful woman, let's all hear it for Felicity and her plan to save the day!<br /><br />Yes, I was disappointed in this book.

They see nothing wrong with seizing a convict ship bound for Australia - a vessel packed with women - lawbreaking women.  These women should be grateful!  What Gideon doesn't see is Miss Sara Willis' point of view - that these hostages might not like the idea of forced nirvana.  Oh how Sara Willis frustrates Gideon.  This little she-devil challenges him, baffles him, upsets him, but most of all entices him.<br />Sabrina Jeffries writes a fast-paced, enjoyable novel.  The story depicts two headstrong people and their lively confrontations.  Successfully, Jeffries brandishes humor throughout her enchanting pages.  She pulls the reader into the wondrous world of contentment - contentment in buying the book, contentment in reading the book, contentment in escaping into the author's fantasy world.<br />Jeffries' strong suit may be humor, but this talented lady also can write a fairly good love scene. Fairly good?  Jeffries' love scenes are intense and hot.

Both brothers make an offer. The viscount offers Sarah a position as his mistress, while Adam offers Sarah marriage.

His assignment - to go to the colonies and protect England's colonized territories against French aggression.  Sarah must remain in England with Adam's family, a family that includes the viscount.<br /><br />Now, this author truly begins to weave her magic, and what sorcery.

He was the man who planned their escape.  Now he is the King's champion - roaming the land as a victorious knight, fighting and giving his strength to those threatened.  However, an assassin is erasing the mysterious brotherhood and Stryder is a prime target.<br />Lady Rowena de Vitry hates war and the knights who prolong the violence. As an heiress, men court Rowena who want her lands and wealth, but she refuses their bid.  For Rowena is waiting for a gentle man, who will show her love and kindness.

King Henry and Queen Eleanor, grow tired of Rowena's resistance, and together they hatch a plan to trick Rowena into marriage - a marriage to Stryder of Blackmoor.<br />So what is the problem?

The charm found in Ms. James' \\"Wild Pursuit\\" was missing from this sequel.  Although the book was a pleasant read, the enchanting jealousy and the incredible lust found in the parent book wasn't found in these pages.<br />This is a story about beginnings, a second chance at love for two pathetic people.  Helene Holland wants to get on with her life, she wants a divorce from Rees Holland, the miserable man she married  many years ago.  But more important, Helene wants a life filled a child.  Helene wants a baby.  However, she must conceive a child before the divorce, to avoid a beastly scandal.<br />Over afternoon tea, Helene and her lady friends draw up the plans for the fertilization. Helene needs a donor, someone she can entice to her bed.  Dumbfounded by his wife's plans, Rees decides to provide his services -- but at a cost.  Rees Holland will supply the much needed assistance, if Helene will assist him with his project - a mediocre opera.  Yet incredibly, this deplorable man is not finished with his demands.  If Helene truly wants a baby, she must live in his home and coexist with his mistress.  What an idea!<br />With such a farcical storyline, why did I rate the book 3 Stars and not something lower?

Properly-bred ladies, ethical in their way, but misunderstood by society.  \\"A Wild Pursuit\\" is a story saturated with lust and desire, yet the author sidesteps heavy intimacy.  However, it is the lightweight jealousy Eloisa James employs that delivers the most appealing reading sensation - humor. This is a comedy of errors. A mixture of misunderstandings that create tantalizing subplots that keep the pages turning for the reader.<br />The only male guest invited to the house party is Stephen Fairfax-Lacey, the Earl of Spade.  This puritanical gentleman is a respected Member of Parliament, and a duke's heir.  To his utmost delight, Fairfax-Lacey finds himself hobnobbing with these scandalous women.  The women have included him in this celebration because he is husband material. If the marriage plans don't work, Stephen might be the perfect man to be a lover. Unhappily, Lady Beatrix Lennox finds herself very interested in his love talents.  Lady Beatrix is a social outrage. Caught in a compromising situation during her debut season, she truly remains on the edge of society.  Initially, I found Beatrix and her rebel attitude too foolish and too extreme; however, I did warm up to this character by the time the book ended.  But it is Fairfax-Lacey's preoccupation with this lustful little upstart that is sheer entertainment.<br />The second subplot is the enticing tale of Esme Rawlings and Sebastian, the Marquess Bonnington.  This is the first romance book I have read where a late-stage pregnant woman engages exuberantly in lovemaking and relishes the activity.  This passionate intimacy is a magnificent move by the author.  Sebastian is a splendid man.  He is a caring lover, he is concerned, he is soothing, and he frequently talks to the unborn baby.  Sebastian loves Esme, but Esme is confused.  She has decided to become respectable. Unfortunately, the Marquess laid the groundwork which resulted in her husband's death.

Ex-soldier, Robert Carroway, is suffering from war-related post trauma.  This tortured man was a victim of unthinkable abuse and degradation by Napoleon's troops.  After months in a French hell-hole, Robert returned to England; his body broken and his mind tormented.  Long, lonely days of healing, and Robert comes to rely on the vibrant Lucinda Barrett to give him his brightest moments.  By far, Robert Carroway is the most riveting character in Suzanne Enoch's \\"England's Perfect Hero.\\"<br />Lucinda Barrett, is a misplaced modern-day girl, and she appears courtesy of Suzanne Enoch's \\"Lessons in Love series.\\" A sequence of books involving three close friends; each friend controlling a personal list. Itemized lists drawn up to teach rude gentlemen the fine art of courting.  Lucinda has her list and now she has her selected pupil.  However, Lucinda runs into an unexpected problem with her tutoring scheme - Robert Carroway surfaces.<br />As a heroine, Lucinda is very likeable; nonetheless, she commits a romance book faux pas - she betrays Robert's confidence. However, it is the romance and the storyline which suggest a bigger blunder.  This love match is wanting. The very idea that Robert is pleased to the first man to reach Lucinda's bed - a triumph over his chief rival so to speak - is - well, need I write more?  England, in the early 1800s, kingdom of the `honor duel' - this hero should be pleased to remove his rival's head.<br />And what is with all the freedom given to these women?  Georgie for example, this darling lady, Robert's sister-in-law and Lucinda's dear friend, is in the final days of her pregnancy.  Yet, she gads about London, extensively?  This story is set in Regency England, set with stringent attitudes and unyielding opinions.  But in spite of, her advanced stage of pregnancy, this woman still attends many social festivities.  She is a key player in a smuggling operation and eventually Lady Dare is part of the female trio assigned to hunt down the backstabbing villain!  Incredible, England's own answer to Charlie's Angels!  The very pregnant Viscountess Dare does all this terrific activity without raising a single social eyebrow or apprehension from anyone -- including her husband.<br />The summary: This is a romance that floats - it doesn't swim and it doesn't drown - it floats.  Yet, the question remains did I think the author was successful?  Well, I do want to read the two parent books; so yes, I suppose it was worthwhile.

With many books, once I turn the last page, the story's image disappears.  Within a few days, I have forgotten the book's foundation.  This is not so in Catherine Anderson's \\"Coming Up Roses.\\"  I think the child in this harrowing tale will live in my memory forever.<br />Kate Blakely and her daughter, Miranda, endured personal hell for five long years. An agonizing world controlled by a heinous man - a perverted man to whom Kate Blakely had regrettably married. A man unsoundly motivated -- by his own interpretation of the Bible.  Joseph Blakely perceived his wife and daughter as `Handmaidens to Satan' - sent by the evil one to tempt him into sin.<br />Zachariah McGovern is the neighbor around whom Miranda builds a castle of dreams.  In Miranda's eyes, this man is her hero.  A man who ranks right up there with the fairies, the elves, and the mystical unicorns from her mother's fairytales -- he is the stuff of magical wishes.  Zachariah McGovern is a god sent.<br />Through the pages, the author has drawn striking character sketches.  Kate Blakely is a gentle, loving woman -- the victim of a life mistake.  Anderson drafts Zachariah McGovern from her masculine template - brawny men who are everything wonderful.  And little Miranda Blakely is divine, the star of the story.  This cast and their lives make remarkable reading material.<br />What are the problems?  The conclusion wrapped up too nicely, too methodically.  These are two wounded souls who would not come back from the brink of destruction so easily -- no matter who the hero is.  Secondly, Zachariah's tragic past was an unnecessary side story.  Still, this is a forceful well-written story.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-04-24

Something to consider when reading a trilogy - read it in order.  \\"Dreams of Destiny\\" is book three in May McGoldrick's \\"Scottish Dream Trilogy\\"; unfortunately, I did not follow my golden rule.  No, I jumped right into book three and shortly into the book I wondered,  \\"Who are all these people?\\"  A missing character buildup and the lack of a worthy introduction probably caused my dismay.<br /><br />However, an intriguing maneuver carried me through to the end.  May McGoldrick chose to run two storylines simultaneously -- the results: a clever enhancement.<br /><br />Gwyneth Douglas loves David Pennington, her neighbor and friend, but she is marrying another man.  David intervenes and the reader's fun begins.  Their romantic spree is a delight.<br /><br />Yet, in contrast, is a lingering dark story. Walter Truscott, David's loyal cousin, struggles with memories of Emma - Gwyneth's scheming, beautiful, dead cousin.  His reflections are grave and melancholy; yet this gloom is a terrific side-dish.  McGoldrick weaves the two storylines magnificently and creates a reading boon. Further spice: McGoldrick reintroduces  Violet - a character from a parent book.<br /><br />Yes, I jumped into the third episode but every novel should stand alone.  Reading in sequence is my golden rule, but it should not be a necessity.<br /><br />MaryGrace Meloche.	2004-04-24

A dissimilar pair who cannot possibly have a future together, or can they?  Abigail and the reader think it is a possibility.  Now the author must convince the hero, and this is where the book's complexity settles -- in the convincing.<br />Abigail Bliss is traveling on an Oregon-bound wagon train.  Hidden from her is the fact she is a very rich heiress; her father feels that withholding this vital piece of information is better.  Tanner McKnight is the hard-core gentleman on her trail.  His mission - to bring sweet Abigail home to Chicago. His downfall -- sweet Abigail falls in love with him.<br />To Rexanne Becnel's credit, she pens a great historical novel.  The information surrounding the traveling conditions in a  wagon train is phenomenal.  Likewise, the added bonus of the fictional mouse creatures is a wonderful attachment.  It is definitely a source of humorous relief from the journey's struggle.<br />However, it is the off and on love interest that puts a strain on the story.  Does he love me? Does he want me?  Do I love him?  Do I want him?  Holy moly.  End it!  The story just ran out of steam.  If only the author had cut some indecisiveness from the four-hundred and six pages, this would have been a dynamite story.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-04-20

London's social scene becomes the battlefield in their madcap attempt to help their nieces obtain two husbands.

Up to the plate step the aunts, where they pull out the war manual and strategically begin to design their military love campaign.  To avoid her aunts' meddling plans, Eliza talks Magnus into an arrangement.  An arrangement that will see both of them achieve their individual dreams when the social season ends. Yes, in the end, they obtain dreams, but not solitary dreams.<br />This is fine writing, Kathryn Caskie has the ability to set up a scene!  With fantastic skill, the author creates wonderful secondary characters; from the interfering aunts, to the worrisome sister, to the catty rival, Caskie delivers big-time.<br />Why not a perfect rating?

American heiress Sophia Wilson will not allow herself to be presented like a raspberry custard. A pudding on a platter, for all the English gentlemen to sniff and taste, just to see if they relish the flavor.  No, she will not - despite her mother's wishes.  Hence begins Julianne MacLean's tale \\"To Marry the Duke.\\"<br />Lively Sophia is a rarity among the haughty, reserved Victorian society. This beautiful young woman totes great American wealth and she perks the interest of the blue-blooded males. However, Sophia positively resents being a display piece, but her mother wants the key to unlock society's lofty acceptance and Sophia will get that key.  Yet, Sophia plans to  hold out for love.<br />James Langdon, the Duke of Wentworth has Mrs. Wilson's key -- a well-established noble title.  He also has a poverty-stricken dukedom.  When the Duke of Wentworth views the lovely sultry Sophia, he views through lustful eyes heavily encased in dollars signs.  This aloof man also totes enough emotional baggage to give the lovable Sophia her own key -- to Bedlam.  And so Julianne MacLean establishes the matrimonial journey of sweet Sophia Wilson and the obscure Duke of Wentworth.<br />Nevertheless, it is Ms. MacLean's writing style that saves this book, for her stereotyped characters are burdensome.  Sophia is too happy, too forgiving, and far too understanding when dealing with the bewilderment of her marriage.  James Langdon is too remote, too brisk, and far too unconvincing when recalling his traumatic childhood.  Yet, MacLean wants us to believe these two people still managed to have a field day in the marriage bed.  Whatever!  Sorry, this illogicality did not win me over. Nonetheless, Julianne MacLean's writing form is still smooth and clean.<br />A bonus, at the end of the book, the author explains the migration wealthy American women followed at the close of the nineteenth century.  These affluent women crossed  the Atlantic, arrived on English soil, and were ready to marry into the British upperclass.

Lorraine Heath writes a straightforward, enthusiastic page turner in \\"Smooth Talkin' Stranger.\\" From the beginning, I devoured this heartening storyline and I truly regretted the final page when it arrived.<br />As a widow, Serena Hamilton lives a lonely life, raising her young son alone.  As a government agent, Hunter Fletcher lives a lonely life, existing only on the outer edges.  Two lonely people who intersect in a bar and spend the night together in fiery passion.  Two people who cannot ignore the heat of that night. Using this power of passion, Heath pens a touching story about two strangers accepting life's fate.<br />The book flows with a loving essence.  Hunter Fletcher is an isolated man, the product of a violent childhood, the man has no starting point from which to build.  He views Serena as the essential Adoration Goddess.  This beautiful woman overflows with tenderness, devotion, and love as she deals with her son and her father.   Understandably, Hunter Fletcher is terrified of Serena's angelic world -  a world for which he yearns.<br />Again Lorraine Heath bewitches this reader. When it comes to creating heartwarming and heart wrenching stories brimming with penetrating emotion, sensuality and humor, this author knows no bounds.  This is a splendid book.

To escape the crude advances of  bawdy patrons, Eavin disguised her heavenly body under ugly sack dresses.  When the golden opportunity came, Eavin Marie O'Flannery married Dominic Dupre.  She hoped for a safe sanctuary.<br />Their brief marriage was a failure -- sexually and spiritually.  Now widowed, Eavin vows she will never be the outlet for another man's relief.  Selectively, Eavin appeals to her late husband's family for shelter.  The year is 1812 and Eavin leaves Baltimore and her miserable life.<br />In New Orleans, Nicolas Saint-Just, Dominic's brother-in-law meets Eavin at the wharf.  Saint-Just owes the Louisiana plantation where Eavin will launch her virtuous survival.<br />But Patricia Rice's pen scratches in, and soon after Eavin arrives, Nicholas' wife dies in childbirth -- and Rice's romantic experience dawns . . .<br />Applying the backdrop of war and the threat of a British invasion, Rice writes a terrific, descriptive story.  Her pen paints the sultry, steamy scenes of New Orleans in the early part of the nineteenth century.  The author beautifully collects and frees her characters.  Eavin is a tender Irish young woman with a wicked tongue.  Her words are a joy to read.  Nicolas Saint-Just is a dark French aristocrat, with a sinful disposition.  His words are a thrill to read.<br />Yes, this is an intriguing dusky story, with one unmerciful drawback -  the last fifty pages.  Here it seemed as if the plot got away from the author.  The zigzagging storyline became a hodgepodge of events.  Good grief, what happened to the quiet, alluring activity of the sensual plantation?<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-04-08

In Shari Anton's \\"Once a Bride\\", the author holds the weary reader in labored suspense. Although it is a tale of romance, medieval court tactics rule most of the pages.  The sovereignty charges Eloise Hamelin's father with treason and then holds him a prisoner.  He waits in the Tower of London for the King's judgment.  The King places Eloise's properties in the hands of his noble knight - Roland St. Marten.  The history between Eloise and St. Marten is familiar but awkward.  Once upon a time, Eloise was to wed St. Marten's brother.  A brother he dearly loved.<br />Nevertheless, this is a romance. Before long, desire attracts our adversaries to one other, but just how far should their relationship go?  The author quickly reduces the reader's anxiety by allowing Eloise's fourteen-year-old maid and St. Marten's sixteen-year-old squire to give the worrywarts counsel -- yup, two young'uns who certainly know the score.<br />In this medieval tale, Anton tries to show society's ease in condemning a loyal noble subject.  Furthermore, the author aims for romantic suspense by exposing our couple to conspiracy and treason. Yet in the end, Anton's tale has a flimsy plot and a diluted location. A tale relating to the middle ages?  Sorry the occasional usage of 'Twould and 'Tis  just didn't convince me.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-04-05

As its title suggests, \\"A Whisper of Violets\\" is a whisper of delicate romance.  Linda Madl pulls her reader into her gentle dream with soft words and tranquil love scenes.<br />Nicholas Derrington, the Earl of Seacombe, and Dorian St. John draw swords on an auction floor.  For different reasons, both crave a musical score entitled \\"A Whisper of Violets.\\"  Seacombe wants to clear his treasonous name and Dorian wants to give her dying aunt her final wish.  In the end, he is the victor of the bidding war.  Three pieces of a musical score and now they each own one, but the third and final piece of the puzzle is still missing.  Unlucky in their lone attempts, they create a counterfeit betrothal thus enabling a united search, a search which delivers mystery and suspense.<br />The blossoming romance is delightful and charming. Unfortunately, the author succumbs to the standard romantic standoff -- both love one another, but wistfully deny the attraction.  However, even with this common ploy, Madl continues to handle the relationship with gentle and understanding words -- avoiding the use of confrontation.  This reader always appreciates the civilized approach, and with this maneuver the author creates a page turner.<br />Another brilliant writing touch is a second romance.  Susanna Sunridge, a titan-haired package, fully bewitches Davis, Dorian's twin.  Oh how Davis fights the BIG one.  Their special attraction is playful and alluring.  It took Davis time to realize what a treasure the widow Susanna truly is, but as always he rises to the occasion.<br />A joyful book, but it is not perfect.  Several times it bogged down, but not enough to create serious problems.  I'm rating it a solid 4 stars.  I would recommend this romantic whisper -- for a first time read.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-03-18

I must confess Karen Ranney's \\"Tapestry\\" genuinely stole my heart. Strategically the author  delivers a coup d'etat by dividing her story into two books. Book one is the kindling of youthful love --  all the acceptance, the joy, the discovery. Book two is the heart wrenching journey through the seven stages of grief. Plainly, the reader walks with the heroine into the pit of desperation. But in the end, Ranney takes her story and her reader and like the phoenix she rises them from these ashes of despair.<br /><br />TAPESTRY was Karen Ranney's debut book and what an entry into the romance field!

Breaking free from her widow's grieving period,  Felicity's campaign is to find a young, titled, FUN husband.  She will flourish and the rest of the world can rot.  Tom Russell, her childhood neighbor and friend, just happens to get in the way and Felicity Wren walks all over him. Good old Tom takes it like a faithful hound waiting patiently for Felicity's adoration.  She is so totally unaware of his loving affection that the reading words become painful.<br />Pacifying the troubled reader, Mary Balogh creates two surprising characters in Felicity's twin sisters.  These young women come to London to take advantage of the \\"season\\" and score they do!  Merrily, both receive advantageous marriage proposals.  This writing ploy is a good strategy by the author.  It eases the tension and allows her reader to continue with the book.<br />Mary Balogh is very good at her craft, but this storyline is uncomfortable.  Although, in the end everyone lives happily ever after, it was a brutal journey to get there.<br />And there are some critical flaws:<br />Page 134. A viscount's wife is a viscountess -- not a countess.<br />Page 9.  Exactly why was Felicity called Lady \\"Felicity\\" Wren?  It was not a birthright.  Her father was only a country gentleman.<br />Page 11.  Felicity referred to her late husband as Sir Wilfred Wren, so she is simply Lady Wren.<br />Ok, they may be pointless errors, but as I read, they drove me crazy.<br />This is one of the many Signet Regency Romance books written during the late eighties and nineties.  The authors filled these delightful books with wonderful storylines that were both educational and entertaining.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-03-06

Pulling away from a standard setting, Danelle Harmon set her novel on the sea and shores of New England, in 1778. A wonderful approach and it is apparent, to the reader, this author is familiar with the area and its history.<br />Captain Brendan Jay Merrick, late of the British Royal Navy, arrives in the New England town of Newburyport, Massachusetts.  His mission is to authorize the building of a magnificent schooner, but his destiny is the daughter of the man who will build Merrick's dream.<br />Mira Ashton rollicks through life. She has her horses and cats, the freedom to do as she pleases, and enough curse-words to rival a sailor.  Her mission is to be the sharpest gunner aboard her brother's ship, but her destiny is to compete for the love of Brendan Merrick, and her competition is the proud and lovely \\"Kestrel\\" - the wondrous schooner.<br />Meeting Mira Ashton and her family for the first time is a challenge to the reader.  Mira is an unrefined, vulgar, little creature.  She defies her father, fights with her brother, and makes the reader wonder -  where is this going?  However, if the reader rides out the initial emotional storm, the reward is worth the effort, for Danelle Harmon finally begins to write a wonderful story. The author mesmerized, this landlocked reader, with descriptive words about sailing and the turbulent sea.<br />Yet, the author didn't survive the ocean voyage.

Congratulations to Sabrina Jeffries on this effort. This gal can write comedy.  I giggled and laughed through the amusing pages. Yet, I found the author still maintained an air of yearning and passion.  Not a small feat!<br />The storyline is delightfully pure - a stuffy English Viscount and a beautiful, exotic woman. His attitude?  \\"Appearance is everything.\\"  Her attitude?  \\"Hogwash.\\"<br />The year is 1821, and in a Philadelphia pub two brothers sit and drink hard cider.  Spencer Law, the fifth Viscount Ravenswood daydreams and mutters about the maddening, intriguing Miss Abigail Mercer they recently met. After several mugs of cider, the normally reserved viscount even spouts love poetry.  His brother watches in astonished fascination and an idea is born.<br />Viscount Ravenswood returns to his uncluttered life in England. Weeks later, Abigail Mercer travels to England to begin her role as his viscountess. One problem, Ravenswood is not Abigail's husband or is he?  With this, Sabrina Jeffries opens the flood gates.<br />This talented author pens a cheerful, tantalizing book from the first page to the last.  Spencer Law is a man who does not know what he is neglecting; Abigail Mercer is only too happy to show him. She is an adorable heroine; she is perpetually upbeat and methodically waves her magic wand over the viscount,  the refined upper class, and the spellbound reader.<br /><br />Truly, \\"Married to the Viscount\\" is an amusing, sensual book.  Why not a perfect score?  Disturbingly, this reader felt a contemporary touch in some struggles and expressions.

Out there on the high seas, our lovers cornered in a world of sun, sea, and storm clouds.  Yes, pirate fantasies are usually irresistible, captivating, and often humorous.<br />With Rexanne Becnel at the helm, this book opened as a seductive escapade.  The author cast the charming Eliza Thoroughgood as her heroine. And for her hero, Becnel developed Captain Cyprian Dare into a tall, dark, handsome, turbulent man. A pirate, a smuggler, a sultry lover, and a man bent on punishing the nobleman who fathered him.  The romance plot -- Eliza Thoroughgood happened to get in the way of Cyprian's revenge.  Yes, a promising story, but did it live up to its promise?  No.<br />Rexanne Becnel lures the reader into a wonderful story.  The seduction scenes are slow and beautifully drawn. The sensual sea voyage is amusing and rewarding, but slowly the story begins to slip. Nothing the reader can put their finger on, it just begins to slip away.  As a reader, you wonder \\"What happened?\\" Then on page 253 a revelation unfolds.  This sentence, found halfway down the page, reveals all.<br /> --- \\"(Cyprian) . . . snatched up a jagged bit of rock, and flung it with all his strength at them.  At Eliza.\\" ---<br />Whoa, sadly, the reader realizes our robust hero is nothing but an overgrown child - a child who takes every ounce of Eliza's strength to nurture.<br />Finally, she grows tired of being sensible, and she returns home to her family.  Of course, what is romance without the hero going after her?  However, Cyprian's reappearance is excruciating.  Eliza's family discovers them in \\"a love nest\\" and no male relative puts up any confrontation!  That's right!  Instead, the unmarried Eliza invites everyone for dinner, to which the author treats all to a huge family squabble.  In the end, our couple is still unwed, Cyprian is still a smuggler, his father is still a jerk, and Eliza's parents are still a classy couple.

Immediately, she summons the viscount.<br />The audacity of Miss Pomeroy's commanding note fascinates Gideon Westbrook, the Viscount St. Justin.  Following a six-year absence, Gideon returns to Upper Biddleton.<br />Harriet Pomeroy is an insightful heroine gushing with innocent boldness.  Gideon Westbrook glides through the pages as a gruff hero radiating honor and dignity.  However, it is the humor the author employs which successfully ties the entire story together.<br />This is smooth reading with a pleasant romance involved; however, the story has limitations.  Personally, I enjoy a little more quiet lust before the actual grand event takes place and regrettably, the unending fossil theme grows tiresome. Nevertheless, the author has reached her goal with a charming book.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.<br />-- Historical fact:  In June of 1824, teeth found in Sussex, England, by the wife of amateur palaeontologist Gideon Mantell were examined at the Hunterian Museum in London.

Finding a fun book is always enjoyable, and this little novel was fun all the way.  It was quick reading, entertaining, and worry free.  I must confess this was my introduction to Sabrina Jeffries, and now I am eager to search for more of her work.<br />Jordan Willis, the Earl of Blackmore lives with a bitter outlook on love and marriage. They raised his mother to marry a title, his starry-eyed father only too willing, and their disastrous union trained Jordan.  Emily Fairchild is a prim, proper country parson's daughter.  Her parents were happily married and Emily too wants a marriage filled with love, she will settle for nothing less.<br />Through mistaken identity, our two contestants windup in the carriage of the Earl of Blackmore -- unchaperoned.  Immediately the earl accuses Emily of the marriage trap; the dignified Miss Fairchild laughs in his arrogant face.<br />With that lead-in, Sabrina Jeffries begins the reader's adventure.  She produces a game of wit and pretense.  A game filled with humor and cleverness.  The author writes Emily as spirited, courageous, and gives her the ability to bedevil the grim Earl of Blackmore.  Emily's tantalizing control, over the earl, is the story.  Jeffries fills the pages with sexual tension and delivers the hot goods.<br />The only drawback to this enchanting little novel, was Jeffries' final handling of Emily's nemesis. Here the story strained; the retaliation was too convenient.  Apart from that criticism, the balance of this fantasy is an amusing, heated book.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-19

Maybe the problem lies in the fact Mary Balogh's Regency Books are usually 225 pages or close to, while this endeavor stretches to 400 pages. This novel is a test of endurance for a Balogh reader.<br /><br />David Tavistock grew up protecting his stepbrother, Julian.  David loved him, shielded him, and covered for him. David Tavistock grew up loving their mutual childhood friend, Rebecca.  Rebecca grew up and married Julian.  David and Julian went off to war, only David returned.  He returned and married his brother's widow, Rebecca. Their marriage became a marathon of guilt.  In \\"Tangled,\\" Balogh pens a story about two people who do not communicate and her story exposes the consequences.<br /><br />The book's setting is Victorian England, an era engrossed in straitlaced thinking. Proper young ladies were taught that the marriage bed was a duty not a pleasure, and polite people were groomed to keep their uncomfortable concerns to themselves.<br /><br />The opening of the novel is in the year of 1854. Balogh furnishes an uncommon Victorian setting, during and after the Crimean War. This is an area in which Mary Balogh shines, she presents history but presents it entertainingly.  \\"Tangled\\" would have been an excellent novelette, but as a full-length project it is monotonous.<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-16

In \\"Red Rose\\",  Mary Balogh writes a beautiful romance, she fills the pages with touching words, thus encouraging her reader's attachment.<br />Some argue there is a fine line between love and hate; in these pages, Balogh capitalizes on this belief. Rosalind Dacey stands alone in life.  Her outlook: single she is, and single she will remain, despite her guardian's plans.  Edward Marsh, the new Earl of Raymore,  has another outlook: it is his duty to marry his ward off, and marry her off he will.  Two separate outlooks, two tug-of-war attitudes.<br />Mary Balogh sheds much light on the shaping of these two outlooks.  Rosalind believes no man could tolerate her disability, her dark hair, and her unfashionable full-shapely figure.  Edward Marsh hates all women, he wished to heaven he did not need them, unfortunately there is that bodily craving that has to be satisfied.<br /><br />For women, the early part of the nineteen-century was complex.  In the Regency era, men governed society and women had little control over their own lives.  Mary Balogh does a fine job demonstrating this point to her reader. She wrote an interesting book that is both entertaining and enlightening.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-12

Little James was born with an abnormality --\\"The mark of the devil -- probably from his mothers injures.  Fortunately, for the tormented Arabella, her jealous husband perishes. Regrettably, Arabella comes back to her father -- a nasty, violent man.<br />Arabella's sire, hoping to be rid of her, searches the land looking for a second husband. Her heartless father finds William of Blackleith, a giant of a man standing  six foot-seven.  William is the illegitimate son of a lord and a village harlot and has lived a life filled with sarcasm and ridicule.<br />When approached, William of Blackleith is delighted to wed Arabella of Byrum. He is thrilled with the union until he hears the rumors concerning her son's bloodline. Now he will not trust nor believe such a wonton woman. The reader painfully fights this concern with him, patiently waiting for William to give his love and understanding to Arabella and her socially neglected son, the small injured James.<br />At this stage of the book, Anita Mills decides to enhance the story further  she brings forth a false priest -- a fraud, a charlatan.  A man seeking revenge against William and his half-brother, Giles of Moray. To obtain his retribution, the counterfeit clergyman befriends the lovely Arabella, but cruelly treats her son with added contempt. This story is sad.

He implores Miss Mary Marsh, his sister's friend, to aid him.<br />The beginning of the book is slow paced, and this leisure tempo enables the reader to understand the characters fully. Mary Marsh, 29, is a spinster by choice. She is wellborn, but not of the noble class.  Mary makes her way in the world by designing lacy erotic ladies' undergarments. Thus, the path Ashworth draws upon to set up some of the romance.<br />Marcus Longfellow is gentle, poised, confident, and poetic. The morning following their first warm liaison, the Earl of Renn whispers softly:<br />---  \\"I learned something last night, Mary. I learned that in all of my thirty-four years, I've never once been given paradise. Oh, I thought I'd had paradise before, several times in fact, but I learned last night that I was wrong.

It bothered me that Mary embarked on a career designing erotic lingerie. Why?

The grand old earl must sire a male child -- an heir to his title.<br />Handsome, Gabriel Cristofore is an extraordinary artist. He is also a con man. His confidence game -- he seduces lonely, wealthy women. Lady Elizabeth Harcourt just happens to be his next mark.<br />I liked Elizabeth Harcourt. She sprang from the pages as intelligent and wise. Even though she has lived a sheltered life, she seems to know the score; yet, is willing to take a chance to add a little spice to her life. However, Gabriel Cristofore is an enigma. He was a philanderer, a cad, and after his liaison with Elizabeth did he truly reform? When I finished the last page, I wasn't sure Elizabeth made the wise choice.<br />Also Elizabeth's father is a riddle, his character is bewildering.  He seems kind and concerned with his daughter, when he ends her sexual affair; but he is so cruel to his child bride, Charlotte. If the author wanted us to truly despise this girl, she should have expanded further into the girl's persona.  Charlotte's eavesdropping at an upstairs stovepipe might be immature, but it is not revolting.<br />Still Holt's art of seduction is wonderful and I read this book with great gusto.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-09

Ah, Captain Drake, a ravishing gentleman, an English Baron, and a man honor bound to marry a scheming vixen on the morrow.<br /><br />Tonight, however, the game unfolds.  Captain Drake cannot take his eyes off the ripening Miss Payton Dixon. He has just become \\"painfully\\" aware that Payton has \\"developed\\" into a much desired lady. Cabot skillfully spins her words creating enormous fun.<br />I enjoyed this book. It is action packed, there is no arguing between the two main heartbeats, and the love scenes are steamy and sizzling.  If there is a serious complaint, it is the tomfoolery of Payton's brothers. At times, their behavior seemed moronic.<br />Overall, a great vacation book -- no worries, mate. Fluff, but oh such pleasant gossamer.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-08

With this work, Julia Quinn has tumbled into the writers' pond of thinking -- that the swells of conflict are the keys to remarkable reading. Ah yes, every romance reader's dream is to drag through three hundred pages filled with down and dirty quarreling all in the name of love.<br />Even with dry wit sprinkled throughout, the author's words are long and drawn. In this Quinn book, we find two people, who are the ages of 31 and 24, and they go at each other to the extreme.<br />Victoria is the nastiest.  This little shrew is supposed to be a vicar's daughter. I guess she missed the lesson on forgiveness.

She will not forget nor forgive the Comanche Indians that murdered her Spanish mother and stepfather.<br />Mills' has cast her hero as a rough, handsome, arrogant man named Clay McAlester. With the author's words, the reader visualizes a Clint Eastwood clone from his \\"spaghetti western\\" days . . .<br />-  &quot;He was facing her, his coat open, showing two gunbelts crossed over a collarless white shirt unbuttoned several inches at the neck. But it was the eyes that sent a shiver through her.&quot;  -<br />Clay McAlester may be a Texas Ranger, but the proud, powerful Comanche nation raised him; a fact Amanda Ross will not forget nor forgive.  Effectively, the author summons McAlester to rescue our testy heroine, from the clutches of a rejected suitor.  Despicable Ramon Sandoval abandoned the lovely Amanda, in the Texas wasteland, to die a slow death.  With her golden pen, Anita Mills guides her contestants to love, and guides her reader to the showdown. The story's ending is to savor; justifiably, puny Ramon and his father pay for their heinous crimes.<br />This western novel takes place during the year of 1873, and the author's words flow with ease and gentle speed.  This inexperienced Canadian lass enjoyed  eating &quot;prairie chicken&quot; over an open campfire, and  Mills' entire description of North American Indian food was a delightful revelation.  To punctuate respect, the author profoundly wrote Clay's struggle with the end of his proud people's way of life.<br />Originally, I read Anita Mills in a Christmas anthology novel.  From then on, I searched the shelves of the local book stores looking for her material.  \\"Comanche Moon\\" was the first Mills book I devoured, and I became a devoted follower.

Good heavens, Katherine may be a stranger to Russia, but she is a daughter of the upper English class!  This English lady is NOT a stranger to the aristocratic viewpoint!

Catherine Anderson provides a travel visa, whenever I pick up one of her novels. This author's location sketches are excellent. Her character development is exceptional, and immediately, her reader is hooked into her provocative storylines.  Usually, this author's heroines are survivors from some inflicted misery.  \\"Indigo Blue\\" is no departure from the Anderson blueprint.<br />The heroine is Indigo Wolf, her misery -- a violent attack by teenage boys.  She carries around enough sexual hang-ups to last a woman nineteen million life spans. However, I am a big Anderson fan, and I read Indigo's father's story in \\"Comanche Moon\\".  In that book, Hunter of the Wolf, was a powerful, intense Comanche warrior. To think he would allow a group of teenage boys to assault his daughter sexually and then get away with it - well -- IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN!!<br />I read this book with eagerness.  The death of Indigo's pet is heart wrenching material, and Anderson's portrayal of racial prejudice is insightful and direct; the power of hate and ridicule is eye opening. Although Anderson draws a touching story,  I was still frustrated with Indigo's sexual obstacles, this continuous abstraction results in the novel's \\"bog down\\".  This is a good book, but it could have been better.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-07

However, here I felt she was out of her element.  Heath's strong suit is her ability to weave her novel's location into a story. Her readers can feel the heat, the dust, the harshness, and yet experience the beauty of Texas. Sadly, in this book,  her genius was absent.  I never wandered through the English countryside nor did I explore the city streets and alleys of London.<br />Her character description of Rhys Rhodes, the Duke of Blackhurst, was such that he came across as a full-scale cowboy. With Heath's character breakdown,  I could picture this man slowly seducing our little spitfire, Lydia, on the LONELY western plains, but in the hallowed halls of his English mansion, the seduction never took shape.<br />Alas, not every romance book has to be set in jolly old England -- after all, the English didn't invent love. Please,  Lorraine, come home to Texas, and let your writing pen roam.<br />Lorraine Heath is an excellent author and I do love her books.

Not  long ago, I watched a special on \\" PBS \\" viewing the Viking onslaught into new territories, taking into account the tales of violence, plunder, and rape.

On a trading mission to York, Haraldsson encounters a beautiful, statuesque, redhead known as Zarabeth and the warrior wants her!  And Zarabeth wants him!<br />Now the issue, Catherine Coulter may have written a book but she didn't fill it with romance.  Zarabeth has the \\"smarts\\" of a turnip; easily her lustful stepfather manipulates her.  Sorrowfully Zarabeth rejects the marriage offer made by her dashing Viking warrior. With revenge and hatred, a subdued Magnus buys Zarabeth for his slave. Sadly, Zarabeth realizes Magnus Haraldsson has changed . . . .<br />---  \\"Zarabeth . . .

Anita Mills' character development is fabulous, and her use of historical enhancement is fascinating.<br /><br />Elinor Ashton's debt-ridden father sold the fifteen-year-old to the elderly, ambitious Baron Arthur Kingsley. The nouveau riche Lord Kingsley purchased \\"a possession\\", a display piece to impress the London upper class.  Applying rigid discipline, Kingsley turns Elinor, into the \\"Toast of London.\\".  A brilliant achievement, but nineteen-year-old Elinor feels unloved, undesired, and very unhappy.<br />With his young, beautiful wife, Baron Kingsley is the envy of every London nobleman and he basks in the worship.  Now the author exposes the novel's  theme --  the open courtship of Kingsley wife!<br />London's notorious rake, Viscount Bellamy Townsend is feverish in his pursuit of Elinor Kingsley.  Publicly, in the Almack's ballroom, even the notorious Beau Brummel refers to Elinor as the Earl of Longford's special \\"Venus\\".  Indeed Kingsley's own grandson, Charles, is captivated and mesmerized with our heroine.  Attention, attention, our heroine is married -- even if her husband is a jerk -- Elinor is still married - yet she engages in an open, blatant affair.<br />The magic, in romance reading, is the mystic world a reader enters.  Our heroines are usually innocent, pure in thought, and blameless -- not portrayed as adulteress women.

Always, Karen Ranney seems to write on the edge, usually drafting a grim tale.  \\"To Love a Scottish Lord\\" is fascinating material. The author establishes the book's focus in the early pages -- the cruelty of humankind.<br />Karen Ranney has the gift to write description. With this book, the reader resides in \\"Castle Gloom\\". The novel's beginning is excellent. I applauded the decision the heroine makes to remain with Hamish MacRae. Mary's choice was personal and totally selfish. Based strictly on her desire to discover and enjoy physical pleasure, aware of the consequences. This story idea was unique and distinct. I admired it. We were not dealing with a virgin girl here. No Mary Gilly was an experienced lover; yet, an air of innocence surrounded her -- how refreshing.<br />The initial storyline is serious -- an atmosphere of foreboding questions and answers. The love scenes are sultry and hot -- very adult reading. Found, in these pages, are a troubled man and a caring woman -- a woman who becomes the reader's champion. \\"Stay with him, Mary\\".<br />The beginning of Karen Ranney's novel is superb. Regrettably, somewhere near the middle of the story, the supremacy ends. Now the writing begins to crawl into a familiar storyline. \\"They\\" arrest and jail Mary. \\"They\\" wrongly accuse Mary Gilly with a bogus crime and the hero turns into the characteristic savior. What a shame!  From the middle of the book, until the last page, the words became an average romance, nothing spectacular, just filling space.

I'm not saying this book is phenomenal, but it is enjoyable.<br />Our heroine, Vermillion Lee Durant, is a trained connoisseur in the art of pleasuring a man. Throughout the lustful London male society, an unknown detail stays hidden -- Vermillion is only trained. As yet, she has not practiced her satisfying skills. She will remain a courtesan student until she turns nineteen; at the conclusion of this birthday ball, Vermillion will choose her first lover.<br />The youngest son of the Earl of Selhurst, Captain Caleb Tanner, a British officer, has been called back from the Spanish front. He is an expert horseman and will act as an undercover spy in the Durant stables. His mission is to uncover the traitorous traitor who has been leaking information to the Napoleon military.<br />I appreciated the length Kat Martin employed for sexual tension -- all the luring glances, aching desires, illicit kisses -- were paced for the reader's total enjoyment. Such longing earns the word romance.  The stable scenes are delightful. Gently written was the soft and assuring manner Caleb used to help \\"Lee\\".  Their competitive horse-race  \\"the contest\\" is assembled with innocence and fun. Martin allowed such tender moments to help the reader overlook the anxious times our two lovers are forced to suffer.<br />Kat Martin's two lovers may not see eye to eye, but at least, they are not fighting, demeaning, hating, and then regrettably making love - the usual Martin outline.  Kat Martin, if you are out there in author land, your writing skills are extraordinary, but please keep your war machine and arguing lessons in the skim mode.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-06

Ms. Balogh urges the reader to consider the characters' inner thoughts -- wishing us to believe these two quarrelsome people love each other! Unfortunately, the message is not delivered!  Even at the story's end, the reader reads the love declarations with uneasiness.<br />Briefly summed -- the tale of a future earl, Kenneth Woodfall, and a wild, independent, free-spirit, Moira Hayes.

Moira's denial of her pregnancy and her waning health are quite believable. The author favorably portrays the book's secondary characters.  Balogh has written Moira's betrothed, Sir Edwin Baillie, as a pompous, silly, flabbergasting man -- reminiscent of Jane Austen's  Mr. Collins from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".

The duke could not and will not marry Harriet as she is beneath his title.  Instead the lovers engage in a soiled liaison.  From cover to cover, Mary Balogh toys with her reader's sentiments. This is bittersweet romance at its finest.<br /><br />To enhance the story's spice, Balogh draws some delightful secondary characters.  The duke's great-aunt literally steals every scene she graces.

Jane Feather fills the novel with intrigue and devious schemes.<br />The setting is the late Georgian era. A time when frenzied male hedonism rules -- live big, play big. A time ravaged with over indulgence, whether it is food, drink, gambling or a brazen sexual encounter with another man's wife. I am always uncomfortable with adulterous themes, and I'm grateful few authors travel this path. Nevertheless, I suppose, in this story, it is a necessary ingredient -- an ingredient that bonds the contract our two characters have agreed to fulfill.<br />Jane Feather covers the era's historical view with careful planning. The author describes the prevailing fashions, the political views, and the distinct class divisions with superb detail.<br />Yet, I felt a problem with the book's outline. The author insinuates a strong sexual desire between our lovers, but the reader senses it is only a clever facade. We never explore true sexual tension.  The sultry cravings and lustful desires are missing.  The initial seduction scene is very uncomfortable -- it is murky and bizarre -- the hero drugs the heroine and then introduces her into an eerie sexual world.

The wonderful mood created throughout the book is the spontaneity of the story. The characters' impromptu reactions are both fun and refreshing. An amusing and interesting piece, no wonder the publishers reissued this paperback. I found myself chuckling over the silliest moment. This is lighthearted reading at its best.<br />Julia Quinn immerses the reader in the developing love story of a headstrong American heiress and a notorious English rake. Every secondary character in the book supports a master plan to bring these two charming people to the altar. These meddlesome players add to the richness of the novel's spirit.<br />Delightfully, Quinn displays an incredible female camaraderie between Emma and her lovely English cousin Arabella (Dancing at Midnight). Then the author enchants the reader with the delightful platonic friendship between these two ladies and Alex's dear friend Dunford (Minx). I realize these creative alliances set the stage for her sequel books.

Caution: lust and desire are sharing your first-class accommodations.<br /><br />The widowed Lady Vanessa Wyndham is a resourceful sister. The reprehensible Lord Damien Sinclair is a loving brother. To soothe family difficulties they become players in a provocative agreement. Nicole Jordan effectively negotiates the terms and the winner is the delirious reader. The sex scenes are electrifying, but the author never allows these scenes to drift from the story. This is the novels strength.<br /><br />Jordan does an attractive job on the personalities of her characters. Vanessa is strong, intelligent and kind. Although her first marriage was an ordeal, our heroine never appears the mangled 'butterfly'. This is refreshing. Damien is the typical English rake, but the author's handling of his reform is a gift to behold. Well done Ms. Jordan.<br /><br />The prologue is the book's major weakness. I suspect most readers enjoy a little foreplay before the heavy intimacy spills onto the pages. Unfortunately, in this book's introduction, the author shoves her unprepared audience, into the torrent, without a breath.<br /><br />The author saturates the final pages with immense activity. The reader is traveling at warp speed; warning, buckle your seat belt.  Viewpoint: Jordan should have slowed the conclusion and scrapped the prologue. Nevertheless, these are minor flaws. 'The Seduction' is a good book -- for the keeper shelf.<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-05

Usually Mary Balogh writes spirited stories edged in a romantic flare. However, here the pen was too harsh for that sensual burn.<br />Again, Balogh illustrates the wide line dividing English society during the Regency era. Ancestral descent is the key to unlocking the upper ranks of society, not the possession of money. Edgar Downes has wealth and middle class roots. Having achieved great success in business, this dynamic man focuses on London. His aim: to add a blue blood bride to his lifetime schedule. The widow, Lady Helena Stapleton, is a very perplexing woman. She is indifferent, aloof, and hate is her favorite word. The reader soon learns the lady's reserve stems from the inability to forgive herself for a past indiscretion.<br />Upon their meeting, we step into passion, a passion fueled with the seduction of romance. Just kidding! We step into passion, but Lady Stapleton has fueled this intensity with HATE, scorn and conflict.<br />The Stapleton Hate Draft Involving Mr. Downes:<br />I hated you, when I seduced you,<br />I hated you, when you apologized,<br />I hated you, when I carried your child,<br />I hated you, when we married,<br />I hated you, when we had sex,<br />I hated your kindness, I hated your understanding. Guess what? This lady hates our hero.<br />Balogh's point, The lady doth protest too much, methinks. Good grief! Mary Balogh by the end of your story, I didn't care who doth the protesting. Your heroine and her \\"H\\" word are just too unpleasant.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-05

In 2002, the author, Lisa Kleypas, revised the initial story and renamed it. The following is this reader's comparison.<br />Romance writing has changed during the last ten years. In this interpretation of the story, the author has ripened our characters' relationship by using friendship, humor, and attraction rather than Max's insatiable lust displayed in the earlier version.<br />Lisa Kleypas has written our heroine, Lysette Kersaint, as an intriguing woman, not breathtakingly beautiful as in the original, just a strong caring attractive person. Kleypas' pen allows Lysette to grow and become Maximilien Vallerand's staunch supporter and friend.<br />The author has toned down Max's personality. He is still a remarkable fellow, but is not the harsh angry man from the first edition. Furthermore, Kleypas has chosen to write Max enjoying an understanding relationship with his twin sons, rather than the unfriendly, demanding bond found in book one.<br />In this study, the writer chooses to explain the wicked Corrine Vallerand, as a woman stricken with a mental disorder. Following this interesting route, Kleypas presses for the reader''s sympathy rather than disgust for this disturbed wife and mother.<br />Even the loyal Vallerand housekeeper's, Noeline, has not escaped a revision. Here she emerges as a wise, well-spoken, poised woman. Even the description of Noeline's bloodlines is softly unveiled and gently drawn.<br />Comparing the two novels written ten years apart, I preferred this rendition of the Kleypas' story. The author has delivered a descriptive sensual story.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-05

A series based on four former officers, in the British army, who return to England as lifelong friends having survived the atrocities of war. Again, the author captures the period with excellent perception. The reader can sense the suppressed social times, the regency era when society stifled emotion and involvement.<br />Sir Nathaniel Gascoigne has come to London, for the season, toting his sister and cousin. Their mission -- to find husbands. Instead, Gascoigne finds a distracting lover, the widow of decorated army major.<br />Sir Nathaniel, a veteran from the Napoleonic wars, is not looking for a wife, only a few weeks of mindless pleasure. Sophie Armitage, a veteran from a sexless marriage, is not looking for a husband, only a few weeks of experiencing pleasure.<br />Thus, the rundown of a very melancholy read. Throughout, Balogh will have the reader in the doldrums. The writing style is distinctively Mary Balogh, but the format is so depressing.<br />The winsome repartee between Nathaniel's cousin, Miss Lavinia Bergland and Eden Wendell, Baron Pelham -- the last of the famed four horsemen -- grants the reader a few sparkling moments. I wish the author had fabricated a true \\"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\\" series and developed a sole book for Eden. His story -- in particular, if Ms. Balogh had chosen to base the romance on the amusing banter found within these pages -- would have been a marvelous end to an otherwise somber series. Tragically, the author has reduced our most likeable and final horseman to a diluted finale found within these pages.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-05

To boot, Lisa Kleypas can write a sex scene, grown up material, exciting without being offensive. But a perfect book? No.<br />Jack Devlin is a big time publisher. He oozes sex appeal, he attracts people like bees to honey, and he earns money hand over fist. He may not be a Lord of the English realm, but he is a \\"lord\\". Amanda Briars is a plump, passable, 30 year old spinster, who happens to write successful novels. For their first encounter, the author uses the clever idea of mistaken identity. Amanda confuses Jack for a gigolo she hired for a night of personal pleasure. A birthday gift, for herself, commemorating her big 30. And oh what fun! Jack soon realizes the error. Amanda is left in the dark. Trust me; the reader will so enjoy this passage, it will be read again.<br />Lisa Kleypas does wonderful things with Jack's character, I loved her idea of the sexy, soft Irish accent, the silky Gaelic words he tenderly whispers. Sigh. Yet, the sketch of Amanda remains cool, she didn't bewitch this reader. I felt no intense feeling for this lady; Amanda walked through the part. And the obvious \\"Take advantage of the kind, sympathetic Charles Hartley\\" was a horrible writing strategy.<br />This reader's wrap up:<br />* the beginning of the book was innovative.<br />* the affair was fun -- steamy and sizzling.<br />* the idea of Amanda's life style and her editorial run -- far too progressive for the era.<br />* the book's atmosphere felt contemporary.<br />* the last fifty pages were anticlimactic.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-05

Whether the chat was held between the lovers or their friends, there is just too much of it. There is no doubt Quinn can write a book. Her characters are likable and the reader wants to read about them; unfortunately, there is not enough story to hold this package together.<br />Problem areas: Lord John Blackwood, possesses a black soul. However, Blackwood's dark secret is revealed far too early to keep the reader's waning attention. The \\"shocking\\" unveiling of Blackwood's so-called sin doesn't justify his colossal guilt. This reader wanted to shout, \\"Enough already -- Get over it!\\"<br />I also found the storyline frustrating -- filled with too many loose ends. One such example: The reader and Lady Arabella take considerable time, to select the perfect seduction gown. Yet, when the evening arrives and Lord John Blackwood (our intended victim) appears at the ball, the author chooses  to underplay (ignore) this titillating dress. Good grief -- nineteenth century England -- Belle's blue velvet dress has no back (bare skin is exposed)  -- should not our harden Lord, or other men, be drooling? Commenting, leering, begging for dances -- men doing something!  The huge build up over the dress selection and nothing -- the reader is left to flounder.<br />The book's finer moments: I did like the poetry sprinkled throughout the pages. This was a delightful gesture by the author to plant romance. I appreciated the touch.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-05

I liked this book. When I first started reading this material, I was apprehensive. I suspected it would be a book about revenge -- a cruel, retaliation read. However, I was wrong. It wasn't. It turned into a story of nurturing passion. Although, Jordan's sex scenes are explosive, I was pleased Ms. Jordan did not relinquish this story to a \\"Susan Johnson\\" clone. Instead, the author delivered a story of harboring love. The tale of two people who meet seven years after a brutal breakup and slowly begin again.<br />Jordan's untangles the story of a grandfather's cruel manipulation, the effect such heartless maneuvering had on two lovers. Then she highlights the remaining story with intrigue surrounding French spies and English traitors. Yet, the main thrust of the book is the scarred love story.<br />Although this book is a sequel in the Jordan series \\"Notorious\\", fortunately it can stand alone. The character that reappears, from a parent book, plays a small role. I liked this consideration. The reader was not forced to read a repetitive historical storyline pulling the entire series together.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2004-02-05

I'll go out on that well-known limb and take my stand, \\"This book was just ordinary.\\" I suspect it would have made a good short story, but as a full length novel it suffered. The beginning was captivating, it held my attention, but somewhere along the way the story began to stumble. The book was too long for the ungarnished storyline.<br />The novel opens well - a duke callously murdered and his legitimate heir framed by an unscrupulous brother. The question the reader ponders throughout the book was \\"why?\\". What pressure, what insufferable issue, compelled a brother to hate and despise both his father and his sibling? Unfortunately, the author never answers the question.<br />Moving on, the novel continues to intrigue the reader. Years slip away and the falsely accused hero, Jason Sinclair, returns from the depths of misery. His mission: to clear his name, take back his realm title, regain his honor, and appreciate his freedom. To strengthen such a feat he must kidnap and imprison the novel's heroine, Velvet Moran. Now we have the recipe for spice -- a remote hunting lodge, two very attractive people, and hours of quality time together. Now this is the stuff for that long Canadian winter. But alas, the secluded adventure is short lived, unfulfilled, and sadly, the end of Martin's catchy storyline.<br />Kat Martin slides into the land of :<br />Our hero has a past.

When the clock struck the second hour after midnight, I forced myself to finally close the book.<br />Using great skill, Anita Mills takes the captivated reader to Regency England to the great city of London, in 1815, before social reform. Mills handles the enchanted tour guide role with amazing simplicity. This author provides an educational access into Newgate Prison; enabling the reader to smell the wretched stench, feel the pitiful despair, and witness the inmates' hunger and hopelessness -- astonishing.  Ms. Mills has categorized several elements of human failing for the reader: greed for money and political power; the longing for social position; and finally lustful gratification. Certainly, the ugly side of mankind.<br />Throughout the chapters, Mills paints our two main characters using a fine tip brush, expertly weaving her words, and forming Patrick Hamilton, the brilliant London barrister, and the beautiful Elsie Rand.  The love scenes are full of passion and sensuality.<br />Incredibly, this writer holds no punches with her storyline. The evil participate in the hideous crimes, displayed throughout the story,  is guilty -- as her reader acknowledges.  Still, Mills holds her captivated reader spellbound -- waiting for the expected plot twist.  It does not happen and because it does not happen, Mills allows her book to soar to a higher position.<br />Yes, Anita Mills is a talented author. Do try the library, or your local used book store, to find a copy!  My copy is definitely headed for the keeper shelf.

Lord Edgar Rawlings, is the second son of a deceased duke and does not want the available duchy; thus, he begins his search for his nephew -- the misplaced Jeremy.

Subsequently, a grave reading disappointment surfaces with the writer's treatment of Edgar's loyal friend, Alistair Cartwright.

Morgan Bedwyn is intelligent, strong-willed, and she bulldozes her way through society's strict rules.  However, kindness and affection also influence this leading lady's personality.  In \\"Slightly Tempted\\", Mary Balogh has successfully developed a favorable young woman.<br />Gervase Ashford, the Earl of Rosthorn, has acquired a life long enemy -- Wulfric Bedwyn, the Duke of Bewcastle.  Callously seeking revenge against his arch enemy, Ashford chooses his weapon of retribution -- the lovely Lady Morgan Bedwyn, the virginal sister of the celebrated Duke of Bewcastle.<br />Scornful vengeance may have activated Ashford's feelings toward the charming Morgan Bedwyn, but soon his passion changes into fondness, friendship, and finally love.  The author slowly develops this ardent intensity; yet, Balogh never bores her reader with her lingering pen. Forgiveness and understanding become the story's centralized theme and draw a satisfactory path to the story's end.<br />Also impressive, the description and feelings the writer conveys circling the days leading up to the Battle of Waterloo.  Again Balogh's vivid words are both informative and interesting but never boring, a history lesson the reader can relish.<br />This is a good book and I look forward to continuing with the Bedwyn family saga in Balogh's next two installments.

Anita Mills triumphs again with this passionate story based on forbidden love, medieval warfare, and glorious chivalry.  Set in 11th century Normandy, this is an intense novel of epic proportions. Many great noblemen intensely pursue the beautiful, young Eleanor of Nantes. But it is to Roger FitzGilbert to whom she surrenders her heart, the one man she is forbidden to love.<br />The book opens with preparations for a festival staged by Gilbert of Nantes, Eleanor's disappointed father.  He is disappointed, in the fact, Eleanor was born female. Painfully wise, Eleanor has accepted that her parents neither love nor enjoy her. Instead she gains comfort from her half-brother, Roger.  Closer than other siblings, the two are inseparable.<br />The party arrangements are underway, and even William the Conqueror and his son, Prince Henry, arrive for the celebration.  Forthwith, amused with the spirited Eleanor, William agrees to discuss a betrothal contract, with Gilbert of Nantes, on behalf of his besotted son. Infatuated with the young beauty, the prince will offer marriage, love and friendship to the exquisite Eleanor.<br />Also attending the feast is one of the most elite villains ever conceived in romance reading -- the wonderfully written Count Robert of Belesme.  On this festive day, Robert, a nobleman's son, pledges he will have Eleanor for his own.

Your latest novel is easy to read, and easy to like.<br />The story begins with a cruel ultimatum; a young mother must select which of her twins she will raise.<br />Years slip away.  Merrick Welbourne, the crown prince of Meridian, traveling through northern Scotland, is seeking answers; however, he comes upon a greater entanglement - his identical twin, Ian.  Chloe Simon, a physician's daughter, despises Ian MacEwen and solemnly vows, today, she will make him pay for his sins; however, she too comes upon a greater entanglement -- the incredible Merrick Welbourne.<br />Crosby's story is entertaining, but very light reading.  The author dallies in the story of a \\"Robin Hood\\" highway man and his gang of compassionate thieves.  The unselfish brigand is none other than the wealthy Ian MacEwen.  MacEwen's criminal pursuit advances the secrets surrounding the entire storyline.  An intriguing idea, but unfortunately when the reader closes the final page, the story is even more mysterious than when it began.  Room for a sequel?  Positively. Harlequin even gives the reader a sneak preview, but alas, this is here and now, and I want reading satisfaction not loose ends.<br />In spite of, Ms. Crosby is an easy writer, and her books are enjoyable.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2003-12-08

Writing this review is very difficult, for to write the story's essence would be to give away plot spoilers. So, I will resist the temptation to ruin the novel for another reader.  The talented Lisa Kleypas always writes her male and female characters as clever, sensual, and very straight forward.  These qualities support the winning Kleypas formula. Yet, in this book her female character, Larissa Crossland, the Countess of Hawksworth is simply a bonehead.  Her attitude -- \\"Woe is Larissa\\".<br />Once married to the loathsome Earl of Hawksworth, Larissa felt no remorse when he died.  However, the earl, Hunter<br />Crossland, has returned, and Larissa is none too pleased.  After all, his resurrection will undoubtedly ruin her freedom. The reader soon learns the man that has returned to Larissa is not the man to whom she was once married.  This current husband is kind, loving, and very considerate, and now the question looms. Is this man an imposter or has Hunter simply changed for the better?  Of course, the reader has the answer well in advance to Larissa's awareness.<br />Onto the plot's pivot.  Sadly, the reader begins to detect, that our heroine is nothing short of a skilled manipulator.  Larissa devises ways to get what she wants.  She teases the earl with her body, promising kisses and further physical discoveries, in return, for his political and monetary favors. All the while, whimpering, over the fact, her husband was once a horrid lover, and therefore, she does not want to endure another round in the marriage bed.  Alas, this is the same woman who prides herself on her caring docile nature. Giving hope and kindness to the destitute of the land, but to the man who is only gentle and loving toward her, this protesting wife is harsh and thoughtless.<br />Yet, this is a romance book and the idea of the story is to get Larissa to fall in love with Hunter.  She begins to realize he is a wonderful man, kind to the orphan boy they have taken in, kind to her wounded sister, kind to the household staff, and exceedingly kind and devoted to her.  Larissa's ice shield begins to melt, and slowly she sees Hunter as a friend and lover.  Finally, the story blooms with love and all is well.<br />Oh, no it is not!  Chapter 18 surfaces and with it the realization of what a nitwit Larissa truly is.  This heroine sets forth to accomplish the most foolish thing this reader has ever perceived in romance reading.  STOP.  I will not give it away.  Nevertheless, let us just say; Larissa's deed is so frustrating; I wanted to hurl the book across the room.<br />Of course, contentment is found in the end, but to get through chapters 18-21 is a burden.

Lorraine Heath has crossed over to the modern era, and as a diehard historical reader, it was Heath's talent that lured me to buy this contemporary novel. A mistake? No way this lady is dexterous.<br />A few years back the Coke guy from the soft drink commercial was all the rage, smoldering and heating his way into a woman's fantasy. Well hello Jack Morgan. If guys in Texas are this \\"hunky\\",  I'm packing my bags.<br />This is the story of two reunited people and their chance to love again. Jack Morgan was the town's bad boy. In his senior year, ready to give up and drop out, Jack met and fell in love with Kelley Spencer -- young, beautiful, fresh out of teachers' college, and his teacher. Kelley Spencer gave him a reason to try. She promised him a life after graduation. Fate intervened, Jack married another, and Kelley left town. Nine years have past, Kelley is back in town, Jack is now the police chief and divorced. Nine years have past, but their problems continue to fester.<br />\\"He splayed his large hand and strong fingers over her stomach. \\". . . the scar Kelley . . . Was it my baby? . . .\\"<br />Within these pages, Heath has developed the ultimate male -- smooth, gorgeous, kind, considerate -- do these men exist? Yet, at the same time, the author has developed our heroine, Kelley Spencer, as a \\"heel dragger\\". The girl is terrified to commit. This man wants her and she hides under a blanket of secrecy. Still, the storyline is skilled and entertaining. A rating of 4.5 because Kelley Spencer's shackles are too heavy, her complexity was like a sore thumb -- front and center. Nevertheless, I liked the book -- definitely a page turner, and you can wager I will be searching for Heath's newest book come April 2004.<br /><br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2003-11-28

Her romance heros are consistently tall, physically attractive, self-disciplined, and  nine times out of ten unbelievably wealthy.  In other words, the ideal romance hero.  Anderson's leading ladies are usually cute, generally patterned after the girl next door,  and nine times out of ten have a history of torment.  In other words, the girl needs his help.  In \\"Seventh Heaven\\", Catherine Anderson sticks to her recipe and prepares another romance delicacy.<br />Joe Lakota, an award winning high school and collegiate quarterback, was destined for the big times.  This all-star athlete had the world by a string, including the sweetness girl in town.  Marilee Nelson lived in a sheltered world.  Her family protected her with love and Joe Lakota idolized her.  Unfortunately, all too soon, her world came crashing down. Brutally, she was persuaded to sacrifice Joe Lakota.  Instead Marilee Nelson chose to protect him by ending their lifelong friendship and love.<br />Ten years have slipped away and Joe Lakota has returned to the small Oregon town, of his boyhood; where he will raise his small, vulnerable son -- the small Oregon town Marilee Nelson still calls home.  Joe Lakota may have returned home but not to the once naive Marilee Nelson.<br />In this story, Catherine Anderson has created a lovely page turner, but it is, at times, slow going.  Marilee has some grave  hangups and periodically the author delivers the healing with a painful pace.  Nevertheless, this is a good book, but \\"Annie's Song\\" is better, if you have not read that Anderson classic, do run out and get a copy.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2003-11-27

The beginning is excellent; it is sad, humorous, and extremely lustful.  Rexanne Becnel catapults the reader into the dreadful life of a small, confused boy -- the product of one man's libertine behavior.  After finishing the prologue, the reader recognizes the nightmare of a child's world filled with darkness and turmoil. The years pass and that little boy has turned into the scandalous Ivan Thornton, the reluctant Earl of Westcott; now he parades through life, flaunting naughty conduct, and generally ignoring the decorum set forth by England's upper class.<br />At 28, Lucy Drysdale thinks herself a learned scholar, and relishes the opportunity to travel to London.  However, the opportunity comes with an attachment; she is to be a chaperone.  Nevertheless, Lucy hopes to find the time and the freedom to engage in stimulating lectures and intellectual conversation; instead Lucy finds the rude, ill-mannered, devilishly attractive Ivan Thornton.<br />Here Becnel's writing talent shines.  She develops great humor and creates jovial flirtation scenes. Ivan Thornton's role as society's bad boy is spicy and Lucy's reluctance adds to the reader's enjoyment. The anticipation, building toward their inevitable pairing, is all the fun.<br />Unfortunately, when their momentous joining occurs, it brings the destruction of the story's merriment.  Ivan becomes cruel to Lucy. Now the reader watches, as our once heroic heroine accepts her husband's distasteful behavior.  Why would an intelligent woman allow this treatment?  Alas, this is the story's focus.  Lucy sees herself as an intelligent modern woman.  Therefore, she analyzes his every rotten exploit and then accepts the nonsense. For the reader, this conformity is such a let down, as we witness this once fiery woman's anemia.<br />Tediously, in the epilogue, we discover forgiveness is in abundance and everyone lives happily ever after. Too bad the finale didn't appear immediately after the coupling scene.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.scene.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2003-11-25

This love story is wonderfully written and wonderfully enjoyed. Balogh pulls the reader into her passionate story with her usual flare.  This is the tale of the mysterious Catherine Winters, and the overpowering, bored Rex Adams, the Viscount Rawleigh.<br />Catherine is a compassionate woman living in the rural setting of Bodley-on-the-Water.  She fills her peaceful days giving music lessons, baking for the sick, and reading to the elderly.  Her only companion, in life, is a little terrier dog.  Viscount Rawleigh is visiting his twin brother's country estate; he is titled, rich, handsome, blas&eacute;, and mistakes an innocent smile for a sexual invitation.<br />What is the story's true success? Mary Balogh does not allow our lovers to dwell in confrontation.  Instead she chooses to tantalize her reader with the mystery surrounding Catherine Winters' past life.  The author controls this intrigue with captivating skill, and when it  comes to captivation, Balogh is in her element. The result?  The reader is unable to put down the book.<br />Catherine's story is heartbreaking and her confession draws the reader to the edge of sadness. Viscount Rawleigh is the ultimate in a romance hero; he stands by his bride, and proceeds to rectify the injustice.  Balogh wrote an incredible ending, with satisfying results.  The villain got his just reward.<br />A rating of 5 stars, to me, suggests the book is perfect; however, I felt there was one stumbling block. In the end, was Catherine's father truly in her corner or not? And, if he was, why not the heartfelt begging of her forgiveness? It may not be a perfect story, but it does come close!<br />Oh, how I love a good book and this is a good book.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2003-11-24

I understand Morgan O'Connor had a hard life, but romance must be the paramount purpose in a romance book, and here  . . . it is absent.<br />At a young age, Morgan O'Connor was forced to be his brother's keeper - a brother who rejected life's responsibilities. Lady Elizabeth Stanton, disinherited, has fled England, and come to Boston to accept Nathaniel O'Connor's recent marriage purpose. Discovering the absent Nathaniel deceived her with lies and pretense, Elizabeth must now consider the somber proposal Morgan is offering.  Elizabeth does accept the inevitability and hesitantly she surrenders to this dismal man.<br />Unfortunately, their relationship and, in particular, the sex scenes are forced and nasty leaving this romance lover uncomfortable.  One disturbing example: when Morgan angrily confronts Elizabeth with his suspicion of \\"brotherly sharing\\", the blameless Elizabeth acts out the role of a \\"seasoned courtesan\\".  Yup, I'm sure that's one way to convince a man of your innocence?<br />Samantha James does attempt some tenderness.  She gives, Elizabeth and Morgan, one blissful week, in a secluded love cottage.  However, this reprieve is short-lived.  Upon their return to Boston and the realities of life, Morgan is again dark and irritable, and Elizabeth simply pushes the right buttons to get his displeasure raging.  Her naive tactlessness, her obtuse behavior,  and their shared ability to jump to the wrong conclusions are relentless.<br />In the concluding pages, Morgan's understanding slowly arrives, but it is too little, too late. What a shame,  for I  found the author's writing to be free and easy.  It was the storyline that was dreary.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2003-11-24

She is rude, indifferent, and boorish to our hero. The second twin, Amanda, is beautiful, spoiled, and shameful. Our poor, poor hero, Chad Kinkaid - whatever is a man supposed to do? Fear not, Chad's sixth sense kicks in and he knows Marian is the one! Why? Who the devil knows?

The setting is the middle ages -- bewitched times -- strange superstitions reign high. Many believed twin births were the symbol of evil -- the sharing of a soul.

Lady Taylor's daughter, Rose, drifted through the pages with innocent charm and humor. Furthermore, the author kept an abundance of social detail moving through the book. She covered everything from genteel etiquette to the living and working conditions of England's lower classes; yet, managed to offer these sordid facts using remarkable wit and insight.<br />Definitely keeper material. I will invite Lady Holly and Zach Bronson to join the select desert island book bag.<br />Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.	2003-11-17

Unfortunately, this book is a comedy of errors that dispenses total frustration for the reader.  Miss Catherine (Kitty) Gordon, a 1st generation American, is in England -- her mission to  salvage her cousin Jessie's undeveloped life.  At the tender age of 16, Jessica Merriman, caught in a compromising situation, was forced to marry the elderly Baron Haverville.  Six  years have past.  Jessie, abandoned to the English countryside by her husband, has found another love. Fear not, cousin Kitty has a plan -- she will abduct the beastly baron and demand an annulment.  Little does Kitty realize, the old baron has died, and she has kidnaped his heir - the dashing, attractive Red Jack Rayne - England's respectable war hero.<br />Sounds promising - it is not.  I was disappointed.  Anita Mills is one of my favorite authors, but this book missed the grade.  It is an endless muddle of lengthy debate and idiocy.  As a reader, I guess you discover the good and the bad.  Usually this writer delivers the \\"good\\" to which I am grateful.<br />Grace Atkinson.	2003-11-15

Anita Mills processes the technique to pull you into a story, hold you, and then disappointingly unlock you at the uninvited conclusion. Simply worded -- I didn't want this story to end. I wasn't ready. I wanted to stay in the nineteenth century, to linger in the English countryside, and to go on with the charming characters.<br />An absolutely wonderful storyline. Anita Mills has tenderly written the story with poignance. The tale of three childhood friends tangled in the web of deceit. The primary plot -- the evilness of one monstrous woman and the dramatic effect it yielded.<br />Helen Delacourt, the Dowager Duchess of Roxbury, so despised Joanna Milford, her son's precious wife, she created a means to get rid of her. This malicious woman accused the innocent Joanna of adultery -- a heinous crime in Regency England -- the misconduct of adultery with their childhood friend, Gareth Sherwood, Earl of Carew. Sadly within a year of her marriage, Joanna stood mute, judicially tried, scandalously divorced, and driven from England.<br />Six years pass, Joanna is a widow and must return to England. She longs to give her two sons English heritage. Visiting the haunts of her youth Joanna unexpectedly encounters her first husband, Adrian Delacourt, the Duke of Roxbury. Shockingly, Adrian realizes he has never gotten over his first and only love, despite her suspected betrayal. Even more astounding; Joanna has her eldest son walking with her. One look at the boy and the duke understands he lost far more than a wife and a friend six years earlier. He also lost his son -- his heir.<br />Eventually, good fortune shone down on me. I found this book in the bargain bin at the local used book store - \\"A ruby in a mountain of rocks\\". Who would dispose of this enduring gem? Not this girl -- this is a keeper. When the Canadian winter settles in, and the hours loom long; I will open this book again.<br />Grace Atkinson.	2003-10-21

It is just a small Signet Regency Romance novel -- but what entertainment.<br /><br />Harriet Rowe was a spirited, precocious young girl; savoring each new day, until her father married the wicked stepmother. Exposed to constant unhappiness and discipline the enthusiastic little Harriet grew to be a dull, drab woman. Nonetheless, into her life, reappeared Richard Standen, the Viscount Sherborne, her childhood friend and playmate. He came bearing gifts -- charm, kindness, and a bright future for Harriet.<br /><br />Sadly, when I reached the end and turned the final page of this book, I desperately wanted to keep reading, I wasn't finished with this novel's rapture. I am at a loss, why the Penguin Group stopped publishing this writer's regency treasures. I realize sex did not control the base content, but the storylines were/are superb. If you ever happen to find one of these short novels, written by this talented author, grab it and run.<br /><br />Definitely a keeper. I will read this heart wrenching tale again.<br /><br />Grace Atkinson.	2003-10-21

In the dreamy world of adolescence, Lady Madeline Matthews dreams of dashing from the schoolroom into the bed of the  mysterious actor Logan Scott.  The impenetrable Logan Scott moves in the beautiful world of money, women, and status.  Madeline Matthews is an innocent girl fleeing a bleak future.  She becomes a junior seamstress in his theater and Logan becomes aroused.  She helps actors with their lines and Logan becomes aroused.  She helps with the theater's correspondence and Logan becomes aroused.  Logan Scott cannot ignore the divine Madeline Matthews; instead he tries to ignore his constant state of arousal.<br /><br />Lady Madeline's innocence charmed this reader; the young woman and her demeanor are delightful.  However, I felt a more mysterious woman should have seized the secretive Logan Scott. This is the same haunting man, who first appeared in Kleypas', \\"Somewhere I'll Find You\\".  Within those pages, the author intrigued her readers -- depicting a puzzling, secretive individual. C'est la vie, Lisa Kleypas had a different viewpoint and this is her paperback.<br /><br />Granted there is not much of a story found within these pages, but Kleypas can write a silky, sensual novel and I do appreciate her method of writing.  She never grinds her work into a state of uneasiness and apprehension. Instead, as an author, she eases the reader through the storyline, a unique gift which provokes this Canadian lass to buy her novels.<br /><br />Grace Atkinson.	2003-10-20

This story is fascinating, either the author has exhausted herself with research or she has first hand knowledge in the theater -- it is that convincing.<br /><br />The Marquess of Savage, Lord Damon,  is searching for his obscure bride. Married as children, Julia Hargate and Damon Savage were united  to further family advantage. Now the marquess wants to explore the future of this unacquainted marriage. The faltering detail: his marchioness has become the infamous stage actress -- Mrs. Jessica Wentworth.<br /><br />Ms. Kleypas writes a worthy story, the drawback -- Julia's endless hesitation; I realize she wants to be free to live her own life but the story drags because of her indecisions.  This reader was fixed firmly on Lord Damon's side; he is hunka hunka burnin' love material.<br /><br />The author arranges a superb supporting cast.  Damon's shameless mistress and her fabrications strengthen the storyline.  Damon's brother, William, supplies the necessary sibling suffering.  Yet, it is Julia's mentor and friend, Logan Scott, who steals the role as \\"Best Supporting Actor\\".  Ms. Kleypas draws his character to perfection -- intriguing her readers with his eccentric lifestyle.  Sequel?  Believe it!  This reader will explore the bookstores looking for \\"Because You're Mine.\\".<br /><br />A tempting book, but the heroine's anxiety is the main thrust of the story and thus is its downfall!<br /><br />Grace Atkinson.	2003-10-20
US	25613486	RYZ13BSN1B75A	0517006200	816661059	Magnificent Passage	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Plentiful	From what I can detect, this is the book that launched the very successful career of Kat Martin.  Published in 1988, and no longer available through the main stream,  I found my copy while searching the shelves in a little used bookstore.  By my reaction, you would have thought I uncovered the \\"Hope Diamond\\" in the salvage.<br /><br />Martin draws a simple, bountiful love story. The novel is action packed and she kept this reader turning the pages. Yet, it is far from being perfect.  The hero, Travis \\"Hawk\\" Langley, is a jerk.  I could not bring myself to enjoy his company.  He is rude, cold, and then grows sexually aroused whenever he is not being rude and cold.<br /><br />Samantha Ashton, stationed with her father in the Dakota Territories, is an innocent looking for adventure.  She discovers it on an outrageous journey to and from California.  An endless trip that sees her pose as a governor's daughter, almost meet Brigham Young, stand naked in the mountains as foul men leer and fondle her, lose her virginity, nearly drown in the San Francisco Bay, then seized and savagely dragged across the mountains by renegade Indians, married by means of an Indian ceremony, returned home and again subject to a brutal assault<br /><br />Whew, a lot of bang for your buck in this novel.  However, Kat Martin does entertain. There are problems, but reading this you can experience the writer on the initial stage of a great career. A good beginning.	2003-10-13

In his desolate cave, survives the lonely, guilt-ridden Ewan MacAllister who fears no man only his guilty conscience. A vigorous warrior, who cherishes his mother, enjoys strumming music, and finally encounters the delightful Eleanor ingen Alexander of Canmore -- a little chatterbox. Here lies the story of a pleasing imp who innocently brings our hunk to his knees -- all in the name of fun reading.<br />That is exactly what this book is -- fun. A light, fluffy read. However, though the book is enjoyable, I felt it missed the boat, maybe the story is just too light!<br />This is the third book in Kinley MacGregor's tales of the MacAllister highland men; and in this novel the characters are engrossing -- bubbly Eleanor \\"Nora\\" is a ray of sunshine, though she jabbers nonstop, most people appreciate her company. Ewan MacAllister is a sad man, he burdens his daily life with his brother's suicide, and many people avoid his company. \\"Oh, east is east, and west is west, and never the twain shall meet.\\"  Wrong! Our Little Miss Sunshine meets Mr. Gloom and sunshine rocks his world.<br />This novel might have missed the proverbial boat, but the book is a comfortable read and it does continue the robust lord chronicles. Here MacGregor keeps many unanswered questions afloat and therefore, brilliantly sets up the continuation in the MacAllister legend. And guess what? This reader will buy the next segment, my only request -- a life jacket!	2003-10-11
US	25613486	R3188R7U63TS7C	031298460X	529940744	Complete Abandon	Books	5	4	4	N	N	To Make Whole	Don't be deceived by the hilarious beginning; this well-crafted book is hardly a comedy!  Amazingly, Cheryl Holt plays with the reader's every emotion. She unwraps love, joy, sorrow, hate, and then throws in sexual prowling as an added bonus. Bravo Ms. Holt,  what an exhilarating roller coaster ride through human endurance.<br /><br />John Clayton, Viscount Wakefield, suffers with the company of artificial friends  - \\"hanger-ons.\\"  He is rich; they are pathetic.  He is attractive; they are fascinated.  He is influential; they are unimportant.  He permits their company; they oblige him.  So rests the worthless life of a self-centered viscount.<br /><br />Emma Fitzgerald, a deceased vicar's daughter, is astute, spirited, and extremely poor.  What started as a humorous liaison, between these two mismatched people, quickly becomes a fragile bond.  Sadly, their intimacy has no gratified future; Emma is far below Clayton's social view and position.<br /><br />Further enhancing her story, Cheryl Holt touches upon more human shortcomings.  Rustling through the pages is John's offensive mistress, his tolerant fiancee, and his bastardly brother.  Emma, too, has her life sharpened with a fresh, delightful sister, a vile admirer, and the daily issue of destitution.  Oh what a twisted web the author has brilliantly woven.<br /><br />The novel's weak points: the lengthy deliberations, in and among key scenes, are distracting.  Such pondering, by the characters, weakens the scene development.  Additionally, the author did not soothe the Clayton brothers' relationship.  Their future friendship was uncertain -- an unanswered curiosity.  However, this confusion and use of sexual language, that at times,  seemed too modern are insignificant objections.  Cheryl Holt has written a creative story that captivates her reader's interest. Well done.	2003-10-11
