If you loved &quot;Warrior's Woman&quot; and &quot;Keeper of the Heart,&quot; then like me, you were anxiously waiting for Dalden's story.  In a word, the book was &quot;pathetic.&quot;  There was just too much story, and absolutely no chemistry between the characters.  Who really cared about the whole conflict of the inter-worlds?

Some people have criticized the author for not being scholarly enough, but as he himself says in the book, this book was not written for that purpose.  He's telling the story of 1066 and the Norman Conquest, and he does a darn good job.  I myself get bored when I read so-called scholarly books that drum out the facts in a ho-hum fashion.  I much prefer Howarth's friendly approach, and I greatly appreciate his opinions.  It is up to the reader whether to agree with him or not.  I for one also feel that had I been alive at the time, I too would have like Harold, disliked King Edward, and been terrified of William.  I suggest you read and buy this book!	2000-10-16

This is an excellent little book--exactly what I've been waiting for.  I've always been very fascinated with the Anglo-Saxon period, but most books on the subject are rather tedious.

This book is filled with factual information, but because Sir Frank Stenton also lends his sagacious opinions the book is both enjoyable and easy to understand.  This book is several hundred pages long with tiny  print, and so packed with information, that you'll know everything possible  about Anglo-Saxon history.  Stenton always prefers the probable to the  outrageous and does not seem to go with the popular opinions about kings,  queens, or events.  You must read this, but only if you're really, really  interested in the subject.  Otherwise, it'll go right over your head.	2000-06-17

When I first saw how short the novel is, I thought that it would be an inaccurate love story or something.  Nothing further from the truth.  Harold II is portrayed in a very harsh and  realistic light--not at all glamorized as he usually is in other books.  He  is seen as both ruthless and kind, hardened but human.  The author has done  a brilliant, fantastic job!	2000-06-15

I've read a lot of biographies on Elizabeth I of England, but this one is the most thorough and interesting.  Writers usually get too bogged down in either factual detail or into scandals/myths. Weir does neither.  She  simply conveys all of the important stuff any one would want to know.  I  also liked how she explained what Elizabethan England was like, how people  thought, and what their customs were.

I read what the self-proclaimed &quot;immature&quot; reader wrote, and I beg to differ.  I love this book not because I'm supposed to, but because I just do.  The austerity of the language, which you term &quot;dull&quot;,  is what sets the whole tone for such a troubling work.  I doubt that Bronte  set out to write a classic romance; I believe she was denouncing the sins  of her characters.  This novel is multi-faceted with its never-ending  parallels:  two houses (Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange), two love  stories, two heroes, two heroines, two narrators, etc.  The inexplicable  love that two heartless people like Heathcliff and Catherine share is  fascinating to say the least.  When Catherine cries out, &quot;Nelly, I AM  Heathcliff,&quot; I'm sure many a girl's heart has thudded in her chest.  This book sweeps you away to a place and time far removed from us and gives  us a view into a harsh and distant world.  You don't have to like the book.  But don't be so dumb or immature as to assume that no else does either.  The longer you study literature, the more you'll see that some books have  passed the test of time, because, well, they're just that damn good.	2000-04-25
