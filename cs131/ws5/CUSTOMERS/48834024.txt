Book 2 is far better than book one.  Mr. Anthony had to spend most of the first book setting the stage and explaining how 2 people from the 21st century suddenly find themselves transported to another place and time.  Grace and Travis are back again and this time the action is intense and fun.  The story is alittle disjointed and the plot twists are alittle silly, but overall, it's a fun read.<br /><br />This is not a Stephen Donaldson series by any means, but give the guy a chance, there are 4 more to go.  Maybe he just needs to find his pacing.<br /><br />Grace and Travis are reunited in Eldh along with Durge; our ever faithfull knight, Aryn; our council to the King, Falken Blackhand; the bard, and a cast of many fun and interesting folks.  It is alot like watching reruns of the original Star Trek series, where at the beginning of the show, there were always a couple of people you had never seen before and you always knew they were the ones who would be killed, thus setting up the rest of the show.<br /><br />Grace, Travis and friends are battling a plague, not unlike the black plague on earth.  Will they be able to save Eldh before all fall victim to the terrible death?  Read and discover for yourself	2005-10-06

They are a wonderful way to escape the real world and enter into an alternate universe and realize you don't have it so bad after all.  This is another of those books.<br /><br />Amara is a former Princess of Egypt who has been dead for 4000 years, she only has one fault, she won't stay dead. Amara is on a mission and anyone who stands in her way will well, they will die to regret it!!<br /><br />One of the things I so enjoy about Laymon is his realism within the horror fiction realm.  Most writers always give wonderful happy endings to their horror stories, not always so with Laymon.  He also isn't afraid to kill off the good guys or helpless children and animals, but isn't that the way horror should be?<br /><br />Crack open the cover, sit back and escape to the world of Laymon horror, you won't regret it.	2005-10-06

I have a 50 page rule, if the book hasn't captured my attention within the first 50 pages, well, it's just not worth my time.  There are too many wonderful books out there waiting to be read.  I gave this book twice my usual attention because I really like Lincoln Child, but it was just too technical to be fun and after 100 pages, I was still bored to tears.  Maybe it got better on page 102, who knows.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone looking to be captivated from the very beginning.	2005-10-06

This book was filled with rich \\"sherlock holmes\\" style story telling and fit the period nicely, but it had too little action for me and I found it too boring to finish.

It didn't happen that way at all. Erin and Jacob are scientists and former lovers who go their separate ways after Jacob is involved with a situation that questions his medical ethics.  Years later, Erin has adopted a child, and that child is gravely ill.  Erin has devoted her life to the medical research that can save her daughters life.  Just when a pay-off is in sight, Jacob comes along and destroys the sample that will save the child.  Now roles reverse and as Jacob and Erin race to try to be the first to reach the last specimen of its kind on the planet.  Whose ethics are in question now?  You be the judge.<br /><br />The book was somewhat boring and silly.  Even if Jacob believed Erin would unleash a terrible epidemic on the planet, he could have found a way to safely help her perform her research and see if her theory was correct.  It was just so unbelievable.  This is certaintly not the worst book I have ever read, but there are so many great medical thrillers out there that you really shouldn't waste your time on something so sub-standard.	2005-10-06

While staying in a hotel after selling some of his art work. Dylan wakes to find that he and his brother have been injected with a strange substance that won't kill them but can certaintly get them killed if the men in the black SUV's get ahold of them.  While fleeing these men, they run into a woman; Jillian, traveling with her pet jade plant, Fred.  Jillian has also been infected with the same substance and now the three of them are running for their lives trying to stay away from those chasing them and all the while trying to discover what and why.<br /><br />The story is fast paced and fun.  It is a work of fiction after all and some of the plot is kind of silly and far fetched.  The characters are well developed and Koontz does a fantastic job keeping Shep true to form through out the whole story.  Many questions from Dylan and Shep's past are also answered during their odyssey.<br /><br />All in all, it's another enjoyable read and worth the effort and time to get through it.	2005-10-06

A burning house, three dead bodies and a missing baby set the stage to once again plunge Lindsay, Jill, Cindy and Claire into another case of murder and suspense.  These three women have been to hell and back together and have grown and matured.  I love the way Patterson has developed these heroines and has invested enough time and effort into each personality that you care about what happens to each of them.<br /><br />  This time the girls are dealing with a killer who strikes every three days and it becomes a race to try to catch the killer and keep the body count at a minimum.  On top of the frantic need to catch a murderer, one of the women is harboring a deep, dark secret, that will prove fatal.  Which Murder Club member is it and what will happen to her?

His characters are believable and his stories are riveting.  This one will not disappoint you.<br /><br />Gus Wheatly is a very busy attorney who has become so involved in his own life, he has shut out everyone who loves him and is out of touch with what is going on in their lives.  One day, he gets a distressed phone call from his daughters school stating that his wife has failed to pick up their daughter and he needs to come get her.  He is annoyed with this interruption in his life, but he is in for a much bigger interruption when he discovers his wife has disappeared without a trace.<br /><br />Women who look like his wife start turning up dead, and their daughter receives a phone call from her mother.  Is Beth alive or is this some kind of sick joke.  No ransom notes arrive and Gus, along with the police, is left wondering if his wife is involved with the murders.<br /><br />The book is fast paced and is never boring.  I found it hard to put down.  This is another winner in a long string of winners for Grippando.  If you are a fan as I am, you will love this one.  If you are new to his books, give this one a try.  You will find yourself at the bookstore or library looking for his other novels.	2005-10-06

It would be really easy to write way over our laymens heads, since he is a doctor, but he seems to always be aware of his reader's limited medical knowledge and writes accordingly.  His books are packed with mystery and suspense.  His characters are always interesting and believable.  Critical Condition delivers like all his others.<br /><br />  Dr. Sullivan has a stroke and wakes up to find that while she is totally aware of her surroundings, she is trapped inside a body that will not respond.  The only way she is able to communicate is by blinking her eyes to yes & no questions.  Her lover, E.R. physician Richard Steele is desperate to find a way to help restore her life to normal.  There are doctors at the hospital that have been experimenting with stem cells, and they may be able to help, but at what cost?  When things don't go the way these physicians planned, will Dr. Sullivan be capable of making those around her understand there is a plot to kill her?<br /><br />  This was an exciting book.  It was hard to put down. It was hard not to panic while reading Sullivans reaction to finding herself unable to move, or speak.  She can't even breath on her own, and I had trouble breathing just reading about her panic.  Clement doesn't waste alot of time mincing words or piling on page after page of \\"filler\\".  He gets right to the heart of the story, making your heart beat faster in the process.  Pick this one up, you won't regret it.	2005-06-27

It is post 9/11, the pentagon has been repaired and now the construction crew has been asked to stay on and complete a huge renovation project.  While everyone is at lunch, a contruction worker stumbles onto a suspended animation canister that contains a creature most horrible. Needless to say, the construction worker becomes lunch!  The creature is now loose and on a mission.<br /><br />  This may sound dull and boring, but it was one of the best horror/suspense books I have read in quite a while.  Maybe it's because the story is just so well written.  The premise has been done before, but there is a fresh take on this plot.  It was exciting, at times funny, and suspenseful.  I found myself not wanting to put it down.  The story flips back and forth from the WWII era to the present and it all ties in together at the end.<br /><br />  Another kudos for the author was how well he created and developed his characters.  They were people you know or have come in contact with.  There was no huge hulking hero that flew in at the 11th hour to save the day, and whether the book had a happy or sad ending depends on what side of the fence you found yourself on.<br /><br />  Give this book a try, I read a lot, approx 2-3 books a week and horror is my favorite.  This book will leave bring you on the edge of your seat, wanting to rush head-on until the end.	2005-06-26

The problem I had with it was how confusing it was to try and keep track of who was who and what their role in the story was.  The techno/medical terminology was a tad challenging, but not impossible.  The story was all too frightening considering what is happening in the world today.<br /><br />  This book gave the reader alot to think about and was more thought provoking than entertaining.  Keep that in mind before you buy it.  Overall, it was a good book and I don't regret reading it, but I would prefer Robin Cook, Tess Gerritsen, Michael Crichton, or Peter Clement.  These authors can put together suspense/mystery/medical thrillers that are enjoyable and easy to understand.	2005-06-25

This is the second in the Nightside series, and it is every bit as good as the first.  I love the way Green can spin a yarn that is frightening, funny, gory and original in thought and plot.  I also appreciate how short the books are, he gets right to the point and doesn't waste time being wordy just to produce a 500 page paperweight.<br /><br />  You can find all manner of creatures in the Darkside, but one you will definitely meet is John Taylor, P.I.  He has an uncanny knack for finding things, anything you might be looking for, and a few you aren't.  His father is a human and his mother is....well, we don't know yet.  Neither does John.  This is one of the questions we get alittle closer to answering with each new book.<br /><br />  This is a mixture of horror, sci-fi, mystery, comedy.  Green has a way of blending it all together into a smooth concoction that is easy going down.  Give it a chance, I'm sure you will enjoy it.	2005-06-25

I was so looking forward to the book coming out, but I was sadly disappointed with it.<br /><br />  The premise of the story was fine, Dr. Alex Delaware receives a scrapbook in the mail containing murder scene photos. These photos bring back haunting memories to Delawares friend, Milo Sturgis, who is a homicide detective.  As a matter of fact, these photos look familiar.  This was a great way to start the story, and I was hooked, but soon it all became confusing with too many characters and in a effort to keep the identity of the killer secret til the end of the book, the plot got fuzzy.  I usually love his books, but he missed the mark on this one.<br /><br />  If you are reading Kellerman for the first time, don't get this one.  If you are a returning fan, skip this one and use the 8 bucks for something better.	2005-06-24

There are some funny moments and some cute dialog between the two cousins, but overall, it was a somewhat boring read.  The story got old quick and I had a hard time paying attention to what was going on, or even caring for that matter.  The one plus is it is a nice book for someone who would prefer not to slog through a lot of useless, gratuitous sex and vulgar language.  I guess to be fair, I need to try another of this series before I judge too harshly.  If you are looking for a fast paced, exciting, sit on the edge of your seat mystery, this is not the one	2005-06-24

I can't follow her storyline from the bad editing job.  Her plots are confusing and boring.  Her character is not a believable person, and acts in such a way that would not be tolerated in real life.<br /><br />Jenna McLaren shows up in Vicky Lucci's office asking Vicky to help her.  She has been declared dead.  Is she the victim of mistaken identity, or did someone believe they had indeed killed her?  The answer is \\"who cares?\\"<br /><br />I tried really hard to stay with this book, but about half way I decided life is too short to waste time on something you could care less about.  There may be a group of people who really love Ms Proulx's books, but I am not one of them.	2005-06-24

It starts out as a good old fashioned haunted house tale, every town in the U.S. has an old dilapitated house that all the kids in the neighborhood are convinced is haunted.  Three young boys watch the destruction of just such a house and steal a brick from the demolition site.  Bad move boys.  It all comes back to torture them years later.<br /><br />  The story had me so hooked, I couldn't put it down to eat.  I just wanted to push on to the end, but half way through it got stupid.  The boys grew up and a house was built on the exact same site and evil came home to roost, along with some definite confusion.<br /><br />The story had so much potential, and it was still an ok read, but if Ms Giron had just hit the mark, this could have been a huge hit.  How some things took place and why were left a mystery, and I don't want to ruin it for you in case you love the book.  I just feel too much was left out and not explained.<br /><br />  Is it worth reading? Yes. Could it have been better? Absolutely.  Will I read another book by her?  You bet.	2005-06-24

This book was a huge disappointment for me, it is not one of her best.<br /><br />  Rachel lost her fiance, Thomas, ten years ago in a plane crash.  She has been mourning him this whole time, wondering if she will ever find love and be truly happy again.  Suddenly, she notices a man hanging around that could pass for Thomas's twin, but anytime she tries to get close, he just disappears.  Is it Thomas, or his ghost?<br /><br />  I was hooked at this point and looking forward to another great story by Hooper.  Unfortunately, the book went down hill from there.  The plot was confusing and hard to follow, and Rachel was such a shallow character that I really didn't care what happened to her by the end of the book.  Ms Hooper missed the mark on this one, and I am a fan.	2005-06-24

Unlike alot of horror novels which contain blood, gore, and graphic violence, Hell House sneaks up on you in a quiet, subtle way.  It's eerie, fast paced, and fun.<br /><br />  4 people are hired to stay for 5 days in a supposed haunted house referred to as Hell House, owned by a man named Emeric Belasco.  Belasco used his house to promote excess and human depravity.  Drugs and alcohol were plentiful, and those who followed him lost their minds. Eventually, the house was broken into and everyone inside, 27 people, were found dead.  Belasco was never found.  Lionel Barret; a parapsychology professor, his wife; Edith, and 2 mediums; Florence Tanner and Benjamin Fischer are given 5 days to discover if Hell House is really haunted and if so, by whom.  Let the games begin.<br /><br />  Things go bump in the night, voices are heard, bedding rises up in the air, taking shape as though a human is hiding under it.  Record players play by themselves and rocking chairs move with no one sitting in them.  It is a roller coaster ride into the supernatural.<br /><br />  The characters are all human and believable.  They are just as scared as you or I would be, given the same circumstances.  No one is a hero.  They just want to survive the 5 days, collect their money, and get out, alive. Can they do it?  Will they all leave alive?  This is a fun book.  I really enjoyed it and am sure you will too.	2005-05-23

It is the first by this author I have read, but since finishing this title, I have purchased the sequel and can't wait to dig in.<br /><br />  The story is about a group of people who are born with violet colored eyes and a special talent.  They can communicate with the dead and lend their bodies and minds as vessels for the dead to communicate with the rest of us boring, \\"normal\\" folk.  Violets are used to communicate with long dead, famous artists, poets, musicians, etc.  Imagine a painting by Van Gough long after his death.  True talent never truly dying.  Violets are also used in law enforcement such as at trials where they summon the victims to return and bring forth evidence against the accused.  As you can imagine, this does not sit well with everyone, and thus, someone is hunting down violets and killing them.<br /><br />  The author has a fresh new concept.  He did a great job explaining the life of a violet and even envisioned stumbling blocks in their lives, just like normal humans have.  They are not superheroes.  They have everyday problems to tackle also.  Everything in life comes with a price tag and the life of a violet is no exception.  The story follows FBI agent Dan Atwater and violet Natalie Lindstrom as they race against time to find a killer.  The characters are well developed and believable.  The story moves at a rapid pace, doesn't bog down, and you just sense the author always knows where he wants the story to travel.  When the killer draws near, will Natalie \\"see\\" it coming?  This one is a winner folks, enjoy!	2005-05-21

Ms. Gwen Hunter has hit the mother lode with this character.  She has done a superb job in creating warm, believable, caring, fun characters.  Each with their own individual personality, and she never deviates from that.  Each character stays true to itself and you can tell who is doing the talking without the characters name being mentioned just by the way the dialog moves and the choice of words used.<br /><br />  The county coroner is accidently shot and Rhea is chosen to fill in.  This is not something that makes Rhea happy, and when she finds out that the person responsible is none other than her two timing sometimes boyfriend and cop, Mark Stafford, well, all hell breaks loose.  You see, Mark had a one night stand during a time when he and Rhea were on the outs, and now the woman is pregnant and claiming Mark is the father.  How will Rhea ever get over this?  Can she and Mark patch things up?  We may never know, first they have to survive a couple of serial killers.  Young girls are being kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered.  The bodies are then buried in a strange arrangement.....well, I don't want to spoil all the fun.<br /><br />  Dawkins County is lucky to have a doctor like Rhea Lynch.  She's smart, funny, and talented.  She's warm and friendly.  She also seems to attract trouble.  Ms Hunter has written herself another great novel.  Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed.  The only complaint I could come up with was I got tired of the supposed rivalry between Mark and Eli.  They both want Rhea, who will win?  It got to the point where I didn't care.  Otherwise, this is a first rate story.	2005-05-21

I was slightly disappointed with this book.  It was a nice, easy, quiet read.  It contained mystery, suspense, and even a ghost.  I guess you would call it charming.  Once I resigned myself to the fact that this wasn't a James Patterson style novel, I was able to enjoy it a bit more.<br /><br />  Emerald O'Brien owns and operates a china shop in a quaint little town.  She is raising 2 children on her own due to divorce.  Emerald has a talent not everyone in town shares, understands, or appreciates.  She can communicate with the dead, and one morning she finds a ghost in her bedroom.  Thus starts our adventure.  The ghost implores Emerald to help bring the murderer to justice.<br /><br />  If you enjoy mild suspense and violence, then this is your book.  There isn't much to offend anyone in the book.  The book is also short and very easy to read.  If you want something light and fun, this book is for you.	2005-05-13

It started out great and fizzled about half way through.  The author had an original idea for a storyline but didn't seem to know how to keep the momentum going.<br /><br />  The premise of the book is a species of man has survived and blended in for thousands of years, biding their time till they could take over the planet and rid it of all homo- sapiens.  It's almost impossible to tell the difference between the species unless you know what to look for.  Artie is a homo-sapien who is caught in the crossfire and is in a race with time to find out what is going on and hopefully put a stop to it before it's too late.<br /><br />  This book is not a total waste of time, but it lacks excitement and depth.  After reading 2/3 of the story, you find yourself wanting to just put the book down, but you have invested time and the story is just interesting enough that you trudge on to find out how it ends.  I certainly wouldn't buy this book new, if you can get it from the library, at least you will only lose a little time, not money, to read it.	2005-05-13

Brian Keene shows his talent as a horror writer.  His characters; Frankie, Jim, Martin, and Colonel Schow are realistic and come alive on the page.  The battle between good and evil not only takes place between human and zombie, but also between human and human as humanity faces extinction.<br /><br />  I don't want to give anything away and spoil it, but the meat of the story is that an event has taken place in the world that causes the dead (animals and people) to reanimate.  This is a fresh change over the usual zombie story in which only people come back.  Another switch is the dead have the ability to think and learn, plot and organize.  They are not your typical zombies stumbling slowly about eating unsuspecting humans.  Jim is divorced, and has a son by his first wife living several states away.  His second wife(who is pregnant) has died and reanimated. Jim is living in a bomb shelter he built before y2k.  When his young son calls and leaves a message on Jim's cell phone, Jim sets off to reach his son and save his life.  Along the way, he meets good and bad, those who want to help and those who want to enslave.  You will meet characters you fall in love with and root for and those you want to reach into the pages and strangle.<br /><br />  The ending is a shocker and has a dramatic effect.  I loved it and hated it at the same time.  Pick this book up, you won't be sorry.	2005-05-02

I would have given it minus 5 stars if I could have.<br /><br />  Lisa and Brad have been trying to have a baby for years. Finally Lisa becomes pregnant and is going to break the great news to Brad during a romantic getaway weekend.  En route, Brad ticks off another driver and finds himself under citizen's arrest for reckless driving.  While he waits in jail to be arraigned, Lisa is kidnapped by the angry driver and taken to a remote location, where she is informed she will be the victim of a snuff film.  When another woman stumbles onto the property, the kidnappers rape, sodomize, torture, and kill her while filming the whole thing in front of Lisa.<br /><br />  I was disgusted but wanted to find out if Lisa made her escape.  I made it to page 130.<br /><br />  The author introduces a homeless woman who has a 2-month-old daugher.  The men kidnap these two and proceed to rape the baby and even EAT some of the baby's body in front of her mother.  They do horrible things to the mother before killing her also.  This was just too much for me.<br /><br />  I love a good horror novel.  I enjoy being scared.  I do not enjoy being repulsed and nauseated.  I have to wonder about anyone who could enjoy reading this depraved, pornographic pulp.<br /><br />  If you enjoy reading about the sexual torture and  brutalization of a baby, then this is your book: Enjoy.  If you find yourself sickened by that idea, don't bother picking up this book.	2005-04-26

It's not often a book starts with such a bang and is able to maintain the momemtum to the last page.  Desert Places is such a book.<br /><br />  Andrew, a famous horror author gets a letter in the mail instructing him to call the phone number included in the letter by a certain time period.  If he fails to comply, the police will find a dead body,buried on his property, murdered with a knife from Andrew kitchen and Andrews blood on the body.  Thus starts the ride of Andrews life.  Will Andrew survive events that are about to take place, will he trade places with the killer, or will he lose his life in an attempt to stop the madness?<br /><br />  This book was exciting, suspenseful, and frightening.  Without giving all the fun away, let's just say that Andrew soon discovers exactly what a human being is capable of under the right circumstances.<br /><br />  Blake Crouch has created two characters who you find yourself cheering for and hating.  He keeps you on the edge of your seat by keeping the action moving and fresh.  The story never bogs down.  Crouch avoids the trap of becoming repetitive and boring.  He gets right to the meat of the story.<br /><br />This is a book that is well worth your time.  Dare to enter the desert with Andrew and be prepared for the ride of your life.	2005-04-26

This is the second book I have read by Lisa Gardner and her writing style hasn't let me down yet.  The Killing Hour is a story of Kim Quincy, a FBI trainee whose father is also an agent.  Her father, Pierce, is somewhat of a legend and Kim desires to be at least as good as her old man.  Kim has been through alot in her life, including the murders of her sister and mother, and has some major issues to overcome.  She finds herself teamed up with Special Agent Mac McCormack to catch a serial killer who kidnaps two victims at one time.  He/she immediately kills one victim and uses their body to leave evidence and clues as to where the second victim, still alive, is located.  If law enforcement is quick enough, they have a chance to save the second victim.  To further the intensity, Mac has knowledge of the killer's methods which no one else has.  Is Mac a man desperate to bring a murderer to justice or is Mac the killer himself?  The race is on.<br /><br />  Ms. Gardner is a pro with character development.  She takes her time and brings out the best, and sometimes, the worst in each one of them.  The two stories I have read thus far also show great attention to detail and story development.  She thinks ahead and allows her stories to flow with ease.  She is quickly becoming one of my favorite mystery/suspense authors.  Give The Killing Hour a try, you're in for a treat.	2005-04-23

It was more Harlequin romance than horror.  Don't get me wrong, it had its moments but it certainly isn't Clegg at his finest.<br /><br />  Julie Hutchinson's husband, Jeff \\"Hut\\" Hutchinson has been murdered, leaving her to raise their daugher; Livy, and Julie's step-son; Matt by herself.  Not an easy feat considering Hut's body has disappeared from the morgue and Julie's experiencing Hut coming to her in the night and having his way with her in ways he never did while he was alive.  To make matters worse, Matt is acting strange and slightly violent and Julie doesn't know how to help him.  Livy swears she is having conversations with her father via her \\"brain radio\\", and you thought you were having a bad day!  A man claiming to have the answers, as well as, psychic ability, enters Julie's life but does he really want to help or does he want to destroy her and her children.<br /><br />  The story had a lot of promise but needed better storyline development.  The characters past could have been explained more clearly, which would have helped the end make more sense.  Once Hut accosted Julie in her sleep, it wasn't necessary to keep describing what he did to her everynight.<br /><br />  The bottom line for me is I just didn't \\"get\\" this one.  It may be a great book to some, but to me it was thrown together and lacked the kind of depth I have enjoyed with Clegg's other books.  If you are looking for sex, pick up this book, if you are looking for great horror, don't bother.	2005-04-23

A \\"virus\\" is plaguing a percentage of the population and this \\"virus\\" causes some to have an extreme allergy to sunlight, silver, and wooden stakes.  Funny, but when I was growing up, we called these people \\"vampires\\".  Enter Ms. Sookie Stackhouse.  Sookie is a barmaid at Merlottes and she also has a special talent, she can read minds.  After saving a vamp from being drained of his blood, which is supposed to have special powers and is sold for high dollar, she falls in love with him and discovers she can't read his mind.  This is a great news to Sookie.  Finally she can date someone who won't insult her just by the thoughts in their heads.  Sookie, suprisingly, can't read Sam's mind either. Curious, Sam isn't a vampire, is he?  When people start dying and the vampires are being blamed, it's up to Sookie to defend the man she loves and catch the killer before he/she catches her.<br /><br />Ms. Harris has created a wonderful cast of characters that are original and fun.  They come alive on the page.  It is fun to watch them grow and develop right before your eyes.  There is a lot of story in the short 260 pages.  It's packed with mystery, horror, humor, and heart warming moments that will remind you of a small town and it's inhabitants.  The only problem I had with this book was I got tired of the sex between Sookie and Bill, her vampire lover.  Once Ms Harris described a scene to two, we got the idea, move on.<br /><br />I enjoyed the uniqueness of this book.  It will appeal to alot of people on many different levels and reading genres.  Ms Harris has a hit with this one.  So snuggle up on the couch with your favorite beverage and enjoy this one.	2005-04-15

Ms. Hooper writes in such a way that is so very easy and enjoyable to read.  Her stories just flow, with no awkward moments.  She has a special talent for writing suspense novels that also contain romance without getting overly mushy with the romance part.  Her stories always leave you guessing until the end.<br /><br />I find no need to rehash the story, you will discover that on your own when you read the book.  Let me just say that this last installment tells FBI Agent Noah Bishop's story. It has been a long time coming.  He is psychic but has remained a closed book to us readers until now.  In previous books, he has appeared to be quite arrogant and seemed like a real ass, but this book brings out the best in him and we get a better feel for the man he really is.  This book contains romance, suspense, mystery, paranormal phenomenom and a touch of humor.  It's a great blend and is well worth your time.<br /><br />Ms Hooper writes about the paranormal in such a way to make it all believable.  She doesn't go overboard with it.  I highly recommend this whole series.  It would be a good idea to read  them in order to get the full effect.	2005-04-10

Everything flows, there are no odd moments where he seems to be struggling with the plot or storyline.  This book kept me on the edge of my seat, as have all the other books by Mr. Laws I have read.<br /><br />This book is about revenge, trust, and friendship.  A group consisting of 6 guys and 1 girl travel a road together, first in friendship, lastly in revenge and horror.  I don't want to give anything away and spoil it for you, but this is a keeper.<br /><br />I have read a couple books by Mr. Laws and have never been disappointed with any of them, but this is by far my favorite to date.  The story moves at a break-neck speed and is must for horror fans.  Give it a try, I think you'll love it	2005-04-03

I found with this book, people either loved it or hated it, there wasn't any in-between.  I am one of those who loved it.<br /><br />A young man is buried alive and years later, comes back to exact his revenge.  The story was a cross between night of the living dead and Dr. Who!<br /><br />This book had much to offer.  The story moved along nicely, without any odd moments.  The author didn't waste a lot of paper describing unimportant things just to have an epic novel.  I like that in a book, just get to the point.  The characters were believable and well developed.  I find people are much too hard on horror writers.  It's fiction at its finest and at no time needs to be believable.  It's purpose is to entertain, and having said that, let me assure you that Mr. Brown did a bang up job entertaining this reader.  It was not overly technical or hard to follow.  I loved the book and hope you will too.	2005-04-01

I had read the back cover and was intriqued by the premise of the storyline.  I went home and quickly sat down with a nice cup of coffee and started reading.  The story was great, the characters lovable, there was mystery, humor, and a wonderful sense that this book had a lot to offer.  Boy was I mistaken.<br /><br />After introducing all the characters and the fun of 2 book characters suddenly showing up in the authors living room, there were about 30 pages of fun while the characters become accustomed to our century's way of life, the story just became bogged down.  The problem was the story just kept repeating the same stuff, over and over.  It got so boring I wanted to throw the book in the trash, but was already commited to finishing it.  The ending didn't get any better.<br /><br />While not a complete waste of time, I wouldn't recommend this book if you have something else to read.	2005-04-01

After reading the back of this book, I found myself ordering the whole series (6), and I'm not sure that was a wise move.  I am going to have a positive attitude and reserve any harsh judgement until after I read the second book.<br /><br />Beyond the pale is about 2 earthlings, a bar owner and an E.R. resident who find themselves sent to a different world full of ancient gods, monsters, sorcery and warriors. What a rude awakening to find there is no deodorant or modern bathroom facilities anywhere to be found!  Travis and Grace have been sent to this weird wonderful world to help save it and in saving this strange new planet, they will hopefully save earth as well.<br /><br />The story starts out great and exciting, but soon fizzles out as character after character is introduced, and the world is described in great detail.  This is necessary in order for the reader to understand the storyline, but is rather monotonous.  Please do not think this is a bad story, it's just the first in a series and alot needs to be explained.  Hopefully, the next book will spend more time on actual story development.<br /><br />If you love fantasy/fiction, you will probably love this book.  It is well written.  If you are new to this genre, give it a whorl and if you are not sure, give the second one a chance.  I plan to.	2005-04-01

All of them featuring Joanna Blalock as a forensic pathologist and her on again off again lover Detective Jake Sinclair as a pair of super sleuths.  Dr. Blalock doesn't miss any clues left behind by the murderers, and try as they may, there is no stumping her.  I was finally fortunate to find the book that started it all and I must say the first is as good as the rest.<br /><br />Dr. Goldberg creates believable characters, realistic bad guys and uses just enough medical jargon to make the story interesting but not enough to confuse or bore a reader unfamiliar with the world of medicine.<br /><br />Women are dying at the medical center Dr. Blalock works at and one of the victims is a friend of hers.  She proceeds to work tirelessly and meticulously to find the killer, leaving no stone unturned.  She is up against hospital administration who is worried more about public opinion and reputation than doing what needs to be done to find the killer.  Dr. Blalock will have none of that, her only concern is to assist Detective Jake Sinclair in bringing the murderer to justice, and in the process, finds herself falling for him.<br /><br />This is a great story, filled with suspense and mystery.  You will feel as though you are riding a roller coaster through twists and turns until the book comes to an end.  This is a good one and well worth your time.	2005-03-07

It's not really a mystery or horror or suspense.  It is a tale of a woman who allows a man to enter her life and then he proceeds to try and destroy it by making others doubt her sanity.  It is difficult to share much of the book without ruining it, and I don't want to do that, it is too good a book.  Let's just say that once our heroine decides she has had enough and wants to get her life back, the way she does it and the end result is breath taking and tackles the reader without the reader seeing it coming.<br /><br />This is a book I would recommend to anyone, male or female.  It contains elements of mystery and suspense.  It deals with human fraility, as well as, cruelty.  You are shocked and appalled at the lengths Brendan will go through to hurt Miranda and turn those she loves against her.  He does this in such a believable way.  We all have known a Brendan at least once in our lives.  You will cheer as Miranda fights to gain her self respect back, and your jaw will drop as you read the last 2 chapters.  Give this book a try for something completely different and refreshing.  You won't be sorry.	2005-03-06

This is one of the better suspense/mystery novels I have read for a while.  The writing is excellent, the characters are well developed, and the plot is an original one.  One of the reviewers complained about the language, but the book is dealing with a pychopathic/schizophrenic looney who probably isn't going to say \\"darn\\" or \\"shucks\\".  Mr. Ames really put alot of effort into keeping his characters true to their natures.  Some authors start out with a character acting or speaking one way then suddenly change personalities half-way through the story.<br /><br />This story is disturbing, exciting, creepy, and will keep you on the edge of your seat with a can of raid in your lap!  It's a wonderful work of fiction that will keeping you reading long past your bedtime.	2005-03-01

It was a hard story to follow and fully comprehend.  Some would call it a \\"thinking mans\\" horror story.<br /><br />The book started out exciting and frightening and full of booga-booga, then after about 100-150 pages, it became hard to follow.  The story started bouncing back and forth, from past to present and one character was someone else from the past.....<br /><br />I had a hard time keeping track of who was who.<br /><br />If you love the type of horror written by Layman, Little, Laws, or Bailey, to name a few, you will probably not care for this book.  If you are looking for something new, different and off-beat, this may be right up your alley.  Mr. Braunbeck makes some moral statements toward the end of the story which is okay, but not what you would expect in a horror novel.  Most people read horror for the sheer entertainment value, not to be morally enlightened by the plight of others.<br /><br />It sounds like I didn't care for this book which is just not true.  It was a very different type of horror story, not really my cup of tea, but it was a new and different experience.  It took talent and a lot of effort to create the type of tale contained within these 378 pages.  The raw emotion the main character showed was phenomenal.  Give it a try and judge for yourself.	2005-02-22

It is one of the best suspense/drama novels I have read in a while.  This story has everything one could want in a mystery: a dame with a solid head on her shoulders, a hunk, murders galore, a gay doctor, an overbearing father who is an ex-cop, and a homeless psycho was used to be an FBI agent.  The plot and storyline are both great and the action doesn't let up.  There is also a bit of humor sprinkled in for good measure.<br /><br />Ms. Dreyer writes a believable hard-hitting novel.  Despite all that has happened in our heroine's life, she comes through victorious and with a lot of class.  The ending was not a real surprise, but it was pulse pounding action from the first page to the last.  I am sorry I have missed this author's books and will be looking for them in the future.	2005-02-16

It wasn't a bad story, and it was written well enough, it just lacked the speed and action that I am used to.  I read alot of Coben, Hunter, and Patterson.  The thing I liked most about this book is the lack of vulgar language and sex.  I like to send books to my mother and she doesn't want to read trash.  This is a book I can send to her without worry.<br /><br />The characters in this book were well developed, the plot was good, and it was an easy book to read.  It was just a little slow compared to what I usually read.<br /><br />Carley is a journalist and has bought stock in a company that boasts it has the cure for cancer.  The only drawback is the guy who is making those claims is dead(or is he).  Everyone who invested in the stock is now out of luck.  One man takes things into his own hands and starts making others \\"pay\\" for the money he lost.

Wow, I looked over other reviews and it seems people either really loved or hated this book.  Some of the \\"hated\\" reviews were by those who are reading Patterson for the first time.  Please understand, while each book can and does stand alone, this is an ongoing story of the life and times of Alex Cross, former detective, now a FBI agent.  There is a history behind Cross and his family.  Before you judge too harshly, maybe it would be a good idea to read a few of his newer novels to get an idea of just who Alex Cross is, where he comes from, and how his family and friends interact.<br /><br />I found this to be a great book.  Once again, Patterson left me on the edge of my seat.  The action and suspense were great and the characters took on lives of their own.  There are plenty of plot twists and the ending is huge.<br /><br />Someone is kidnapping people to sell to collectors.  Any and all fantasies can be fufilled if you have enough money.  Cross, new to the FBI, is assigned to find the \\"Wolf\\", the man believed to be responsible for the human slave trade.  At the same time, Cross is trying to deal with his own personal crisis at home.<br /><br />Patterson delivers another solid performance.  I can't wait to read the sequel to find out if the Wolf is captured and what happens to Cross's personal life.  So if you love the Alex Cross series, you will love this one.  If you haven't read any before now, do yourself a favor and pick up a couple so you can understand where Cross has come from.  Enjoy!	2005-01-23

Taylor's father committed suicide after finding out what Taylor's mother really was(she wasn't human).  We still don't know what she was and I hope that future books will reveal this mystery for us.  Taylor can find anyone, a gift he can only use in the Nightside.  In our world he functions just like the rest of us.  When a rich woman comes to him asking him to find her runaway daughter, Taylor finds out the daugther has stepped over into the Nightside, so back home he goes, with mother in tow.<br /><br />This book was so well written there is not much to say.  It speaks for itself once you read it.  The characters were a fun bunch.  I don't want to spoil anything for you but you won't regret reading this one.

I really liked this book, not because it was the best mystery I have ever read, or it was the most exciting book in the world.  I liked this book because it was just plain fun.  It didn't require alot of thought, it is short and to the point.  It is filled with humour, action, suspense and it does all this without vulgar language, guts all over the floor, and everyone sleeping with everyone else.  This book could be read by young and old alike and everyone in between.<br /><br />The plot is good, the idea is fresh and different from the usual mystery novel.  The mental conversations between the main character and the ghost are great.  I can't wait for the next installment of this series to see how the relationship between these two blossoms.  Share this book with a friend or relative.  The townsfolk remind me of a small mid-western town I grew up in where everyone knows everyone else's business and everyone has an opinion.  This is a refreshing book, I hope you enjoy it.	2005-01-19

It has all the ingredients needed to keep your heart beating just a little faster and keeping you turning the pages long past your bedtime.<br /><br />The only complaint or criticism I have is the unlikely style of thinking and talking Mr. Massey has given to his young cast of characters.  We are talking about 13 & 14 year old boys.  Mr. Massey has them speaking with wisdom and speech patterns well beyond their years, which ends up sounding phony and silly.  That is one of the things I enjoyed so much about THE FACE by Dean Koontz.  His young character talked and thought the way a young boy would.  Mr. Massey could learn a trick or two from Mr. Koontz's style.  Does this take away from the greatness of the book? Not at all.  This is a must read for anyone who likes to be scared.  Buy this book, curl up on the couch with a nice cup of hot chocolate and prepare to start looking around you and jumping at every single noise, and if you notice your watch has stopped, welcome to Thunderland.	2005-01-16

JUDAS VIRUS is a really good book, but not great.  It contains alot of mystery and a fair amount of suspense, but at the same time, it was a little disjointed.  The premise of the story and the ending did not flow together as well as I thought it should have.  The relationship between the main character; chris, and her father started out believeable but the author had her lashing out through the whole story and was a bit over the top.  There was a little too much \\"teenage drama\\".<br /><br />All in all, this is a good book and would be well worth your time reading.  I enjoyed the story and it kept you guessing till the very end.  The only problem I found was the author's effort in bringing it all to a close.	2005-01-16

She can weave mystery into the fabric of an excellent medical thriller as well, if not better, as Robin Cook.  While this, in my opinion, is not one of her very best, she still has the magic of story-telling prose.<br /><br />The plot and story line are solid, there are enough twists and turns to keep you turning the pages.  It was fun watching Ms. Gerritsen bring together events that in the beginning didn't seem related at all.  To me, this is the sign of a great writer.  Her characters are believable and while she injects a lot of medical knowledge and jargon into her stories, she brings it all down to a level that most people can understand.<br /><br />While I have enjoyed some of her other books more than this one, I still must recommend this book.  It is a good solid read and reads easily enough to finish in a night or two.  Enjoy!	2005-01-12

I am an avid Little fan and I love the way he can take an everyday, ordinary fact or occurance and turn it into a true work of horror.  My favorite novel by Little is The Association, it just doesn't get any better than that.  I believe it is his best work to date.  With that in mind, I awaited the arrival of The Policy with bated breath and couldn't wait to tear into the pages.  I was only mildly let down.<br /><br />While the story is not as powerful as The Association, it didn't end quite as silly either.  This book is about a group of people and how their lives are affected by the horrors of insurance salesmen, and what happens when certain types of insurance is declined or bought.<br /><br />This was a really fun read.  There was so much satire mixed in with the horror.  One minute I was laughing and nodding my head, thinking to myself how many times I have been suckered into more and more \\"protection\\", the next minute I was riveted to my seat cheering for a character in the book to not open the door or go outside.<br /><br />It is hard to talk much about this book without giving too much of the story away, but this book is certainly worth your time.  Of course, the book would have been much shorter if the characters would have been offered insurance against insurance agents, but maybe that is another story for another time.  Buy this book, you won't regret it.	2005-01-12

It sounded like it would be an enjoyable read.  A nymphomaniac attacking a hospital patient, a black cat, a witch.  The best part about this book was the blurb on the back cover.  The rest was pretty boring.<br /><br />The story started out with a lot of promise, it contained humour, mystery, suspense, all the elements needed for a great novel ride.  This soon fizzled out and I had to push the book to the finish line.  I am not certain what happened, Ms Proulx had all the elements and got off to such a great start, but she seemed to not know where to take it.  The characters weren't that<br /><br />interesting and the ending was too predictable.<br /><br />If I had it to do over again, I would not waste any time on this book, there are too many good ones out there.  This is the first book from this author I have read, I hope all her books are not like this.	2004-12-22

I didn't even know this was a sequel.  You don't need to read the first one to understand this one.<br /><br />Mephistopolis is a city in Hell.  It is a place filled with torture, pain, horror, and regret.  Not a place you'd want to get a flat tire in.<br /><br />Cassie Heydon is looking for her dead sister, Lissa, who killed herself and left Cassie feeling guilty.  Cassie will need to brave the depths of Hell and all that entails to find her sister.  She does get some heavenly assistance from an angel named Angelese.<br /><br />This was a fantastic book.  I loved it.  It contained horror far beyond my puny imagination.  Lee has created characters that are rich in substance.  He has successfully created an image of Hell that is truly horrific.  Where did he come up with some of this stuff?  I stayed awake longer than I should have a couple of nights in a row to finish this book.  It is well worth your time, but please note, this book is NOT for the squeamish!  I will definitely look for more of Lee's works.	2004-12-22

He has an imagination that just won't quick.  Four Blind Mice is another huge success, at least, in my opinion.<br /><br />Alex Cross is in love with a beautiful detective and wants to plan a future with her.  Many miles separate them.  Nanna Momma is starting to show her age and Alex is worried as to how long she may be with he and his children.  John Sampson has a friend who has been accused of some vicious murders and claims he is innocent.<br /><br />The thing I love about Patterson is his mutlifaceted stories and his short chapters.  He is constantly flipping back and forth from one aspect of his story to another, constantly keeping you on the edge of your seat, and he brings it all together at the end for a fantastic finish.  He doesn't let us down in this novel either.  His characters come alive on the pages and he starts out at a break-neck speed and doesn't slow til the last word.<br /><br />There is so much taking place in this novel and he ties it all up beautifully and leaves the reader wanting more.  I'm not sure how he does it novel after novel, but he is one of the most consistant writers I have read.<br /><br />The excitment in this story will captivate you and you will find it hard to put the book down.  The ending is just great and there is a surprise at the end that I didn't see coming. Pick this one up, sit back with a cup of hot coffee, and enjoy.	2004-12-22

I have to say I was intrigued when I read the synopsis of this novel in a BMC magazine and quickly added it to my must read list.  I sure am glad I did.  This book had everything one could possibly want in a story, drama, mystery, humor, plot turns and twists, characters rich in personality, and a great story line.  The book is sooooo well written!  It was a sheer delight to read.<br /><br />The suspense was wonderful and just when I thought I knew who did it...surprise!  This happened a couple times.  If this is their first effort, I can't wait to see what is to come.  Hopefully they won't change their writing style.  More authors need to take notice.  The story flowed almost like watching a movie, and it was over so quickly.  Speaking of movie, this story would make a great movie.  I just can't seem to say enough about it.  Do yourself a favor and give this book a try.  I can't imagine you would regret it.	2004-11-27

If it doesn't capture my attention in 50 pages, I put it down.  Life is just to short to waste on a mediocre book.  I was afraid this book was destined for the discard bin. At the 50 page mark I was still intrigued with the story line and decided to expand my rule a few more pages, I am glad I did.  By page 80 the story was off and running.  It didn't travel at breakneck speed, but it was sure and steady.<br /><br />Bailey started out a little slow but as the story progressed, so did the action and suspense.  This is not the best work of horror I have ever read but it is certainly worth your time.  Dreamland is a modern day haunted house and while it may not have alot in the way of ghosts, evil definitely lives here.<br /><br />In the end, I found myself cheering on the good guys and feeling badly for those who didn't make it. Bailey has alot of potential and I am looking forward to his next effort.	2004-11-21

Coben is the first author to win the Edgar, Anthony, and Shamus awards, and it shows once again in NO SECOND CHANCE.  He is truly a talented writer who knows how to grab the readers attention on the first page and hold it tight until the end.  I have yet to be disappointed with his books.  One of the things I like about his style of writing, he is not afraid to have bad things happen to good people.<br /><br />This book was fast paced and never boring.  Coben blends some humor, suspense and mystery in his stories, and his characters come alive on the pages.<br /><br />Dr. Seidman has a past and it comes back to haunt him.  The price he must pay for this past is those he loves most in this world.  His wife is murdered, he is shot and left for dead and his daughter is kidnapped.  Naturally the FBI believes he is somehow responsible and it is a race to the finish to find the killers/kidnappers and prove his innocence.<br /><br />If you miss this one, you have missed a great book.	2004-11-12

My favorite book by Koontz has been The Face, but Odd Thomas will definitely give it a run for its money.  This is a story about a man named Odd Thomas.  It seems Odd can see the dead and they are not see-through apparitions either.  They are as solid as you and me.  He can tell they are dead because the dead don't speak.  He also can see these strange black creatures called Bodachs.  They seem to always show up at a scene of impending doom and violence.  It is as though the Bodachs feed off the violence and despair.<br /><br />Odd has a girlfriend named Stormy, and the both of them have matching birthmarks.  A fortune telling machine at a carnival has stated that they are destined to be together forever.  Odd comes upon a very strange man and a whole passel of nasty Bodachs and he is on a mission to stop whatever violence is about to take place.  He has had a dream in which he sees many people lying around dead.  Can he stop the slaughter before it happens?<br /><br />It's hard to say much about this book without giving away the ending which blew me away!!  I didn't see it coming and it made my stomach feel like it does as you just start down the top of a roller coaster.  You can't possibly be disappointed by this story.  The characters are likeable and funny.  They have such rich personalities.  The story flows quickly and easily.  I loved it.	2004-11-07

I really liked this story from start to finish.  There were a few flaws, but hey, that is why there are so many books out there.  You can't please all of us all of the time.<br /><br />The story is about an E.R. physician named David who finds himself tangled in a web of madness and destruction after treating a fellow hospital employee who has been attacked by a madman and alkali thrown into her face.  This sets off a chain of events and David finds himself and his family more involved than he could ever have imagined.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and I started feeling a certain amount of sympathy for the villian once the story unfolded enough to reveal how he became to be.  I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, but it is well worth your time.<br /><br />The ending left something to be desired, although the impact of the ending is evident if you pay attention to the story. Some of the events in the book were unimportant and never expounded on, leaving you to wonder why they were there, but overall, it was a fun read.	2004-11-02

This book, The Doorkeepers, is just ok.  The premise of the story is great, it has some very exciting moments, but the proof reading was overlooked.  There are many errors in this book and not stupid picky stuff, I'm talking about sentences that simply don't make sense.  It was as though Masterton wanted to change a sentence but only changed half of it.  This made the book, at times, lose it's flow.<br /><br />The gist of the story is this;  there are mutiple planes for the same location.  For example, there are an infinite number of Londons.  Each one is the same but different at the same time.  Each has its own history and time setting.  There are doorways to each of these universes.  The story is about a man who finds himself frantically trying to find the secret to these mysterious doors after his sisters dead body is discovered in the present London, but it becomes known that she had been lured to an alternate London and killed there.  Let the games begin!<br /><br />I found this story intriguing but more science ficton than horror.  The ending was a little lame.  You certainly won't be wasting your time reading this book, it's just not one of his best.  Of course, that is only my opinion.  If you want Graham Masterton at his finest, try the books I mentioned above.  They are fantastic.	2004-11-02

The beginning of the story describes a crime in a level of detail that makes you sick with revulsion.  Jilliane Hoffman thus grabs you by the collar and screams, \\"Don't put this book down till you reach the last page!\\"  You can only obey.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the plot, but by the time I reached the last few chapters, I was cheering.  I'd never found revenge to be a beautiful thing until Hoffman showed me how it's done.<br /><br />\\"Retribution\\" is about pain, violence, the struggle to do the right thing, revenge, love, healing, and a second chance at life.  The characters are well developed, and you are drawn into their world completely.  There's none of that unbelievable fantasy nonsense you find in many mystery/thrillers.  You can envision the moral battles taking place in the minds of our heroine and those around her.  Just like in real life, decisions must be made and lines must be drawn.  I spent a few days after finishing this book asking myself, 'What would I have done?'<br /><br />Buy, borrow, rent, or steal this book.	2004-10-20

It wasn't the worst medical thriller I have ever read, but it certainly wasn't the best either.  Earl Garnet is an ER physician, whose wife is pregnant and also a physician.  Earl is plunged into the middle of trouble when he is called to the chief admisistrators office to find the man dead.  He also discovers a cardiac needle has been broken off in the murder victims chest.  There are only a handfull of doctors who are skilled enough to know how to use a cardiac needle, and Dr. Garnet is among them.  This fact quickly makes him a suspect.<br /><br />Garnet, struggling to identify the real killer and clear his own name, soon becomes the killer's next target.<br /><br />The story started out just fine and had enough action and suspense to keep you wanting to read through dinner and past your bedtime.  There is enough medical jargon to make it interesting, but Clement doesn't over do it.  He gives a brief explanation so any layman can keep up with the story.  Clement trys to give the story a twist at the end that is lame and out of the blue.  It was not well done, but all in all, the story is a good one and worth your time.  Hopefully Clement will get a little better with plot organization for his next effort.	2004-10-10

In UP COUNTRY Mr. DeMille once again delivers an exciting action packed adventure filled with characters who seem like real people.  The book was quite long, and a lot of the filler dealing with Viet Nam and the Viet Nam war was not really necessary, but Mr. DeMille is such an expert story teller, one doesn't seem to mind all that filler. Paul Brenner, a vietnam vetern, must travel back to Viet Nam in search of a man who could rock the United States with a piece of knowledge he possesses.  A female guide/companion is sent to Brenner to help keep him on track and out of trouble, or is she?  Maybe she's there to make certain Brenner completes his mission. There are many twists and turns, some expected and some not so expected, in this wonderfully exciting tale.  Paul is kept in the dark about the information he is after as the reader is. That was a nice touch. This book has it all, romance, adventure, suspense, comedy and a rich history of a war and country many have forgotten.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  It was a pleasure to read.	2004-10-05

I saw a preview of it in a book club catalog and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I followed my gut:  This was a great book.  I was hooked at the first chapter and never looked back.<br /><br />Henry Sleep is a young man running from something, he's not sure what.  He suffers from nightmares he can't explain and has memories of his childhood that are disjointed.  He grew up in a place called Sauls Run.  After losing his mother at age 12, he spent the next few years hating his father, until he was able to flee town and run from -- what?  He couldn't quite remember.  His father's suicide brings him reluctantly home to face the stuff his nightmares are made of.<br /><br />Henry left behind two people, Emily and Perry, who hate him for fleeing Sauls Run and leaving them behind.  Henry struggles throughout the story to remember what he did to cause Perry to hate him so.<br /><br />The story is filled with deep, rich storytelling.  The characters are so alive they feel like old friends ... or enemies.<br /><br />The book is brief and left me eager for Bailey's next effort.  Bravo to him for resisting the urge to yammer on long after the story was over, like too many of his colleagues seem to do.	2004-08-21

She delivers a solid performance every time.<br /><br />Dr. Rhea Lynch finds herself in another fix, so shortly after the last one.  Her best friend is away recovering from a life-changing injury.  Rhea is still struggling with her feelings for Mark, Cam is still chasing anything wearing a skirt, and Ms Essie -- well, she still rules the world (Rhea's world at least).<br /><br />There's a lot of action in this new novel.  At times it's hard to keep up with what is happening, and there are a few loose ends in the final chapter.  Some of the unanswered questions are left that way intentionally to give the reader something to think about and form his or her own impressions.  It's a nice touch.  I could have used just a little more explanation at the end, but overall, the story is classic Hunter.<br /><br />Gwen Hunter has worked hard and succeeded in developing characters you love to love and love to hate.  We have followed Rhea's life and the lives of those around her.  Hunter brings a \\"realness\\" her characters that is seldom seen.  You feel as though you have known each character all your life.  There is just enough romance between Rhea and Mark to keep you rooting for them but not so much to lose sight of the excitement of the story.  There is enough medical jargon to make the book interesting but not so much as to confuse or bore you.<br /><br />I can't say enough about the Rhea Lynch sagas.  I hope we all get the opportunity to grow old with Rhea & Co.  Ms. Hunter can't write books fast enough for me.	2004-08-19

The story was okay, the presentation was a little lame.  I like a little more action and excitment in my stories.  It's not that the plot was weak or the story was poorly told, it just lacked life.  When I get to the end of a chapter I like the author to compel me to continue reading the next chapter.  I found that lacking in this book.  When i finished one chapter, I was neither curious nor excited to see what the next chapter would bring.<br /><br />This book is basically about a man accused of murder, the people trying to prove his guilt and those trying to prove his innocence.  The end of the book gets better and has a much quicker pace.<br /><br />All in all, this is not a bad or competely boring book, it just doesn't grab you and keep you riveted.

The story is about nanotechnology, a subject I'm certain we're all familiar with....NOT!<br /><br /> The book starts out grabbing you around the collar and it holds on tight. It's a mixture of mystery, as well as comedy, as we are introduced to our characters and what is happening in their world at this moment. There is a wonderful crescendo effect as the story evolves from 'getting to know you' to 'Oh my God, what is happening?' What I didn't like about the book was the fifty or so pages in which the author tried to explain exactly what nanotechnology is and how it related to our plot. It was alot like reading a VCR manual. Hang in there, it gets better.<br /><br /> Once you are thoroughly confused as to what nanoparticles do and how they originate, and by the way, I don't think it was information we really needed to enjoy the story, the pace kicks into high gear and doesn't slow down til the last 6 pages or so when our author wraps it all up.<br /><br /> This book would make a great movie, and it was a really good book, minus the techno talk that was really confusing and too techno for us common folk.	2004-07-26
US	48834024	R2C0EIGIEUDEAJ	0553102834	360126435	Positive Match (Hc)	Books	2	1	2	N	N	where is the dialogue?	I love medical thrillers but often they end up being mostly all alike and predictable.  This story was not that.  The premise of the story was not original but had a twist at the end that I didn't see coming.  That is why I gave it 2 stars.  The problem I had with this book was the lack of dialogue.  The author was telling a story but there was little interaction between the characters.  There was a bit too much technical talk.  It got to be very boring after a while and I found myself skimming instead of reading. The first chapter grabbed me and I thought I was in for the ride of my life, but it fizzled all too quickly.	2004-06-01

There have been a few I liked alot, and a few I couldn't stand, but The Face is one I couldn't put down. I found myself reading it every chance i got.<br />Aelfric Manheim is the son of a famous actor who is loved and adored by many. Fric lives a priveledged life but is starving for the attention all kids desire.  He soon gains attention he doesn't want!<br />Without giving any of the story away, I have to say there were moments when I had goosebumps on my arms. I also found I was breathing heavy out of fear.  This is the best book Mr. Koontz has ever written.  You come to love Fric and find yourself rooting for him.  It's like watching a horror film on T.V. and screaming for the hero not to open the door. I was drained by the time I got to the last page.<br />If you are looking for a book to make your heart beat faster and your pulse race, then i highly recommend this book.	2004-02-15
US	48834024	R30GDWNN2NAPOA	0446530891	382868174	Split Second (King & Maxwell)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	wow	I picked up this book and a discount book store.  It is the first time i have read one of his books.  I loved it.  As i was perusing some of the other reviews, I noticed how harsh people were being of this book.  I am not a writer, but i read an average of a book per week, and i couldn't find anything wrong with this story.  I plan to seek out his other 2 books and see what it is I have been missing.  His characters were beautifully developed, which is a huge selling factor for me.  If i don't feel some type of emotion towards the players in the story, i don't want to waste my time reading the book.  I didn't know whether to love or hate Joan. Sean reminded me of Sean Connery's version of James Bond. Michelle is an empowered yet soft female.  The story moved along at breakneck speed, and i was at the end before i knew it.  It was a hard book to put down.	2004-02-05
US	48834024	R3JVQ8NJ0HF65W	0399148760	892853054	Seizure	Books	3	1	4	N	N	another good thriller	Wow, after reading some of the other reviews i feel like i must have been reading a different story.  i liked this book.  it was typical robin cook.  all his books have &quot;issues&quot; to be explored and this one is no exception.  i think he brings an awareness to his novels that others do not.  it was a fast paced story.  it was not his best effort but he definitely had you thinking by the end of the book and i think that is his intention.  the characters are well developed and you can feel a range of emotions toward them.  i would recommend this book to anyone.  keep writing robin.	2004-02-05

This was an enjoyable read.  The technical jargon may be over some people's heads, but she explains all you need to know and if you have any medical background at all, you will love it.  The pace is good.  I love the way she incorporates a love interest without turning the story into a romance novel.  There are twists and thrills to be had in the book's 306 pages.  Ms Reichs writing is smooth and flows without getting bogged down in alot of nonsense you don't need or want to know.  My only complaint is i feel she rushed the ending a little bit. She builds up a grand climatic ending and just sort of gushes it all out instead of letting the ending unfold on it's own.  I will definitely catch up on her other books i have not read yet and i will continue to read her books in the future.	2004-02-05

I forced myself to read 275 pages, hoping it would get better, but i realized that i really no longer cared what happened and i put the book down, never to be picked up again.  The story just keeps repeating itself, a &quot;lightquake&quot; takes place, something is ejected out of the trunk, no one really knows what that something is, what it's purpose is, or where it came from, and you never discover the answers to any of these questions.  This book may appeal to those who haven't read King from the beginning of his career, but for this &quot;die-hard&quot; classic King horror fan this book put me to sleep.	2004-01-03
