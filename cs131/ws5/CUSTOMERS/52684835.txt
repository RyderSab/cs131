Between her breasts she was shamefully emblazoned & tattooed as \\"Feld Hure\\" (field whore) with SN A135633.  The camp had both Labor & Joy Divisions where she was forced to watch \\"Public Chastisement\\" in Execution Square where 20 nude girls, strapped onto chairs, were bludgeoned to death upon order of Master (Mistress) Kalefactress, a criminal prison releasee overseer for Nazis.<br /><br />Daniella is transferred to Joy Division, sterilized & used as sex slave or Pleasure Maiden in the \\"Doll House\\" which holds 50 inmates. These girls are required to provide sex to Nazi soldiers before their departure to the Russian front.  During \\"Enjoyment Duty\\" they are instructed to smile and act happy - if not, & they accrue 3 bad reports, they are beaten & executed.  The 50 inmates are depicted as being arranged into 2 rows of 25 girls each, back to back, & awaiting the ingress of German Nazi soldiers who then arrive & assemble with agonizing fevor at distinctly 2:00 PM daily. Throughout, the Master Kalefactress observes lewd acts.<br /><br />There is a perfunctory introduction & an inglorious conclusion which is scummy, unsuccessfully written and/or poorly translated, but even if meant to merely mimic a depraved person's thoughts -- it absolutely falls short.  Totally lacking is some level of explanatory preface to indicate fantasy, fiction or a level of genuineness or authenticity where \\"names & places were changed to...\\", etc.	2005-10-09

Index, 4 pg. Biblio., 16 B/W photos & 2 maps: Balkans in 1914 & Slavic provinces of Austro-Hungarian empire.<br /><br />The journalist, an author of 8 books, visited Yugoslavia several times.  Her book, unlike \\"The Secret of Sarajevo\\", paints an ignoble picture of Archduke Franz Ferdinand & details the youths & student renegades who schemed, plotted & then assassinated Archduke Frans & his wife Countess Sophie June 28, 1914.  The 6 conspirators, all captured, were brought to trial & sentenced.  When written 2 remained alive & one (Cvetko Popovic) agreed to be interviewed.  Youthfulness of the conspirators was surpizing.  A long-standing hatred of Bosnians for the Austro-Hungarian empire dates to June 28, of 1389 (feast day of St. Vitus-Vivovdan) when Turks and Serbians engaged in mutual carnage. This [...] was used as excuse for Austria to declare war on Serbia & thusly led to WW-1 with England joining after Germany invaded Belgium, etc., etc.<br /><br />A lot of political science permeates the book & gives better understanding of grievances & which protective allies formed.  Propagandists used rumor, gossip & lies effectively as potent warring ingredients. An interesting read. The prose at times is awkward.	2005-09-20

Biblio. & 6 pg. Index with 22 B/W photographs, 5 3/4\\" x 8 1/2\\".<br /><br />Pauli's \\"The Secret of Sarajevo\\" (SoS) is a beautifully written love story of the Austrian Habsburg Archduke Franz Ferdinand & Bohemian Countess Sophie Chotek, Lady-in-waiting, from their 1st encounter at a ball in Prague in the Fall of 1894 until their assassinations in June 28, 1914 in Sarajevo during a royal visit.<br /><br />Two helpful lures are imprinted with the confines of the inside  covers:  the front bears a map of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy,  showing borders of the German & Russian Empires & the adjacent Kingdoms of Serbia, Italy, Rumania, Montenegro & the Countries of Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, Galacia, Bosnia, Bulgaria & Albania.  The backcover shows selective genealogy of The Arch-house of the Habsburg-Lorraine.  These enticements are extremely helpful as one reads this well-researched story of Austria's Habsburgs, for  it revolves around the ruling Emperor (1848-1916) Franz Joseph I, unforgiving uncle of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.<br /><br />The book deals well with the intrigues, aspirations, confidants, castle estates, royal gardens, & protocols governing social, marital & military events.  Reference is made to underlying residual blame in Bosnia relating to prior warring events of Turkey & Serbia, but also to the then current aspirations of Germanic, Russian & Austrian Empires.  The reader must form his own conclussion about culpability's for the assassinations & the events which followed,-- giving rise to the \\"Great War\\", WWI.  A most enjoyable book which would make a great movie.	2005-09-06

Mar. 1933 - liberated Sunday, Apr. 29, 1945 was 1st of many Nazi camps for Ger. political prisoners, Jews, criminals & POWs.  Built for 10,000, often held 30,000 & after 1944 up to  60,000.  Deaths rose in Winter & from crowding, starvation, freezing, typhus.  Executions averaged 200/day.  Most pre-war inmates were German, Austrian & Jews but with war were (in order): Poles, Russ., Fr., Yug., Jews, Czechs, Ger. & few Ital., Belg., Hung. & Greek.<br /><br />Underground organization & politicization did not exist until just prior to liberation.  Generally, one did what one had to do in order to survive.  Exceptions were \\"dirty work\\" by hardened criminal inmates rather than SS.  Commonest mode of death was \\"on transport\\", arriving dead on train flat cars.  Townspeople knew, denied or lied about the CC, all afraid. Reception, day routine, experiment stations (cold immersion, barometric chambers, pus & malarial injections), executions by gas, drowning & exhaustion & guns. Organizational charts, racial numbers at liberation & nos. of natural deaths & execution deaths are tallied.  The authors (U.S.Army) & date of study likely provide a \\"gold standard\\" status to this document. Photos are disturbing as expected.	2005-09-02

Annually, new crops of ten-year-olds were dedicated to the Fueherer on his birthday, April 20th.  At ages 14-18 lads joined Hitlerjugend (HJ) as Hitler Youths overseen by Baldur von Schurach, whilst girls entered Bund Deutscher Maeder (BDM), League of German Lasses.  In 1937 Adolph Hitler Schools, under Robert Ley & Schurach, were devised along with special colleges, Ordensburgen.<br /><br />This book used more than 1000 interviews, & contains many quotations from populace living at the time. The methodology of applied propaganda was eerily assimilated by youth, moreso than parents, - it involved using simple Boy Scout tactics (hiking, camping & campfires, singing, chanting) & athletic competitions;<br /><br />pseudo-religious allegiances; instilling fear of hostile countries that pillaged, raped, etc.; & dangers of polluted blood lines (Jews, Gypsies, etc.) & attraction of uniforms, insignia, ribbons, flags, parades, marching bands & hierarchy of heroes.<br /><br />Allegiance was instilled to Fueherer, Volk & Vaterland (Leader - People - Nation) as national socialism along lines of \\"Father - Son - & Holy Ghost\\".  Progressively, religion was replaced by nationalism (holidays, etc.).

Index, 8.5\\" x 6.5\\"<br /><br />Based on doctoral dissertion & awarded 1994 G.A. Almond Award in comparative Politics, this book by DJ Goldhagen (DJG) traces origin & scrutinizes essence of anti-Semitism from its origins over 1,000 years ago: -- manifest in non-Jewish Christian civilization at beginning of the Crusades (Jews characterized as non-Christian Christ killers); throughout the Middle Ages into early modern Europe, e.g. England, later Germany (nearly Judenrein), etc.; & clearly antedates rise of Hitler & Nazism.  DJG insinuates, repeatedly, that for practical purposes there was near universal (world-wide) anti-Semitism - if not overtly, then at least patently (latently) so.  DLG describes it as pervasive, pernicious & promulgated & worsened by the likes of Martin Luther (1483-1546), vilely anti-Semitic (\\"They hold us captive in our country.  They let us work in the sweat of our noses, to earn money and property for them, while they sit\\"...\\"let off gas,\\"...\\"live softly and well from our wealth.\\"...\\"They...mock us and spit on us, because we work...\\").<br /><br />An early speech by Hitler, Aug. 13, 1920, fused, ignited & spread much pent-up pre-existing anti-Semitism hatred:  - he blamed the woes of Europe & Germany entirely onto the evil machinations of Jews.  DJG divides transmogrification of anti-Semitism into \\"exterminationist anti-Semitism\\" in 3 steps:  Phase 1. - 1933-1938 Nazism to WW-2 where Jews were routed of rural areas, \\"socially deadened\\" by exclusion from cultural, economic, judicial & social interaction; Phase 2. - 1939-1941 over-running Poland, France etc., Nazis herded Jews & used terrible ghettos, starvation, etc., & Phase 3. - 1941-1945 on invading Russia, mass killings, shootings, camps, marches, starvations took place until the very day Allied Forces arrived en mass.<br /><br />The philosophy?  ... Perhaps addiction to Nazi nationalistic lust for \\"Germanic Eden\\" of Eastern Europe necessitating elimination of anti-Christ Jews & envisioning racial purity of northern Europeans.  The alternatives to genocide: (1) sterilization, (2) \\"Social deadening\\" by excludion, (3) deportation &/or Zionism (feared Jewish militaristic threat) deemed ineffectual for the \\"Jewish Problem\\".<br /><br />DJG dwells on detailed info base & facts, repeatedly recited ad nauseam to wit: -- primarily all strata of the German culture (& to a lesser extent neighboring eastern European cultures, Latvians, Lithuanians, Russians, etc.) men, women, skilled or unskilled, educated or uneducated, or the military Wehrmacht, Einsatskommando, SS, SA, SD, Gestapo, Police Battalion or non-military citizens partook of killings.  Moreover, unit commanders indicated killings, beatings, etc. were \\"voluntary\\" in the sense that punishment was not given for failure to do so, & that there were perceived elements of joy, enthusiasm, volunteerism, & sharing of emotions including photographing these morbid events to share with others (families/friends) as well as fatigue or exhaustion in carrying out these chores -- these were the \\"Ordinary Germans\\" of DJG.<br /><br />The role of the church/clergy is dwelt with in some detail, including the call for Solemn Requiem Mass by Cardinal Adolf Bertram fo Breslau to commenorate Hitler's death in May 1945.  One of the few recognized dissenters, making the proverbial cry in the wilderness, was Pastor Walter Hoechstaedter, a Chaplain, in 1944.  Where were the others?????<br /><br />This reference work is academia, well documented with references & notes, but is clearly flawed by profound excess of raw data and/or clearly repetitious statements -- wordiness exceeding 50% -- which, if corrected, would not diminish one iota the horrors contained within.  Even so, the book makes for difficult reading, occasions one to make notes, & is a scholarly discourse on a gruesome subject.uesome subject.	2005-07-28

Buffa, NY, Warner Books, 2002  ISBN  0-446-52738-6, HC  436 pg., 9 1/4\\" x 6 1/4\\".<br /><br />The 4th(?) of 7 Joseph Antonelli novels finds the protagonist attorney coaxed by cousin Bobby Medlin & law partner Albert Cravens, friend of the accused's mother, defending a youthful Black pre-med student Jamaal Washington from charge of murder, having been wounded on a foggy night fleeing the scene by rookie cop Officer Gretchen O'Leary accompanied by officer Marcus Joyner.  The victim, US Senator Jeremy Fullerton, was running for Governor amidst a bevy of political intrigues involving power broker Lawrence Goldman & his daughter Ariella, various White House factions, Governor Augustus Marshall, Andrei Bogdonovitch formerly alleged to be with Russian KGB, & some other notables.<br /><br />Antonelli meets divorcee Marissa Kane, the two are enamoured with one another - but as the trial begins Antonelli is repeatedly warned of lurking dangers should his client be found innocent.<br /><br />The courtroom players, Judge Thompson & DA Haliburton & courtroom interrogations are extolled in exquisite fashion.  We learn of the book's title when the trial ends, but the story continues - the ending is a \\"sleeper\\" we'd perhaps not expected, but it is nonetheless, fulfilling & typical of Antonelli's sagas.  Of Buffa's Antonelli novels, this is one of my favorites. I find his novels do not have to be read in sequence.  Get this one!	2005-07-18

(incl. 14 pg. index), 9 1/4\\" x 6 1/4\\".<br /><br />This is a lengthy treatise, a timely discussion, largely formatted as a semi-chronological narrative by foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman (3-time Pulitzer Prize winner @ The New York Times).  He writes in the 1st person of his observations on the shrinking world stemming back to the time of Christopher Columbus's voyages which set the stage for Globalization 1.0 (1492-1800 - era of muscle, horse & steam power, etc.); Globalization 2.0 (1800-2000 - era of Multinationals); & Globalization 3.0 (2000-2004+ - era of individuals). He lists 10 \\"forces that flattened the world\\" which included 11/09/89 fall of Berlin wall, 08/09/95 release of Netscape browser, Internet Protocol, open-sourcing Apache/Linux languages, outsourcing fix of internal time clocks for Y2K fiasco, off-shoring, supply-chaining (restocking), insourcing UPS, in-forming (Google/Yahoo/MSN) & \\"steroids\\" (misc. boosters).  In turn, these worked as triple convergences of new players, new places, new processes/programs revolving around free trade, skills/leadership & flux of education gaps.  He also discusses \\"The Unflat World\\" & \\"11/9 versus 9/11\\".<br /><br />Friedman introduces micro- & macro-economic concepts, gives examples gleaned from personal observations & business leaders.  He gives insight into modern company/country management which we may be open-eyed to learn partiulars: - UPS insourcing; Harvard's Crimson newsletter outsourcing; & Wal-Mart's distribution centers.  He discusses NAFTA, social security, \\"Untouchables\\", adverse effects of \\"humiliation\\" on those less-well understood Arabic/Muslim cultures, & notes China's ideologies of \\"Black cat, white cat, all that matters is that it catches mice\\", & also newest Chinese saying \\"To get rich is glorious\\".  Problem areas include high cost of medical care (US), illegal immigration (US), lack of leadership (Mexico),  effect on non-globalizing countries (Sudan, North Korea, etc.) & dependency on oil/energy (China/US).<br /><br />Friedman's writing skill allows him to succinctly condense & then explain rapidly evolving globalization issue-so we can appreciate some those cross-currents in effect at the recent July 2005 meeting of \\"G8\\" in Scotland, be they rioters, billions in aid  targeted for Africa or the FOUR SUBWAY TRANSIT BOMBERS.

Ref/Notes & 18 pg., Index,  9 1/2\\" x 6 1/4\\"<br /><br />This is a lengthy treatise, largely formatted in a chronological narrative as studied by investigative reporter David Kirby, a Sci. & Health contrib. to The New York Times.  Most of the data are retold accountings from parents of autistic children, but also gleaned from scientific forums, meetings, physicians, lawyers, newspaper accounts, politicians & the Internet.<br /><br />The Prologue sets the theme:  an alleged collusion & cover-up recounting the Nov. 19, 2002 stealth rider attached to the Homeland Security Act bill which shielded drug companies from pending or future litigation in adverse reaction lawsuits, of particular ELI LILLY.  The later drug company already had hundreds of civil suits filed by parents for allegedly allowing toxic levels of mercury in vaccines.  Various groups representing autistic children alleged high levels of mercury, in particular organic ethyl mercury (Thiomerosal), were permitted in childhood vaccines & administered with full knowledge by the drug companies & with approval by the FDA & CDC. The groups alleged conspiracy & cover-up by FDA, CDC, White House, medical journals, medical associations & various scientific forums addressing questions of vaccine safety & of their failures to address the increased incidence/prevalence of autism or devise methods of treatment.<br /><br />The reader is given a gamut of diagnostic descriptions for Sx of mercurism, autism, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), pervasive developmental disorders (PPD), Asperger's syndrome (Idiot Savant), ADD & ADHD & informed of the statistical increase of ASD from 1 in every 10,000 births in the 1980's to 1 in 166 (today).  Of note, boys are affected 4 times more than girls.  The book recounts various theories for autism - lists some biochemical markers & effects of sex hormones & heavy metals (including mercury) in phenotypic expressivity - & discusses various treatments now available.  Kirby tells us the issue of mercurial causation of autism remains unproven, that mercurials have been largely removed from vaccines & that research continues.  If mercurism was causative, then autism will decline in the U.S.<br /><br />This book is an important one for families having an afflicted youngster - it should be read.  Importantly, early diagnosis & intervention are critical to lessening impairments in those with ASD & related disorders.  The book is not specially technical but chronological formatting & repetitions made reading wearisome.rs & effects of sex hormones & heavy metals (including mercury) in phenotypic expressivity - & discusses various treatments now available.

Antonelli & Sinclair voice feverent oppostiion to the thrust of TV panel indictments & are dismayed at the jeopardizing portentous perils & media feeding-frenzy ejaculated by the Bryan Allen Show.  As fate would have it, Daphne McMillan's butchered body in Julian Sinclair's home makes him a suspect & so he too is subjected to a TV Newsmedia Trial shaping public opinion on the Bryan Allen Show.<br /><br /> The story unfolds realistically - indeed, we are tacitly prompted to identify the machinations & frequenters with the Scott Peterson trial, Paula with Gloria Allred, Bryan with Larry King (an/or now Nancy), etc...perhaps.<br /><br />The mockery of the plot, the devious stratagem of some principals & the inventive closure is affably engineered - & perhaps we are wont to a sequel...?

His mastery of poetic license, fresh similes & energetic embellishment had to originate in real life experiences.<br /><br />Moore, once again, uses NYU investigative lawyer & protagonist Vincent Calvino, living in Bangkok & is hired by telecom expert Harry Markle to check on younger bros. Drew, Saigon attorney, about ethical issues at his firm.  Not only is Drew unexpectedly killed but Drew's client Mark Wang from Hong Kong is found dead.  Calvino & \\"Pratt\\", Lt. Col. with Royal Thai Police & long-tiome friend from college days, work together in solving the crimes. Calvino has charm for the ladies & we are introduced to Jackie Ky & Mai, & given a slurry of info about the \\"Comfort Zone\\" of bars beset with drugs, booze & women -- plus other mercenary frequenters, foreign & domestic.<br /><br />The plot takes place in Thailand & we are given a taste of Thai vocabulary to provide suitable Asian twang & allowed to glimpse the degraded human essences of street people when lured to the \\"Comfort Zone\\".  Moore's novel provides an interesting itinerary of characters, peoples & places.  Our memories get refreshed over geography, politics & cultures involved in Vietnam War years (1954-1975) & of assiduous forces exacted on those people who stayed or came later for divers reasons.  The finale seemed frail when Vincent, injured & melancholic, needed coaxing to leave the intimacy of the \\"Comfort Zone\\".  Having been introduced to Moore's protagonist, Vincent Calvino, I look forward to following him under Moore's other titles.  It is a good read & I'm pleased it was brought to my attention.	2005-05-29

Kelly Keady, Magdalene Books, Minneapolis, 2004 - ISBN 0-9749738-0-7, HC, 398 Pg. (9\\" x 6\\") includes Prologue 30g., Epilogue 8 pg., & 54 Chaps. divided into 3 Parts (I-657 pg., II-177 pg., & III-132 pg.).<br /><br />\\"The Cross of St. Maro\\" is a lengthy, powerful & entrancing thesis depicting widespread corruption at all levels of government: - local, state & federal - a product of long standing bribes & political gifting by multi-national corporations for favorable bank & trade policies (including money laundering), corporate welfare relief & sanctioned trading of arms to foreign governments, - but even more worrisome is the CIR, an elitist organization of weathy entrepreneurs with an inconnu soliciting domination with intent to provoke a worldwide incident between Syria, the U.S. & the Muslim world by inciting a major terrorism attack on New York.<br /><br />The story is told through protagonist, Peter Farrell, an junior investigative attorney provided boxes of damning documents which could inculpate many bureaucratic & administrative officials in both governmental & private sectors.<br /><br />Even as Tasha Dolnick disposes of sexaholic FEC Commissioner Jeffrey Speeter as a suicide, Golde & Rosendahl's law firm attorney Peter Farrell is telling wealthy client Paul Simon he'll accept his case & interview Paul's sister, Rose who'd been placed in a mental facility after attempting to kill her husband, billionaire Elias St. Armand, & he'd review whatever papers she possessed.  Rose tells Peter that Elias was integrally sinister, admitting he'd killed her father with a cattle prod to inherit his business; moreover, her mother Lillian had secreted boxes of ruinous documents against Elias.  Because Peter was going fishing, his brother John transported some documents for him.  Returning home Peter is assaulted by a uniformed man, finds his house ransacked & learns both his brother John & Joe Rosendahl were murdered.  Worried, he calls Dean Adams & is told to mail documents to surviving law partner Aaron & then meet him in Washington.  Adams makes 3 calls, including one to Aaron, & is found the next day, shot to death in a car wash.<br /><br />Feaful, Peter visits friends Henry Knops & nephew Jimmy Powell.  Recognizing danger he connives a flight to San Francisco via Chicago to seek sanctuary with a trusted girl friend, Sara Ahrens, daughter of Judge Douglas Ahrens.  Using a fictitious name concocted years earlier, Peter phones Sara as \\"Joey Sukapukavic\\" for a meeting at the Mission Dolores.  He is recognized by agents & in a shooting spree he & Sara split.  But the story has just begun, it goes on & killings continues, the plots thicken: -- and, the terrorists have finely tuned their malevolent deranged activities to produce maximal casualties.<br /><br />Woven in, is a cast of characters with their in-depth pasts fully revealed: i.e., stark details of Tasha Dolnick's dehumanization as a young maiden in native Srebrenica, an area sacked & subjected to ethnic cleansing by Cetnik rebel Serbs; i.e. capacious information on Sienna Club attorney activist Sara, & profuse details on grandfather Isaac Ahrens, one of the original leaders of the Dutch Underground in Hoogeveen & facing the Nazi Endlosung, also son Douglas born in 1940 & given to Catholic family, surviving the Hongerwinter, seeing Holland's liberation in 1944, becoming a U.S. citizen, a lawyer & finally a judge with judicial misgivings leading to his spoliation.  Munificently, is Pachomius, presented as founder of Christian coenobitical monastery in Egypt c. 300 AD at Tabennisi on the Nile where most of the treasured library was destroyed by Alexanderian troops with some monks escaping to the Ukraine where survivors rebuilt their Tabennisiot fortress monastery high in the Carpathians.  In this setting, but under wartime conditions of Nazi occupation, Andriy Kravenko grew up a child born as \\"the fruit of the violence inflicted upon Lina\\", his mother, repeatedly raped by Capt. Erich Hoch, Third Reich, March 10, 1944.  Monk Andriy was driven asway from the hood after killing an unfaithful & worked in Odessa KGB until it was abolished by Gorbachev in 1991, but hired by CIR as an enforcer.<br /><br />There is/are a number of \\"significant others\\" in this casting which readers will find extensively described:  to wit - Roland Miller, Elias St. Armand, Redwood, Det. Martinez, John Kerr, Bob Fairchild & VP George Algers.  All interesting, spicy characters.<br /><br />The book is intriguing, immaginative & certainly worthy of being read.  Not just because the subject of corruption & terroism is timely, but the large cast of complex characters are described in rather unique fashion: - where we most often learn about people & places by smelling the roses, feeling & seeing & hearing wind & rain, etc., herein they are displayed in a disturbingly negative light as products of psychiatric/social ancestries, birth & maturation, with an unspoken hint of refuge because societal sufferings had fabricated subsequent antisocial behavior.<br /><br />Finally, may we inquire about Paul Simon who hired Peter?  Did Paul get a report on Rose, did Paul pay his bill?  Where is Rose, is she still in...the mental ward?  What is the Cross of St. Maro?  You'll be able to answer these questions if you read Keady's novel.  I'd look forward to a sequel or a trilogy - Peter is one of the good guys, though not necessarily still a virgin.  E.

What I learned was the author's preoccupation, praise & prediliction for:  \\"The Economist\\" (74 citations), \\"New York Times\\" magazine\\" (44 cit.), \\"New Yorker\\" magazine (15 cit.), \\"New York Times\\" (10 cit.), \\"New York Book Review\\" (8 cit.), & a few others.  Why any author would choose to fill 1/4 of a booklet with such extensive citations is unreasonable (unless to avoid plagarism) & is not evidence of originality (perhaps novelty was sought?).<br /><br />Alternative?

Pi...to  10,000 decimal places (whew!).<br /><br />We are given 18 Chapters: includes: -  origins of numbers, Greeks, Euclid, Romans, Archimedes, etc., then digital hunters, Newton, Euler, Monte Carlo method, Transcendence of Pi, those 'modernists' (q.v.) & the computer age.  Each & every chapter (save Chap. 5) is endowed & clothed by figures, formulae & graphs for those readers adequately equipped in geo., trig., logs, & the calculus, etc.  As a whole, this is an intensely interestng chronological history of Pi & of those renowned mathematicians & academicians who invented, exploited or expounded on Pi & related matters.  Especial attention is given to recounting the Romans more as murderers & thugs rather than mathematicians & thinkers (Chap. 5). Some religious commentary is incidental & unrewarding.<br /><br /> The author shuffles, leaps, or waltzes from tantalizing tidbits of information we've either mislearnt, learnt or long forgotten in his quest to provide us an entertaining & learned discussion of mathematicians & their tools (ruler/compass) used to arrive at Pi, a transcendental number: hence,  circles cannot be squared. Beckmann dispenses nicely  with Carl Theodore Heisel's claims to the contrary.  The format of \\"The Golden Ratio\\" (story of Phi) by Mario Livio mimics Beckmann's book in its display of divagations (which in reality is a plus).<br /><br />For those having interests in mathematics & history of numbers, etc., this book serves its purposes.  Petr Beckmann disavows himself as historian or mathematician but this book would seem to prove otherwise.  He knows & loves his numbers & respects the ingenious mathematicians responsible.  The \\"History of Pi\\" is a delightful text to share the same shelf with Livio's \\"TGR: The Story of Phi\\".  Its a steal.	2005-03-30

This #13 gives us the familiar list of characters: --CME Dr. Kay Scarpetta, SA Benton Wesley, Det. Pete Marino & niece Lucy Farinelli -- all of whom interact with a dead girl's family, an inept coroner & that weirdo off-center Edgar Allan Pogue.<br /><br />Herein, we learn that Kay, having been fired from her CME job in Virginia but now having a new office in Florida, is summoned by Dr. Joel Marcus, her incompetent replacement coroner, to investigate the unexplained death of 14-year-old Ms. Gilly Paulsson.  We become familiar with Gill's mother Suzanne & the father Dr. Frank Paulsson, a Flight Surgeon who allegedly harasses female pilots & whose examination of Lucy proves to be a misadventure.  Pete gets totally drunk & experiences a soulfully painful south-of-the-border affliction which requires the personal scrutiny & attentiveness of Dr. Kay who confesses she's not totally naive but maintains her inhibited professionalism with the aid of Betadine.<br /><br />For Scarpettatina fans, this novel will nicely fulfill their needs; besides we are witnesses to those impoverished male characterization attributes as gross professional ineptness (Joel), drunkedness (Pete), sociopathy (Edgar) & sexual deviancy (Dr. Frank).  The plot is relatively narrow & thus easy to digest along with those diverse tidbits of fustian goings on so the reader is inspired & energized to fill in those blanks on unresolved issues which ordinarily are meted out in great particulars.  We are no longer privy to the intrigues & novel mysterisms found in her earlier books, \\"Postmortem\\", \\"The Body Farm\\" or \\"Cruel and Unusual\\", etc., and so things have changed. The binding, print & layout are superb.  Perhaps we are spoiled by watching too much TV \\"CSI\\", but \\"Crossing Jordan\\" is a blessing & only gets better.essing & only gets better.	2005-03-23

Basically, this is a secluded retreat where human corpses are placed on surfaces, buried, or submerged in water -- Then, photos & diverse inquires made of rate of decomposition, saponification, mass, temperature, destruction by maggots, hornets, beetles, etc., & remains (teeth, bones, chemicals) for purpose of using data to determine sex, race, age, size and time since death (time of death) for forensic purposes.<br /><br />The book's voice Dr. Bass, written by Jefferson, is in a cozy, mindful & quick-witted style affording appropriate insight into death, dying & the dead. All told, an autobiography (irregular time-line) of Dr. Bass, revealing lives & deaths of his parents, 3 marriages, his heart problem, success & notoriety of the Body Farm, & his achievements & personal recognition by peers.  His self-satisfaction attitude is deserved, his drollery is homespun. To read this book is to then know Dr. Bass. He's one of the good guys...	2005-02-27

Author uses abject word choices, solecism or inaccuracies in medical/forensic phrasing as, i.e., (pg. 27) \\"since female humans are predisposed to pregnancy and childbirth\\" is non-comedic, corny.  Why not say \\"childbearing women\\" and use 2 not 9 words.

B/W illust., & 5 pg. excellent bibliography.<br /><br />An author with illustrious writing BG including 30 novellas, chiefly medical topics, assuredly researched his subjects carefully before entertaining us with delightful, engaging and illuminating anecdotes of their afflictions, be real or imagined.  A seasoned writer, he is able to instill humor without destroying the targets of his quill, at most merely humanizing them.<br /><br />We are given a table of contents, an index of 7 patient categories (Rulers, Kings/Queens, Literary, Arts, MD/RN, Commoners, & Fictional) and 31 names of well-known subjects, each dealt with in average of 6-8 pages which makes for comfortable reading.<br /><br />Adroitness in language is superb -- sometimes tongue in cheek but always informative, genuine, and effervescent.  A medical doctor myself and privy to the cult of amorphous medical jokes generally associated with our profession, Gordon's \\"AHFDP...\\" differs by relating association of factual people to their own maladies (exceptiing Lady Macbaeth, Baron Munchausen & Sherlock Holmes).

Leaving, they meet troublesome racism of 1964 as Civil Rights Law enacts.  Lily desperately seeks information on her dead mother's past, & Rosaleen determines to become a registered voter.  In Tiburon, S.C., a town name scrawled on a picture belonging to Lily's mother, they are directed to the home of the Boatwright's, three bee-keeper sisters named May, June and August -- and coincidences just keep coming.<br /><br />We learn much about broken families, racism, sharing, religious faith abetted by \\"Black Madonna\\" and poignant insight into the raptures of adolescent loneliness, flights of fantasy & nuturing instincts.  Naturally, there is much ado about bees and  honey.  Perceptive & sensitive, the novel caters toward womankind but is powerful reading & has no bounds on readership.<br /><br />An outstanding first novel by a gifted writer who puts spit and polish on each word, seasoned writers must admire and be envious of her fluid style.  As an old-fashioned cardiologist, I found the book heart-touching & it would make a great gift for any special occasion or just because.	2005-02-19

Promoted as \\"A Picture Book of Sex for Children and Parents\\", I fear today's society will be inclined to view the book as permissive if not overly licentious.  The B/W photographs of genitalia, etc. are explicit and encompass age groups from the very young to adult -- pre-puberal erections and some genital touchings between the sexes is depicted.  I am not aware of any book comparable to this illustrated primer that fills the needs of sexual education so well -- but I do recall the apprehension and fury when this book was first marketed, a time before AIDS was discovered and before teen-age pregnancies flourished.<br /><br />Knowing many parents strenuously object to having public schools provide sex education for their children, this book might be one these parents could utilize to provide illustrated factual information.  This book does not mention the bird and the bees.	2005-02-18

So yes, there's urgency in deciphering clues & locating the 2nd victim before her grisly death. Provocative use is made of many forensic specialists.<br /><br />We are inundated by Gardner's minutely detailed guesome & macabre autopsy findings, of abused both living & dead bodies by unsavory fauna of flies, maggots, crawling creatures, acids, mud & we experience insufferable heat felt by search party members & victims.  We learn of survival & search/rescue techniques used to overcome hostile milieu that tests the strength & fragility of the human condition.  A double whammy \\"Hitchcockian\\" ending is  satisfying & muses \\"Why Do Murderers Murder?\\"<br /><br />The author's alternation of passages between murderer, his quarry & the \\"good guys\\" (Kimberly, Mac, et al) is sorta choppy like Huxley's \\"Point Counterpoint\\" -- &  p. 145 commentary \\"...to find oxygen in air that was 90 percent water\\" over-reaches.

Brown renders a suspense novel using the main characters of Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon and the brilliant, single but enigmatic scientist Vittoria Vetra, our same Langdon starring in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  So yes, there are rampant maniacal  killings cleverly planned by a resurgent undergound Brotherhood, long considered vanished, and known as the Illuminata whose mission is to destroy Catholicism by targeting the Pope and  Religiose, 165 Cardinals who must gather to elect new Papal authority.<br /><br />Langdon is first called to Switzerland's CERN but then departs to Rome, convinced he is morally obligated to provide his academic symbological expertise to help solve the worst of impious assassinations by unraveling clues that furnish whereabouts of the Illuminati who'll kill by ancient means of Earth, Air, Fire and Water but have now turned to modern nuclear destructive devices.  The intrigues are well played out and finalized with a Hitchcock ending.<br /><br />Brown's command of technical, romantic, religious, historical and cryptographic matters is expertly handled.  Two inveiglements,  small maps, one of Modern Rome and the other of Vatican City, were teasers and I yearned for more illustrations of places and things detailed in this book.  Comparatively, having just read \\"Trinity\\" by Wm. DeNesi and \\"Alone\\" by Lisa Gardner, Dan Brown's \\"Angels & Demons\\" impels us a step further and despite being drawn-out, I found it not only agreeable to read but left me with a delightful little \\"buzz\\" in the brain.  Brown knows his material and in a nutshell, I say \\"damn but he's good!\\"  Some Catholics will express their concerns on the matters Vatican, but this is a novel, not a decree.  Hollywood should look at this one.  Read it!	2005-02-13

Alicia Scott).  Gardner at her finest renders a suspense novel entwining lives of police sniper Bobby Dodge and Boston socialite Catherine Gagnon with those messed-up lives of their ovn parents and  \\"lustmord\\" of pedophilist Richard Umbrio.  So yes, there's rape abduction, police homicides, and an escalating mess of murder by knife, hanging?, gun -- by chilling variant divating means.<br /><br />We are immersed into finely-tuned and researched machinations of SWAT techniques, of alleged spousal & child abuse, of aftermath of incest, pedophilia and inappropriate use of financial and judicial power, and importantly a heartening and occasionally disheartening look into survival techniques used by people suffering from imperfections and fragility of the human condition and where the bottom line rings true that blood runs thicker than thieves.<br /><br />Gardner's command of language, be it technical, romantic, carnal, or merely weaving fact with fiction is simply superb -- when novels get this good it is hard to say enough and I'd love to have a signed copy.  Deservedly, I give it 5***** without hesitation.	2005-02-06

To accomplish this he's assigned several teachers to tutor him in Italian 101, and thusly the reader is made familiar with terms as \\"Buon giorno\\" and \\"Grazie,\\" etc.<br /><br />This is an endowment for those readers who are either fully immersed in spy and counter-spy novels or who want to have the intimate savor of a foreign city, especially well-researched Bologna.  I found the book contrived, events predictable and not especially challenging so it was easy reading.  I found only one mispelled word on page 81.  And yes, there is no sex in this novel.  I think an inveiglement as photos and illustrations of the magnificent cities of Italy, particularly Bologna would have helped.	2005-02-02

There are 8 textual pages with a useful introductory prologue and interview by Dian Hanson -- additional textual material is minimal and it references Stuart's 1st film \\"The Lost Door\\" just released, and the author states future works will be confined to cine.<br /><br />Thus, Stuart claims this as his last book, one that is preceded by 3 prior volumes using a similar large format to feature erotic photography which some will decry as out and out pornography, and is the first to include a DVD.  Those familiar with Stuart's work will find this 4th volume on the cutting edge and pushing the barriers of erotic art in the same manner as were attempts at space exploration in breaking the sound barrier or taking the first setp on the Moon.  It may particularly irritate, offend and infuriate those of the western cultures (Judeo-Christian) whose  religious organizations' persuasions will allow many of them to be excessively troubled and deploring of Stuart's brash, boldly explicit and colorful eroticizations.  The interview by Dian is illuminative and should be read by readers & viewers of Stuarts's \\"....Fourth Body\\" where the term fourth body does not indicate nor refer to volume #4, but references a sphere of centralian existence transcending carnal, natural body and mind to true consciousness (existentialism).<br /><br />Stuart dislikes the artificiality of modern day glamour, erotic and overtly pornographic art which is devoted to and depicts women lacking bodily hair (pubo-axillary & extremities) and often sans eroticism as not better than wholesale pornography at its worst: he believies this can be attributed at least in part to a giving in to contrived societal pressures imposed by the bath and beauty establishment whose mission is to sell razors, chemicals and depilatory cremes, etc.<br /><br />People (woman) then become the objects depicted by advertisers and advertisements -- they are transformed into who the corporate world portrays they should be (its all about money).<br /><br />Some appreciation might be found in making interpretations between aesthetic and erotic art forms and why one form over another?  This book does lower the perceived societal bar on the level of what the western world culture accepts as \\"erotic\\" art.  I would place it in the same general category of books as \\"Forbidden Erotica:  The Rottenberg Collection, ISBN  3-8228-6413-7 (Taschen).

The author of some 10 (+/-) books on divers subjects as the X-Files, Buffy the Vampire, Urban Legends and the like, has developed a fluent writing skill together with ability to both explain and clarify technical matters in a lively manner without being wordy.  The author obtained source input from 427 contributing individuals and also made direct contact with 30 policing agencies, public and private labs, and teaching facilities to be both current and accurate in the rapidly evolving science of forensics.<br /><br />Using appropriate and at times incredible case studies, this raconteur provides a narrative-type casebook placing it apart from the usual cold or aloof and detached textbooks.  There is a helpful contents table listing the 5 chapters covering the scene of the crime, and \\"working the scene\\" for evidence, body human, different stages (bombs, computers), and skills (animal and photographic).  There are amusing anecdotes, references to TV, book, and movie plots and to some well-publicized crimes and criminals plus helpful illustrations.  The bibliography is excellent and the book includes 2 helpful Appendicies listing (A) requirements, duties and salaries for the various specialists in forensics, and (B) a worthy listing of teaching institutions offering instruction in CSI.<br /><br />The author's use (p. 98-101) of the term \\"splatter\\" (Ugh!) for blood stains departs from the accepted and conventional word \\"spatter\\" used in the U.S. would suggest possible Canadian influence or naivete.  In DNA discussion the reference is made (p. 150) to C,T,A,G as \\"proteins\\" -- in reality these are purine or pyramidine bases found in nucleic acids.  The discussion of National Geographic's manipulated photo of moving \\"one of the Great Pyramids a little closer to the other\\" (p. 217) is incorrect, as the change made involved altering a horizontal format into a vertical format to accomodate a cover photo (to keep the Nat.Geo.

Unbeknownst to his wife Betty, he secretly amasses a small fortune he boastfully reveals to his best but inept straggler friend Mark.<br /><br />Though \\"happily\\" married with children, Steve has one too many addictions:  he (1) is a fantasizing philanderer with a proclivity for Junoesque bosomy women he meets in bars or the workplace, (2) becomes regularly immersed in Martinis, (3) has inventive machiavellian hustler skills and (4) is overly narcissistic.<br /><br />As is true with most addicts and addictions, \\"just one or two more and it's quits,\\" Steve manages to jump most of the hurdles and run most of the bases -- but he is stopped short at home plate.  And, as in Nature, there can be that eerie calm before the storms.<br /><br />Payne's novel is itself addicting.  It provides an interesting itinerary of places, a litany of characters and revealing of some tragic consequences of the imperfections of the human condition.  Steve is somebody you would like to hate but you also almost come to love this bastard whose Ego got laid by his Id.  The story line is not one to be easily forgotten.

Newman strives to separate truths from the fabrications and, if feasible, facts from the legends but warns us her book is a 'companion' to the aforementioned.<br /><br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has an abstruse amount of fascinating literal chronicaled details within the text of a fictional novel and this makes it nearly impossible or at least a most challenging and difficult task to reconcile veracity between fabricated or legendary data with unpolluted materiality.  In her book she points out errors and improbabilities in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" but additionally clarifies and gives colloquy or discourse on legendary and factual material and provides a substantial list of books for Recommended Reading with footnotes to source material.<br /><br />Newman gives an authoritative commentary on the people, places and times referenced in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" in an illuminating and affirmative fashion.  The author's speciality of medieval research gives life and sheds considerable truths and a lot of understanding to the intrigues, trivia and extraordinary events chronicaled in Dan Brown's novel \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" (which I'm told is to be made into a movie).  Sharan's book has worthy inveiglements as inclusion of modest number of old medieval prints, etc., and the author's occasional whimsical sense of humor is appealing.

I will only name the main intriguing characters: Symbologist Robert Langdon,  Agent Sophie Neveu and Curator Jacques Sauniere who have relationships to the Opus Dei, a keystone, Cryptex, Masons, Knights Templar, the Holy Grail and so much more.<br /><br />There is an abundance of fascinating chronicaled facts in this well-woven novel and it is sometimes difficult to separate fact from fiction,  fabricated from legendary.  It is a sexual book but not about sex.  The dissertation on diverse codes and 'word games' is engaging but frustrating if we are wont to figure it out on our own. It's unnecessary to condemn this book, written as a novel, as \\"anti-Catholic.\\"<br />The author has extensive authoritative command of sundry, disparate areas of knowledge which are inspiring and attest to his research & the attention he paid to weaving intrigue, trivia and legends in poignant style. It is an amazing, absorbing, and accomplished mystery story where the reader gradually learns who really are the good vs. the bad guys.  This is a must read which takes little effort to open the cover, especially with the illustrations! -- then the book's enticements take over.  Worthy inveiglements relate to codes within the book, some of which are smoke and others allegorical and the later edition which is nicely illustrated and features prints of historic places of Europe that are discussed in the text and are well-received.  Do get this illustrated edition!  The book's price is more than fair.	2005-01-09

An inveiglement might be a map of Southern California, imprimis Orange County.  I, and you also, will be looking forward to more books by this eloquent author.

MacCurry, Baltimore: PublishAmerica Pub., 2003  ISBN  1-59129-979-9  PB, 176 Pp., is a well-written detective novella or story about vengeance and retribution which involves PI Joe Lane, a former Sheriff, who is set-up as fall-man for a young stripper's death.  His own daughter had been previously murdered with some similar details.  The story has a good mix of liquor, tobacco, car chase, stabbing, shooting, friendship, sex and more sex to keep the reader attentive.  I refrain to say more less give this story away.<br /><br />Helpful was the author's career as criminal investigator so any rough edges to this first novel needs little more than fine sandpaper.  All total I found but two missspelled words.  Agreed, the cover once opened -- this is one book not easily put down until the last page is read!  Just as women are wont to read 'romance' novels, this would be the male indulgence.  The book is forceful, concise and can be recommended for adults young and old, and for both sexes.  I look forward to more books by MacCurry.	2004-12-10

Brian King, Burbank: Bloat Publ. Co., 1996.  ISBN 0-9650324-0-X  PB 314 pp., is a panoply of 37 murderers (with and without accomplices) whose crimes, chronicled in alphabetical order, are substantially written in the 1st person or snared from their confessions, self portrayls, or proclammations.  The text is decently acccompanied by useful bibliography.<br /><br />  Unlike most books on crimes and criminals, Brian King (?fittingly) chose to have the book's preface written by serial killer Herbert Mullin.  \\"Lustmord\\" is Germanic and candidly translates to \\"pleasure killing\\" -- the book is replete with such accounts, often told in such minute sordid details that elements of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) appear tantamount in a number of cases.<br /><br />  This is not a book one must read sequentially, i.e., cover-to-cover, since the organization is extrinsic, simply alphabetical.  Most cases occurred after WW II, the majority were in the US, a few in the UK. In \\"Lustmord\\" the themes of gross sexual perversion and banality become entwined with a variety of schizophrenic and schizoid behaviours and oft times sheds suggestive insight into possible origins of goaded deviancy.  I suggest the book be reserved for readers with at least a modest background in medicine or psychology - it is truly morbid.  Alternativly, it does serve as an excellent reference source for information on the graceless and muddled deranged eccentricitiies of the \\"worst of the worst\\".	2004-12-07

Paul de River, MD, FACS.  A brief lucid intro. by Eugene Williams (Frmr. DA of L.A.) precedes an imposing 50-page prelude  (Brian King) which chronicles de River's background & initial employment by LAPD as psychiatrist who founded the first Sex Offense Bureau (1937) after preparing (perhaps the first recorded) forensic profiling (1937) of Albert Dyer, subsequently convicted & hung (1938) for triple sexual child slayings, decades in advance of FBI's VICAP. (Justice was swift in those days).<br />  Captious exposition is provided on the politics and the corruption within LAPD and of the travesty & rumble caused by revelations on child killer Chloe Davis (1940) and murdered Elizabeth Short (\\"Black Dahlia\\", 1947).  With 4 other brutal L.A. sexual slayings within 6 months, Cal. PC Sec. 290 was passed with the help of Dr. de River in 1947 & it required sex offender registration some 50 years before \\"Megan's Law\\".  King's 39-page Appendix (Chap. 5) details 4 high-profile cases that de River studied.<br />  Dr. J. Paul de River expatiates (4 chapters) the essentials & 10 sub-divisions of Sadism (algolagnia), Masochism, Criminal Investigation, and finally Study in Crime which compiles 6 viewpoints on the sexual criminal as seen from prision, justice system, police officer, crime writer, criminal attorney (sanity issues), and psychological interrogation and investigation.<br />  The book did find use as a teaching text at the time it was written. It is a truly scholarly text written by a shrewd psychiatrist who was largely self-taught because no academic courses existed in medical schools on the criminal study of sexual deviants.  It is dated, however, by obsolescence of certain terminology and a modernized & re-defined psychiatric classification, i.e. homosexuality is no longer considered sexual persions, etc.<br />  The Book has many good features and documents the author rubbing shoulders and trading punches with some of the most well-know politicians and law enforcement peoples of that era (1930's - 1940's).<br />  The 5 1/2\\" by 7\\" format, excellent & essential psychiatric glossary, and puissance of pertinent and grisly graphic photos puts it high on my recommended list. (Note is made that Ernest E. Debs made public notice de River's book was pornographic and its access should be limited).  The author's personal convictions on seriousness of sexual criminal behavior, his prediction of its increasing prevalence in society, and his foresight in beginning and directing a Sex Offense Bureau, and use of sexual criminal  profiling makes him a major contributor to the study of sexual criminals.  He was flamboyant, he was brilliant, and he was a family man who adopted a daughter and cared for his sickly wife who succumbed to ALS.

Maples, Ph.D. & forceful journalist S.E. Regional correspondent \\"Miami Herald\\"  Michael Browning  who, together, detail the \\"Strange and Fascinating Cases of a Forensic Anthropologist.\\"<br /> We are furnished 16 chapters which cover Maples' upbringing in Dallas, his majoring in English with minor in biology at Univ. of Texas with studies under mentor Tom McKern. In time, Maples became curator-in-charge of the Human Identification Laboratory at the Florida Museum of Natural History & was a former Pres. of the Amer. Board of Foren. Anthropology and is diplomate - FAAFS.<br /> The book is not a teaching text nor is it especially easy to read with that expectation. Maples gives us a background of how and why he got into forensics, a fairly detailed review of his personal involvement with several world-class high-profile cases, and then closes with some not inconsiderable rancor and acridity directed toward law enforcement and medical doctors. I think Maples' credentials and his \\"time served\\" qualifies him to provide constructive analysis: - but hostile criticisms do peregrinate throughout the book, admixed with bountiful self-adulations where we are wont to reflecting a bit more on the inner satisfactions of one's life work and less on brackishness, and one's own indispensability.<br /> The book has many good features and certainly the author has rubbed shoulders with some of the best (Dr. Michael Baden, Bill Bass, Tom McKern, Ellis Kerley, etc.), and he does have a very commendable command of narrative prose with story-telling skills which makes for eceptionally delightful reading. Unquestionably, his personal involvement with the bones of \\"Elephant Man\\", Francisco Pizarro, Pres. Zachary Taylor, Tzar Nicholas II & family, etc., makes exceptionally attractive reading material.<br />  I found the table of contents, 9 pages of index and the 61 superb x-ray & photographic illustrations in this medium 6\\" x 9\\" format commendable, then wished I had the H/C edition.

The early teasing by play- and schoolmates, alleged (but denied) beatings by father, loathsome torture of animals, early exposure to sexuality and loss of mother, swinger life style & extramarital affairs, insatiable sex urges (and practices) and other deviant behavioral diversions and/or perversions including road rage and arson were manifest in this 6'6\\" 250-pound murderer who played strangulation games with his victims.  Olsen graphically describes these events as they were happening.<br />  Olsen's alternation of chapters between the killer and the killer-to-be has some reminisces of 'flash-backs' but is a bit clumsy, although the use of many quotations and a sense of being written in the first person provides a chilling recital of the angry child who is transformed into a depraved narcissistic serial killer totally lacking remorse, but mocks authority and moral principles.<br />  I found the table of contents disturbing by its absence, but there is a 5-page index and 11 worthy illustrations.  The last 2 chapters were of especial interest to me and provided a unique slant about maniacal antisocial personality disorders.  Because of its novel features the book should be on the list of must read.	2002-09-04

Dr. Baden discusses some of the little known but extremely significant political intrigues he encountered, revealing facts known only to certain medical examiners, DA's, politicians in high office and prominent family members.<br />  The introduction describes the pseudo-victimization \\"abduction\\" of T. Brawley (1987) and 12 chapters follow with Chap. 1 detailing Dr. Baden's selection to head forensic pathology for the 1977 Congressional Select Committee on Assassination (JFK); Chap. 2 his studies at Bellevue; Chap. 3 some notes on Elvis Presely, the Nurses Perez & Narcisco Pavulon deaths prosecution blocked by Imelda Marcos, and the ricin death of Markov (1978); Chap. 4 with concise notes on history of coroner system and Chap. 5 details Baden's confrontations with NYC Mayor Koch, Manhattan DA Robert Morganthau, and Health Commissioner Ferrer over handling of the David Levine, Willie Welch, Robert Soman, and Nelson Rockefeller cases, to mention a few.<br />  Chapters that follow are lucrative and revealing of forensic science at its best and politics at its worst.  The accusations against Claus von Bulow of twice trying to murder his wife \\"Sunny\\" by insulin injections revealed a frightening tribunal jungle of medical & legal specialists whose main concern was (evidently) to thwart possible perceived malpractice charges.  For unrevealed & appalling details of the 'preppy murder' of Jennifer Levin by Robert Chambers (discussed on the Larry King show Aug. 26, 2002) look in this book.

It is a well-written and indexed (19 pp) mind-probing study of violent evildoers which seeks to observe why misdeeds are committed in especial ways and how that may indicate who (UNSUB) did the particular crime.<br />  Douglas had two decades with the FBI (with teaching and investigative assignments) Behavorial Science Unit (BSU) at Quantico and he discloses the field practice of applied criminal psychology to the crime scenes, forensic evidences and interrogation techniques.<br />  An extensive listing and/or recital of many high profile cases is looked to - including Manson, Berkowitz, Speck, Gacy, Zamora, Pierre &amp; Andrew, Ross, Nickell, List, Coleman &amp; Brown, Cunanan, and Kaczynski is but to highlight a few.

Francois of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.  An additional 16 pages of photos show the victims, crime scene, killer, and forensic principals.  A final 9 pages cover some confounding legalities of premature guilty pleading in capital crimes.<br />  The book's presentation is interesting, appearing firstly to be jumping around but the reader discovers this is a likely ploy paralleling the confused thought processes or machinations of Kendall who forgot about one of the eight victims he'd killed and put in his attic.  Kendall's M.O. was static, his signature (bathing) intriguing, but his motive elusive and not a factor in conviction, certainly a rarity in itself.<br />  We have opportunity to witness the downside of sovereignty and non-cooperative jurisdiction of Town, City, State and Federal policing authorities until a serial killer is suspected.  Rosen took some potshots as: &quot;Law enforcement's continued reliance on the outmoded, ineffectual and unproved FBI serial killer organized and disorganized modality does nothing to help in catching these criminals.&quot;  But, is this fair game when there are no bodies and no crime scenes?<br />  All in all, I found the book interesting as a recital of an otherwise incongruous story of a killer stashing bodies (unbeknownst to family) in the attic and basement of his parent's home near the Vassar and Marist Colleges in Town and City of Poughkeepsie.

Indeed, she skillfully introduces and outlines, in a series of 11 chapters, the crime scene and the elements of crime scene reconstruction including criminal logic, deceptions, and forensic puzzles &amp; methodology in up-to-date evidence collection.  Indeed, the last chapter &quot;Evidence Response&quot; is especially well presented.<br />  Aside from the oft encountered confusion in definition of &quot;trace evidence&quot;, the book is excellent from the standpoint of crime scene coverage, categorization of forensic methodologies, and readability.  It has an excellent glossary (13 p.), consequential references (4 p.), and helpful index (11 p.).  The book is informative, well organized, priced fairly and is thusly recommended.	2002-08-03

Pincus, MD, ISBN 0-393-32323-4 pbk, Norton & Co. 2001:  a 225 page disquisition plus 13 pages of notes by a NYU Professor of neurology & psychiatry and graduate of Columbina CPS who investigated some 150 murderers over a 25-year period and tenders his unified theory that \\"killers kill for the same reasons,\\" regardless of their classifications (single, mass, serial, & perhaps genocidal).<br /> Pincus observed that killing arises in the milieu and troika of disturbances which generally discloses (1) childhood abuses (sexual, verbal, physical), (2) frontal lobe damage (birth trauma, chromosomal, genic, infectious, toxic as alcohol & drugs), and (3) a medley of mental (neuro-psychiatric) impairments e.g. bipolar depresssion, paranoia, ADHD, CD, ODD, etc.  He hypothesizes that single, mass, and serial killings have similarities with the Nazi/Hitler's paranoid anti-Semitism, Gaza Strip atrocities and various terrorist factions of more recent vintage.<br />  He opines the only feasible remedy would be prevention of child abuse and cites pilot studies underway, and also specifies factors impeding implementation of other remedies including treatment of convicted murderers.  He details his basic neurologic testing format including specific tests directed at eliciting impairment of the frontal lobes, the latter being somnething he states most/many neurological examiners fail to do.  Dr. Pincus has worked successfully on a number of defense cases aimed at getting death sentences switched to life without parole.<br /> The treatise is not overly technical, the writing style is a bit wordy, and very minor detractions were noted (i.e. XYY in not a chromosomal deficit but a chromosomal excess or defect; Trisomy 21 is no longer referred to as mongolism but Down's syndrome; and this reader is skeptical that someone could & would  drink a 12-pack of beer and a pint of whiskey in 45 minutes (one can every 3.75 minutes & not counting the hard liquor).<br />  This study is an important contribution to the study of homicide and it provides engaging thought-provoking commentary on what makes murderers murder and also a workable solution to the problem of homocides.

ISBN 0-471-25466-5 (Cloth) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999 is a 254 page publication by an aspiring journalist-turned-author who updated his 1990 book of the same title in an apparent treble sort of writing mode which suggests the old, the new and the somewhat alien.<br />  He provides 10 chapters, the first 5 of which are devoted to the crime scene and trace evidence.  In this they are adequate but be wont to dispute the book's title as misleading since this is straight-forward criminalistics or forensics - but the style is not particularly notable for exposition or grammatical clarity.  Chapter 6, &quot;The Mind and Brain of the Violent Criminal&quot; is poorly documented, fragmented and leaves some posed construals unanswered.  Chapters 7-10 appears to be more in focus with the writer's expertise but carry a cautionary askance if not candidly apprehensive warnings on criminology and the justice system whilst discussing data collection, electronic surveillance, controlling of criminals, computers, and &quot;Liberty, Justice and Science&quot; in Chapter 10.  In many ways these personal trepidations of the author may be true.  This reader, however, believes this is not the proper forum in which to express personal views and it detracts from its use as a viable reference textbook.  Chapter 7, &quot;Electronic Surveillance...&quot; is well-written; well-encompasses the subject, and was especially informative.<br />  The author is to be commended for his concluding &quot;Author's Note&quot; indicating his book has been used as &quot;supplemental reading...(forensic science) mostly at the high school level,&quot; and this is in keeping with the forward by the well-known Henry C. Lee who wrote it &quot;bridges a gap between the basic and the advanced....&quot;  It makes make for easy reading and for that reason alone can be recommended as an introduction to forensics with commentary.with commentary.	2002-07-06

Perseus Publishing 2001 is a 270 page discourse (including 10 page index) written by a seasoned freelance science journalist.  Sachs provides us with the historical interest in and the subsequent development of a multitude of devises used to arrive at the best 'Time Of Death' (TOD = Ger. Death) that ofttimes may reveal the why, where, when, whom (and whom not) of an unexplained death.<br />  Sachs proffers physician Antistius of Rome as the first forensic 'pathologist' (mass murder plot on Julius Caesar in 44 B.C.), reviews the classic triad of rigor, algor, and livor mortis (reliability generally limited to 48 hours post death), and discusses ongoing search for those time markers which may critically span hours, days, weeks, months, years and decades using analyses of vitreous humor, cadaver impedance, and the singly and combined forensics of entomology, botany, and anthropology with a discussion of the &quot;Bugs, Bones, and Botany&quot; death-investigation workshops for cops and coroners devised by Byrd and Hall by the late 1990's.<br />  Sachs examines the more recent pursuits to pinpopint time of death by probing and quantifying specific insect (e.g. Diptera) and plant DNA profiles, cadaver soil leachates, aroma patterns, relative ratios of amino acids and degradation product assays (e.g. cadaverine, putrescine, GHB and GABA) of decomposed flesh.  A shrewdly-written succint but highly informative must read inquiry for those professing to be informed on 'Time of Death'.  The price is right and I'd suggest the hardcover edition.	2002-06-26

Such information is often critical in indicting and convicting or dismissing suspects in deaths from natural, accidental, suicidal, unknown, or homocidal causes.<br /> More than a potpourri of intensely interesting forensic cases solved or confirmed by forensic entomology, the author provides 10 chapters which move from discussion of entomology, maggots, flies, to the identification of human remains and the nature of crime, criminals and the justice system.  Chapter 4 \\"Foul, Strange and Unnatural\\" describes some grisly cases and the author muses about those evils perpetrated today contrasted to those in times long gone and proffers that \\"meaningless violence now occurs during times of peace and prosperity,\\" and that the modern  day vandal \\"derives pleasure from distress it causes others.\\"  He is loathe to openly discuss the feral things he has seen done to children.  He is aghast at those who give \\"serious talk about the 'rights' of paedophiles to indulge their desires\\" and who assert these paedophiles \\"are yet another persecuted minority.\\"  He is concerned about societal fragmentation by the agency of moral relativism.  Dr. Erzinclioglu regards some values/actions as \\"sacrosanct and inviolable.\\"<br /> Reference is given to the initial application of DNA using PCR in Chapter 7 and of the \\"coffin\\" scuttle fly Conicera tibialis which can locate a corpse 6 feet underground, and he provides comnmentaries in Chapter 8 \\"Past Times\\" of the four plagues of Egypt (O.T.), and coverage of myiasis (obligate and/or facultative parasitic maggot feeding on live flesh) with specific references to King Antiochus IV Epiphanes (Syria), Herod the Great, King Herod Agrippa (Judea), Pheretima, etc., and reviews some of the unique problems of myiasis in domesticated versus indigenous mammals of different continents.<br /> The Medicinal application of maggot therapy is well-covered in Chapter 9 that is replete with major tropical maladies, parasitology, and of the scientists who made discoveries leading to effective treatments and observations of maggot infestation in the Napoleonic, American Civil and the Great Wars.<br /> In the final 25 pages, Chapter 10, the author articulates those perceived flaws and weaknesses he detected within the forensics of the Criminal Justice System (CJS), an adversarial system betwixt barristers.  Elements of corruption on occasion were observed within the police system regarding creditability of evidence.  The Home Office Forensic Science Service (HOFSS) under the CJS evolved into a 'privatized' FSS agency where cost factor by and by ordained the extent and type of forensic studies available to the prosecution. Frumpy & unqualified \\"muddy-water\\" consultants emerged as \\"specialists\\", plying their expertise through defence barristers.  Since April 1999 scientific witnesses within the British Civil Justice System are no longer adversarial but answerable to the judge alone: This is not yet the case within the Criminal Justice System.<br />  All in all, there is much more to this book than reviewed above.  It is a scholarly work, written in a style which does not yield to cursory reading but with provoking commentary on those societal, judicial, and scientific issues that should insure a large audience for this exposition.<br /> I would have liked to have seen a few illustrations of the various commonly encountered flies and maggots that were discussed, but references are provided for me to do so.  A mystery to this reviewer is substitution of Pica pica with a member of the Muscidae family. To wit: the book's opening quotation taken from 'Who Killed Cock Robin?' Anon. is given as 'Who saw him die?', 'I' said the Fly...'  is at variance with my library version which reads 'I', said the Magpie, 'with my little eye, I saw him die' from \\"Poor Cock Robin\\" printed in \\"Favorite Poems for Children\\" Ed. by Holly Pell McConnaughy.

St. Martin's 2000 is a 301 page account (including 18 photographs and an adequate index) of 16 unique and baffling mysteries admirably presented by veteran author Miller who warns the reader that most forensic excursions are not spectacular and he succumbed to collecting those \\"exceptional enough to hold a reader's attention,\\" something he readily accomplished. All cases were based on true events, albeit, the names, places and some incidents were altered, but forensics remained genuine.<br /> Miller's ploy was presenting these cases, oft macabre, in a titillating fashion which presents to the reader's mind both the intuititive reasoning and troubling frustrations tediously overcome by dedicated diligence of forensic detectives. The grisly and deplorable acts are methodically traceable to the underlying motives in virtually each instance, and this works to advantage to find closure on especial cases which might otherwise seem inexplicable.<br /> The book's style makes for easy but informative reading, and its one of those books that once started is hard to put down; and having read one or more cases (15 to 20 pages each) the reader feels compelled to recite the details to whomever will hear him out.	2002-06-11

Manhein, ISBN 01402.9192X (pbk), Penguin Books 2000, is a 137 page curiously enticing story-telling recount of Manhein's personal encounter and infatuation with college anthropology which led her to become a working forensic bioanthropologist and Director of Forensic Anthropology and Computer Enhancement Services Laboratory (FACES), forensics instructor (LSU), and deputy coroner.<br />A gifted story teller, she provides an articulate recital of her childhood, then marriage, and finally 'matriculating' at age 33; and she then delves into a dozen or so intriguing cases where she is asked to help provide identification of remains, often just bones and thus she acquires rank as 'The Bone Lady,' and later fellowhip distinction (FAAFS).  The medley of cases provide some modicum about similariy of mammalian bones, grave sites, viewing windows in cast-iron coffins, insights into aging of bone, and differentiation of male vs. female remains.<br />The book yields the &quot;feeling&quot; of field forensics by touching on the politics, stenches, miseries, hazards, grief, closure, and those too few triumphs unearthed by 'The Bone Lady.&quot;  It is well written and easy to read and priced just right.	2002-05-28

Hanssen\\" by Lawrence Schiller: ISBN 0-06-050809-4(2002) HarperCollins Publ., is a 306 page hardcover novelette which strives to present, profile and proseltytize Robert Philip Hanssen (born April 18, 1944) an FBI Special Agent since 1976 who was arrested Feb. 2, 2001 for espionage (15 counts), pled guilty and was sentenced May 10, 2002 to life imprisonment.<br />The reader might be jolted in learning that neither Spy Hanssen nor wife Bonnie were interviewed (DOJ interdiction) by the author Schiller (or confederate Norman Mailer). Schiller's \\"intention\\" was to fabricate a psychological likeness of Hanssen from incidents to divulge his complexities and unique traits during the(ir) nine-month investigation and \\"hundreds of hours interviewing\\" the family, friends, frequenter (KGB), & fellow church followers.<br />What emanates is a strange bedfellow, beset with a rigid OCD personality, whose bedroom marital sexual feats are majestic, whose Narcissism is manifest by pleonastic masturbation and who has a passion for talking to/at/into mirrors.  A man whose insecure wife is appalled to learn of his penchant for Playboy magazine but is amenable to posing nude to fulfill his Polaroid fetish.  His morality is manifest by switching allegiance to his wife's church, joining Opus Dei, and proclaiming moralistic pretensions as he becomes engulfed in espionage with the KGB for big bucks, a diamond, and a better life style for his family.<br />The good news is that \\"Into the Mirror...\\" is easy reading as we are given privy to shallow characters possessing those crude but perhaps interesting para-erotic eccentricities and personal mannerisms which may hold a reader's attention. I had expected a factual investigative journalistic report after Schiller's \\"Perfect Murder, Perfect Town.\\"	2002-05-18

Publishers deserve praise for this elegant edition.<br />There is an excellent, quaint but all too short introductory commentary by photographer Barry Lategan who provides a brief digest of the nude form both historically from Biblical and pre-16th Century Irish churche times down to its present-day employment in advertising, girlie magazines and calendars.  He provides some  reflections on  perceived but not totally explained limitations and restrictions governing male nudity. He also gives an interesting explanation of why horseshoes are hung over door ways, a Celtic custom handed down from olden times.<br />The majority of images are excellent, nicely representative of acknowledged and established photographers of the nude body and I had especial respect for the artisitic works of Herb Ritts (folio of 12 images from \\"Women Through the Ages\\"), Barbara Bordnick, Howard Schatz, Barry Lategan and many others. However, I found Suzanne Opton's \\"Device\\" (from the midriff tragedies) and Nancy & Matthew Sleeth's \\"Venus at Thirty\\" (still no pubic hair?) contrived and of uncertain merit in the context of this book.

Each chapter didactic is followed with a (dozen or so) basic question &amp; answer section with explanations.<br />  The author's impressive credentials in both field and teaching experiences helped condense important basic CSI issues into a short and easily-read synopsis that includes 20 good bibliographic entries and a thorough 6-page index.  A few trivial grammatical flaws are readily discharged, but difficult to justify given computers with spell-checkers, etc.	2002-04-08

It is an extremely well documented historical  accounting of targeted racial/ethnic killings from 1492 to the present.  Especial emphasis and iteration is placed on the well-nigh complete  extermination or genocide of the once populous native North American  Indians.<br />A brief, interesting discussion is provided on the controversial  birth status of Christopher Columbus's extraction and arguements favoring  Italian (Genoese), Spanish, Portuguese, or even Jewish nationality, etc.  Churchill notes there are more than 250 books and articles devoted to and  another 300 essays or folios discussing this issue.<br />Various genocide  references are made: Cambodian (Khmer Rouge), Armenian (Turks), Gypsies,  Poles and Jews (Nazi) and those occurring in North, Central and South  America. Even fetal genocide is mentioned.  Churchill refutes, heatedly  debates and debunks the prevalent and largely American Jewish assertion  that the only true genocide ever to have taken place was the Jewish  Holocaust.<br />A concluding discussion and definition of genocide, actions of  the UN General Assembly and some clarifying of definitions and intents of  meaning in Articles 1-V111 of the Convention on Prevention and Punishment  of Genocide (1948) was very helpful.<br />The book is ponderous reading: the  content is shocking for it departs radically from that which had been  taught in school.  However, Churchill comes off as having written a  masterful account which, once embraced, is difficult to put down until it  has been read.  The all too few picture and the explanatory footnotes are  invaluable.  This is a must read for those who profess to be informed.	2000-08-24

The book is nicely illustrated,  rarely using duplicate photos, in the proper use of barbells and dumbbells  for home use.  Safety is emphasized and though use of gloves is encouraged  they are not shown in illustrations but this does make the correct hand  positions easier to depict.<br /> A concise chapter on nutrition is well  written, emphasizing importance of balanced nutrition and discouraging the  use of amino-acid supplements and megadose vitamin intake as expensive  and/or potentially harmful.  The non-necessity of having to use heavy gym  equipment and motorized devices is appealing.<br /> The introductory history  of Gold's gym is of especial interest to those acquainted with Venice  Beach, CA where Gold's gym began and is ever more popular.  Written by an  expert, Sprague was original owner-operator of Gold's Gyms. He has given us  a useful book of trusted information which includes discussion of reps,  sets, and frequency for optimum muscle development.  The book is suitable  for use by the ever increasing ederly population which has so much to gain  as they live longer.	2000-07-28

The  CIA with its 22,000 full-time employees is clearly explained in terms of  its assemblage, sub-structures and turf battles amongst its four divisions:  Operations, Science and Technology, Intelligience, and Administration, with  a listing of specific areas of responsibilities, achievements, and  methodologies.  Differentiation is made between CIA Officers and Agents,  differences amid the CIA and FBI missions and philosophies, and noting  certain improprieties which led to the Church Committee hearings (1975) and  certain oversight committees including those of General Counsel (legal),  and Inspector General.  The complex shpere of CIA responsibilities is  illuminated by describing a typical &quot;day in the life of&quot; the  Director.<br />The author's experience in investigative reporting permitted  him unusual opportunities to obtain convincing first-hand accountings of  the CIA physical plant, personal interviews with five of the CIA past or  then present CIA Directors, and numerous informants from the FBI and  Congress.<br />To not read &quot;Inside The CIA&quot; is to not know the CIA.	2000-07-23

Wesley Swearingen about his career as Special Agent for the FBI during the period 1951-1977.  The marketing forward by  Ward Churchill (we are not privy to who he is) notes Wesley had the  necessary courage, fortitude and character to reveal the intrinsic  wrongness and illegal doings of the FBI over a span of several  decades.<br />Wesley explains how he was able to muster the requisite  conscience and personal integrity to expose, albeit belatedly, the bigotry,  cheating, lying, burgularizing, wire taps, bugs and unauthorized  surveillances he had participated in or witnessed during 25 years as  Special Agent.  Also emphasized is how the Black Panther Party, the  Weatherman (militant college students of the SDS founded by Thomas Haden)  and individual top political activists were subjected to harassment,  censure and surveillance without due cause.<br />Swearingen is to be commended  for writing about alleged eye-witnessed corruption in the FBI. He  effectively indicts himself as a co-conspirator, something which ordinarily  adds credence to a confession.  As a writer, Wesley's naivete exposes  himself as a haughty Special Agent who is troubled with financial and  personal security, an over zealous need to make faultfinding remarks of his  associates and a total inability to get along with others.  Although it  fails the rule of &quot;It Takes a King to Unseat a King,&quot; the book's  content is revealing, easy to digest, reasonably well arranged and does  give one pause to ponder.	2000-05-30

Hazelwood, former member of the elite  Behavioral Science Unit at Quantico, VA, is an acknowledged authority on  the fantasies and modus operandi  of sexual criminals. The chapters on  autoerotic death and pseudovictimization are especially informative.<br />This book is a useful complement to any criminal behavioral profiling  library. Unfortunately, proof reading by the publishers should have been  taken much more seriously, and this failure detracts from its use as a  scholarly reference source.  Solecism is overly conspicuous and disturbing  throughout the text and magnifies many passages suffering from sundry  abuses of language. The authors' occasional attempts to infuse some  humorous remarks, most of which fell short of their mark, would be better  omitted.<br />Hopefully, reprinting of this book will mandate a close scrutiny  of grammer. Substitution of such words as &quot;the&quot; and  &quot;to&quot;, etc. indicates spell checkers are not a substitute for  tedious textual proofing: -  On rereading this book I downgraded it from a  4 to a 3 based on grammatical error, not lack of useful material.	2000-05-21

Singh provided a touching degree of warmth to the otherwise perceived cool if not cold affectations often associated with mathmaticians and their mystique or oftimes obsessions with numbers in his enticing work  &quot;Fermat's Enigma,&quot; a story woven and embellished by his  thoroughly researched  history of numbers as seen through the eyes of  ambitious mathematician's and viewed in context of the true story of  contemporary mathematician Andrew Wiles whose passion propelled him to  solve a cryptic theorem made by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and which posed a  tempting and baffling riddle for some 350 years.<br />Knowledge of numbers or  higher mathematics is not essential to the reader as Singh introduces these  judiciously, just adequately to whet our appetites and tease us about the  novelty and also delightful simplicity of numbers -  so we can better try  to appreciate the challenge to Wile, his preparation (ostensibly from  childhood) and eventual generally conceded victory re: A^n + B^n = C^n  where (n &gt;2), the Pythagorean to a power cubed or greater.<br />Chapters  &quot;A Mathematical Disgrace&quot; and &quot;A Slight Problem&quot; are  especially well-written. The author appears to have been a bit heavy in the  re-stating of Andrew's quest but this is his main focus. Singh's intriguing  review of historical data and selection of subject matter covering numbers  may have also set the stage for a notable documentary, &quot;The Code  Book,&quot; which discusses the Scherbius's Enigma machine and a few  notables also appearing in Fermat's Enigma. We are wont to wonder if Fermat  had, afterall, a solution himself.  Once begun, the book is hard to put  down until read.	2000-04-28
