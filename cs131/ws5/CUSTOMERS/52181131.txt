Margaret George is a good genre novelist and has done gobs of research, but she does not show us the mind of Henry as vividly as some of the great historians, like Antonia Fraser, or Alison Weir.   Part of the problem, I think, is the gimmick of autobiography--Henry never sounds convincingly English.  It is as if you went to see Anne of a Thousand Days, and instead of Richard Burton playing Henry, its Tom Hanks.   <br />George does better with the character of Will Somers, whose critical comments intrude on Henry's &quot;manuscript&quot; from time to time.  She also does a pretty fair job of explaining a long and complicated span of English history.  Character development tends to be limited to Henry and his six wives and several mistresses, but that is part of the historical romance genre.   The important men in Henry's life: Wolsey, More, Cromwell, Cranmer, come off as cardboard sticks. ( I would have loved to have seen more of the inscrutable Cranmer--now THERE'S   a novel for you.)	2000-12-31

Unfortunately, by the time, someone got the idea to write a book about Kind of Blue, almost evryone present at the creation was already dead.  Of Miles Davis' classic quintet only drummer Jimmy Cobb remains alive to tell the tale. <br />Author Ashley Kahn collects the handful of photographs made at the Kind of Blue session and has combed all available secondary sources to detail what he can about how the album was made.  The trouble is-- even though Kahn was able to listen to the original master tapes-- the session was completed so quickly, there is not much to say about it.  To the musicians involved, it was a couple afternoons' work.  There were just enough takes completed to make an album.  <br />Its like the story of Lincoln at Gettysburg. Lincoln stood up and read his address so quickly the photographer didn't have time to load his camera before the president sat down again. So Kind of Blue remains an unexplainable jewel.  Everyone knew it was good, but no one is quite sure how it got that way.<br />Apparently, Miles Davis, perhaps in consultation with Bill Evans, or perhaps on his own, sketched out a few notes, and five or six hours later, they had an album.  Kahn is not able to pinpoint where one musician's responsibility stopped and another's began, but it is Davis who has gotten most of the credit. It seems obvious that credit is due to Davis' role as a bandleader rather than a gift for actually composing.  <br />You could say Kind of Blue (like Topsy) jes' Grew, but Miles was the artistic ego that shaped it.  And he knew enough to call it done.	2000-12-20

George Eliot hasn't yet gained the modern pop success of Jane Austen or Edith Wharton, but I think its only a matter of time before she catches on in a big way and we see a big. lush movie version of Middlemarch.<br />For now, dont be put off by her novels of great Victorian size.   If you are used to the broad comic brushstrokes of Charles Dickens, you will find Eliot a much subtler artist.  She paints very subtle shades of emotion and morality.  <br />If you have already read Middlemarch, you should seek out Virginia Woolf's essay on Eliot in her book, The Common Reader. Also, Eliot figures highly in Sandra Gilbert's study of Victorian literature, The Madwoman in the Attic.	2000-12-19

This DiMaggio might not be the same Yankee Clipper of our sacred memory, but there is no doubt that Cramer knows how to tell a good story.  Just be warned that it might not be the story you want to hear.<br />This book is closer in tone to Gay Talese's Dimaggio than to Halberstam's more heroic figure from Summer of '49.  Cramer tends to gloss over DiMaggio's sports achievements, spending a good half of the book on the post-retirement years with Marilyn Monroe and a succession of money grubbing lawyers.<br />What you get in the end is a handsome, but grumpy hero who could squeeze a penny till Lincoln screamed.  Joe never stopped loving Marilyn Monroe, but he never stopped loving the idea of himself as hero either.  To the end of his days he sent roses twice a week to Marilyn's grave and insisted on being introduced as &quot;America's Greatest Living Ballplayer.&quot;  He could hold a grudge like no one else.  He was eternally jealous of Ted Williams.   He loved getting stuff for free, and often insisted on it, be it hotel rooms, meals, airline tickets, or box seats at the World Series.  <br />One particular image that sticks with me from this book is the garage full of unused golfbags and clubs DiMaggio accumulated from years of celebrity tournaments.  When invited to a tournament, he would often insist he was &quot;bringing a friend&quot; so he would be given TWO new bags of clubs, but they all went straight to his garage.  <br />More touching is the detail that DiMaggio travelled with a dogeared copy of Hemingway's The Old Man and The Sea in his limo and used to read the old fisherman's musings about &quot;The Great DiMaggio&quot; over and over.  Apparently, Joe also liked Paul Simon's song, Mrs. Robinson, tho not at first (his initial reaction was &quot;I oughta sue this guy, I havent gone anywhere!&quot;)<br />This is not a great book about Baseball, but it is a gripping picture about a great American Personality.	2000-12-16

One almost had the impression over the last ten years that, like Truman Capote with In Cold Blood, Atlas was waiting for his character to die so he could be sure of how the story ended. Fortunately, Atlas did not wait and we still have Bellow and this book!<br />There have been comparisons already to Richard Ellman's work on James Joyce. Of course, Ellman's Joyce bio is a towering monument of scholarship and perhaps a harder book to write, but that is also a harder book to READ and not nearly as much fun as this one.  I would compare Atlas's Bellow to Quentin Bell's Virginia Woolf, also a very fun book and a book that is both a passionate defense and an exasperated apology for its subject.<br />Now, I am not necessarily comparing Bellow and Woolf except to say they are both prickly and deep.  Like Bell, Atlas has the advantage of knowing his subject personally and like Bell, is not above occasionally letting his frustration show.  Bellow is not an easy man to like, or even tolerate, but his gifts are prodigious and Atlas never resorts to bitter stereotypes.<br />This is a book written with a deep sense of the American vernacular.  There are currents of Chicago-ese, Canadian, and Yiddish running through it in a delightful mix.  Atlas writes  a very clear, lucid style and quotes from Bellow's letters and unpublished manuscripts freely.<br />It is hard to imagine a Stanely Elkin or a Philip Roth without first a Saul Bellow. This book is a great introduction to the Nobel laureate's work.	2000-11-09

He is also not the object to which Arthur Schlesinger devoted a thousand pages of hagiography.  The Kennedy here is a man groomed from youth to be, at best, a Duke of York, never a Prince of Wales.  Oldest brother Joe was the original heir to the Kennedy dynasty, then on his death, the  mantle passed to John.  It never seems to have occurred to John that Robert would ever be more than a close advisor, or perhaps a foil.  The  image of &quot;Bobby the Cutthroat&quot; suited JFK's purpose and allowed the  President to appear more diplomatic and charming.   Despite the family's jokey fatalism, no one ever expected JFK to die.  It seems that Robert never quite a chance to recover from his brother's death, but thrust himself further and further into national politics, perhaps in an effort to prove himself,  perhaps only to achieve his own identity.<br />This book is just long enough and no longer.  It lays to rest the conspiracy theories,  but Kennedy remains a figure more of potential than action.<br />RFK's image remains ambiguous and that is the charm of this biography.  He was handsome, sensitive, and oddly, the most vulnerable of the Kennedy brothers.	2000-11-05

There are fewer  annoying inconsistencies than there are in the other prequels and sequels.   McMurtry might have been making a special effort to wrap the series up  neatly.  The plot ambles along like a lost mule looking for water and there  are occasional episodes of sickening violence and torture, but on the  whole, one is just grateful for the chance to spend another seven or eight  hundred pages with McCrae and Call.	2000-09-05

In the earlier book, by Michael Shaara, Lee was an enigma. Much  of what we saw of him was through the eyes of James Longstreet.  Jeff  Shaara does not paint as interesting a portrait, and answers none of the  questions the earlier book brought up about Lee as a general and as a man.   The Robert E. Lee we get here is essentially the grey saint of Southern  Folklore, not the gentle but slightly doddering Lee of The Killer  Angels.<br />Jeff Shaara does do a good job of showing a continuity in the  battles that lead from Gettysburg to Appomattox.  The troop movements are  easier to understand than in most other books on the Civil War.  Grant  gradually tightens his grip until Lee's army is unable to move.  <br />Besides  Grant and Lee, the major character here is Joshua Chamberlin.  The Killer  Angels introduced readers to the hero of Little Round Top, but  unfortunately, in this book, Chamberlin doesn't really have much to do. It  is interesting, though, that the Southern commanders apparently had to stay  in the field until they died, whereas when Joshua Chamberlin is wounded, he  is shipped home for several months to peacefully recover. Another reason, I  suppose, why Northern victory was inevitable.<br />This is a good vacation  read, but not particularly fascinating as history.	2000-09-05

Anthony Burgess, in addition  to being a witty novelist and critic, also had the chutzpah to publish an  abridged version of Finnegan's Wake, so you know he knows his stuff!  This  is not a page by page explication of Joyce's complex works, ala Gifford or  Gilbert, but more like a defense for the intelligent reader who may be  wondering if these novels are worth the time.<br />It is wonderful that the  cover of this June 2000 paperback reissue has features an image of Joyce  looking away, his face  hidden from the reader.  Joyce remains an enigma--  a sparkling inspiration to readers who enjoy thinking about the questions  and don't care about definitive answers.<br />If you've read A Clockwork  Orange or Nothing Like the Sun and are curious about Anthony Burgess'  critical work, this is one of his best performances.	2000-08-25

I think Lonesome Dove can standcomparison to Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. Of course, I've only read Tolstoy in translation, so chances are I've missed alot, but there is no question that McMurtry creates something here very close to that impossible dream: The Great American Novel. I dont know that any other American writer has ever suceeded on this scale, which is why I go to Tolstoy. <br />McMurtry uses the Western as a starting point, but there is a little of everything here. Surely there has never been another American Western with so many varied characters, both men and and women. McMurtry juggles many different points of view, but manages to give each of his characters a unique voice. Most remarkable of all, I think, are the women in the book, who manage to escape the usual stereotypes of madonna or whore, even though many of them are, quite literally, prostitutes. <br />Lonesome Dove is written in a deceptively simple, unpretentious style. I've just finished reading it for the second time. Despite its length it is really a fast read, since it is one of those books that demands to be taken with you where ever you go until you are done.	2000-08-21

There is alot of violence and gore, but  alot of humor too.  We see Call and McCrae meet and join the Rangers  together and follow their first, hapless adventures through Southern Texas  and Mexico.  <br />It is nice to see Gus McCrae alive again after Woodrow Call  had to ride alone through Streets of Laredo.  Of course, this book is not  nearly the work of Art that Lonesome Dove was, but if you are following the  series, you wont want to miss this installment.	2000-08-21

When CBS purchased the rights to Lonesome Dove,  McMurtry retained the right to use his own characters again in his own  sequel. Apparently, McMurtry didnt like what CBS did, since his take is  completely  different.<br />For that matter, this is a very different book  from Lonesome Dove, too. The characters, while familiar, have grown and  aged and changed a great deal.  Pea-Eye, especially, seems to have become  a completely different person.  Lorena, too, has transformed over the years  to become more like the Clara of Lonesome Dove, than the young  ex-prostitute of the earlier novel.<br />There are problems of continuity that  dont bear much thinking about.  Faulkner used to say he couldn't always  keep his characters straight from book to book either, but he preferred to  believe that as he got older he LEARNED more about them.  I think thats a  good way to describe McMurtry's development between books.<br />The best way  to describe this novel, then, might be familiar, yet DIFFERENT!	2000-08-09

In contrast to Stefan  Kanfer's recent biography of Groucho, this book delves alot deeper into the  vaudeville origins of the Brothers and their  comedy style.  Also Louvish  has done some admirable work spotlighting the early days of Groucho's foil,  Margaret Dumont. There is a helpful bibliography at the end, as well as a  helpful list of the Marxes' film and radio work. (Surprise! Their last film  wasn't Love Happy, it was actually Irwin Allen's The Story of Mankind.) I  have to agree with some of the comments here about Louvish's writing  style--he occasionally becomes a bit overenthusiastic.  Like fans of Monty  Python or Star Trek, it  is hard for him to get through a paragraph without  making some reference to the shows.  This is overall, pretty forgiveable  considering the work he has done.<br />This has been a good year for fans of  the Marx Brothers, probably the most new books out at one time since the  1970's.

I agree with some of the other reviews here that it is a bit light on research (it would have been nice to have more  source notes), but it covers Groucho and the other Marx Brothers well  without being exhaustively analytic. Like most comedians, it seems, Groucho  was not a happy or a nice man. His humor seems to have come from a dark  strain of insecurity and ego that grew worse as he got older.  Kanfer does  not try to gloss this over.  One point this book does have over the 1979  biography by Hector Arce--it covers Groucho's last years in detail and  details the results of the lawsuit between the Marx children and Erin  Fleming, Groucho's secretary and companion.<br />Fans of Groucho will also  want to seek out the essay Adam Gopnick published in the New Yorker in  March 2000.  <br />I also enjoyed both of Arthur Marx'es books about his Dad:  Life With Groucho and Son of Groucho.  Both of these books are now out of  print, but well worth seeking out.	2000-08-04

Joyce Johnson's collection of letters shows a side of Kerouac more like Big Sur than On The Road--he's  not so much the travelling hipster as the thoughtful artist.  Kerouac never  quite got to the point in his artistic development where he pleased himself  with his own writing.  He was always ambitious and always frustrated with  words.  He was hammering out a new style of prose, but much of his audience  seemed unaware of his influences.  There were too many readers out there  who just wanted to be beatniks and not enough who had read Thomas Wolfe and  Theodore Dreiser and the others who inspired On The Road. <br />The Selected  Letters of Jack Kerouac as edited by Ann Charters now take up two volumes.   I have not compared those two books with the proof I read of Doors Wide  Open, and I do not know whether there is any overlap, but I enjoyed Joyce  Johnson's collection. There are not enough female voices among what we call  the Beat Generation, but hers is a complement to Kerouac.  I think their  relationship inspired him to open up in ways he could not to others.  This  is a great addition to Johnson's earlier memoir, Minor Characters, which  was published more than ten years ago.  It is good  to have the Kerouac  letters, but it is a fine thing to see this woman come out of the shadows  and find her own voice after all these years. <br />When can we expect Joyce  Johnson's first novel?	2000-06-16

Billie Holiday has not yet been captured effectively in a  full length biography, but this book is a step in the right direction.   Margolick does not try to delve very deeply into Billie Holiday's artistry  or her difficulties as a black woman trying to make it in a white-dominated  world, but he hits some interesting highlights.  If you like this, your  next stop might be Angela Davis' Blues Legacies.	2000-06-07

This is, of course, a classic, but it should be noted that some of the examples in the book have  been updated.  The revisions are subtle and pleasing. They don't change the book radically, but make it just slightly  more interesting. Toni Morrison is mentioned, for instance. The book is  essentially still the same firm, friendly, concise Strunk and White most of  us grew up with.	2000-06-07

Well, it turns out, the book is mostly quite complimentary.   There may be a few minor embarassments here and there, like the story of  his relationship with Lauro Nyro, who led him around Central Park on a  leash, but Geffen is shown to be a smart if sometimes ruthless business  man.  There are alot of great stories here, like the birth of Crosby,  Stills, Nash and Young who barely finished their album before they decided  they hated each other.  Or the Eagles, another superband full of enemies  and infighting. There is more dope here about the music business than about  the movies. We'll have to wait for another book to give us the juice about  Dreamworks and Steven Speilberg.	2000-06-07

Still, you might look at the guy as an early example of what Hunter Thompson called, &quot;Gonzo  Journalism.&quot; Reed was reporting history as he saw it happen.  There is  always something to be said for that.	2000-06-07

This is a really neat book, especially for early readers, or for pre-readers. Babies and kids love the  The range of expression here out of a handful of vegetables is incredible. Its like seeing Jim Henson's Muppets  for the first time.

This is a simple idea  beautifully rendered.	2000-06-07

Mr Bennett's Lincoln is not the familiar figure of Carl Sandburg's bio, but still believable.  Bennett, author of Before The Mayflower, gives  us a pragmatic, ambitious, scheming Politician. Lincoln apparently didn't  care much for black people personally, enjoyed the racist humor of the  time, and may have actually been a racist himself.  Bennett makes a  convincing case that Lincoln would rather have sent black slaves back to  Africa instead of integrating them into post-Civil War society.  This is a  fascinating portrayal. The only reason I dont give it five stars is that I  am not yet sure how to square this with all the other Lincoln books I've  read.	2000-05-17

Actually, after reading this book, I am still somewhat undecided, but at least this makes me remember  all the reasons I didn't vote for Carter in 1980.  I still consider myself  a yellow dog democrat, but its hard to imagine anything happening in  November 1980 other than Carter losing and Reagan winning.  In fact, all  this time later, its hard to imagine that Carter even existed.  So this  book is an enjoyable reminder of the good points and the aggravating points  of the Man from Plains.	1999-10-18

This is the first book I've read by Willa Cather, who I now realize is a great prose stylist of American Literature that my college teachers completely ignored.  She is so much a better  writer than her male  contemporaries--guys like Crane or London or Lewis you hear so dang much  about.  It is so wonderful too, to read a book from that time about a woman  who sruggles to express herself and is not killed for her troubles in the  end. Consider me on the bandwagon now.  I am beating the drum for Cather.	1999-10-18

I thought the review below by bluejaye99 to be particularly interesting.  I dont think Steinbeck is in the absolute top rank (with, say James or Faulkner or Twain) but he is a fine story teller who uses words much more  fluidly than most American writers.  Yes, this book has its clumsy parts,  but it is easy to read and makes an impressive beach book.	1999-10-14

There is a strangely ambiguous atomosphere in this Portrait.  It is impossible for me to tell if Ross is making fun of  a sad, senile old alcoholic or if  she is seriously hero-worshipping.  Hemingway comes off very badly in any  case. He keeps repeating the phrase, &quot;How do you like it now,  gentlemen?&quot; and seems generally pretty unaware of his surroundings.  I  cant get past the feeling that Ross is exploiting  H. for her own personal  gain, but I suppose H. was not above doing the same to others himself in  his younger days, so perhaps these things all even out.	1999-07-13

It was about 25 years ago and at the time I had tried to read H's longer books, such as The Sun Also Rises, and failed.  Well, I was only in seventh grade and I had rather  puerile tastes.  At the time, Torrents reminded me very much of the Richard  Brautigan and the Kurt Vonnegut books I was devouring.  I still think this  is a great book for kids.  Its not the most representative introduction to  Hemingway's work, but its much more fun to read (and shorter!!!) than The  Old Man and The Sea.	1999-07-03

Forget all the mixed reviews you've read in the media and the stupid spoilers you've seen on the internet.  If you like horror fiction, you'll want to read this.  Its probably too gross for those  simply looking for a  good book to read on the beach.  This has gotten me thinking about what  exactly separates Horror as a genre from, say,  Mystery.

A major problem is that Elvis' life from 1958 to 1977 just isnt as interesting or dramatic as  his initial rise to success.  Mostly what we have here is a catalog of  desultory and listless moviemaking, punctuated by an occasional recording  session or concert that ignites the King's interest.  To Guralnick's  everlasting credit, he enjoys Elvis' music and its place in the American  Pantheon, even when the music isn't all that good.  This is the closest we  have yet to an objective biography of Elvis Presley, but this half of the  life did not merit an entire volume. And what is all this nonsense here on  Amazon about Johnny Rivers?  So what if he beat Elvis to the punch  releasing Chuck Berry's Memphis?  Does anyone whose last name is not Rivers  really care anymore?	1999-03-18

If you're a movie fan, you've probably seen the Orson Welles movie version  of this novel, or at least seen scenes of it in various retrospectives. You  may be curious about the novel now specifically because it recently was  named one of the Modern Libray Top 100. You may be wondering why. Chances  are, even if you're an English major, you've never heard of Booth  Tarkington. If your grandparents have a shelf of forgotten books in their  attic, this novel might be one of them.  Its hard to understand why the  Modern Library choses this as one of the 100 best novels in English.  It  seems as near to being forgotten as a book can be, and perhaps it is better  left so.	1998-08-12
