If you've enjoyed their previous books about quilting and applique, you'll enjoy this one too!  There are a variety of designs; just looking at them gives me ideas for many different types of quilts everything from the usual bright, sparkly, fun Piece O' Cake color ways to romantic, folk, traditional and contemporary. <br /> <br />Most of the designs in this book have curved piecing, which the authors give clear and concise directions to help you.  Many of the patterns in the book also have paper piecing sections.  Though, previous knowledge of either Piece O' Cake designs or previous knowledge of paper piecing/curves may be helpful they are not a prerequisite.  An adventurous beginner could easily dive right into any of the patterns without difficulty.  The authors have excellent directions for all of the various techniques involved in all of the quilts in the book. <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who loves Piece O' Cake designs, anyone interested in curved piecing, applique, paper piecing, or anyone with a sense of adventure.

A+	This book has TONS of great patterns!   <br /> <br />There are tons of flower patterns all are original ideas, never seen before flowers.  There are also several houses, household items like a telephone, apron, chair, there are several butterfly and a dragonfly patterns and lots more.  Along with all of these patterns, the authors show you several ideas for turning the patterns into quilts.  An idea that I thought was great was that the authors created a redwork quilt using their applique patterns!  If you have a tricky time with math this book makes it easy to enlarge or shrink the patterns you want to create.  Also included are terrific directions easy enough for beginners.  <br /> <br />This is an amazing collection of patterns by a couple of great women.	2004-08-23

If you enjoy Better Homes and Gardens' other books and magazines you will really like this book!  Each of the many designs in this book has a large color picture of the quilt, clear directions, and each quilt has a diagram of 'optional sizes' so that you can make the quilt any size.  The end of the book has 14 pages of information for the beginner quilter.  Along with complete and concise directions and the basic directions in the back, this book would be a good choice for beginners.  There is also a wonderful variety of designs including the tradional Log Cabin and Nine Patch blocks along with more challenging designs like Robbing Peter to Pay Paul and Storm at Sea.  This book also contains patterns for Red Work and Applique lovers.<br />Another great feature of this book, something that as a quilter I look for, is that each design has 3 or 4 variations.  For instance the Robbing Peter to Pay Paul quilt is first represented in the classic red and white, but there is also a pillow in stripes and plaids and also a tablerunner made in a floral yellow patterned fabric--all of the same design!  Laura Boehnke, quilt tester of American Patchwork &amp; Quilting Magazine, does what she does best by designing the alternate choices in color and design for the patterns. <br />For individuals looking for a book that has a great number and variety of patterns and for individuals needing inspiration to see patterns worked in different color schemes, this is a great book!  I am very glad I purchased this!	2004-05-25

A+	After seeing and being totally impressed with the quilt on the front cover of Quilter's Newsletter Magazine's March 2004 issue I had to purchase this book!  The quilt on the cover of QNM is designed based off of the patterns in this book, only it is not red and green--it is pink, magenta, teal, purple, and blue (beautiful!).  One of the most important things that I look for in a pattern is versitality.  This book has many patterns in it and though the book is about red and green quilts, these patterns are very versitale and could be made from any color pallett.<br />Traditional quilts are very beautiful and Ms. Kimball guides you thru the meanings and histories behind each symbol in each block.  The book is very well written with a lot of color pictures for examples.  Another thing that I really enjoyed about this book was that Ms. Kimball, unlike many other authors, wants you, as a quilter, to use your own creativity and imagination.  She even tells you to use her blocks as starting points and encourages you to expand on them.  She also includes numerous small diagrams of quilt blocks with the same name but different layouts.  Examples of this are the Rose of Sharron, Pineapple, and American Beauty Rose to name a few.<br />This book is an extremely worth while investment!  A+ all the way!	2004-04-12

There are no instructions for the patterns...though any quilter with any experience could easily put the designs together.  Also, the patterns are not to size, that is unless you prefere miniature quilts.  All of the designs are sketched on a page, some have 2 to a page, and are all in black and white.  There are no pictures of any of the completed designs.  If you plan to use this book for quilting it would make for a complicated quilting motif. <br />Here is what I will probably do with it:<BR>1. Make a copy of a design so that I can use colored pencils to help me visualize the pattern I want to make. (Keep the book clean!)<BR>2. Make an enlarged copy (or 2) to make freezer paper templates to use in the applique design.<br />Someone only interested in the designs could also use them to make cards, embroidery, quilting motifs, and possibly decorate other artful crafts.<br />Having said that, had I seen this book in the store I would most likely NOT have purchased it but since I have I will make the most out of it.  This is definitely not for a beginner quilter who would need and appreciate directions and guidance on putting the designs together.  However, I think that it will be a helpful aid in the future.	2004-04-06

Each pattern in this book is accompanied with a page that describes how that particular quilt is special.  Some of the patterns look complicated but the author breaks down the designs and simplifies them.  Most of the designs, if not all, consist of 2-3 blocks that when put together make a beautiful design.  The Morning Glory pattern is one example of this; it consists of 3 blocks but gives the appearance of a whole cloth design.  You will also find patterns such as: wreath of roses, dutch basket, wind blown tulip, cherokee rose and many other beautiful designs.<br />The beginning of this book is dedicated to the history of Marie Webster, the original creator of these wonderful designs.  This book, I think, would be a challenge for someone who has never done applique work before.  All of the pictures are in color and each quilt has a close-up of the design.  Full size applique pieces make getting started easier.	2004-04-02

If you've seen a quilt with roses, irises, daisies...before and weren't impressed, try this book for designs that are fresh and clean.  According to this book, a lot of the designs of the 1920's-1950's were based off of these.  I have not seen these patterns used in this way ever before.  In this book you will find patterns for many flowers including: iris (pictured on the cover), daisy, may tulips, poppy, white dogwood (fabulous!), french baskets, and a very beautiful grapes and vines pattern.<br />If you've never appliqued before, this book will be a challenge to you.  The instructions are written for a quilter with some experience.  The beginning of the book gives wonderful details of the life of Marie Webster who is the original creator of these designs.<br />I also enjoyed Marie Webster's Gardent of Quilts which, I think would be a bit easier for a beginner eager to try traditional designs.	2004-04-02

I borrowed this book from a friend and was amazed by the wonderful designs and use of color.  The authors used a very unique and original method of arranging the appliqued designs. The designs in this book are interesting new twists on traditional designs like the pomegranate and other floral designs.  One of the things that I found most interesting was that the backgrounds of the designs are pieced with fabrics of similar hues, tones, and colors which helped to enrich the design and add interest.  All of the designs are applique.  <br />If you're looking for a book on applique that is different then a lot of other books out there then this is the one!

If the US is founded on capitalism, does that mean that the US is the root of all evil?  Of course the answer is no!  <br />If you're interested in learning some of the facts about what capitalism is and should be, this is the book you want to pick up.  This book should be required reading in college business, law, and all government classes.  Ayn Rand covers all aspects of capitalism in a very organized, logical way.  This book is very easy to understand and is clearly and concisely written.  It is a must have if you want to pick up anything about capitalism.	2004-03-05

Rand is a wonderful writer--all of her stories are excellently writen, have a very well defined plot, her characters are extremely well thought out, and she is able to weave a strong purpose into the story.  Ayn Rand is my favorite writers because the plots and storylines in her books are very well thought out.  I hate reading a book that leaves gaps and loop holes in the story and where the characters are whish-washy at best.  If you're tired of books that leave you feeling empty and that your time was wasted, then pick up this book.  This book is a worthy investment!	2004-03-05

I think, Ms. Rowling does a great job portraying Harry Potter as a teenager--some of the struggles, emotions, and dilemmas that some people go thru at that age.  I think for some people it might be difficult to read because of this, and also because it's so long, but after reading this I'm having a hard time waiting until the next book comes out!

For someone who has never sewn a curve and feels intimidated by trying I would recommend this book.  <br />Although this is a good book to have, the reason I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 was that some of the designs were difficult to make out. Some of the flowers were hard to visualize.  The author recommends using very pale colors.  Though, there are a good many pictures of quilts with very vibant and alive colors made by her students.

Root also gives you an idea of how each block could be quilted.  Although I only have 1 thing that I would change, and it's probably just my own personal curiousity but nonetheless, I wish the blocks had a little tid bit of their own history saying why that design came to be immortalized in a quilt.

I've read this book twice now, as well as The Fountainhead, Night of January 16th, Anthem, and many of Ayn Rand's other philosophical books.  This book has changed the way I look at the world.  Ayn Rand had the ability to weave philosophy into a story line to create a masterpiece.  When you read some philosophies, you feel as if you are preached at.  Ayn Rand backs-up every point no matter how minute with concrete evidence.  She gives many examples of what happens when a person deliberately refuses to listen to reason. <br />Since writing this novel, many of the laws that were writen in the book to demonstrated what would happen if unnecessary laws, taxes, etc.. are actually in effect!  (I read that somewhere in one of Rand's other books that she later wrote.)<br />This is truly an incredible book!	2003-09-23
