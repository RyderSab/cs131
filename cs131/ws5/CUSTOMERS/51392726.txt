US	51392726	R8XIAI1CPKH0Q	0674012801	410150006	The Iraq War: A Military History	Books	4	8	12	N	N	Important Political Year Reading	.<BR>Summary:<br />Great reading that is hard to put down.  The writers are insightful, with expert, well researched and provide compelling information gleaned from expert well connected sources whom they had long term friendships and associations with.  <br />The book appears factually written without an apparent political agenda.  An increasingly important factor for books coming out this year.<br />Truly substantial information, facts, and details of the war.  Substantially more than will be commented on here.  Many disparate situations are better understood and explained by this book - like how can a mechanical support team get lost in the middle of combat?<br />Political Year Issues:<br />General Franks re-wrote modern military tactics with his blitzkrieg through Iraq to topple one of the most brutal dictatorships with the (one time) 5th best army in the world.  Could the war have been won with much greater costs and loss of life on both sides?<br />Good thought provoking information including substantial captured Syrian jihad troops in the fedayeen forces - what were they doing there?  What does this mean to us in looking forward to the next middle eastern crisis?<br />Questions Remaining:<br />If we found no weapons of mass destruction, but we knew they were there before (they were previously used and the US, England, France and Russia sold them to Saddam Hussein and all agreed they were there at one time).  Where did they go?  Do the presence of Syrian jihad troops give us a strong enough linkage to pursue Syria for the missing WMD's?  (This is my personal belief, for what little it is worth.)  The point being there is no evidence of the WMD's being destroyed, therefore they must be someplace.  Buried in the desert? Or, in a neighboring country?<br />What is Syria's role in this war (with its superiorly trained troops), and potential aftermath issues that will have to be addressed within this decade?  Syria remains a dictatorship that harbors and trains terrorists in its Bacca Valley and still plans to drive every Israeli Jew  into the Mediterranean Sea - regardless of any peace treaty. <br />Negatives:<br />Could use more dialogue to bring out the first hand experience, rather than being a citation.<br />Could have used more maps and diagrams.  These are really essential for digesting troop movements relative to cities, and relative locations in a fairly dispersed and desolate land.	2004-03-25

But, he really is very subjective and ill informed.<br />If one ever read a newspaper story about an incident that one knows about, somehow newspaper writers only get the straight forward facts about 60% correct; with their conclusions generally fully deficient.  Well, Drosnin is a good newspaper reporter and does not disappoint those statistics!<br />Background:<br />Rabbi Eliyahu Rips published one of the most arduously peer reviewed statistical analyses of all time.  (Rips, et al, \\"Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis,\\" Statistical Science, The Institute of Mathematical Statistics, August, 1994.)<br />This publication revealed that the TORAH (the first 5 books of Moses - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,  Numbers, Deuteronomy) had the property to be analyzed via recent computer technology to reveal significant information that is very highly improbable.  <br />Note:  These properties have not really been proven for the rest of the bible, although the other books have some extra-ordinary and unique properties that are well beyond chance.<br />There is no question of the stats.  They exist and have been fully accepted by experts who really could not accept the premise.  Unfortunately, (or, fortunately) the premise and statistics are correct, and those experts (including some hefty cryptographers) readily acceded that in wonderment.<br />In my own quest to test the subject, I purchased the software and found some interesting things.  And, found the items demonstrated by Rips and others, proving that they did not just make this up.  But, I am not a statistician, so I simply accept the profound conclusions presented by the experts in that journals publication.<br />Book Review:<br />Thus, when I got the book as a gift, I was excited.  I found it interesting, but if I did not do my other research, I would have concluded that this entire area is very weak and somewhat full of baloney.  <br />And, that is the problem with Drosnin's book.<br />Thus while it is interesting and easy to read and understand, he doesn't back anything up.  I tried to pursue some of his findings, but could not obtain them.  It would have been great if he gave more information so these things could be confirmed beyond his repeated statement that Rabbi Rips declares the finding to be highly unique and improbably.<br />FYI:  To date, I have never found anything written, or presented by Rips to confirm Drosnin's persistent relationship and testing.

Literally, you will not be able to put the book down because of its design, and its wonderfully enjoyable writing.<br />I found myself always trying to read just one more chapter, and finished the book in a few nights. Each chapter is short, fast paced, ends in a situation of suspense, are often based around curious riddles, and the overall conspiracy topic and its details are very interesting!  (Even though Baigents Messianic Legacy shows the Priori documents/claims listed in Holy Blood, Holy Grail are fraudulent!  But, thats an entirely different story.)<br />Browns mystery interestingly details the friction and conspiracy of mainstream Christianity (e.g. the Catholic Church) juxtaposed against the conspiracy of age old paganism.<br />This mystery takes us through some exotic locals like the Lourve, with its historical works of art and their interpretations; Rosilyn Chapel in Scotland, a Swiss Depository (a very foreign concept in the US), London and Parisian Cathedrals, and many other interesting places.  It also takes us to many other curious points of history and time, giving us needed perspective on who we are today, and how our societies got to this point.<br />Story:<br />A beloved Louvre Museum curator is violently murdered in the museum and is found with self imposed enigmatic clues to his death and murderer.  His secret grand daughter, a Parisian cryptographer, and an American academic symbolist search against time and danger to decode his messages which include riddles and anagrams of the works of Da Vinci, Hugo, Cocteau, Newton, Pope and the secret Prioi de Sion.<br />Negative:<br />Brown has designed the book to somewhat conclude that the above conspiracies are based on the fact of the truth of paganism, over the fiction of Christianity, rather than the opposite.  If there is so much truth and historical basis for the paganistic interpretation of Christ and Mary, why does it have to be so secret for 2,000 years - waiting for the right time to show itself to the yearning world?If there is so much truth and historical basis for the paganistic interpretation of Christ and Mary, why does it have to be so secret for 2,000 years - waiting for the right time to show itself to the yearning world?	2004-02-16

And, I am a believer in the codes.<br />My perception of his writing it similar to when I read a newspaper story about an incident that I know a lot  about...somehow newspaper writers only get the straight forward facts about 60% correct; with their conclusions generally fully deficient.

I thought he might have put more effort into this one and thus have made it more plausible.  I read most of it on the plane home, and a flight attendant spoke to me about it saying, \\" I wish he really put some real information in there.  I believe in the subject, but I can't accept his work.\\"<br />If I  did not do my other research, I would have concluded that this entire area is very weak and somewhat full of baloney.  <br />And, that is the problem with Drosnin's second book.<br />Thus while it is interesting and easy to read and understand, he doesn't back anything up.  I tried to pursue some of his findings, but could not obtain them.  It would have been great if he gave more information so these things could be confirmed beyond his repeated statement that Rabbi Rips declares the finding to be highly unique and improbably.<br />FYI:  To date, I have never found anything written, or presented by Rips to confirm Drosnin's persistent relationship and testing.

That is just plain ignorant and dangerous.<br />Final Point:<br />Drosnin presents the final atomic conflict arising out of the failed middle east peace efforts.  I really don't think anyone needs a prophecy to see that one coming. <br />Perhaps idealists may \\"prefer\\" to look at it that way, but very few realists view the millenia old hatred as something that can be swept away with economic development, or by swapping land for peace.<br />For every Muslim (middle eastern) I have spoken to, it is not the location of Israel, it is their existence that is problematic.  <br />Peace treaties are therefore only opportunities for war, not a solution for war.	2004-02-16
US	51392726	R1ZWN2CTEO84K8	0965649210	574921762	The Secrets of the Federal Reserve	Books	4	38	53	N	N	Requires all Americans to Question their Financial System	.<BR>It is an important - even critical - read of facts. But, possibly not a valid perspective.<br />Summary:<BR>The Federal Reserve was created as a private corporation and remains so to this day.  Its stock is owned by only a few families, via their control of their banks.  Further, these families clearly obain great personal financial benefit from this unique benefit - at little initial investment.<br />Mullins demonstrates that while several American Robber Barons amassed billions of wealth, through the establishment of the Federal Reserve as a private corporation, he also demonstrates that a single predominant banking family (Rothschilds) truly owns and controls these banks, and the Federal Reserve.  This same family also owns the Federal Reserve banks for England, France, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands.<br />Further, Mullins reveals that the Rothschilds also control many specific significant American Corporations that explains why such information is continually missed, or misrepresented in the media.  Charts and news clippings from page 91 through 110 show ownership of the Federal Reserve, Banks and control of Banks, Family dynasties and businesses, as well as cross corporation Directorships of numerous corporations and media companies, including the New York Times.<br />Finally, Mullins provides substantial references supporting his conspiracy theory that the Federal Reserve is unnatural and illegal within the American Constitution, and was specifically established by conspiracy.  <br />Thus, the final question is not the existence of the Federal Reserve as a privately owned corporation, but, what are the true good and bad trade-offs of this, and what should be done within our constitutional system about this.  Nothing, debate, or change this fact?  None of these issues are dealt with.<br />Review:<BR>Mullins provides good information, and a significant number of references, including New York Times articles, and other public documents.  His story has been told many times before, so it isnt very foreign, or unbelievable.  And, his conspiracy story appears very true, if not in fact, but possibly in effect.<br />However, Mullins writing is rather choppy, and sometimes difficult to follow the people and circumstances.  This clutter is partially due to the amount of information provided, as well as the various times /dates / events that he is linking together.  But, clearly a more skillful writer could have avoided this challenge.  This does not dilute Mullins message, or the information.  It only requires more effort by the reader.  <br />Directly after demonstrating establishing the Federal Reserve, Mullins shows how the Federal Reserve was singularly (in his mind) responsible for World War I - Europe was broke and could not wage war without substantial loans to governments, that were also guaranteed by the governments.  He later develops similar theories regarding Hitler and WWII.  <br />Personally, I was not convinced of the direct causality.  However, Mullins gives us food for thought outside the normal WWII conspiracy box.  Again, possibly the relationship exists in effect, if not in actual fact.<br />Finally, Mullins tackles of the issue of conspiracy of the establishment private ownership of the Federal Reserve in the early 1900's - it was defeated numerous times until finally slipped through congress during a Christmas recess.  Mullins provides reasonable support for this being a historical fact; and for it being patently illegal under our constitution - including the illegality of the personal Income Taxes passed to support the Reserves needs.  He dwells on the original warnings of our founding fathers against releasing the governments authority to borrow, and/or to tax personal income.<br />But, Mullins does not attempt to deal with the issues of whether or not this system is actual more beneficial to the US economy and responsible for its unprecedentedhistorical development.  I can easily believe in the factsof the illegality of the Income Tax, and of private ownership of the right to print money.  I can even believe in the entire conspiracy of the development of these systems by a few greedy families solely for selfish greed.<br />But, it would be good to see a debate on the basic issue of overall societal benefit of these institutions.  As a businessman, I can see clear societal and economic benefits of these institutions and the clear benefits of having a stable Federal Reserve out of the hands of our impetuous Congress.  <BR>Mullins own research shows that the Great Depression was caused by Congress restricting the growth - actually shrinking the money supply - at a point of already contracting economic conditions.  Can you imagine todays congress managing the money supply after seeing the strong overall gross benefits of such control by the Federal Reserve over the past 25 years?  Clearly our money would be worthless due to inflation if this were the case.	2004-02-16

Prof. Greene does a great job at communicating the weighty physics on Einsteinian - quantum - string theories.  He uses apt examples with very few numbers and no formulas to convey the concepts of modern physics.  This is no minor, or ephemeral feat!  <br />Greene also makes the topic more interesting with insights into the \\"competitive\\", and / or \\"enigmatic\\" situations that develop as physicists compete to break the puzzle of the theory of \\"M\\" (all 5 string theories).<br />Of course, he makes it interesting and fun by presenting it as a scientific race and competition.  <br />Review:<br />Not an easy read, but Greene makes it as easy as possible.  I found it very enjoyable, but would not recommend it to someone who wants some easy reading!<br />Negative:<BR>I have a minor point (not really a complaint) about the information as conveyed.  Greene did not spend much time of potential scientific disparities that remain in the field.  For example, recent discoveries demonstrate that Hubble's \\"Red Shift\\" is quantized, requiring a very different view of the Big Bang and the current structure and dynamics of the universe.  This is becoming more relevant with new findings coming forth in this area.<br />A second point, more very late-breaking information has been coming forward suggesting that the speed of light may not be stable and finite, but in fact slowing down.  Whether this is true or not, it would have been nice to see some of this late-breaking touched upon.  But, that might have taken another 200 pages, I suppose.<br />Acknowledgment (and hopefully discussion of) of these items would allay my fears that a scientist is trying to argue \\"facts\\" when only competing theories exist.  I really hate it when scientists try to make their pet theories into &quot;facts&quot; by presenting indirect and uncertain data and unproven theories as definitive studies.	2004-02-15

For that reason alone, one should read this book regardless of whether one is a die-hard evolutionist, a born-again Christian Creationist, or an open-minded scientist.<br />The late Jay Stephen Gould. called Mayr the \\"greatest evolutionary biologist and writer of extra-ordinary insight and clarity\\".  This book is well-written and Mayr expresses his ideas eloquently providing lots of good material. But, it won't \\"convert\\" many to evolution considering what it contains, and what is missing: there are no new arguments, information, or discoveries. <br />It that sense, Mayr could trumpet evolutionary theory's final demise.  For, if the \\"greatest evolutionary biologist\\" cannot argue against evolutionary theory's failings, who can?  The 1990's witnessed a flood of credentialed, and knowledgeable scientists quietly, but decisively left the ranks of evolutionary theorism for valid scientific reasons. <br />Review:<br />As if Mahr is caught in a time-warp to his childhood, he doesn't comment on new revelations in biology, genetics, physics, paleontology, and intelligent design concepts.  He turns his back on Gould's theory of \\"Punctuated Equilibrium\\" which grates Neo-Darwinism;  dismissing without argument the problem of the lack of transitional forms (hardcore evolutionists argue is evolution's proof),  \\"Wherever we look at the living biota, .... discontinuities are overwhelmingly frequent.... The discontinuities are even more striking in the fossil record.  New species usually appear in the fossil record suddenly, not connected with their ancestors by a series of intermediates.\\" (pp189)<br />Mayr dedicates six chapters to micro-evolution, but skims macro-evolution with out-of-date discussions (now viewed genetically improbable - 3/1,000 mutations are beneficial; 700/1,000 are deleterious).  Avidly discusses butterfly coloration, but avoids metamorphosis! How can the apical evolutionary tome avoid tackling macro-evolution?  Without macro-evolution, there is no evolution - by definition!  <br />\\"It is now actually misleading to refer to evolution as a theory, considering the massive evidence that has been discovered over the last 140 years documenting its existence.  Evolution is no longer a theory, it is simply a fact.\\" (pp269).  Yet, even Darwin specified evolutionary challenges that could destroy its tenets. Mayr gives no thought that discordant evolutionary theories on their own destroy any ability to claim the \\"fact\\" of evolution - because facts cannot be in dispute (theories reviewed below.)  Mayr entirely dismisses any creationist or secular anti-evolutionist scientific writings as if they should fall to the wayside without consideration of the issues they contemplate or develop, thus re-writing the basis of scientific discovery: <br />With a wave of his anachronistic hand, he tosses away Gould's \\"punctuated equilibrium\\", Crick's \\"panspermia\\", Behe's  \\"irreducible complexity\\", Tifft's, \\"quantized red shift\\", Big Bang, Intelligent design, recent works in genetics, molecular biology, electron microscopic sub-cellular organelle studies, paleontological issues, etc. that conflict with evolution's basic tenets. Refusing to discuss these theories and their \\"facts\\", Mayr is free to declare the \\"fact\\" of evolution - if only to himself.<br />The real challenge of Mayr's book is the ignorance it foments, like every other arbitrary system that disallows free-thought and argumentative interchange.  So, it's of no surprise that the final tome of the \\"greatest evolutionary biologist\\" should read similarly, providing absolutism \\"facts\\" devoid of any supporting data.  Statements like \\"the production of life cannot be too difficult, because it happened on earth as soon as conditions became suitable...\\" (pp.43) are simply irresponsible.  Truly, where is the scientific argument?  The premise?  Data? Anything!<br />A committed atheist and therefore evolutionist, Mahr disdains creationism without considering its arguments, \\"The claims of the creationist have been refuted so frequently and so thoroughly that there is no need to cover this subject once more.\\" (pp269) However, Mayr's own writings demonstrate he doesn't understand Creationsim, its scientific strengths and weaknesses. These legitimate scientific issues must be addressed and argued.<br />Mayr's final tome, possibly is THE final tomb of evolution.  Until some new scientific information is brought to the fore, it is scientifically discrediting itself.  Evolution just cannot be a \\"fact\\", with so many \\"facts\\" in dispute. <br />While we cannot invoke God to solve basic science problems, we cannot deny God for our existence when no alternative exists. Forget science's limitations and religion's dogma:  we exist, therefore we either evolved, or were created.  For evolutionary zealots: \\"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\\" Albert Einstein.<br />\\"Facts\\" Conflicting with the \\"Fact\\" of Evolution<br />Crick's \\"panspermia\\" theorizes DNA could not have formed under any early earth scenario, nor could m-RNA (the simplest \\"living\\" molecule); therefore earth's life was seeded by amino acids from outer space.  Highly theoretical, panspermia details the need for this alternative, but provides no data as to how, where, when, or why this could have occurred.<br />Gould's \\"punctuated equilibrium\\" theorizes that because of the void of transitional forms (the mainstay of most die-hard evolutionists) all species evolved within 1-2  generations through a \\"hopeful monster\\" - the feathered bird with reptilian parents, etc.  This is generally analyzed as genetically impossible.<br />Behe's  \\"irreducible complexity\\" presents electron microscopic evidence arguing that evolutionary successive sub-cellular structures couldn't have been intermediates. Example, flagella couldn't give rise to cilia, because the two have distinctly different structures that if reduced, become non-functional.  It's therefore impossible for these different structures to have successive relationships.<br />Howell's explanation of africanus / homo sapiens fossils (reflecting massive paleontological issues, arbitrary data, date \\"fixing\\") \\"The human fragment from Kanapoi with a date of 4.4 million, could not be distinguished from Homo Sapiens morphologically (sic 100,000 years).... We suggested that it might represent Australopithecus because at that time allocation to Homo seemed preposterous, although it would be the correct one without the time element.\\"<br />Tifft's, \\"quantized red shift\\" observational data demonstrates Hubble's Red Shift is quantized.  If true, this data destroys current universe dating, demonstrating a much younger universe and is aggressively ridiculed: \\"There is no way of explaining these observations, so they cannot be true.\\" (\\"Seeing Red\\", Halton Arps).<br />Big Bang, \\"In the beginning, there was nothing, then it exploded creating the universe.\\"  The obvious challenge is how did matter and energy first arise, in opposition to all laws of thermodynamics?	2002-09-10

For that reason alone, one should read this book regardless of whether one is a die-hard evolutionist, a born-again Christian Creationist, or an open-minded scientist.<br />The late Jay Stephen Gould. called Mayr the \\"greatest evolutionary biologist and writer of extra-ordinary insight and clarity\\".  This book is well-written and Mayr expresses his ideas eloquently providing lots of good material. But, it won't \\"convert\\" many to evolution considering what it contains, and what is missing: there are no new arguments, information, or discoveries. <br />It that sense, Mayr could trumpet evolutionary theory's final demise.  For, if the \\"greatest evolutionary biologist\\" cannot argue against evolutionary theory's failings, who can?  The 1990's witnessed a flood of credentialed, and knowledgeable scientists quietly, but decisively left the ranks of evolutionary theorism for valid scientific reasons. <br />Review:<br />As if Mahr is caught in a time-warp to his childhood, he doesn't comment on new revelations in biology, genetics, physics, paleontology, and intelligent design concepts.  He turns his back on Gould's theory of \\"Punctuated Equilibrium\\" which grates Neo-Darwinism;  dismissing without argument the problem of the lack of transitional forms (hardcore evolutionists argue is evolution's proof),  \\"Wherever we look at the living biota, .... discontinuities are overwhelmingly frequent.... The discontinuities are even more striking in the fossil record.  New species usually appear in the fossil record suddenly, not connected with their ancestors by a series of intermediates.\\" (pp189)<br />Mayr dedicates six chapters to micro-evolution, but skims macro-evolution with out-of-date discussions (now viewed genetically improbable - 3/1,000 mutations are beneficial; 700/1,000 are deleterious).  Avidly discusses butterfly coloration, but avoids metamorphosis! How can the apical evolutionary tome avoid tackling macro-evolution?  Without macro-evolution, there is no evolution - by definition!  <br />Mayr gives no thought that discordant evolutionary theories on their own destroy any ability to claim the \\"fact\\" of evolution - because facts cannot be in dispute (theories reviewed below.)  Mayr entirely dismisses any creationist or secular anti-evolutionist scientific writings as if they should fall to the wayside without consideration of the issues they contemplate or develop, thus re-writing the basis of scientific discovery:  \\"It is now actually misleading to refer to evolution as a theory, considering the massive evidence that has been discovered over the last 140 years documenting its existence.  Evolution is no longer a theory, it is simply a fact.\\" (pp269).  Yet, even Darwin specified evolutionary challenges that could destroy its tenets.<br />With a wave of his anachronistic hand, he tosses away Gould's \\"punctuated equilibrium\\", Crick's \\"panspermia\\", Behe's  \\"irreducible complexity\\", Tifft's, \\"quantized red shift\\", Big Bang, Intelligent design, recent works in genetics, molecular biology, electron microscopic sub-cellular organelle studies, paleontological issues, etc. that conflict with evolution's basic tenets. Refusing to discuss these theories and their \\"facts\\", Mayr is free to declare the \\"fact\\" of evolution - if only to himself.<br />The real challenge of Mayr's book is the ignorance it foments, like every other arbitrary system that disallows free-thought and argumentative interchange.  So, it's of no surprise that the final tome of the \\"greatest evolutionary biologist\\" should read similarly, providing absolutism \\"facts\\" devoid of any supporting data.  Statements like \\"the production of life cannot be too difficult, because it happened on earth as soon as conditions became suitable...\\" (pp.43) are simply irresponsible.  Truly, where is the scientific argument?  The premise?  Data? Anything!<br />A committed atheist and therefore evolutionist, Mahr disdains creationism without considering its arguments, \\"The claims of the creationist have been refuted so frequently and so thoroughly that there is no need to cover this subject once more.\\" (pp269) However, Mayr's own writings demonstrate he doesn't understand Creationsim, its scientific strengths and weaknesses. These legitimate scientific issues must be addressed and argued.<br />Mayr's final tome, possibly is THE final tomb of evolution.  Until some new scientific information is brought to the fore, it is scientifically discrediting itself.  Evolution just cannot be a \\"fact\\", with so many \\"facts\\" in dispute. <br />While we cannot invoke God to solve basic science problems, we cannot deny God for our existence when no alternative exists. Forget science's limitations and religion's dogma:  we exist, therefore we either evolved, or were created.  For evolutionary zealots: \\"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\\"<br />\\"Facts\\" Conflicting with the \\"Fact\\" of Evolution<br />Crick's \\"panspermia\\" theorizes DNA could not have formed under any early earth scenario, nor could m-RNA (the simplest \\"living\\" molecule); therefore earth's life was seeded by amino acids from outer space.  Highly theoretical, panspermia details the need for this alternative, but provides no data as to how, where, when, or why this could have occurred.<br />Gould's \\"punctuated equilibrium\\" theorizes that because of the void of transitional forms (the mainstay of most die-hard evolutionists) all species evolved within 1-2  generations through a \\"hopeful monster\\" - the feathered bird with reptilian parents, etc.  This is generally analyzed as genetically impossible.<br />Behe's  \\"irreducible complexity\\" presents electron microscopic evidence arguing that evolutionary successive sub-cellular structures couldn't have been intermediates. Example, flagella couldn't give rise to cilia, because the two have distinctly different structures that if reduced, become non-functional.  It's therefore impossible for these different structures to have successive relationships.<br />Howell's explanation of africanus / homo sapiens fossils (reflecting massive paleontological issues, arbitrary data, date \\"fixing\\") \\"The human fragment from Kanapoi with a date of 4.4 million, could not be distinguished from Homo Sapiens morphologically (sic 100,000 years).... We suggested that it might represent Australopithecus because at that time allocation to Homo seemed preposterous, although it would be the correct one without the time element.\\"<br />Tifft's, \\"quantized red shift\\" observational data demonstrates Hubble's Red Shift is quantized.  If true, this data destroys current universe dating, demonstrating a much younger universe and is aggressively ridiculed: \\"There is no way of explaining these observations, so they cannot be true.\\" (\\"Seeing Red\\", Halton Arps).<br />Big Bang, \\"In the beginning, there was nothing, then it exploded creating the universe.\\"  The obvious challenge is how did matter and energy first arise, in opposition to all laws of thermodynamics?	2002-09-05

Best enjoyed when re-heated after sitting in the refrigerator for 24 hours - I have no idea why!)<br />Favorite Recipes:<br />1.....Shrimp Etouffe'e (page 75) - of course!<br />2.....Cajun Meatloaf (page 112)<br />3.....Cajun Seafood Gumbo with Andoulle Smoked Sausage (page 208)<br />Negatives:<br />1.....I only give it 4 stars because it does lack some of the enticing glossy pictures we have grown to expect for visual pleasure. (I have the 1990, or so, edition, so this may no longer be accurate)<br />2.....Many recipes have multiple steps to make the sauce, or base, then prepare the recipe.  If you are strapped for time, or not a dedicated chef, this can be disappointing.<br />3.....Not everyone likes Cajun heat; so, while not all recipes are hot, this issue will limit the recipes to choose from.<br />4.....Diet with Prudhomme?

The newspaper articles illustrate what was known, feared, supposed, and not known to the everyday person.<br />Recommendation:<br />Highly recommended for those who wish to understand yesterdays actions and ramifications so as to not repeat history's mistakes.  <br />Review:<br />Includes US newspaper clippings, as well as Japanese newspapers. Begins with a San Francisco Examiner front page from June , 1926 reading: \\"Secret Plans of Japanese General Staff Preparing for War with a Western Power\\".<br />Today, we can read that same headline in Bejing, siting war to be waged in the year 2022.<br />Later, after the Pearl Harbor attack, the Japanese Times and Advertiser newspaper front page reads:  \\"Brilliant War Results Revealed\\". Further, note the spin by the Japanese: \\"It is the unshakable policy of the Japanese Empire to preserve stability in East Asia and to contribute towards world peace...\\"  This was the excuse for initiating war with the US, for the purpose of waging peace!<br />Today, we could hypothetically replace these words with, a Saudi Arabian newspaper reading, \\"Bin Ladin's Brilliant Results Revealed\\", \\"It is the unshakable policy of the Al Qaida to contribute to Muslim world peace in the name of Allah....\\"<br />Each of the 93 pages is essentially a front page but, sometimes (two pages make up the entire front page.  With the exception of the 1926 front page, and a December 7, 1945 front page, the book provides 46 newspaper articles date from December 1, 1941 to March 7, 1942.<br />Negative:<br />Some of the articles have very small print, and are therefore more difficult to read.<br />Also, the author allows the newspapers to speak for themselves.  However, it would have been better to have had some comments, or ancillary information provided.	2002-03-18

It has 130 illustrations (including 17  color glossies).<br />Review:<br />MacNulty has reviewed Freemasonry's most accessible secrets (first three degrees) and its related symbolism. <br />He begins with the speculative ancient history (Hiram Abiff, Solomon's Chief Architect) through to the age of the medieval guilds when Freemasonry has valid records, to modern times. MacNulty discusses Freemasonry's outward tenets of brotherhood, spiritual fulfilment, cosmic enlightenment (to the ancient mysteries and secrets) and social responsibility.  <br />He further discusses the Christian Biblical origin of U.K. as well as American Freemasonry - ceremonies and oaths using the Judeo-Christian bible; but notes the oriental (middle eastern) and far eastern development of Freemasonry - using non-Christian holy books (Koran, etc.) occurred just before and around the time of the American Revolution.  <br />MacNulty somewhat dispels the concept that America's Founding Fathers - if they were in fact Freemasons - developed the US separation of church and state to mean separation of the State from ALL churches and religions, but a separation of a Christian state from any specific Christian church.  American Freemasonry was solidly \\"Christian\\" - the Christian (i.e. not Catholic, not Protestant, not Lutheran) bible was specifically used and referred to in all official rites and ....actions.<br />MacNulty further specifies that atheists were not accepted under any condition, therefore atheists who use the separation of the church from state to force their religious beliefs on the remaining 97% of the U.S. have no historical (freemason) basis for their argument for banning \\"God\\" from public offices, buildings and ceremony. <br />MacNulty gives explains the Jungian psychological principles in his explanation of the Blue Lodge degrees , and discusses the \\"mysteries learned from  mystical Freemasonry. Deep mysticism or self searching.  He explains that the Masonic Rituals illustrate stories, symbolism is show through acting out the rites, and are for each member to interpret - until these truths can be revealed to higher degree initiates (see BEWARE below).<br />MacNulty shows the symbolism of \\"Mysteries\\" and \\"Mystery Schools\\" in Freemasonry, (first three degrees) but, does not show what these \\"mysteries\\" are, what \\"God\\" they surround, and what creed they support. Rather, MacNulty surmises that it is up to the individual to find their own truths to the ancient mysteries - a relativistic argument that I do not agree with, but others accept.<br />This debate is beyond the scope of MacNulty's book which only reviews the symbolism of the first Three Degrees (out of 33 degrees).  These higher mysteries are committed to by initiates in order to attain the first Three Degrees, but are not known until they attain much higher levels.  Even then, these mysteries are only gradually revealed as brothers become initiates of various higher degrees.<br />I point this out because so many other authors (and 33 degree masons) demonstrate that each of the Templar spin-off brotherhood societies (including freemasonry) eventually lead to Satanism, or a type of Satanism.  This is virtually opposite the promoted Third Degree presentations.  <br />Negatives:<br />The information was so well written, informative, interesting, and easily read that I found myself wanting more.  Conversely, if MacNulty wrote in more depth, or breadth it would probably have been too much information and might have broken the pace and enjoyment of the read because the text is well matched to the illustrations..  <br />BUT, BEWARE!<br />Also, McNulty should have touched upon the openly communicated Satanic beliefs of the 33rd degree Masonic Leaders like Albert Pike who explainsMasonry (in his well-known book 'Morals And Dogma'), \\"Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explainations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be mislead...\\"page 104-105 <br />\\"The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended he shall imagine he understands them.\\" page 819<br />Also, \\"That which we must say to a crowd is - We worship a God, but it is the God that one adores without superstition. To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st, and 30th degrees - The Masonic Religion should be, by all of us initates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian Doctrine.\\"<br />\\"If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay whose deeds prove his cruelty, perdify and hatred of man, barbarism and repulsion for science, would Adonay and his priests, calumniate him? Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods: darkness being necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive.\\"<br />\\"Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy; and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.\\" (Instructions to the 23 Supreme Councils of the World, July 14, 1889. Recorded by A.C. De La Rive in La Femme et l'Enfant dans la FrancMaconnerie Universelle on page 588)<br />And, \\"Lucifer, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the son of the morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with it's splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!\\" Morals and Dogma page 321<br />These statements by Freemasonry's foremost leader speak for themselves.	2002-03-17
US	51392726	R1TDRCHOFRVXZ1	1883011914	209214712	The American Revolution: Writings from the War of Independence (Library of America)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Great and Enjoyable Book for American Revolutionary History	Recommendation:<br />Whether this is a topic that excites you, or not, I believe this is a must read book (even if in part) for every American to learn the principles for which this country was founded and the great sacrifices made to attain independence.<br />Summary:<br />What greater words for understanding the thoughts and context of the American Revolution than the participants (Revolutionaries, Redcoats and British) themselves!  If you have even a nominal interest in their beliefs, causes, commitments, suffering, losses, and successes then this is the book for you!  <br />Comments:<br />The book is comprised of the 124 letters, diaries written by the participants themselves (and newspaper articles).  While we can discuss some interpretations of some writings, or excerpts, overall it provides clear insights into the motives and principles (sometimes adverse to each other) of the participants and the significance of independence to their ideals.<br />The first letter is from Paul Revere discussing his historical ride for Liberty, including his fear of \\"having his brains blown out\\" when captured. (Did you know he never finished his ride due to his capture and having his horse confiscated?)<br />Two very informative letters:<br />John Laurens letter to his father (Henry Laurens - a slave owner) (January, 1778) endorses freeing the slaves for two reasons: first to support the revolution; second, \\"I have long deplored the wretched State of these men and considered in their history, the bloody wars excited in Africa to furnish America with slaves - the Groans of desparing multitudes toiling for the Luxuries of Merciless Tyrants - I have had the pleasure of conversing with you sometimes upon the means of restoring them to their rights...\\"<br />George Washington's letter to Henry Laurens (Henry's communication - which supposedly included army intelligence -  to Washington is not found in this volume, so we have to speculate on its contents) regarding freeing slaves forthe revolution. <br />Washington responds in March 1779, \\"The policy of arming slaves ... is .... a moot point...\\" because the enemy would follow with the same action.  \\"then.... who can arm the fastest, and where are our arms? Besides, I am not clear that a discrimination will not render Salvery more irksome to those who remain in it; most of the good and evil things of this life are judged of by comparison;\\"<br />Since both Henry Laurens and George Washington owned slaves, it is inciteful to learn of their ongoing discussions of this issue as they fight and sacrifice for their own freedoms.  We gain some idea of the conflicts with the total goal of freedom, with the near term exigencies of war and revolution. Slavery was not fully accepted by some who had slaves, so the question seems a matter of when and/or how slaves should be freed.  (This is challenging for us to comprehend today)<br />Other Representative Contents:<br />Paul Revere:  Memorandum on the Events on April 18, 1775<BR>\\"The war begins:  Massachusetts, April, 1775\\"<br />John Adams to Abigail Adams:<BR>\\"Congress Votes for Independence, July, 1776\\"<br />Benjamin Franklin to Lord Howe:<BR>\\"It is impossible we should think of submission\\"<br />George Washington to Lund Washington, December 10-17, 1776<BR>\\"American Retreat, Pennsylvania, December, 1776\\"<br />Thomas Paine: \\"The American Crisis, Number 1, December 19, 1776\\"<BR>Philadelphia, December, 1776<br />Peter Oliver: \\"The Origin and Progress of American Rebellion\\"<BR>\\"A Tory View of Frontier Warfare, Summer 1778\\"<br />Nathaniel Green to Alexander Hamilton<BR>\\"Plight of the Southern Army: South Carolina, January, 1781\\"<br />Nathaniel Green to Thomas Jefferson, April 28, 1781<BR>\\"Appeal for Support from Virginia, April, 1781\\"<br />George Washington: Circular to the State Governments<BR>\\"An Appeal for New Troops: October, 1780\\"<br />Also, includes <br />Chronology <BR>Biographical Notes<BR>Notes on the Text<BR>Notes<BR>Index. <br />Negatives:<br />The book is volumous, with 800 pages of letters, making it difficult for many people to get through, or just challenging to begin.  However, as the reader goes through the book, they may wish for a specific letter that was not included.  So, this is not really a negative.<br />The old English writing and some word usage can be difficult to read until the reader adjusts to it. <br />Overall, a great, great book to understand our countries origins that I would very highly recommend to any person with the slightest interest in the truth of American Revolutionary History.	2002-03-17

Written for specialists, clinicians and students.<br />This is a seminal textbook for understanding the medical and scientific facts of hyperbaric medicine, as well as implementing hyperbaric medical technologies to patient care.  HBO  has widely varied disease and condition applications with a commonality of pressure technology.<br />Medical Economics<BR>In the modern world of medical economics, HBO can save Third Party Payers significant costs on patient treatments while delivering significantly improved outcomes and quality of life. <br />HBO is one of those medical sub-specialties that is left behind by the biases of modern medical economics and science.  Modern medicine is primarily based on pharmaceutical economics.  Significant research investments are powered by the manufacturing and distribution economics of successful drugs.  This is a great and tremendous system, delivering research, understanding and successful treatments that unquestionably alleviate disease and conditions on a broad basis.  But, this system is not perfect and is not without isolated failings. <br />HBOT cannot be packaged into a pill, has minimal manufacturing economies, and high ongoing service costs and high overhead, while associated with nominal patient volumes, and nominal billing rates.  These economics have long held back this very promising technology (HBO) and its successful applications.  Further, double blind studies are virtually impossible - patients perceive pressure changes, or lack thereof, technicians are required to implement pressurization, and oxygen delivery systems may not be able to deliver less than 100% oxygen.<br />Ironically, HBO can power pharmaceutical and surgical applications to higher levels of treatment success bringing cures where partial successes were the norms. (Chapters 9, 13 14, 15, 23, 24, 27, 33). <br />Controversially, HBO has demonstrated good clinical success on incurable diseases and conditions, including Crones Disease, stroke, CP, MS, and others.  While modern medicine debates the etiologies and optimal treatment protocols, curative HBO applications can be given today.  These applications (esp. Crones, and MS) can further illuminate etiologies therefore, furthering and accelerating alternative and supportive therapies.<br />HBOT supports diabetic wound healing, preventing amputations; enhances infectious disease therapies, saving lives and reducing hospital stays; is used for various poisonings; can provide accelerated surgical recoveries (up to 30-40% faster); and can ameliorate strokes and brain injuries by up to 40% when applied within 4 hours of injury.<br />Medical Physics<BR>Simply, under pressure, oxygen dissolves in blood serum, and therefore can diffuse to poorly supported disease areas, or injuries. Further, HBO acts as an immuno-suppressant, relieving acutely injured tissues of oedema, preventing further injuries (if applied on a timely basis), as well as supporting the natural healing process.<br />Angiogenesis occurs within 15 - 20 minutes of HBO.  It is not known if angiogenesis is initiated by the increased pressure effects, or by the oxygen dissolved in the serum.  However, angiogenesis is felt to be a factor supporting accelerated healing in injuries, chronic wounds, and surgical recoveries. Further, little is known about these growth factors and their involvement with healing.<br />Neurological Applications<BR>The chapters on neurological applications are some of the most significant in this text and should be required reading for all neurologists because they hold the greatest single promise to modern healthcare. These chapters are steeped with extensive (and largely ignored) animal and human research papers, extensive clinical studies with supportive SPECT scans and associated clinical outcomes.<br />The brain remains the final frontier of science and brain injuries are the most destructive and expensive to society (#1 killer of children and teenagers, #1 birth defect, #2 killer for adults). <br />We do not understand the brain's response to injury, or disease, much less detail its response to treatments and recoveries.  But, we can accept the overwhelming clinical observations made by trained physicians world-wide of positive outcomes to HBO when applied to brain injuries, and cerebral palsy patients.  <br />Hopefully, one day we will be able to manufacture a drug, or drug regimen that can replace HBO treatments for brain injuries.  However, that day is probably 50 years from today.  Therefore, today, we need to apply HBO to brain injuries, note the clinical outcomes, optimize the treatments, and develop ancillary supportive therapies.  <br />Diagnostic Imaging is propelling objective clinical research for neurological applications of HBO by demonstrating underlying metabolic activity changes in brain tissues with HBO. Clinical observations significantly correlate with SPECT scan changes.  (SPECT using HMPAO have become the scan of choice.)  Chapter 18 written by Dr.'s Neubauer and Harch provide an excellent foundation for understanding and support for using HBO for brain injuries and CP.<br />Table of Contents<br />Forward:   by Edward Teller, Director Emeritus Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories<br />(In a personal communication to me, Dr. Teller assures the empirical physics of HBO, and is convinced that HBO enabled him to recover from a serious stroke.

If you have a special child, get this book, because you may learn more about your child, and their own journey and thoughts. If you don't have an special child, then get this book and learn about the blessings that come with the pain and challenges of the journeys that parents of special children travel.<br />Book Review<BR>Marshall writes, with physical assistance, of things we cannot see, or imagine in our busy and cluttered lives. Yet, these are the important, and permanent things that life is determined on, not the urgent and unimportant.<br />His poems are very good (fantastic considering his age and issues) and offer a mature, yet spiritually innocent viewpoint that remains objective and not caught up with our worldly challenges.<br />Marshall is here and suffers in order to fulfill God's purpose of helping us, and those who need spiritual assistance.<br />How Marshall Helped Us Learn of Our Daughter's Thoughts, and Experiences:<BR>We have a daughter with severe cerebral palsy who cannot speak or walk an had just finished two weeks of therapy in Chicago and were catching a plane for the ride home. This was two years ago, so she was four at the time. By accident, I packed her reading books, so we stopped in the book store to find a book to read. We accidently came across Marshall's book and I explained to my daughter that Marshall was like her, and could not speak or walk, and was just a few years older. Then, I asked her if she wanted to get Marshall's book, she got very excited (happy). <br />On the plane we read the first few pages and came across this part of Marshall's poem...<br /> Even though my individuality finds<BR> sweet knowing perfection, I listen<BR> for the answers to wishes from above.<br />So, I asked my daughter if God spoke to her about her wishes and prayers. She just about jumped out of her skin!!! It was like finally!!!! Someone knows my secrets!!!! Yes, I speak to God and He speaks to me!!!!<br />I was startled, and asked her some poorly developed questions. After a couple of months, I thought about the questions I asked and also her answers, and I realized that I really did not learn what I thought I had learned. (We have to ask her questions, with two or three answers for her to choose from, then ask additional questions to further determine her correct and precise answers).<br />Because I only want the truth, regardless of the issues, I spent some time to relaly think about the questions, and alternative answers that could be gleaned from my technique, then began to ask her more precise questions to nail down her responses.<br />What I found is that she did speak to and hear from God every night. That she did remember her personal journey (died at birth for 35 minutes), and remembered seeing God when she died. She did not remember being in the hospital, being taken off life support, or anything else.<br />But, when she died, she went to heaven, and was not given a choice, but was told to return to her Mommy and Daddy (which she wanted); and she was told that her purpose was to help a lot of children who were in need. (...) She came back to us - obviously - and now is a bright 6 year old who goes to full inclusion school, has many friends and lots of fun. Yet, she cannot speak, or walk, yet. (But is making great progress!)<br />Without reading Marshall's book, I would never have thought to ask these questions, and would have never have learned my daughter's secrets.	2001-12-19

They are beautifully illustrated, well developed with accurate information (it is unusual for hotel and restaurant information to be that accurate), have enough history to help the reader understand the people and cultural background, and have a lot of useful travel information and useable maps in the appendixes.<br />Specifics:<BR>The guides are organized as follows:<br />How to use this guide<BR>Introduction to Historical and Geographical Information<BR>Geographical Regions<BR>............Introduction / History of Regions<BR>............Specific Cities / Towns<BR>........................Introduction to Towns / Cities<BR>........................Map of specific Towns / Cities<BR>........................Tour of Area of Towns / Cities<BR>........................Specific stops, historical monuments, churches, buildings, etc.<BR>....................................(Filled with great maps, architectural drawings / cutaways)<BR>Travelers Needs<BR>............Hotels<BR>............Restaurants<BR>Survival Information<BR>............Local Info.<BR>........................Police, safety, buses, trains, etc.<BR>............Travel Info.<BR>........................Maps, tours, currency, etc.<BR>............General Index<BR>............Phrase Book <br />Discussion:<BR>The book begins with &quot;Introducing Italy&quot;, including a complete map, a review of Italy, Italy's history, and Italy thought the Year - including events, etc.<br />Region with an &quot;At a glance&quot; overview, then has subsections of Cities / Towns, then specific locations, churches, historical monuments, bridges, galleries, etc. <BR>But, the really great attraction to this book is several fold; it is:<br />............Very complete<BR>............Easy to read<BR>............Beautifully and artistically completed<BR>............Good shopping, safety and other tips<BR>............Gorgeous photographs too numerous to list<br />Architectural reviews include various views, and cutaways; given greater understanding and better perspective. They are all attractive, if not works of art - honestly.<br />The travelers' Info. offers good and valid info. on prices, currencies, customs, important words, etc. I used the reviews on hotel's restaurants and nightclubs, etc. and found they were useful and accurate, and helpful with my touring and site decisions <br />The books are so well thought out that it has multiple maps, with various lookup tables, and the book's flaps are designed to be used as bookmarks for map pages.<br />Negative:<BR>The &quot;country-wide&quot; guides are by definition more general than the &quot;specific city&quot; guides.  So, if you are going to Rome, get the &quot;Rome&quot; guide.  If you decide to get the &quot;Italy&quot; guide for your 3, or 4 city tour of Italy, understand that this guide may be a little to general for all your local travel needs.<br />Conclusion:<BR>As the President, CEO of an International Meeting Planning Corporation we have many resources and techniques to learn about places we have meetings / groups at as well as the cities and sights. But, as a traveler, this book really is top notch and I would recommend it to anyone going on a personal trip, or wanting to learn about a city, or location.	2001-12-19

I am not in love with it... but my kids like it quite a bit.  It is interesting because it takes children on a journey through woods, fields, swamps, etc. to go find a bear. All along the way, there are funny sounds to show the different obstacles on the journey... woods, fields, swamps, etc.  These sounds enhance the stimulation of the journey.  As the journey reverses itself, the story repeats the words, sounds, places and experiences for enhanced learning.<br />The pictures are good, but a little dull - but the kids still enjoy them.  And, the surprise ending is fun to rush through for more excitement.<br />Overall, a good book, fun and a little bit silly.	2001-12-19

Summary:<BR>HBHG is interesting, hard to put down (although sometimes wordy), and has some good information.  But, its dangers are that it APPEARS to be well researched with deep thought, but reality is poorly researched, poorly substantiated, with weakly thought through conclusions arrived at with leaps of logic and information.  While it gives an incredible number of references, they seem skimmed over, not properly read, or used.<br />HBHG is written to represent unsubstantiated history - or, I believe, misrepresent substantiated history.  HBHG gives an interesting twist to accepted history; and compels soulful and honest research and thought. People hating Catholics, or Christians will enjoy HBHG, but must succumb to its lame research to comfort and fertilize their hates. It does bring the Catholic Church into some question, but puts no valid issue with its core Christian doctrines. <br />Good Information:<BR>Interesting and correct highlights: Pousson, the core story of Father Sauniere, some basic history of Rennes, some Christian beliefs (as presented by Christians).  It is a major accomplishmenet that it reawakens our awareness of the symbolic meaning underlying great works of art. Visit any church in Rome, or anywhere in Europe and let your mind run wild!  I did.  The symbols were useful for relaying information to a population that was mostly illiterate.<br />Bad Information:<BR>Many, many misquotes, and, if you read through other reviews, many misrepresented misquotes.<br />Now, for some poorly informed, and/or unsubstantiated issues, let's look at the things we can view unemotionally: <br />Analysis of Father Sauniere: <BR>Any junior detective could determine that Baigent missed the boat on his analysis.  Father Sauniere obviously got his money from a third party source that could be turned on and off at will; and had a relationship with; a relationship that soured, then was regained.  Oh, my goodness!! What close relationship in his book does Baigent completely miss????  It is straight forward!  Agatha Christi and Sherlock Holmes are turning over in their graves over Baigent's miss-assumptions, and weak puzzle-solving!<br />What is the valuable treasure???  <BR>Baigent regards it as the bloodline of Christ, and therefore the bloodline of the rightful royalty of Europe (known as the future anti-Christ to Christians).  Again, Baigent misses several major points:<br />1   the dossier's show nothing of real value or reliable authenticity.  In fact, Lincoln shows the ruse by the Priori de Sion in a later book. <br />2   that the true treasure of the Arthurian tales, and Templar exploits is the holy bloodline.  (Don't get me wrong, this is an interesting twist).  How about looking for another specific treasure (related to blood) retrieved by the Templars and brought to Rennes.  (This specific item is also important to the Anti-Christ.)<br />3   the exact location of Baigent's (or the true treasure).  Baigent blows it again.  He misses the hints, directions and meanings behind the Father Sauniere's rebuilt church and garden symbolism; misses much symbolic meaning within his discussions; misses the incredibly rich symbolism of the surrounding environs of the Rennes; finally he misses some incredibly rich symbolic books written to disclose the symbolic meaning of the environs (named in Baigent's own bibliography). <br />4   he doesn't follow-up with some of the straight forward history of the Templars and their retreat from Jerusalem, which would have led him to significant revelations of their true treasure, and the meaning of the riddles Baigent investigates.<br />Finally, (though there are many others) that Christ survived the crucifiction.  (But, agreeing with Baigent, Christians and Jews (Talmud, Josephus,, etc)  that Christ did exist and was crucified).  Baigent presents several ridiculous fallacies: <br />1   Roman Centurions were required to carry out orders under penalty of death, yet they didn't fulfill their orders to execute Jesus.<br />2 Christ feigned death tricking battle hardened Centurions (remember, gladiator fights to the death originated to get soldiers used to seeing death).<br />3 Christ made no living response to being speared by the Centurion who did so to make certain he was dead.<br />4 That same Centurion mistook separated blood (clear liquid serum and pericardial fluid, and settled red blood cells) for living blood for that came out of the Christ's spear wound.<br />5 Christ could survive such injuries <br />6 All this occurred with fore-planning and intent so that he could secretly establish a Royal Bloodline.<br />To readily put most of this theory to rest: Over 600 years no other person survived Roman crucifiction.  Second, why would someone go to such trouble, when the gambit has no real payoff? And, with a &quot;true lineage&quot; why haven't they made an attempt to raise its secretive, and overrun status for 2,000 years?  Why did Christ take his wife to Southern France, of all places?<br />While Baigent quotes Catholic and other history from documents and resources that most people do not have access to, we can review his many biblical misquotes, (but Lincoln's &quot;Messianic Legacy&quot;goes to town misquoting and rewriting the bible, its passages, and straight forward interpretations).  This is annoying and discrediting to the writers.  The bible is too well researched with well-established translations for a &quot;researcher&quot; to make so many audacious mistakes.  This discredits all the other areas of &quot;research&quot; because it demonstrates general sloppiness, and weak mindedness.<br />Baigent misquotes/claims: <br />1 Lazarus is not mentioned anywhere in the four gospels except at John (he didn't look at Luke 16:20).<br />2 Jesus was the bridegroom at the Cana wedding; (yet it's clearly written that he was invited). <br />3 Jesus didn't die on the cross; (the Gospels were written prior to 70 AD - Temple destruction - Christ's death was never refuted, or refutation attempted (Talmud, Josephus, Philo, etc.)<br />4 Jesus lineage was a complete massacre of accepted bible research and Jewish culture (see my earlier review).<BR> <BR>HBHG is entertaining, and can get a dedicated researcher off onto new adventures against accepted institutions and beliefs.  But, it is anything but valid research. My initial review of HBHG noted a couple glaring biblical misquotes.  Now, after completing substantial Rennes/Templar/Hospitalier/etc. research, I am negative towards Baigent's research, his intellectual honesty, or at least his intellectual powers.  But, still a good read!	2001-12-12

It is fun to read with lots of sounds and a variety of &quot;roars&quot;.  <br />The graphics are colorful and nice with colorful dinosaurs that and smile a lot, and not scary - dinosaurs can easily go over the &quot;top&quot; and get scary for kids if not done right.  The words are few, and go well together with quick rhyming and therefore good for early reading.<br />Most of all, it is fun!

Maria did a great, great job in writing a touching story that comes to life from our own experiences.  It is a collectors book, beautifully illustrated, and a quick, easy read.  So, it is in truth a wonderful children's book that many adults would love to read.  It is a \\"Kleenix\\" book -  make sure you have a box available when you read it.<br />The Story:<BR>The story features a little girl, Kate, who meets a little boy, Timmy, who has challenges doing the things that we all take for granted.  Kate asks her Mom, \\"Why is that boy different?\\"  Kate is afraid to initiate speaking with him, and is at a loss for what to do.  Her Mommy explains to Kate, that when Timmy was born, his Mommy cried a lot of tears because Timmy was hurt when he was born.  The story blossoms from there.<br />After working up all of her courage, and fumbling quite a bit, Kate  meets the boy and finds out that he is a really great kid, and has hope, and dreams, and thoughts and feelings and fears like all other children. Kate realizes that Timmy, is just like her.  From there on Kate goes out of her way to make sure that Timmy is included in her activities with her friends.<br />The Story's  Importance:<BR>This  is very important for all children (and adults) to learn more about others who are different than us as well as to learn more of their perspective.  We have a handicapped child, yet, I am still uncomfortable about how to first greet a handicapped, or challenged person when we first meet them, because I never want to intrude, or impose.. With that in mind, I can see how it very challenging for someone who has had no exposure to people who are handicapped, challenged, or just different. I wish I read this book when I was a child, because I am no different than anyone else in learning about how to meet someone with disabilities.<br />Real Life example:<BR>Our daughter (...) is severely handicapped with cerebral palsy,is six years old, and attends a full-inclusion kindergarten classroom.  (...)  (She) has been very fortunate to have made some great friends at school and out of school.  But, most children (and adults) do not know what to do, or say when they first meet her.  <br />We always introduce (her) to her new friends, and explain that when she was born, she got hurt.  And, while (she) is very bright, like they are, but her body can't do the things she wants to do.  It's kind of like when their foot falls asleep and it becomes difficult to walk!  (Her) friends relate to this and are no longer afraid of her, or of doing something wrong.  Her friends often argue over who will play with (her) or help her. Now (she) has many very good friends who play with her at school and come to the house, as well.  <br />Christmas Gifts:<BR>The book is a great holiday gift.  We thought it is so touching, and informative, we purchased about a dozen to give to (our daughter)'s therapists (touching), and her teachers (informative).  We also kept a few for our family for our own teary enjoyment!	2001-11-27

The book has catchy sounds with a great rhythmic pattern that is just fun for parents and kids!  And, when it gets stuck in your mind after hours of reciting it, it is much better than \\"It's a small world after all!\\" which drives everyone crazy!<br />Ok, so, what's my story??? <br />Our severely handicapped daughter, Rebecca, suffered through hours of arduous therapies, working and struggling to help herself.  She started this at only 2 months old and worked very hard at every single session to this day - now 6 years old.<br />Chicka Chicka Boom Boom was one of the books that we read and read and read and read to her during these never ending ordeals to keep her mind sane with her pain and struggles.  She still laughs when we recite the words!<br />By the way, Rebecca is doing very well, although she remains severely handicapped.  Her very hard work and efforts have brought her to a level no one ever thought possible (you see, she was dead for 35 minutes at birth).  She struggles to walk, speak and feed herself everyday.  ....<br />And, when you read this book, think about Rebecca and all her friends and say a little prayer for all of them!  Thanks!	2001-10-12

Recommendation: <br />Great tape; great topical instruction. One of the best tapes a Christian can buy.  Every Christian should learn about faith and commitment from the Moabitess (gentile) Ruth.  One of my very few favorites. I have given 1-2 dozens of these tapes for my friends.<br />If you are a new Christian you should get this.  This book ranks up with John, Genesis and Revelation (Revelation is a great book not because of its prophecies, but because of its 340+ references from the Old Testament).<br />Summary:<br />One of the key Old Testament books that details the Levitical legal requirements for a &quot;kinsman redeemer.  Ruth is a beautiful literary work with critical concepts and prophecies for the Jew and Christian alike.  Also, teaches the laws for gleaning, the Leverite marriage, and other Jewish customs. Ruth is a powerful four (short) chapter book that also prophecies King David's birth in Bethlehem.<br />It also demonstrates (indirectly) how suffering can have great <BR>purpose.<br />Review:<br />Naomi leaves Israel for Moab penniless and in her land (inheritance) in debt with her husband during a severe drought.  Her two sons marry Moabitess and then die. When Naomi's husband dies she returns to Israel.  Ruth perseveres and returns with Naomi, committing to love and worship Naomi's God.  While gleaning, she happens on Boaz's land where he becomes interested in her - he had heard many good things about Ruth's faithfulness and commitment to Naomi.  Naomi learns this and teaches Ruth the Jewish customs and laws and how to act for Boaz in order for Naomi to redeem her land, and therefore care for both of them.  Boaz falls in love with Ruth and redeems Naomi's land, marries Ruth and is given a prophecy after the birth of his firstborn. <br />Missler carefully instructs the listener in the subtle details that are missed when we casually read this book.  Also, there are several passages that confound us, including Ruth's request for Boaz to &quot;put hisskirt over her&quot;; the point that she is on the threshing floor with him when she makes this request; as well as the bizarre prophecies 1) &quot;may you be famous in Bethlehem&quot; and 2) &quot;may your house be like Perez&quot; (Gen 38:6-29).  He also teaches us why this book is so valuable to Christians and Jews alike because of its call for faithfulness for grace and redemption.<br />Chuck Missler's Tape Studies:<br />I listen to Missler (and Dr. Fructenbaum's) tapes when driving in my car.  They have greatly helped me extend my personal studies and spiritual growth while persevering under exceptionally arduous personal circumstances.  (I will always have a special place in my heart for Missler's K-House because of the beautiful prayer one of his staff said with me just before I had to take my daughter off life support to end her life - you can read my daughter, Rebecca's story at littlestangel.com by going to the &quot;Questions&quot; page and clicking on the icon).  <br />Missler is great because he provides well-researched biblical studies while pushing the listener / reader into a wider realm with some well-identified, but reasonably founded speculations. Many times the listener won't agree with these speculations, but they are good for some spiritual and argumentative exercises. He fully discloses his references when he is on firm ground, as well as clearly states when he is venturing into speculative territory.<br />The only negative is that I have the first version with the original notes. These notes are more sparse than the notes in Missler's more recent tape studies.  But, the notes are deep enough and have the required bibliography.  The more recent tape set may (or, may not) have updated notes - I don't know.<br />Regardless, this is absolutely a must have tape set for every Christian.	2001-10-10

As Christians, we look at the bible through our own limited gentile eyes, and interpret everything as if it belongs specifically to us.  But, Dr. Fruchtenbaum goes through the other 90% of the bible that specifically deals with Israel (the true vine, the chosen people, the people of the covenant ) and Abraham (the friend of JHWH).  After all, JHWH's entire plan for mankind is through Israel.  Christianity is only a temporary (but, very uniquely blessed) solution to Israel's temporary blindness (non-belief in Jesus as the Messiah).<br />As Paul writes &quot;everything aforetime was written for our learning.&quot;  The laws, sabbaths, history and prophecies.  All of these Jewish items were written for us to learn and understand JHWH's plan and prophecies.  But, this only occurs through Israel.<br />Review:<br />Dr. Fruchtenbaum's work, thoughts and writing style is logical, well-researched, deep and insightful.  But, he writes so you can easily follow him and understand his subjects, arguments, and conclusions.<br />Dr. Fructenbaum takes the reader through the information, logic and interpretations and related verses in a manner that actually teaches the reader to improve their abilities to think (in terms of biblical interpretation).  In completing this book, the reader will learn a great deal about Judaism and Christianity from the proper Jewish perspective and thought patterns.  More importantly, the reader would learn how to read the bible effectively in order to logically understand the scripture and its deeper complexities and interpretations as well as learn how to think through what he has read in order to come tohis own conclusions.  <br />The book is thorough, deep and well resourced, well referenced with extensive bibliography  and thorough biblical references, as well as direct references to bibliographical resources on each page. <br />If there is a drawback to this book (notwithstanding &quot;A reader from Omaha, NE USA's&quot; excellent November 14, 2000 comments) the book is deep, has a lot of information, and requires time and effort to go through (1052 pages!!).  Conversely, Dr. Fruchtenbaum makes the journey easy and well worth the effort.  Further, the book would not be as significant if it lacked these attributes.<br />A second drawback (ironically, opposite to the above) is that because the book is so extensive, it skims explanations and references to certain interpretations that are discussed within subsections of subsections.  For example: in chapter X. &quot;A Dispensational Israelology&quot;, section B. &quot;Israel Present&quot;, subsection 1. &quot;Israel Present&quot;, sub-subsection e. &quot;The Mystery Kingdom&quot; where Dr. Fruchtenbaum discusses the 9 parables of Matthew 13:1-53.  Here he discusses the parables and their interpretations, but leaves out supporting references, ex. parabolic &quot;birds&quot; are symbolic of evil spirits (symbolic definition given by Christ himself in Matthew 13:18).<br />(Sorry, I coincidentally used the same pages to comment on as did the good reader from Omaha).<br />Please note that it would be far too much to ask Dr. Fruchtenbaum to give this detail as it would (at some point) interfere with the general mission of the book.  But, it is an issue as readers dig deeper into the book's topics, research and interpretations non-the-less.  It should be noted that in making this book Dr. Fruchtenbaum dramatically shortened his original 2,200 page tome.  I can only suppose that the point above was induced to accomplish this dramatic reduction. <br />Final Note:<br />For readers who wish to gain additional insights into Dr.Fructenbaum's ministry and teachings, I recommend his audio tapes at ariel.org.  Although, they have poorer audio qualities than other tape ministries, the tapes fully support the Dr.'s research and teachings.	2001-10-01

It goes through every marathon in Olympic history, giving each race history, events, course, statistics, etc.  It is very thorough, while pacing itself to get in all the Olympic marathons into a single volume.  And, it was written in an interesting and readable manner.<br />The competition and sport of the races themselves give a great basis for an exciting read.  <br />If you are doing a research project (like I was) this was the only book I would recommend - or, at least the first book.  I could not find a book anywhere that showed the 1960 Rome Olympic course.  Martin and Gynn had it.  In fact, their race course map was better than the map a friend obtained for me from the Italian Olympic Library (Federazione Italiana Di Ateletica Leggera).	2001-09-29

US	51392726	R27M46WRDJE44F	1565071999	14385456	A Woman Rides the Beast: The Roman Catholic Church and the Last Days	Books	4	23	35	N	N	An important book for Christians	The real question is: &quot;Is this book relevant?&quot;<br />The answer is a very resounding &quot;YES!&quot;<br />Christians and Catholics really should read this book, but do so with an open mind and with a grain of salt and a lot of deep thought. The truth shall set us all free; and false gospels will damn all those that follow them (Galatians 1:6-9). So, the real question, is what is the truth, and when are we falling away from it? You won't really find the answer in this book, but Hunt will certainly give you some fascinating history to ponder and the references to search through.<br />The book is very readable and Hunt does an excellent job in presenting an extremely broad and deep list of references to support his statements. Unfortunately, neither you nor I will ever have access to most of his references to confer his analysis. And, he fails to recognize the critical issue of the &quot;great Harlot&quot; described in Revelation 17 (as does almost everyone else!)!<br />With that said, much of his presentation appears factual, with plenty of accessible references as well as hundreds of unaccessible Vatican archive references. He takes us through the history of the Catholic Church to the present day. Some of this history is fairly well hidden by the Catholic Church, but available (thus, verifiable) to determined researchers.<br />After reading this book, I still have many questions regarding the Albigensees, and Cathars, and many of the other religious groups murdered by the Catholic Church (as many as 25,000 Christians killed in a single afternoon!) Despite Hunts portrayal of the situation. I suggest you cautiously read Holy Blood, Holy Grail for Baigent's presentation the beliefs of the Albigensees, and Cathars and others. Hunt calls them Christians, Baigent tells a very different story of false Christians - but I have more problems with Baigent's research than Hunt's.<br />However, that still begs the question, how can a Church murder 25,000 people in a single afternoon and still call itself Christian? Hunt damns the Catholic Church, but doesn't really take on the issues and manner of rule that existed in those times. Will that remove the sin of murder? No. But, at least it would give us more to ponder and weigh.<br />But, to really appreciate the truth of some of Hunt's statements and references, one must travel to Rome and visit the Vatican, St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican Museums, as well as a dozen or so of the Catholic Churches in Rome. The artwork is stunning, but the symbols and icons and pagan idols (mostly stolen by past Roman Emperors and then procured by various popes) that adorn the churches are specifically not Christian. In fact, I would venture to say that the Vatican Museum has more Egyptian pagan idols and images in it than can be found in Egypt.<br />Another example, in front of The Church of Our Lady of Nineva (a Babylonian name) stands an elephant with an Egyptian obelisk (dedicated to the God Osiris) on its back. It, and the other churches have skull and crossbones, ramskulls, and many other pagan icons carefully designed within their intricate artistry with great thought and very high costs over the centuries. What does it mean? All of the churches were built with tremendous thought put into architecture and symbolic art. And, they have been actively maintained as such. <br />Hunt has some good thoughts on the failings of the Catholic Church. But, how does Hunt reconcile the Church that reads the Nicene Creed every Sunday with the Church of record? He really doesn't. Regardless, the book is a trove of information and references for one to start their own research journey into learning the truth about the largest Church in the world.<br />Regarding all of the Catholic Churches failings: it is a large bureaucracy that has had a long history of great and horrible leaders. It has a number of beliefs that cannot be found in any scriptures (transubstantiation, Mariology, purgatory, indulgences, papal infallibility), and it has historically failed to obey Christ's commands - &quot;Love God&quot;, &quot;Love thy neighbor&quot;, and &quot;Love the enemy&quot; (sic, Cathers and Albigenseans) but, it also announces the Nicene Creed every liturgy. It was a Church that existed during the times when the greater population (including many kings) could not read, or write; and feudal kings dictated the beliefs of peasants. The Catholic Church has many failings, but, it should be recognized that it still holds many Christians in its ranks.<br />Finally, Hunt misses the boat on the most important issue of the post-rapture tribulation church...... by definition, it will not have any Christians in it!! None of them will!! But, of all the Churches, the Catholic Church will be the largest in terms of adherents (even if it has the highest percentage of Christians raptured), with the greatest infra-structure of buildings, etc, and probably will then be the great harlot! <br />So, is it really fair to hammer away at the Catholic Church when every other church will have adherents in their Sunday mass following the rapture? Sure. We have to always search for the truth, no matter how painful, or disturbing. In fact the more disturbing the truth is, the more we should search it out. We are all judged on our deeds and beliefs. Except faithful believers will have their sins burned away as the chafe. Maybe a lot of Catholics will have little on them except the smell of smoke when the arrive in heaven, but there will be a lot of Catholics in heaven.<br />For the record: I was baptized Catholic and attend a well chosen Catholic church, but call myself a faithful Christian, not a Catholic.	2001-08-05

Summary:<br />A must read book if you know someone with a stroke, Cerebral Palsy, or other brain injury.  HBOT has many well-established clinical applications on a widely diverse number of conditions and diseases.  The most interesting is the application for restoring cognitive abilities in brain injured children and adults.  After all, the brain remains the final frontier of medicine!  <br />Send me an e-mail for any questions (parent to parent)and I can send websites for further info. <br />TEXAS NOW REQUIRES THIRD PARTY PAYMENTS FOR HBOT FOR COGNITIVE INJURIES!!  BUY THIS BOOK TODAY, AND GET THOSE THERAPIES IMMEDIATELY!<br />Review:<br />The book is well written, and makes heavy medical science easy to read. It explains the medical and physiological science of hyperbaric oxygen treatments (&quot;HBOT&quot;) in some detail, but was written for you and me to read and understand. It reviews HBOT for many different diseases and conditions, including MS, stroke, arthritis etc. The commonality for these diseases and their response to HBOT is they each have systemic circulatory problems and an immune response, with disruption of cellular metabolism as root problems in their etiology. <br />It is very helpful for parents and patients to understand whether or not HBOT would be a viable treatment alternative. It also discusses how HBOT affects the condition, or disease, and whether the treatments are curative (carbon dioxide poisoning), or simply maintain the current state (multiple sclerosis). <br />If you have a child, or relative who has had a stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis (yes- MS), order this book NOW! Learn all you can about HBOT, its applications to your loved one's condition. When you consider all the pain, agony, lost income and costs associated with currently insurance approved therapies, and the dismal results achieved, spend a few dollars and an hour to read the relevant parts of the book and think outside the box, a little. HBOT is not laetrile.HBOT is a well established (everywhere else in the world) and basic technology that enables your body to get a boost to naturally repair itself through its own natural physiological response to oxygen under pressure. HBOT is used every day in the US for wound care - which has much of the same basis as neurological wound care (stroke, asphyxia, or brain injury).<br />The Author<br />Dr. Neubauer is one of the world's top experts on HBOT and his work, efforts and patient care are well-respected by other top HBOT experts. He is known and respected as the &quot;Grandfather of HBOT for neurological conditions&quot;. While at his center for my daughter's treatments I met a number of HBOT experts who visit him to confer and continue research and had the privilege of reading letters from many more HBOT physician- scientists from UK, Canada, Italy, China, Russia, the US, etc.<br />HBOT Summaries<br />HBOT is used worldwide for various injuries including various poisonings, and crushed wound injuries (sic - car accidents, etc.). HBOT is used in many advanced countries including UK, Italy, Russia, Japan and China (and many poorer countries) for treating closed wound brain injuries from birth, accidents, or strokes. HBOT is not accepted by the US medical community, yet, due to the lack of double-blinded studies as well as due to the lack of understanding of the underlying physiology. Note: the underlying physiology of approximately 50% of the drugs listed in the Physician's Desk Reference are poorly understood.<br />HBOT has been clinically demonstrated to be effective in treating a variety of closed wound brain damage injuries by enabling the body to re-establish damaged blood vessels, and by &quot;waking up&quot; neurons made dormant from injuries. Recent Russian studies show some of the underlying physiological mechanisms (for neurological injuries) appear to be the elimination of the deficit and restoration of CO2 formation and consequently the autoregulation of the O2 transport to the neuron (using minimized hyperbaric treatments - 1.1 - 1.2 ATA). Essentially, correcting the effects of oxygen deprivation from the injury by re-establishing micro-circulatory and intra-cellular O2 / CO2 metabolisms. The disrupted neuronal metabolisms appear throughout the &quot;penumbra&quot; of the brain injury. This helps explain Dr. Neubauer's theory &quot;waking up&quot; of sleeping/dormant neurons.<br />Personal Experience<br />My daughter (Rebecca, five yo) has extremely severe cerebral palsy (died at birth for 35 minutes, life support for 6 days; no viable EEG, etc.). Going into the HBOT therapies, I was excited and hopeful. But, not prepared for how I was amazed at her response, as well as the improvement in her brain (SPECT) scans. I had several leading doctors (cardiologists and pediatric neurologists) read her SPECT scan results and each expert was astounded at the changes. Rebecca gained metabolic activity in 80%+ of the areas that were previously inactive/dormant prior to HBOT treatments. Rebecca clearly demonstrated the physical ability improvements corresponding with SPECT scan improvements. Her improved physical control, coordination and motor learning were easily measured and noted by every therapist and doctor who regularly works with her.<br />HBOT for CP children<br />For children, HBOT is not a miracle cure.  Children must grow, develop and mature through stages.  Each stage provides a neurological basis for developing into the following stage.  HBOT enables the patient to revitalize damaged, but living but otherwise non-functional neurons.  However, once those neurons are revitalized, they need input on how to develop, where to establish connections, and how to be integrated into the brain and body's general system.  Thus, HBOT must be co-treated with physical therapies.<br />Recent HBOT Clinical Findings       Dr. Neubauer's recent International Symposium on HBOT for CP and the Brain Injured Child (July 25-28, 2001) presented numerous positive clinical research findings on HBOT for brain injuries.  While there is substantial work to be done to better understand the underlying metabolic and physiological principles of what happens on the cellular and systemic levels, there is very little doubt about the efficacy of HBOT for treating neurologic injuries and conditions.  <br />Many HBOT Center Medical Directors can name cortically blind CP patients who have gained sight after 40-150 HBOT treatments. This is exceptionally objective clinical information that should be pursued.<br />BUY THIS BOOK!!!!	2001-08-05

So much so that it is difficult to dismiss UFO's regardless of our underlying beliefs. But, most of the reports and concepts of UFO's cannot fit with the basic principles of physics -which are the same throughout the universe. Most other books fail to research and offer support in this area rendering their claims less than believable. <br />What is different and exceptionally interesting and valuable about this book is that it takes a 180 degree turn to review this information from a completely different paradigm - UFO's could be from an alternative dimension. From this multi-dimensional vantage point, many of the odd facts, and abduction and other reports on UFO's fit together better and are more easily accepted. It also touches upon some of the laws of physics to show why these laws are at issue and therefore must be dealt with.<br />Going a step further, Missler and Eastman then review ancient passages in an attempt to determine if this multi-dimensional paradigm can fit with Jewish, or Christian scriptural beliefs. It appears that their research really pays off well with a different paradigm that supports all of the disparate and anomalous UFO reports.<br />Of course there have been many speculations regarding various UFO reports, and in turn, Missler/Eastman do make certain leaps in possible interpretations of come biblical passages (which they readily identify as such). But, overall, the paradigm seems to have greater footing than any other UFO model I have read about.<br />From this book emerges the following: we cannot explain away UFO's - there is just too many reports that cannot be explained; and, most UFO reports do not fit with the principles of physics as we know them.; therefore an alternative paradigm is required in order to better understand UFO phenomena. The Missler / Eastman paradigm seems to best pull the facts together as we believe we know them.<br />Note for New Agers: Don't avoid this book, or be afraid of it because it concludes with a Christian perspective on UFO. The book is not steeped in \\"hell fire and brimstone\\" or sermons. Rather, it is a serious book that takes a deep look at anomalous and challenging UFO phenomena. I would be interested in hearing from others where they objectively see the flaws of this model, as well as what model fits better.	2001-08-01
US	51392726	R1CYYJNBGVHVUI	0440136482	598516960	Holy Blood, Holy Grail	Books	3	92	136	N	N	Gripping Story, Flawed Research	Summary:       Baigent completed an interesting review of Europe's Royal Bloodlines (Merovingian). His writing style makes the subject come to life and appear to be accurate.  However, his ultimate hypothesis rests on very weak and inaccurate biblical quotes demonstrating a cursory research and  knowledge of the bible.  This issue renders his final hypothesis highly  doubtful and his base genealogical research of the Merovingian bloodlines  fully under question. <br />Recommendation:      I would recommend Baigent's  book as interesting and thought provoking reading, while encouraging  self-research and skepticism by the reader.  While I found Baigent's book  useful in understanding what family the anti-Christ derives from (that is,  the lineage of the serpent/dragon that dwells in the &quot;sea&quot;), the  average person can be deceived into believing biased suppositions and  allegations lacking appropriate research.  Overall, it seems as if Baigent  is a dupe who has been supported to spout whatever stories the Merovingians  need to support their own questionable objectives.<br />Review:   Although,  highly offensive to Christians, the book can be relevant to biblically  knowledgeable people IF his genealogical research of the royal families  from 400 BC forward is accurate.  The bizarre myth of the origination of  the Merovingians (a pregnant woman being re-impregnated by a serpent/dragon  while swimming in the ocean) can be re-interpreted from the bible and its  symbolism found in the books of Genesis (Gen 3 - the Serpent) and  Revelation (Rev 12 - the dragon). This is the myth that the Merovingian  Dynasty relies on in order to re-acquire the throne of Europe leads  Christian's to interpret the Merovingians to be the ancestors of the still  prophetic world leader (commonly known as the anti-Christ).   Further,  Baigent touts that this royal family heir should be able to solve the  religious problems and bring together the Jews, Christians, Moslems -  another Christian prophesy specifically regarding the anti-Christ.<br />    Examples of Feeble Research:<br />1        Re-interpretation of Catholic  Church History <br />Baigent seems to enjoy re-interpreting the Catholic  Church's actions into supporting the tenants of the Merovingian Blood line.   But, offers no proof.  Numerous times Baigent notes that the Catholic  Church &quot;backs&quot; down when &quot;presented&quot; with the Prior de  Sion &quot;secret information.  However, Baigent never confirms the  information presented to the Church, and never provides supporting material  to explain the Church's actions and decisions. His only explanation is  theory  based on conjecture based on assumption based on supposition.  The  Catholic Church may have many reasons to (correctly, or incorrectly) to  make a decision on.  The least of the factors affecting the Church's  decisions would be information that is not demonstrable, not confirmable,  with no sound basis to support a change in Church Doctrine and specifically  supports the Church's own prophesies of the Anti-Christ.  <br />This feeble  research weakens &quot;Baigent's&quot; base genealogical research.  NOTE:  This review is not to be interpreted as a defense of the Catholic Church -  it stands in its own beliefs, blessings, blood and sins. Nor, is this  review a blind defense to Christianity - it is based on valid study of the  bible and its text that is verifiable to all readers.<br />2     Two  Genealogies of Christ<br />Baigent accounts for the differences between the 2  genealogies in Matthew and Luke as demonstrating &quot;mistakes&quot; in  the bible.  However, the issue is readily understandable: Matthew and Luke  present Christ's genealogy for different purposes, and from different  perspectives.  <br />Matthew communicates the gospel from viewpoint of Jew -  Christ is presented as the Lion of Tribe of Judah.  For this, Matthew  starts Christ's lineage with Abraham progressing through David and Solomon,then progressing through Christ's legal father, Joseph, and finishing by  presenting Christ as the Messiah - the Lion of the tribe of Judah.<br />  Luke's genealogy is specifically a very different genealogy, but it states  it is of Jesus the &quot;supposed&quot; son of Joseph which is the son of  Heli.... and on.  This is not a &quot;begotten&quot; genealogy (bloodline),  but a Mother's genealogy that is represented in accordance with the Jewish  custom - Hebrews did not permit the name of a woman to enter the  genealogical tables, but inserted the husband as the son of him who was in  reality the father-in-law.  That is, Heli is Joseph's Father-in-law.  This  is consistent with Old Testament lineages of David the show Boaz as David's  ancestor, but does not mention Rahab, who is also significant and mentioned  in other passages.<br />Luke was a physician and was preoccupied with  presenting Christ as the Son of Man - in his humanity. He showed that  Christ was God incarnate.  Borne of a Virgin into humanity.  Luke starts  Christ's genealogy from 1st man - Adam - to King David.  However, Luke goes  through David directly to David's son Nathan - Solomon's brother.  His  genealogy is then traced through to Heli, Mary's Father.  This demonstrates  the actual Blood line of Christ.  <br />Second, these genealogies are very  significant in that they comply with every requirement of prophecy and law  in the Hebrew scriptures.  Including in Genesis 3, where the Messiah had to  be born of the Virgin.  Second, Jeremiah 22 states that God placed a blood  curse on the lineage of David from King Jeconiah forward - that is no one  of Jeconiah's descendants shall sit on the throne of David.  Joseph was of  this bloodline and lineage and therefore disqualified from sitting on the  throne of David. <br />Luke's lineage of Mary (Luke 3) goes through David and  not through Solomon, but through Nathan, a branch that avoids the Jeconiah  blood curse (Jeremiah 22) &quot;None of His seedwill prosper&quot;.  Thus,  Mary, who is the blood &quot;Virgin&quot; parent of Jesus was not cursed  and therefore the proper blood forebear of the Christ, while Joseph was the  legal heir to the throne, but, not the blood heir of the Messiah.<br />This  issue is in stark contrast to the Merovingian bloodline which requires  Joseph's and Christ's bloodline to support its dynastic ruse.  The  Merovingian genealogy goes through the bloodline of Joseph and therefore is  accursed by God (Jeremiah 22) and will specifically never sit upon David's  throne.<br />(Other Genealogical Notes for the Curious)     John unabashedly  focuses on Christ as the Son of God - Deity - and includes things in his  gospel that are quite different than the other gospels.  John's gospel  demonstrates the genealogy of the pre-existent one who was before all else.   He created everything and everything was created by him.  Christ  pre-existed all of creation.  John uses the term &quot;fulfilled&quot; 38  times to focuses on who he was as prophesied in the old testament.  Baigent  fully misses this genealogy and its full significance of demonstrating  Christ as God. <br />Mark presents Christ as the Suffering Servant who came to  earth to serve mankind.  Mark does not give Christ's genealogy because no  one cares about the bloodline of a servant.  Mark continually demonstrates  Christ's works, or services to his people - those with faith.  <br />The four  gospels are very consistent in how they show Christ and his genealogy as  the Messiah in accordance with the Hebrew scriptures: Matthew, the Legal  Heir to the Throne of David; Luke the lineage of a man from the first man,  Adam; John the lineage of God, who came down as the Messiah; and Mark which  shows Christ as the suffering servant, and as such a servant, does not have  a lineage.	2000-02-21
