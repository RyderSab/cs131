This book is an interesting, well written description of Freemasonry.<br /><br />It covers the history of Masonry, from the operative lodges of the middle ages to the modern lodge as we know it today.<br /><br />The chapters on the role of Freemasonry in the founding of this country, detailing the Masonic lives of Ben Franklin and George Washington, was particularly interesting and the book did an excellent job of describing some of the terms I've heard used but was unclear of.  Mainly of the \\"Moderns\\" and \\"Ancients\\" branches of Freemasonry.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars except it was a little unclear on the terms of Scottish and Ancient York Rite he threw around describing the origins of the Fraternity.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent, well written book.  It would be a great addition to any brother's Masonic library, or a book for the curious folk wanting to learn more about the great institution of Freemasonry.	2005-07-08

As a conservative and someone who looks at the Constitution as a static document that is the framework of our government (Mark would call me an originalist much in the same mold as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia) I raced to buy Men in Black to see how exactly the Supreme Court was overstepping it's bounds.<br /><br />I was dissapointed.<br /><br />Maybe Mark Levin should take a writing class, because his book is nearly impossible to understand. I didn't study the law, but I did major in American History and have no problem reading flowery prose of great historical writers like Paine, Jefferson, or Franklin. If I could get through a Patrick O'Brian novel in 2 days, I thought I could get through anything.<br /><br />This book takes the cake on being confusing. He makes no clear point on his thesis of Judicial activism. He cites case law almost continually in blockquotes that run nearly three quarters of the page. He inserts them as if they alone are supposed to make his point. Anyone who is not a lawyer will find it hard to understand.<br /><br />The opening chapters are the worst. His discussion on sodomy laws and courts intervening in matters of homosexual sex and marriage make no sense at all, and he fails to back up this opinion that states should be allowed to ban homosexual marriage.<br /><br />He relies to heavily on citing long drawn out case laws and excerpts from judical opinions instead of giving a clear and concise background and historical analysis of the Constitution itself and how he believs it sets a framework for American law.<br /><br />How about a little Constitutional theory here?<br /><br />I had to grab my own copy of the Constitution to refresh my memory because this book on Constitutional law doesn't even contain a copy of the Contitution!!<br /><br />I agree with the point of his book, but I found myself more confused at the end of it. I failed to completely grasp what exactly the role of the Judiciary is and how different rulings are fundamentally unconstutional (speaking as a originalist again). It seems that his thesis is not so much that the courts are taking apart the Constitution, but are really just contradictory to previous opinions.<br /><br />I think instead of citing case law after case law he should have discussed the Constitution itself, and how exactly the courts are overstepping their authority.seems that his thesis is not so much that the courts are taking apart the Constitution, but are really just contradictory to previous opinions.

Robinson is a fast paced and enjoyable read about Christian religious fundamentalism and Freemasonry.  <br /> <br />It shows a lot of the tactics used by Antis (anti-masons), and delves into the truth behind the lies that many anti-Masons (most notably Rev. Pat Robinson) mention such as \\"Lucifer as God\\", worship of Baphomet, and the strange belief that Freemasonry is a religion.  <br /> <br />Like Born In Blood, this book is in two parts.  The first part details his investigations among the general public and with the antis themself.   <br /> <br />The second part of the book deals with his interactions with Masons and their families, and what Freemasons think of the anti-mason backlash. <br /> <br />I suggest this for all Masons, and for people who might have heard negative things about Freemasonry, but still are not sure.	2005-01-17

Though somewhat tedious at times, this is one of the books to go to if you really want to know about the history of the Knights Templar and of Freemasonry.<br /><br />The first part of the book deals with the history of The Templars, the warrior monks, who were one time protectors of the Church, and then became its biggest target.<br /><br />The second part of the book deals with the ties of modern Freemasonry to those Knights, and discusses symbolism in the rituals and rites of modern Freemasonry.<br /><br />Mr. Robinson goes in depth into the story of religious persecution, the Crusades, and their effect on bringing out the medieval secret society that would later publicly emerge as The Freemasons in 1717.<br /><br />Some people may accuse this book of being somewhat anti-Catholic, but the tone really sets up the reasons why Freemasonry came to be, and why one of the fundamental tennants of it is religious tolerance and freedom of persecution.	2005-01-17

HMS Surprise, by Patrick O'Brian is the third in the Aubrey/Maturin series of novels about the British Navy during the early 19th Century.  This tome starts with Captain Jack Aubrey, now a post captain, temporarily commanding the large frigate HMS Lively while the primary captain is busy with another task.  His job as captain is the boring job of running a blockade, and he is  bored, broke, and trying to find a way to find enough money to marry his sweetheart, Sophie Williams.<br />Thanks to some intervention by his good friend and surgeon, Stephen Maturin, he is given command of HMS Surprise, a small frigate which Jack served on as a young midshippman.  Jack is charged with the task of protecting the East-India fleet from destruction and confication by the French.<br />His job takes him to the great India subcontinent, and the rich sights and smells that go with it.  Along the way we see an amazing storm at sea, the damage that can be inflicted on a ship and her crew while rounding Cape Horn, an amazing act of surgery performed by Stephen Maturin.<br />The final battle that pits &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey, the Surprise and a vastly outgunned fleet of ships against the far superior French forces.  The story more  is clear, fast paced, and exciting.  Just like Jack now commands a ship he knew is his youth, HMS Surprise moves along at a comfortable enjoyable pace as O'Brian comes into his element at writing great stories.<br />The story is exciting, fun to read, and the characters are truly interesting and well developed.  As anyone who is interested in 19th century &quot;ships of the line&quot;, naval history, or just love a great story, this  book is sure to please.	2004-04-26

They are fun, exciting, and great imaginative reads. They are not the easiest books to read, but they are swashbuckling fun.<br />In case you don't know who Patrick O'Brian is, he is the author of the 20 books in the Jack Aubrey adventure series. Most recently his books, Master and Commander and Far Side of the World, were loosely adapted for the screen. The movie though great does not do the books justice.<br />The first book in the Jack Aubrey series details the beginning of the strong friendship of Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin. They meet at a concert where Jack elbows Stephen in the ribs, and the rest is fiction history.<br />When Jack Aubrey is promoted to the rank of Master and Commander he is given command of a sloop, the HMS Sophie. Needing a doctor for his new command, he invites his new friend, Stephen to come along on the cruise.<br />The ship is a small, slow, undergunned Man O' War with a out of practice crew and a new commander. Soon though, through the will of Jack, the ship becomes a lean fighting vessel taking numerous prizes while on patrol, briging fame and fortune to the up and comming commander.<br />The book shows in great detail the rigors of life at sea. From dangerous storms, engangement with the enemy, to the boredom of life in between engagements.<br />Jack, though a brilliant seaman, tends not to play the political game very well, and proves it by having a not so private trist with the wife of the Commodore. This action leads him and his ship to not get the recognition they deserves and ultimately leads to the actions in the final battle which I will leave for you to find out when you read this exciting book.<br />I highly suggest you try these books. They are fun, well written, and exciting books that detail life at sea during the start of the 19th century.	2004-04-05

Daily routines of hard work, bad food, and brutal discipline are told in a rich and colorful language.  Also wonderfully accounted are the feeling of true independence and discovery that came about from traveling on the high seas to areas where no one has ever been before.<br />The story is highly entertaining, and kept me turning the pages, though more than any other book, this novel has a steep lurning curve.   Most of that is the fact that this IS the tenth book.  Though this book is good, I would suggest you start with \\"Master and Commander\\" (Book 1), as a lot of things in this book rely on knowing backstory from the previous books.<br />There are many terms, both nautical and specific to the 19th century, which are routinely used in the books.  Words like Foresail, Mainsail, Mizzensail, Flying Jib, Foremast Stay, and Bowsprit will be new to those who are not adroit in nautical language or in 19th century life.  You can easily learn through looking the words up, it is easier to start with \\"Master and Commander\\", as they explain a lot of the terms very plainly in that book.<br />Overall the book is wonderfully written, and entertaining read, though it is nothing at all like the movie.  Those of you who are hoping to \\"read the movie\\" will be dissapointed,  but those who love colorful period accounts and stories will love this book.	2004-03-26

Books	4	4	7	N	N	A good easy read:  A Libertarian Primer	In his new book, Give Me a Break : How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media,  John Stossel (the co-host of ABC's 10/10) discusses his past as a consumer affairs reporter and his revelation during his work that a lot of the problem in Amercia today come from huge government intruding in our everyday lives.  The programs supported and paid for by you and me stifle innovation and make us less prosperous.<br />Similar to \\"Who's Looking Out for You\\", by Billl O'Reilly, this book is a much more easy read and comes off as less preachy.  The language is smooth and flowing and comes across a lot more like a converstation and less like a book of thought and ideas.<br />Stossel discusses his early days, his battle with severe stuttering, and his early work as an investigative reporter.<br />During his tenure at ABC he went from consumer affairs reporter to skeptic of big government.  Supporters of his who loved his work when he was skeptical of big businesses, began to question his integrity when he started questioning big government.<br />His topics range from discussing the FDA process of approving drugs, which he sees as taking entirely too long, to government regulations which cause people to be overpaid for government contracts, to the benefits of \\"greed\\".<br />Frequent followers of Stossel will no doubt recognize many of his arguments.  Many of the chapters closely follow and discuss many of his television specials like \\"Are we Scaring Ourselves to Death\\" and \\"John Stossel Goes to Washington\\"<br />Though the book is a quick and enjoyable read, it tends to drag on a bit. Some of the chapters could be condenses slightly, as some of his arguements get repetetive.<br />Anyone who subscribes to the tennents of a Libertarian, that is small government, free markets, and less government intrusion in your personal life will find this book enjoyable.<br />For heavier reading I would point you toward books by Larry Elder or, if you are really looking for something heavy, Ayn Rand.ou are really looking for something heavy, Ayn Rand.	2004-02-18

The same things that seemed mysterious before now seen annoying, corrupted, and prone to the the same problems as the rest of the world.<br />Lord Voldemort is back, but no one seems to believe Harry.  The Ministry of Magic sends a dreadful women to watch over Hogwarts, Harry, and Dumbledore.

Voldemort and his followers versus the good wizards.

I do miss them greatly now that this journey is done, but I look forward to sharing more of his journeys.<br />I know a lot of people are protesting these books. They do this because they don't understand them.  These books are simply a story of a simple boy who finds greatness, and fights evil with his friends.  There is not a person a live who, when a child, didn't fantasize about this.

I first was intrigued by the different types of beers out there when I started frequenting a local bar that had over 200 types of beers. A lot of what I thought of beers was learned from tasting myself, when I found this book I was able to make even more informed beer buying and tasting decisions. First off this book tells you more than enough to make you beer saavy, from knowing how different beers and ales should taste, smell, and  look, to how to serve them. From this understanding you are able to know what you are drinking. You will be able to judge beers not on a whim, but based on how they are supposed to taste based on their style. I had the first book, which was good, but this is more complete.  In this edition the author removed some redundancies, and increased his scope of sampling so you can get a more broad idea of beers from different regions, and breweries. This book is a must-have for any newcomer to beer. But it is also great for for the person who thinks they've tasted it all. No matter what you knowledge of beer, you will find his insights and lessons insightful, and entertaining. Take it with you on your next cross country trip, or to the beer distributor and try a something new!!	2001-06-17

That can be true, but this book is a very simple start for beer. Let's face it, the vast majority of beer drinkers aren't brewmasters, or don't know the difference between dry hopping and beechwood aging. For those of you who really want to get started, and learn a little about beer and various points of interest in the beer world.  The best part of the book, in my opinion, is the write-ups of famous or notable beers, from Yuengling, America's Oldest Brewery, to Anheuser Busch, Americas Largest.  This book lays out a beginners plan to whet their appetite. More advanced beer lovers move on.	2001-06-17

At first I began to read it only because it was a requirement of my major, but this quickly became one of my favorite books I've read in my studies. The story is of a young jewish boy, being brought up in a ethnically diverse New York City. It is about his grappling with his spirituality, and his perceptions of the world.  One thing I learned about the Jewish culture is of its strong patriarchy, and this book shows conflicts that arise between father and son, and how a son can almost never live up to his father's expectations. The story is haunting, and the landscapes are vivid and picturesque.  I also recommend a similar book, &quot;Bread Givers&quot;, by Anzia Yezierska.	2001-04-10

If you've ever been lost in the woods...	..then you know the kinds of things that can play tricks on your mind. Imagine you are a scared little girl, with only a bag lunch to eat, and no clue on how to get out. Thats the mind set you have to be in to begin to read this book.  Many will tell you that this book is about spirituality, or finding yourself, or whatever.  But this basically comes down to the mind games you play when you are in total solitude, and the with the absense of normal 20th century comforts, how vulunerable you indeed are. This book does show however, that despite that you may be mad at your loved ones, or feel like you hate the position you are in, it is still best to be amongst the ones you love, and in your current position, because that is better than the alternative, which is solitude and lonliness. Read this book, its a quick read, easy to understand, and it might make you appreciate your comforts, and even like the little annoyances that normally would drive you nuts.	2001-04-10

This book was a very good start for my approach of eating a healthier sustainable diet, but his attack on meat, poultry, dairy got annoying. His advice is good, he points out simple common sense techniques to \\"volumize\\" your food.  The pictures in this book really point out how some small fatty food equals a big sald, some cantelopue, and other stuff. It really gets you thinking. I would have given the book 3 or 4 stars, but his book has NO REPIPES. It would be a great book to be used in conjuntion with another similar book that contains recpies such as \\"Volumetrics Weight-Control\\" by Barbara Rolls.  Thats how I use this book, I use it in conjunction with my Volumetrics Book, together  you can eat healthy food that actually tastes good, feel more full on fewer calories. It is truly a diet that is sustainable.	2001-02-27

The recipes in this book are simple, and you don't need weird stuff like tofu or soy products. (if you want them, they wouldnt' hurt)<br />Many of these recipes are simple enough so you get a great understanding of how to cook in a volumeteric style, and adapt a way of healthy eating that will last a lifetime.  Most diets aren't sustainable, but this I could eat these recipes and from now on and keep my wight off in doing so. You can eat all the same foods you always eat more or less, but with just a few adaptations you will actually eat less calories. So far I'm eating about 800-1000 less calories than I normally eat, and I feel better and actually feel more full!<br />This book is not only great if you want to loose weight, but also want to lower cholesterol, cut the fat, or just learn how to eat yummy healthful food.	2001-02-27

Some are controversial, such as sex, religion, politics, and  race.  Others are much more personal such as his views on Parenthood,  relationships, and friendships.  His points are very cleary made, and  whether you agree with them or not, his ideas are backed up by data and  common sense.  I would have given his book a  5, but the writing style took  a little getting used to and seemed a little too fragmented. Overall though  a good read.   Read this book!	2000-09-20
