Bob Herbert, the op-ed columnist for The New York Times, collects some of his columns that range from 1995 to 2004 within \\"Promises Betrayed.\\"  The journalist gives a voice to the voiceless black citizens railroaded in Tulia, Texas, the wounded soldiers from the current war in Iraq, and the struggling working class.  The writing is clear and often biting, especially when attacking the purveyors of injustice such as the racist cop in Tulia or some of President Bush's policies.  For example, Herbert quotes George Akerlof, a 2001 Nobel laureate in economics, in order to shed light on the current U.S. economy.  Akerlof says, \\"the Bush fiscal policy is the worst policy in the last 200 years.\\" <br /> <br /> An annoying fact among this collection is that Herbert repeats himself often within a batch of related columns.  For example, the same facts and tidbits are presented over and over again in the \\"Disgrace in Tulia\\" columns, which appear in sequential order, as originally published in newspaper print.   With that nuisance aside, \\"Promises Betrayed\\" is still a worthy piece of reportage that brings to light clear cases of injustice.  However, Herbert takes his reportage a step further and believes the cases presented are a reflection of an America decaying from within due to its eroding morals.  He says, \\"We've been attacked from without, but the greater danger to the essence of America is within.  There's a fire in the basement of the United States and we're behaving as if we cannot even smell the smoke.\\" <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot	2005-07-24

Khaled Hosseini's debut novel, \\"The Kite Runner,\\" is a compelling story told through the eyes of Amir, the son of Baba, a wealthy, charismatic Kabul businessman. Hosseini paints a vivid illustration of the boy's life from his 70s childhood in Afghanistan to his adult life in the San Francisco Bay area. Each chapter ends with a cliffhanger that teases the reader with enough tension to implore one to read on and answer the proverbial question, \\"What happens next?\\"    The running conflict throughout most of the novel is the gap between the aspiring writer, clumsy, prone-to-car-sickness Amir and his father Baba, who is a gregarious larger-than-life character in love with the game of soccer. If all these apparent differences were not enough, Amir's mother died during childbirth, thus an instant chasm had been formed between the father and son from the start. Also, in the mix are the Hazara servants of Baba, Ali and his son, Hassan, who seems to find more favor with Baba due to the boy's raw physicalness and quick intelligence. The jealousy experienced by Amir towards Hassan proves to be a conflict that does not resolve till the satisfying, box-office like conclusion of the novel (released as a movie on December 14, 2007 in the USA).    \\"The Kite Runner's\\" storyline is taut; there are no wasted sentences here, just a plain good old character-driven plot with worthy conflicts. Hosseini has managed to paint an intimate canvas chronicling one Afghani man's struggles and triumphs across several decades.    Bohdan Kot	2005-07-23

Be Careful with Those Scissors Augusten! <br /> <br />Leo Tolstoy's famous opening line in \\"Anna Karenina\\" states, \\"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\"  He could have been easily referring to Augusten Burroughs' unorthodox childhood, especially if we substitute the words happy and unhappy with sane and mad to be more accurate.  Burroughs' memoir, \\"Running with Scissors,\\" does not display an unhappy family as much as a completely bonkers one.  Although Burroughs mother does suffer from depression, she appears to enjoy being unstable and depressed.  <br />  <br />If this book were read as fiction one may be inclined to criticize the writer for hyperbole and quirkiness that seems more at home in a Cohen brothers movie script (\\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?,\\" \\"The Man Who Wasn't There\\").  But this is a memoir that captures the maelstrom of an inattentive mother, absentee father and the author's adoptive family (Dr. Finch, the mother's psychiatrist, takes charge of Augusten) in gut-wrenching funny tales that are tinged with sadness. <br /> <br />The chapter entitled, \\"Toilet Bowel Readings,\\" has Dr. Finch and his two daughters, Hope and Natalie, Agnes (an agoraphobic patient of the doctor who has been living upstairs at the doctor's house for two years) and Augusten crowd the bathroom to examine the doctor's bowel movement as if it were a piece of art on display in a museum.  Finch says, \\"The tip is pointing up.  Do you know what this means?\\"  After asking for a spatula (to retrieve and then dry out the specimen on the backyard's picnic table) and several ruminations, Dr. Finch says, \\"It means our financial situation is turning around, that's what it means.  It means things are looking up.  The shit is pointing out of the pot and up toward heaven, to God.\\" <br /> <br />Burroughs' tale is a cautionary one, reminding readers how children crave structure and discipline while barking for independence and less parental control.  Burroughs often laments about how he wished he had to answer to someone while growing up.  Dr. Finch insisted upon treating his children and Augusten like little adults.  One day out of boredom, Augusten and Natalie decide to put a skylight in the kitchen, but the project inevitably goes awry.  Dr. Finch just stumbles over the plaster and only says, \\"I think it's a spectacular mess.\\"  Not a surprising remark from a doctor who fed Augusten pills and liquor to purposely get him admitted to a psych ward so he would be able to miss the remainder of the school year. <br /> <br />\\"Running with Scissors\\" is a dark comedy that sears with honesty and will leave you in stitches.  No one escapes Burroughs' pointed observations; even the author's own character defects are mercilessly examined.  After reading this bizarre memoir, the humdrum existence of suburbia will look quite appealing. <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-22

William Styron, a Pulitzer-Prize winning author, gives a personal tour of his dark night of the soul. The writer suddenly found himself beset by depression during the fall of 1985 after coincidently being unable to drink alcohol due to its nauseous aftereffects. \\"Darkness Visible\\" is a memoir that lucidly tracks the descent, journey and healing of the pain \\"most closely connected to drowning or suffocation - but even these images are off the mark.\\" So Styron takes a stab at hitting the bull's-eye, and he does so with quick precision and an economy of words that poets will appreciate  <br /> <br />Styron does not lament or proselytize about his woes, but instead states the facts as if he was a reporter noting the vagaries of the illness. At one point he matter-of-factly explains how it becomes easy to contemplate suicide. \\"What I had begun to discover is that, mysteriously and in ways that are totally remote from normal experience, the gray drizzle of horrors induced by depression takes on the quality of physical pain. But it is not as immediately identifiable pain, like that of a broken limb. It may be more accurate to say that despair, owing to some evil trick played upon the sick brain by the inhabiting psyche, comes to resemble the diabolical discomfort of being imprisoned in a fiercely overheated room. And because no breeze stirs this caldron, because there is no escape from this smothering confinement, it is entirely natural that the victim begins to think ceaselessly of oblivion.\\"  <br /> <br />Styron's simple, compelling reminisce about a time that seemed forever dark, is told in a voice that screams with quietness from the cave of depression. \\"Visible Darkness\\" resembles a late-night confession by a stranger at a bar, imploring us to listen because Styron's telling is an unburdening and because gems of truth are laid out one by one.  <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot  <br /> <br />	2005-06-30

Dora, a half-sister, out of duty takes custody of the sisters and brings them to London, England post World War II. The majority of the scenes take place in England but New York City, Stockholm and flashbacks to Sydney also play prominently.  The novel spans several decades with numerous side stories and minor characters presented that seem to give no greater understanding of the main plot line, the love triangle of Caro.  Edmund Tice, an astronomer loves Caro, but she shuns Tice's affectations because she has eyes for Paul Ivory, a famous playwright who decides to marry Tertia Drage instead.  <br />  <br /> Darkness encases the novel from the beginning as Tice arrives amidst the beginning of a terrific downpour.  Hazzard casually gives away part of the ending on page twelve. \\"In fact Edmund Tice would take his own life before attaining the peak of his achievement.  But that would occur in a northern city, and not for many years.\\"   Then the author picks up the story as if she said nothing, leaving the reader hanging till the last page when all of the novel's points are quickly brought together for a climax that takes to long to reach and is unsatisfying. <br /> <br /> Hazzard's writing is often rich in detail and full of precise descriptions of place, but many pages are also filled with side-stories and numerous characters that are not given enough space to provide depth and a fuller meaning to the main plot.  Also, Hazzard's writing is generally baroque, pedantic at times, as if trying to use as many obscure words as possible.  The writing style distracts and sometimes becomes the showcase of the novel instead of the plot itself.  Nuggets of truth and beauty are scattered throughout the novel, but there are too few for the arduous journey of reading flat characters, clunky words, and dead-end side stories. <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot <br />	2005-05-13

The unnamed male narrator recalls memories from his early childhood and brings the reader up to date to his present status, a twenty-year old college dropout. He muses on his parents divorce, his father's inability to get his act together, sexual adventures and offbeat characters amidst the backdrop of the 1980s and 1990s.     The novel is heavy on dialog that hits the mark and flows easily among the sparse, but effective descriptive writing about characters' appearances or the narrator's internal thoughts. One is able to understand what it was like growing up during the Reagan and Clinton era within a broken nuclear family. Amsden writes of the personal, but the author never goes over the top with clich sentimentality or predictable passages. In fact, the narrator's recollections are often quirky and humorous, done in a style that begs to be read till the last page. The narrator recalls one of the many stories about his dad's inappropriate behavior. \\"Maybe I'm thirteen years old now and he's going off about Shirley, how she got this twenty-five grand inheritance, blew it all on cocaine. All of it gone in one weekend. And he was there. Dad tells me how crazy Shirley was. And since Dad never has any idea when to shut up, he tells me about her body, all of a sudden, how beautiful it was. He even tells me how beautiful her breasts were. Especially that one time when she got up on the table, that time she danced for everyone.\\"     Lastly, one negative is the novel seems to end abruptly as if the narrator is saying, \\"Well, that is enough stories about me, thank you and good night.\\" There are no concluding pithy insights offered, just a quick fade out.

Oh, the others came and went with their nurturing gestures and concerns, but it was the dog on whose ear I teethed and who watched me through countless hours with sagacity and bearing of a Ugandan tribal chief.\\"  Yes these recollections are often quirky, but also contain many laugh-out loud passages.  Kleinzahler describes his Mafia-dominated suburb as, \\"a theme park for Tourette's syndrome.\\" And with deadpan humor he complains about one Mafia neighbor, \\"It wasn't very considerate of him to kill our plumber, Mr. Ferri.  Reliable plumbers are hard to come by.\\"   <br /> <br />However, the essay about the myth of Eros seems out of place among this collection.   The scholarly take is often pedantic; the author cites classic love poems and knowledge as if to fulfill a page requirement for a class paper.  The reader is handed a bouquet of flowery facts that look nice, but add no real depth to understand the notion of Eros. <br /> <br />Kleinzahler's title piece, \\"Cutty, One Rock,\\" is easily his best work. The author recalls the double life of his older brother, a banker by day and gay hustler by night.  \\"He was born wild, born troubled.\\"  Humor and sadness commingle in a stellar, brutally honest essay.   <br /> <br />Overall, the memoir, \\"Cutty, One Rock,\\" will move the coldest of hearts as unconventional lives are examined with dignity. <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot <br />	2005-04-26

The notion of spirituality plays a vital role within the core of each story, although at times it is quite subtle.         An overt example of spirituality is the black-comedy set in early 1900s White Russia, \\"Jacob Bayer and the Telephone.\\"   Helprin examines man's loss of reverence towards God in the abundantly wealthy town of Koidanyev.  The author's sly humor in describing the literal larger-than-life character Jacob Bayer encourages a chuckle, \\"When Jacob Bayer walked into town, even horses turned their heads.\\"  Bayer's formidable task is to slay the town's new golden calf - the telephone - the source of the town's riches.  But the town remains obstinate and one villager states, \\"The telephone is superior to God because, unlike God, the telephone exists.\\"        The realistic conflicts portrayed usually overrun the upright, honorable main characters.  \\"Perfection\\" is notable because, unlike the other short stories, this one is imbued with light humor and a marked absence of death.  Fans of Mickey Mantle and baseball will particularly enjoy \\"Perfection.\\"  Roger, a skinny teenage Hasidic Jew, teaches the 1956 New York Yankees how to play winning baseball.

The feeling of perpetually riding up an escalator that never reaches the top haunts their soul, each woman begs for a break.  They all hunger for solitude: a precious commodity for these over-run lives.  The women dream, pine, scream for a life that is balanced - a husband who does his share, bosses who do not belittle them and a society that cherishes them for raising children.            The women push forward endlessly, but remain embedded in a quagmire they do not exactly love or hate, but mostly tolerate for now.  Many of the characters seem surprised by their circumstances and cannot remember the time before they were labeled wife, mother and worker simultaneously.  The self has been emptied via the energy drainers: husband, kids and the workplace.      Isolation resonates within each woman.  This is most poignant in the short story, \\"Caf Society.\\"  Two over-burdened women meet for a brief coffee afternoon break, but neither one is able to communicate the frustration or the ache each feel.  Simpson beautifully captures the formal outward exchange and the inward silent pain unable to be released.  The short story begins,     \\"Two shattered women and a bright-eyed child have just   sat down at the window table in the caf.  Both women  hope   to talk, for their minds to meet; at the same time they are aware the odds against this happening are about fifty to one.\\"     The reader will cheer for the women in \\"Caf Society\\" and all of Simpson's women characters as they struggle for an elusive freedom.  But no quick-fix solutions are presented.  Occasionally, the characters step forward a hair's breadth in their fight for inner-peace and balance.         In short, Simpson's writing resonates due to its honesty.  \\"Getting a Life\\" will warm you with biting humor and then chillingly expose the true face behind the masks of mother, wife, and worker.

The former child psychotherapist cogently dissects Houdini, \\"a man who was liberating himself only to be able to liberate himself again later.\\"   Phillips' probing of Houdini's background is a lively discourse and believable answer to what would provoke a man to continually perform ever-increasingly dangerous escapes.    The writing is full of pithy gems, such as: \\"What one is escaping from is inextricable from, if not defined by, what one is escaping to.\\" But the book also feels incomplete at 177 pages.   Just as the book warms up, the author suddenly fades away.  Ironically, the last essay is on the reclusive poet, Emily Dickinson.  Phillips begins, \\"When the poet Emily Dickinson died in 1886 at the age of fifty-five, most of her neighbors hadn't seen her for well over twenty years.\\"    Phillips examination of escape, except for Houdini's profile, is done in a hurried fashion. The author only gave a cursory look at the psychological stones unearthed within the three profiles of Dickinson, a young girl, and a grown man. Perhaps Phillips' main goal was to provoke questions, which he does often and well. Thankfully, he does avoid glib conclusions. But a deeper understanding may have been gleaned if Phillips kept examining the dark treasures uncovered in the psyche, instead of escaping from them.     Bohdan Kot	2005-04-21

Eliot's poem, \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\\" kept vying for attention.  Especially the line, \\"Do I dare to eat a peach?\\"  The main character, Julius Herz, 73 and retired is Prufrock, the man who decides to forgo the peach.  The novel's third person point of view narrative deftly portrays Herz, especially his plagued inner life.  But often the reader is also privy to Herz's mental state through inner dialog, the occasional conversation with other characters and letters Herz pens.     \\"Making Things Better\\" is one long lamentation and how things could have been better say this happened or this did not happen.  The pages are slow to turn at times since most of the action takes place within Herz's mental life.  His obsessions include a failed marriage with Josie, his declining health, an ill brother, Freddy, and Fanny Bauer, the woman he truly wanted to marry, but got away due to his timidness.  Brookner's authentic sentences capture the sadness of a man who realizes he did not truly live life, but skipped around its corners.     But wait, there is hope on the horizon, hence the title of the book, \\"Making Things Better,\\" a phrase often repeated by Herz.  He is seeking redemption; this is the impetus of the book that keeps one reading to see if he finally dares to eat a peach?      Bohdan Kot	2005-04-21

Men and women wonder how they got to the present place in their lives, and the reader is propelled to join their exploration.  The author's plot lines are intriguing and often electric.

Welcome to the world of Dogwalker, a collection of 12 short stories by Arthur Bradford, where digging beneath the underbelly of society is par for the course.  The characters seem to have left the set of a David Lynch movie, perhaps Lost Highway - one's not quite sure whether life is real or just a dream.     Yes, dogs play a major role in several of the stories in the small volume.  Besides the three-legged dog, there are mutant puppies, a refrigerated dead puppy and a breed of half-dog, half-human species.  The latter appears in the story, Dog.  The narrator begins, \\"No doubt you'll think I'm strange when I tell you I've been making love with my girlfriend's dog.\\"  Strange is an understatement as the story progresses into a science-fiction realm akin to H.G. Wells' novel, The Island of Dr. Moreau.     Disturbing as the thought of procreation via bestiality may be, it is the detachment of the protagonist in each story that will produce palpable shivers.  In the opening story, Catface, a blas attitude is apparent as the main character lists a montage of strange roommates he has shared a studio apartment with.  \\"He breathed very heavily through his nose and when he spoke the words came out in high-pitched squeaks.  Thurber moved quickly with jerks and twists like spasms and for a while I thought he was diseased.\\"  Thurber also had a strong dislike for houseplants (meaning he would toss them out the window upon first sight).     The stories are dark but there are enough peculiar laughs to keep the book from falling into pure drama.  The characters are fresh and imaginative; Bradford brings them fully alive through precise dialog.  You may want to peek ahead at times to satisfy your piqued curiosity.  The O. Henry Award winning author has written about the extremes of society with honesty and clarity.  However, there is no pity shown for the lives showcased, insteada notion of acceptance rings throughout the book.  This is most evident in the story, Bill McQuill.  Half a man would have succumbed to their fate with bitterness and anger (bad pun intended here, you'll have to read the story).     Dogwalker can be easily read within an afternoon as the author holds our interest in the motley bunch.  Be prepared to be saddened, cheered and lose your breath for a bit while reading this satisfying surreal book of short stories.    Bohdan Kot	2005-04-21

Bravo to the authors Richard Eyre and Nicholas Wright for bringing their insider know-how on to the page.  Eyre was the artistic director of the Royal National Theatre.  Wright was an associate director with the Royal National Theatre, as well as being an actor and playwright.     There are no wasted breaths here.  One cannot spare any as 100 years of theater are seamlessly encased in this volume.  The encyclopedic knowledge is enhanced with stunning and arresting black-and-white photos.  The subtitle, \\"A View of British and American Theatre in the Twentieth Century,\\" however is misleading.  The main focus is the British theatre.  Eyre and Wright examine the American (Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams), Irish (William Butler Yeats) and other nation's theatre only to illustrate the effects on Britain's theater community and vice versa.  Some exceptions are the Bavarian-born enigmatic Bertolt Brecht and Ireland's Oscar Wilde; both are given ample room due to their profound influence.  But British playwrights and their plays are the lion's share of the book.  British actors, such as Laurence Oliver and John Gielgud, are mentioned for their contributions to the \\"structural change to the theatre.\\"     \\"Changing Stages\\" is broken down into 14 topics, including: Shakespeare, Wilde and After.  A timeline is also furnished: a reference to grasp the past century of live performance in an easy manner.  The witty and lucid writing is irresistible.  Both novice and seasoned theatre lover will find this book a welcome addition to their library.  One can read straight through or pluck jewels via the topics or index guide.  Eyre and Wright are magicians for materializing a concise package of 20th century theatre within 400 pages.  A joyous read for any fan of this living art.    Bohdan Kot	2005-04-21

One will keenly feel the mental, physical and spiritual toll experienced by the medical students dissecting the cadaver.  The inclusion of the student's background and the life of the cadaver, known just as No. 3426 to the students, but reveled to be Tom Lewis, a devout Roman Catholic, is an effective addition to the book due to the humane tone gleaming off the page.       Giegerich's journey through the five areas of (GA), head and neck, thorax, abdomen, and upper and lower extremities is a fascinating and enthralling view of our complex body. For the most part, medical jargon does not overwhelm the text. Generally, there are no gratuitous scenes that aim to shock.  However, the faint of heart may want to skip certain sections, most notably a vividly described craniotomy.      In short, Giegerich succeeds in bringing the path of would-be doctors alive with detailed, honest writing.

Editor Jack Beatty's own essays and writers ranging from Charles Dickens to Paul Johnson to James Hedges vividly demonstrate the corporation's impact.  This collection of biographies, literature, historical documents, newspaper articles and so on are in roughly chronological order, with each prefaced by an incisive explanation by Beatty.     Beatty's through dissection begins with the Virginia Company of London (1606) - the first corporation.  He skillfully takes us to the 1700s as corporations begin to replace partnerships.  Betty's coverage of the years 1820 to 1860 - when corporations begin to flourish - is extremely informative, yet lacks the energy exhibited by the rest of the book.  By the late 1800s through the early 1900s, corporations begin to grow enormously in size and power.  Betty chronicles this period with great verve through his richly detailed selections.     Beatty resurrects the Great Depression quite effectively via John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, while his excerpt from Joseph Heller's Something Happened succinctly illustrates the paranoia of office politics during the era after World War II.  Another superb choice is Peter Drucker's short essay showcasing the hostile takeovers that were so prominent in the 1980s.   Also, Susan Faludi's Pulitzer-prize winning expose of the 1986 leveraged buyout of Safeway Stores is a beautifully written piece of reportage about the aftermath.     Corporations have committed their share of sins and embodied their portion of moral relativism.  Social responsibility is a pervasive theme in this book, beginning with Beatty's preface, which reminds us that intervention must come from stockholders, as well as the public at large.

Thankfully, Rita D. Jacobs' delightful, concise book, The Way In, provides the necessary oxygen for our deep journey to the bottomless pit of our self.     Part three, the essence of the book, enables the reader to plunge the self through journal writing.  Jacob gives simple yet effective advice, such as writing about one's self in the third person. Part one consists of journal excerpts and their different purposes. Anne Frank, hiding from the Nazis, uses the journal as a confidante. Part two represents the myriad of journals one can keep: travel, transition, crisis, love and the increasingly popular divorce chronicle.     The author's spirited writing will spark the journal writer within to seek the buried, dusty treaures lurking in the vast unmined soul. Jacob concludes, \\"There is an unending self within you to be fathomed, explored and revisited time and again in your journal.\\"  The Way In offers helpful common sense tidbits for your journal, whether it be confessional, travel or self-exploratory; I imagine good ol' Bill kept some kind of journal, and hey, look how well it worked out for him.

Eric Hansen's travel essays (written over twenty-plus years) are upbeat, serious, downright funny and just plain strange at times.  Hansen says, \\"The best way to penetrate a culture and mingle with the people was by getting involved with the local economy.\\"  He is the handy man for a rowdy hotel on an island off the coast of Australia; a volunteer at Mother Theresa's Home for Dying Destitute in Calcutta, India and a fish smuggler at the Republic of Maldives.         \\"The Bird Man And The Lap Dancer\\" not only takes you visually to places as diverse as Vanuatu and the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, but it also exposes readers to the area's daily life by meticulously dissecting the culture.        The book works due to Hansen's disarming personality and his insatiable curiosity. The author's saintly patience is tested often with comedic effect; the most hilarious moments take place in India.  Hansen is put through the ringer of the country's bureaucracy as he tries to ship crates back to the States.  The scenes are so ridiculously over-the-top with red tape procedures that even Franz Kafka's Mr. K (\\"The Castle\\") would have to pause and laugh.          In short, the concise essays pack in history, humor, memoir, and cultural observations without straining the reader, a pure delight page after page.    Bohdan Kot	2005-03-31

She buys seven books and quickly becomes enchanted with the bookseller Sultan Khan - a rare specimen where three-fourths of the population is illiterate.  She decides to invite herself and stay with the family during the following spring of 2002 \\"because it inspired me.\\"          The daily conditions Seierstad reports on are dismal, but the family members are the have-mores of Afghanistan.  Strikingly beautiful written sentences are seldom.  Generally, the author writes in a plain, matter-of-fact tone to showcase her observations.   For example, Seierstad's take on wearing the burka is a straightforward passage.  \\"How it pinches the head and causes headaches, how difficult it is to see anything through the grille. How enclosed it is, how all the time you have to be aware of where you are walking because you cannot see your feet, what a lot of dirt it picks up, how dirty it is, how much in the way.\\"        The saddest story is how the fledgling Leila, Sultan's daughter, is kept from blooming under the tyranny of a male-dominated society.  In fact, Leila is pale and ill due to her lack of Vitamin D caused by insufficient amounts of sunlight.  Seierstad states, \\"Kabul is one of the sunniest towns in the world. The sun shines nearly every day of the year, 6,000 feet above sea level.  The sun makes cracks in the earth, dries up what were once moist gardens, burns the children's skin.  But Leila never sees it.  It never reaches the first-floor flat in Mikroayon, nor behind her burka. Not a single curative ray gets past the grille.\\"        Since the text is simply written, it enables the reader to quickly follow the storyline.  But Seierstad's ability to be objective was heavily tested and the author herself admits to being upset by her surroundings.  She says, \\"We shared many good times, but I have rarely been as angry as I was withthe Khan family, and I have rarely quarreled as much as I did there.  Nor have I had the urge to hit anyone as much as I did there.  The same thing was continually provoking me: the manner in which men treated women.  The belief in male superiority was so ingrained that it was seldom questioned.\\"         The journalist's Westernized viewpoint and anger towards the Khan family men disabled her ability to see the male character's lives clearly.  Also, \\"The Bookseller of Kabul\\" is short on Afghanistan history, therefore the reader may come away with the feeling of being confused due to being ignorant of basic Afghanistan history.  Despite Seierstad's failings to unfold enough of the country's history for the reader's benefit or delve deeper into the psyche of Afghan men, the book is still  is a worthwhile read.  In the end, we come away satisfied because \\"The Bookseller of Kabul\\" envelopes us within the women's struggle and a culture the Western world seldom experiences within such intimate reportage.

Stiles' writings on American history have included articles in Smithsonian magazine, essays in the Los Angeles Times and the Denver Post.  Stiles' biography on Jesse James is presented in a clean, crisp style and one that is also well documented (100-plus pages of notes).    The writing in \\"Jesse James\\" is often very engaging and intimate as if conveying a fantastic bedtime story to a child.   However, one may easily forget at times the book is about James.   As much as this is a James biography it is equally (especially during the first 200 hundred pages) a history book on Missouri twenty years before the Civil War.   Yes, you need to write about the backdrop, the context from which a character like James emerges, but it appears to be overkill here.   I slept at times during the first half of the book as I was told ad nauseam the spirit of the times and James' personality fit together perfectly to produce a rebel who would not accept the Civil War's end.    History buffs that like to know every crevice of an era will appreciate the myriad of details that are informative, but for most the lack of any real new knowledge will produce boredom.      Around page 200 as the Civil War is ending, the text becomes infused with a lively energy as the main character James takes center stage for good.  James was known by many labels-hero, bandit, robin hood, rebel and so on.  Stiles boldly rips away the aforementioned masks and reveals a far more complex man-a political activist.  The author states, \\"The Civil War created the most politically active population in perhaps all of American history, and nowhere more than in badly divided Missouri.\\"  James' home was the border state of Missouri: a slave state that did not secede from the Union during the Civil War and a state where complete political power transferred to the North during Reconstruction.  Stiles precisely illustrates how James and various other Confederate guerrillas ignored the surrender at Appomattox and continued to fight in order to resurrect the Confederate Democrats' power.      As we learn more about James we also learn a dark part of American history.  Stiles states, \\"James's life illustrates how bitterly divided Americans have been in the course of their history.\\"  James refused to let the Radicals and Reconstruction keep control over Missouri.  His targets were for money, excitement, and fame, but also as the author conveys convincingly, the horrific violence was used to further a political agenda.  James was able to accomplish his political goals by masterfully manipulating the media during his outlaw days.       \\"Jesse James\\" is a thought-provoking look at the man and his times.   Redundancy does rear its ugly head at times during the first half of the book, but Stiles does shed light on Jesse James and an emotionally-charged period of American history.

Robert Morgan, author of the bestseller \\"Gap Creek,\\" transports us to a 1920s Appalachian Mountain town in \\"This Rock.\\"     The story takes place over a three-year period and focuses on the polar-opposite Powell brothers, Muir and Moody.  Muir is ambitious and quiet.  Moody is an appropriately named, unstable character that runs moonshine and gambles.       Morgan uses the perspective of Muir and Ginny Powell, the brothers' widowed mother, to narrate the brothers' conflicts.  Remarkable details are laid out for the reader to behold and enjoy like gems.  Morgan paints the beautiful landscape of the mountains, a feast for the mind's eye.  The drama echoes stronger due to Morgan's inclusion of mountain dialect.  It's as if the author time-traveled to the locale and used the Edison gramophone to record the hillbilly speech.       The story builds nicely as Muir's decision to build a church atop the mountain has ripple effects throughout the community, most notably his brother Moody.  \\"This Rock\\" is a page-turner illustrating the common and difficult aspects of 1920s Appalachia life. In fact, I bet after you've reached the last page, the cool morning dew will be lingering on your hands.    Bohdan Kot	2005-02-16

Jane Smiley collects forty-six of the essays and says, \\"Read it like eavesdropping or like twisting the knob on an old radio and tuning in stations from far and wide.\\"  These brief essays have a confessional feel to them, often declaring writing to be difficult, yet also a worthy task for the truly committed. <br /> <br />    Numerous passages detail the obstacles confronted when courting the muse and also offer advice on how to write well.  The most entertaining and direct approach stems from crime fiction writer Elmore Leonard and his ten rules to \\"remain invisible\\" when writing.  He sums them up with the maxim, \\"If it sounds like writing, I rewrite.\\"    There are numerous pitfalls that hamper the writing process - the most common is doing everything under the sun but write. <br /> <br />    Ann Patchett, author of the critically acclaimed novel \\"Bel Canto,\\" hilariously explains her battles with procrastination.  \\"I have already restored my oven to the level of showroom-floor cleanliness, written a small hill of thank-you notes (some of them completely indiscriminate: `Thank you for sending me the list of typographical errors you found in my last novel'), walked the dog to the point of the dog's collapse.  I've read most of the books I've been meaning to read since high school.\\"  <br /> <br />    What this collection does best is humanize our published idols; the most notable demystification being Arthur Miller's piece on relating his early years of being a struggling writer.  Miller may have written the classic play, \\"Death of a Salesman,\\" but how many knew his first play was a flop and he \\"resolved never to write another play.\\"   The honest feel coupled with an inviting tone make Miller's essay a standout.   <br /> <br />    However, the entire collection is compulsory reading for any aspiring writers.  The piece by Alan Cheuse is a godsend for any late-blooming writer or for those skeptical to pursue a dream as middle-age approaches.

Lucidly, he brings us coups d'etat, early independence days, wildlife, various cultures and the heat-\\"so intense that it causes minds to retreat into stupor.\\"     Kapuscinski succeeds in bringing us the authentic lives of ordinary Africans. He wanders with \\"passing trucks ... nomads through the desert ... peasants of the tropical savannah.\\"  This white man lives in the African neighborhood, not the exclusive safe places of wealth for tourists and the minority rich.  \\"I want to live in an African street, in an African building.

He immediately grabs one's attention through an entertaining, laid-back manner. His tone is friendly, but stern enough to be didactic and forceful enough to move the procrastinator or silence the internal editor of a struggling writer.     Catchy quotes from famous writers such as Anton Chekhov and other notables are strategically placed alongside the text, thereby strengthening Dufresne's current topic lesson on such points as character, conflict, plot, and dialog. The book's main foundation is common sense, direct directions and most importantly, the infectious tone of a caring mentor who helps you get excited about the writing process. \\"The Lie That Tells a Truth\\" may have no revolutionary passages about writing fiction, but it is honest enough to be on the same bookshelf as the recent how-to writing classics, \\"On Writing\\" by Stephen King and \\"Bird by Bird\\" by Anne Lamott.     In the end, the text reminds writers to not be so overly critical of their tepid writing or lack of masterpiece productions. For if Joseph Heller can say, \\"Every writer I know has trouble writing.\\" Then we all can breath a little easier and begin to pound the typewriter keys once again with a renewed vigor.

Raymond DePaulo Jr., M.D. is not only a psychiatrist, but also a psychiatry professor and the director of the Affective Mental Disorder Clinic at John Hopkins School of Medicine. Dr. DePaulo has written a cogent book at what it means to suffer from depression and its possible causes. The psychiatrist also covers various aspects of manic-depression, but the lion's share of the book covers the illness of depression. Despite numerous advances in medical science, we are still not clear on what causes depression. Dr. DePaulo states, \\"No one system, organ, or other factor is responsible for depression - not one steroid, not one gene, not one neurotransmitter, and not a lesion on one side of the brain or the other. What we seem to have is...a stew with lots of different and exotic ingredients.\\"    Where the book becomes shortsighted is within the sections dealing with the treatment of depression. The doctor advocates the use of traditional and cutting-edge medication as the cure for the vast majority of people throughout the book. It is not surprising that a psychiatrist does not go in depth concerning alternatives to drug therapies, but Dr. DePaulo covers only an astonishing 9 pages regarding alternative treatments such as exercise, nutrition, or talk therapy. In fact, large portions of the text read like a long pharmaceutical advertisement.    In the end, \\"Understanding Depression\\" is an invaluable guide to just that, understanding depression. However, the latter part of the subtitle, \\"What You Can Do About It,\\" is a biased view of a psychiatrist whose only remedy are pills despite this \\"cure\\" entailing ineffectiveness and serious side-effects for a significant portion of the recipients.

The novel centers on William T. Jones, a middle-aged dairy-office employee who has everything he wants: a loving wife and son, a good job and an old family farmhouse stocked with animals including his elder eccentric cat, Genghis. The novel's preface foreshadows the downward spiral of Jones' life by quoting from the Holy Bible's Job, \\"Oh that I were as in month's past, as in the days when God preserved me.\\" <br /> <br />    Alison McGhee's writing style is simple, yet effective; her writing enables the reader to live within Jones' thoughts and empathize with his psychological pain.  However, the novel roams in depressive terrain so often that you begin to ache for something uplifting to happen.  At one point Jones visits with his just separated wife and thinks, \\"Eliza. Come home. I'll keep the house warm for you. I'll stoke the woodstove as high as it'll go.\\"  But Jones says nothing to her; it is this helpless attitude that envelops the novel like a suffocating blanket.  McGhee does not accord the reader a breather and for this reason the novel becomes frustrating to read - the sad tempo is so over-the-top that one begins to feel numb like Jones. <br /> <br />    Page after page Jones is \\"dying from the inside out,\\" like the giant maple trees lining his driveway, as he focuses only on a warm and irretrievable past.  Before midway through the novel you may want to place a self-help book into Jones' hands or take him to the nearest therapy session because his coping skills are non-existent.  It is not until Jones winds up in the hospital that he begins to open his eyes and appreciate what he still has.  Redemption seems to flicker on the horizon towards the end of the novel for Jones, but for some readers it may be too late to save this novel. <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-29

Laura Jacobs, a first-time novelist, has written a powerful piece about a pair of women who are thirty-something and unmarried. The two principal characters within \\"Women About Town\\" are Iris Biddle and Lana Burton, New York City women who aspire towards a successful career and a loving marriage.     Biddle creates Iris Originals - one-of-a-kind lampshades - a craft that barely keeps her financially afloat. She is reluctantly single after her husband suddenly vanishes to Africa via a Peace Corps mission. Burton is an up-and-coming art critic who is dating Sam - a man who flinches at any notion that brings him closer to the \\"M\\" word.     The deftly written chapters on each character leaves us wanting more and asking the proverbial question, \\"What happens next?\\" Jacobs' novel is worthy due to its ear for dialog and its ability to capture the emotions within the women's dissatisfied lives. Biddle places a bird ornament upon the Christmas tree and laments, \\"I'm like you, stuck in old tinsel.\\"      Jacobs writes believably throughout the novel.  However, the climax proves to be too perfect as the character's loose ends are brought together rather quickly.  The ending is predictable as a box-office movie's last fifteen minutes and is not worthy for the literary writing present beforehand.     Bohdan Kot	2005-01-29

The editors, Sebastian Faulks, a journalist and author of Charlotte Gray, and Jorg Hensgen, have done an excellent job of picking a star-studded cast of writers to illuminate the topic of war-Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer, Kurt Vonnegut, and Joseph Heller are some of the forty writers.  But beware, reading this collection is more gloomy and full of despair than the depression wing of a Seattle psychiatric ward during its rainy season. <br /> <br /> Despite its title, The Vintage Book of War Fiction has numerous offerings from writers who have been on the frontlines.  Perusing the biographical selection one notices that some of the writing is not fiction but instead autobiographical.  Vonnegut wrote the classic novel Slaughterhouse-Five based on his experiences as a prisoner of war viewing the destruction of Dresden by the Allied forces.  <br /> <br /> The horrors, maladies, rapes, destruction, bizarre humor and so on of war are present here in vivid color. Hiroshima Joe by Martin Booth graphically transports us to Hiroshima right after the nuclear bomb dropped.  \\"On the floor of the tram cabin was a partly congealed liquid slush of greyish-brown matter in which lay some broken branches, stripped bare of their bark.  It was more than a minute before he realized that the floor-covering had been people, the branches nude bones.\\" <br /> <br /> These stories are compelling, but they are also repelling, grotesque.  But one continues reading; we are pushed forward by the same impulse that strains our neck to see a recent car accident.   Faulks says, \\"Has ever there been such century for killing as the one we have just endured?\\"   The collection is splendid because it illustrates the sheer carnage and the psychological bruises in an honest, thought-provoking manner.  JohnHorne Burns says, \\"Then humanity fell away from me like the rind of an orange, and I was something much more and much less than myself . . .\\"   <br /> <br />    Yes, you will feel the intensity of experiencing the war and its aftermath up-close as if watching an IMAX in one's mind thanks to the cornucopia of superb writers.  But the good listener will also digest the excerpts as a cautionary tale and fervently understand that man must be peaceful to continue and prosper in our present nuclear age.   <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot  <br /> <br />	2005-01-29

If you were one of those students who dreaded science in school, then Oliver Sacks' memoir, \\"Uncle Tungsten,\\" is still for you.  The subtitle, \\"Memories of a Chemical Boyhood,\\" brings us Sacks' boyhood obsession with the world of chemistry.  The distinguished neurologist brought us \\"Awakenings\\" (you may remember an extraordinary performance by Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams in the movie) and \\"The Island of the Colorblind.\\"      In his new effort the author nimbly tosses scientific jargon such as iridium, pitchblend, and valency that have right-brain users like me take deep breaths. At times one prays the sentences will become lucid soon. However, Sacks infectious voice carries one throughout the book. The author will have you getting excited about chemistry and its wonders.       Sacks genuine giddiness is palpable.  The book begins, \\"Many of my childhood memories are of metals: these seemed to exert a power on me from the start.\\"  Sacks befriended his Uncle Dave, better known as Uncle Tungsten, with a barrage of questions.  The uncle was well versed to tackle the youth's insatiable curiosity.  Sacks says, \\"We called him Uncle Tungsten for as long as I could remember, because he manufactured lightbulbs with filaments of fine tungsten wire.\\"     The book is chock-full of chemical experiments Sacks imitates.  While some boys may delight in the adventures of Superman or some other comic hero; Sacks recalls his passionate interest in the discoveries of scientists such as Dmitry Mendeleev, Madame Curie, and Humphry Davy.  Again, at times the chemistry jargon may put stress on the brain of a layman, but the read is worthwhile despite the minor headache here and there.     The reader is also exposed to what life was like for England during WWII. Sacks' tribulation in boarding school is an interesting read. The perspective is from a senior Sacks reflecting on the most difficult part of his formative years.  In short, Sacks' writing brilliantly showcases youth's exuberance, insights, and sadness...but most importantly, the precocious Sacks is a remainder of the beautiful reveries we have as children, and if we are fortunate, carry over into adulthood like Sacks and his scientific heroes have.

They are part of Clifford A. Pickover's subject material used to explore the paradoxes of God and the science of omniscience. Pickover, a professional puzzler and inventor, will bend your mind like a wet noodle, so please bring an open mind and more importantly, plenty of aspirin when reading \\"The Paradox of God and The Science of Omniscience.\\"                Pickover will convince you without a doubt about point A, but then be equally convincing with a contradicting point B. The book is bursting at the seam with paradoxes concerning God's nature. An interesting notion is that omniscience has its disadvantages. One example the author cogently dissects is a game of chicken with an omniscient being. If you enjoy ruminating on such notions, then this book will quickly enthrall and delight with the numerous permutations the author diverges on to grasp a fuller understanding of God. However, if the aforementioned leaves you in the doldrums, harking back to a time when you were forced to sit through the requisite Philosophy 101 college class, then this treatise will have you running for the hills.                The point of the author's writings is to challenge the definitions of God and the universe. The effect may be shattering as one's paradigm slowly shifts. Pickover seems to enjoy being the provocateur; his tone is gleeful at times. Pickover states, \\"The mere asking of these questions stretches our minds.\\" He leads discussions via the Socratic method, but definitive answers are lacking as questions quickly multiply. However, one absolute is this: a gem of a read for anyone vaguely interested in God.     Bohdan Kot	2005-01-29

He beautifully captures the moment of a place and its scene in a clear voice. In Amsterdam he's caught in a downpour after ingesting mushrooms and goes to a nearby caf to change. \\"In the cramped confines of the toilet I had trouble getting out of my wet trousers, which clung to my legs like a drowning man.\\"     Despite excessive self-absorption at times, the book still works on many different levels.

This fact is well known by anyone familiar with James' works, but what remains unclear is what happened during his convalescence.  \\"Twenty-one pages (as much as forty-two pages of writing)\\" were cut from James' diary that surely held some answers about his dark hour.  Thankfully we have Jon Boorstin who writes so well from James' point of view that we need to be reminded these writings are actually not James' confessions but historical fiction.  \\"The Newsboys' Lodging House\\" brilliantly extrapolates upon the missing pages to form a cohesive and believable account of what led James to become the renowned modern thinker and progenitor of Pragmatism and the Will to Believe.         The novel jumpstarts in 1908 Cambridge with a stranger imploring an attention-grabbing question, \\"Is you my father?\\"  That teaser grabs the reader's unequivocal attention as James elegantly recalls how one chance encounter at McLean Asylum in 1872 with Horatio Alger, a writer of boys' stories, inspires him to leave the asylum and research \\"the question of evil\\" among the poor newsboys of New York City.        Boorstin has magically crept into James' psyche and delights us page after page despite many somber expositions that detail James' anguish over evil's place in the world.  Reading in fact becomes compulsory as we eagerly await an answer to the stranger's aforementioned question. In the meantime, Boorstin expresses James' ideations in an entertaining manner and more succinctly than several philosophical tomes.    Bohdan Kot	2005-01-29

Alec Wilkinson brings a stimulating read with \\"Mr. Apology and other essays;\\" most of the essays were previously published in \\"The New Yorker.\\" The first part hosts a cast of eccentric characters that easily compete with Kramer's adventures on the TV show \\"Seinfeld.\\" Wilkinson is able to delve into the core of an individual within the space of twenty pages or less. In \\"Elmore's Legs\\" we meet Gregg Sutter, the legman for crime-writer Elmore Leonard - the person who does Leonard's research. Wilkinson also explores what makes hockey goalie Mike Richter, drag-strip champion racer John Force and others tick.    In the second part the laughs taper off as a tone of seriousness envelops his reflections about his son who has many of the characteristics of Asperger's syndrome. \\"The world with its lights and intensities bears down on them with terrific force.\\" He also warmly remembers his mentor, William Maxwell, an editor at \\"The New Yorker.\\" Although the subjects are obviously close to his heart, he does not stray into sentimentality and is objective so much so that it seems like he is interviewing himself.    Within the third part Wilkinson examines the rule of the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot as seen by two Cambodian women who are now mysteriously blind like numerous others from that tribulation period. The author effectively translates the daily horror and puts the reader in the women's vantage point. The text is difficult at certain moments to digest. But his essay on John Wayne Gacy, convicted of killing thirty-three boys, the most in America, is ultra creepy; some of these passages you might want to skip entirely. However, even if you have a weak stomach, the rest of the essays should be considered compulsory reading due to the author's ability to articulate clearly each person's reason for being.

The editor Block chose to explore the darker side of humanity, the mortal sin of lust, by handpicking short stories that generally lean towards the macabre with dashes of sex. The skillful writing leads the reader without effort to a world full of double agents and desire perverted. Clive Barker, Paul Bishop, and Ed Gorman, to name a few, are the writers that reward with numerous delicious twists and surprises.    In the first short story, \\"Crack,\\" by James Hall, a voyeur's obsession over a teenage girl possesses him to a frightful conclusion. The unnamed Fulbright fellow confesses, \\"In most matters I considered myself a scrupulously moral man. I had always been one who could be trusted with other people's money or their most damning secrets. But like so many of my fellow Puritans I long ago had discovered that when it came to certain libidinous temptations I was all too easily swept off my safe moorings into the raging currents of erotic gluttony.\\" \\"Crack\\" is a thorough psychological study of how an innocent beginning becomes pathological.    The characters throughout all of the pieces find themselves powerless to fight a desire that has progressed to a full-blown demon. \\"Speaking of Lust\\" is a testament to the power of persistent malcontent thoughts. Evil thoughts eventually have no joy staying inside the ravaged mind and long to be transformed into \\"unacceptable behavior\\" for release. The collection examines beautifully how sin does not happen out of the blue. The writers brilliantly illustrate that many bad decisions were made before the ultimate transgressions of murder, suicide, incest, and rape occurred. A showcase of lust gone awry, its inevitable tragic conclusions will leave you fulfilled: or perhaps wanting more.    Bohdan Kot	2005-01-28

Joyce Carol Oates is a prodigious talent, both in volume and quality.   One is in awe of the numerous titles from various genres - novel, poetry, play, essay and novella - for which she has published and received critical acclaim within the past forty years.  Who is more qualified than Oates to assemble \\"The Faith of a Writer,\\" a collection of essays written over a large span of years (many published earlier) that explore the craft of writing?  Oates says the collection is \\"meant to be undogmatic, provisional.\\"           This is not a how-to write book, but rather, a personal take how Oates and other writers like Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and several other notables approach the craft of writing.  The most interesting essay, \\"Notes on Failure,\\" examines the helpful role failure can play when striving for memorable writing.  Oates discusses James Joyce's difficulty in getting his first novel published before he wrote the classic \\"Ulysses.\\"  In response to the repeated rejections, \\"Joyce retreated, and allowed himself ten years to write a masterpiece.\\"          Oates also ponders topics such as inspiration, her early childhood influences, reading as a writer, and self-criticism.  Her tone throughout each short essay is crisp and direct, often compelling and endearing, like a schoolteacher who always demands the best.  Oates stresses that writing when done well, like any other artistic endeavor, is a craft.  She believes, \\"inspiration and energy and even genius are rarely enough to make `art': for prose fiction is also a craft, and craft must be learned.\\"        Oates' slender volume is a beautiful rumination and worthy addition to her large catalog of work.  She manages to pin down and examine the elusive nature of the muse.    Bohdan Kot	2005-01-28

The main character, Dr. Isaac Gantz, a musicologist, suspensefully narrates the discovery of the music of the Hebrew alphabet in the first novella, \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, The Original Music of the Hebrew Alphabet.\\"  While traveling in Communist Budapest, the fledgling Doctor feeling the pressure of the college's publish or perish paradigm needs something worthy for publication.  He meets Ferdinand Friedman, perhaps a madman, who holds the fabled Holy Grail of Jewish music history.       Leviant holds your attention without any apparent effort or unbelievable scenes to move the plot forward.  There is no hyperbole present here despite the novella's fantastic theme of sacred music that dates from the first man, Adam.  And the ending, although not tying loose ends, is satisfying.     Leviant's writing throughout is often poetic and bountiful with numerous crisp images and humor for such a slender book.  The second novella, \\"Weekend in Mustara,\\" begins \\"I found the craggy zigzag peaks, visible everywhere in the city, both awesome and disconcerting, a kind of pressure on the soul.\\"  The author is the protagonist as he searches the fictional island Mustara for the writings of 11th century Jewish poet Yehuda Halevi.  A fast-paced tempo quickly entraps the reader in Leviant's obsessive thoughts to procure any material on the poet.  He says, \\"My life's work.  For years I've been studying his songs and poetry.\\"  Of course the island and its cast of offbeat characters becomes an obstacle for Leviant's search.  Several plot twists keep the reader's attention, but the ending leaves one frustrated after the 80-page buildup.      Bohdan Kot	2005-01-28

The expose examines the paradox: \\"Schizophrenic outcomes in the United States and other developed countries today are much worse than in the poor countries of the world.\\"     Journalist Robert Whitaker, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, showcases the first hospital for the insane. In 1751 the Quakers began a moral treatment that included exercise, social activities and work. These methods had remarkable cure rates (unreachable with today's care). However, one can easily see there is no money to be made via the aforementioned interventions. Therefore, by mid-1800s, the medical field, fearful of losing power, began to become interested in using medical knowledge to treat the insane. Whitaker elucidates the shift of power from humane treatment to \\"enlightened\\" medical treatments such as insulin coma therapy, ECT, lobotomies and the present use of mind-numbing neuroleptics (originally used on prisoners to quiet them down) and other drug therapies that prove to be quite dangerous due to their serious side-effects. In short, the suffering of the mentally ill have been compounded as the current sadistic milieu uses them as a cash cow.     Whitaker's writing paints the horror all too well. One begins to wonder if the guilty psychiatrists, researchers and pharmaceutical companies ever look in the mirror. The evidence of their criminal relationship is laid out clearly by Whitaker. \\"Mad in America\\" is a testament that cries out for massive changes within the corrupted pharmaceutical field of treating the mentally-ill.

Their tough facades are exposed, and of course, the men are cowering like a small child - not a new notion, but it is explored with such prevailing sadness that you may want to offer consolation to the characters.     Cavell, an ex-boxer, does his best writing in one of the longest short stories, \\"Ropes.\\" Alex Folsom recalls his knockout, \\"Spotlights made the ring rise up in front of me like a blue island in a sea of black.\\" Stripped down sentences like this bring vividness and immediacy. Folsom continues on with unwavering honesty about his father, a troublesome love relationship, and life after boxing in a casual tone that is quite inviting. Fine details give shape to the story; this facet is often lacking in the other shorter stories, therefore consistent depth is missing.     \\"Rumble, young man, rumble\\" may demand attention with its quick starts, but the full throttle peters out towards the end within many of the shorter short stories. The climaxes often feel incomplete or just plain predictable.     Bohdan Kot	2005-01-28

At age ten Nathaniel Stone pictured the eastern United States as an island he could circumnavigate.  The author fulfills his childhood vision and chronicles the adventure with boyish enthusiasm in his first book, \\"On The Water.\\"  His seventeen-foot scull departs at the Brooklyn Bridge; Stone states, \\"I was a late bloomer when it came to anything adventurous.\\"  We sympathize as he quickly learns to deal with buoys, massive barges and numerous other obstacles encountered on the ten-month journey via rivers, lakes and canals to the town of Eastport, Maine.         Stone`s writing resonates the beauty of his surroundings; the writing engages the reader to the point of seemingly joining the author on the rowboat.  Misadventures occur often along the way; the most notable is Stone being \\"THROWN OUT\\" of a small village on the Ohio River.  The book reminds us how culturally diverse this country is - a glimpse into the towns that lie near the waterways.            Stone's innate desire to circle the eastern United States is a testament to follow one's dreams - a unique travelogue not in a rush to reach its destination.  Several black-and-white sketches by Elizabeth Stone and a map inside the covers is a nice visual touch.           Rowing backwards six thousand miles affords him long periods of solitude within nature.   Stone appreciates these solitary moments in the vein of Henry David Thoreau, the naturalist writer and author of \\"Walden Pond.\\"    \\"I sit up for another stroke, now looking down as the blades ignite swirling pairs of white constellations of phosphorescent plankton . . . `Remember this,' I think to myself.\\"    Bohdan Kot	2005-01-28

Well-crafted short stories - five never before published - a play and non-fiction writings by Heller comprise this posthumously published book thanks to the editing of Matthew J. Bruccoli of the University of South Carolina and Park Brucker. <br /> <br />    \\"Catch as Catch Can\\" is a delicious treat for \\"Catch-22\\" fans who desire more of Heller's black comedy since a third of the book concerns itself with the novel, \\"Catch-22.\\"  \\"Yossarian Survives,\\" a small chapter originally deleted from \\"Catch-22,\\" contains the irresistibly funny lines, \\"Don't just lie there while you're waiting for the ambulance.  Do push ups.\\"  <br />  <br />    But what really makes this collection interesting, especially for aspiring writers, is \\"observing Joseph Heller's apprenticeship.\\"  Heller's first published short story, \\"I Don't Love You Any More,\\" dates from 1945 and is about a military man returning from WWII who decides he is not in love with his wife anymore.  This short story and many other early ones lack Heller's satirical voice perfected in his novels.  There are hints of the biting humor, but the reader can clearly sense Heller is struggling for his own voice.  Heller in fact writes, \\"there wasn't much distinctive about all but two or three of the stories I was writing at this time.  I now wanted to be new . . . Original.\\"   Bruccoli and Brucker write, \\"Not until `MacAdam's Log' (`Gentlemen's Quarterly', 1959) did Heller break through the conventional magazine formula.\\"   \\"Catch as Catch Can\\" allows us to catch Heller's progression from stock short-story writer to literary genius. <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot <br /> <br />	2005-01-28

An unnamed writer, the narrator of the novel, begins the suspense with the clich, \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\"   Constance Rattigan, an aging former starlet, hastily gives the unnamed writer two books - a 1900 Los Angeles phone book and her old address book - both containing red-circled entries with crosses that suggest who will die next; Rattigan is one of the names circled.      Some of the names circled begin to die suddenly under suspect circumstances while Rattigan concurrently becomes difficult to find.  Is she the next victim or the murderer?  The unnamed writer becomes obsessed with procuring answers.  Entertaining sidekicks like Crumley, a lovable grouch, and Henry, a blind man that invariably sees more than everyone, accompanies the unnamed writer's search within fast-paced engaging dialog.    Brief chapters - many five pages or less - and simple word usage are effective throughout the novel.  The climax is unclear as many twists abound, a given in a Bradbury production - remember the fireman Guy Montag from \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" who starts fires?   Bradbury dazzles and boggles the mind till the final pages.     Bohdan Kot	2005-01-28

Karl Taro Greenfeld, now the editor of \\"Time\\" Asia, departed the USA in his early twenties for Asia to fulfill his writing dreams.  The excursion's motive became hazy as the \\"booms, busts, drugs, sex, violence, magic\\" of Asia overshadowed the craft of writing.  \\"Standard Deviations\\" is a chronicle of the author's descent into the mired lives of sex workers, crooked businessman and their pocket politicians, and the young foreign ravers who all have one thing in common - leeching the Asian \\"bubble\\" economy.     The inevitable crash of Greenfeld's life (he becomes a drug addict) and the insubstantial economy is a disturbing account of life being led without the forethought of any consequences.  Greenfeld is able to bring the reader close to the riots of Jakarta, a free-sex ashram in India, and the speed slums of Bangkok easily since he has ridden the Asian roller-coaster ride from the 90s to the end of the century.   \\"About me are flea-infested dogs and puddles of stagnant water several inches deep with garbage, and all around is the stench of smoldering trash.\\"    The book's greatest asset is the author's ability to be brutally honest with himself and the culture surrounding him.  The tempo is quick and unrelenting, think Hunter S. Thompson; at times it moves too fast as a different setting is suddenly on the page.   But the writing is beautifully lucid; the author brings the darker images of Asia alive in an unflinching manner.  \\"And I know a hit of the mad medicine is the easiest way to make it all seem bearable.  Taking a hit, I know, is a surefire way to feel good.  Right now.  And I want it.\\"    Lastly, the book also allows us to see redemption is possible from the lowest of points.

Stewart's characters appear to be tragically compulsive and unable to act in their own best interests, even when the choices are clear. For example, the unnamed female protagonist is unable to leave Louis, a married manic-depressive alcoholic, because she feels like it is \\"one big movie\\" and says, \\"I couldn't let go because the relationship had developed a life, a momentum of its own, which was quite separate from the individuals involved in it.\\"     Stewart's writing transmits a palpable sense of loss, depicting characters that cling to an unhappy fate out of fear and habit. The author's sentences are crisp and to the point as we watch the unnamed female protagonist meander from the beginning of her love life in the 1970s to the present.  Overall, a believable and even an enjoyable read, despite, actually, because the terrain of the unnamed female protagonist is awash with horrible decisions.  Reading this train wreck proves to be delicious fodder for any rubbernecker or unscrupulous talk-show host.    Bohdan Kot	2005-01-28

He expounds on China, India, and the Egyptians.  He tells \\"brave stories of noble women and great men.\\"  In a nutshell we are given the essence of Confucius, Buddha, Jesus, Shakespeare and numerous others who have been an integral part of civilization.

Direct advice such as \\"one thousand words a day five days a week for the rest of your life\\" jumpstart the book.  She also offers advice that may seem offbeat (e.g., write thank-you notes for every rejection received).  \\"In that first hour of rejection, when your liver is exploding and your spleen is on fire, you grope your way through the house to where you keep your `charming note' stationery . . .write him or her a charming note.\\"     \\"Making A Literary Life\\" delivers the facts of becoming a writer in a lucid manner, but also honestly and with quick wit.  Any romantic notions you may have about writing are stripped away.  See says, \\"Literary life is a marriage, not a romance.\\"  There are no shortcuts mentioned here; one must work diligently and persist.   This book lays the groundwork, but the author reminds that to build powerful words, sentences, and paragraphs is work-at times excruciating and joyless.      Besides meticulously covering the foundations of good writing-character, plot, point of view and so on-she also discusses the often-neglected time just before and after publication.  \\"After you write a book, you must sell it.  The three months before and after publication are just as important as the years you spend writing.\\"    \\"Making A Literary Life\\" is an inspiration for writers and anyone shy about following their passion.  \\"I was thirty-two, had two kids and my Ph.D., was coming up on my second divorce, and had already written my first unpublished novel before I got the beginning of a clue.\\"   See is a personal mentor proffering clues to facilitate a literary life; most importantly she empowers the writer to believe publication is plausible.

The hopeful destination (a 1,500 mile trek) is to arrive in the Hebrides (Scotland) on the first day of summer.     \\"Following the Sun\\" offers more than bicycle-travel stories. A history of sun worshipers through the ages such as the Aztecs, Incas and several other sun cultures are discussed.   A delightful and eccentric bunch of characters along Mitchell's route lighten the didactic tone of the book. A speaker from the Flat Earth Society preaches in a confident manner to an ever-growing hostile crowd in Hyde Park. An overly protective bed and breakfast manager repeatedly dissuades Mitchell from riding to Scotland. She shouts, \\"You'll die of exposure in the empty wind like a poor lamb. No one in their right mind ventures out to the Hebrides . . .

Kennedy, a prized Scottish fiction writer, brings us from across the pond, \\"Indelible Acts,\\" a short-story collection filled with satisfying tales - her first to be published in the States. The unnamed narrator in \\"Not Anything to Do with Love\\" summons up the theme of the slim book with her notion of an ex-boyfriend, \\"There would be tenderness, but the kind you only feel when there's a bruise.\\"    Kennedy explores what individuals will do when love is absent - adultery runs prominently as an inadequate fix. Thankfully, humor is sporadically present within the pages of heartache, thus keeping the pieces from becoming a veritable mine of depressive rants. Inner dialog also propels the stories with ease; it allows the reader to be aware of the painful disparity between outer and inner reality.    In \\"A Little like Light,\\" John Edward feels stuck in a dismal marriage and an unrewarding job as a school janitor. He thinks of himself as an actor playing out a role for both his family and work. The only moments of solace he has are his thoughts: \\"The best love is a little like light. It is unremitting, cannot fail to find you, to take the shortest, surest way, as if that were marked out as part of your nature, the line where you and love are made to meet.\\" The school's new teacher, Elizabeth Harrison, does find Edward, but he does nothing to pursue the new relationship despite his interest or take action to repair his failing marriage.    Edward, like Kennedy's other characters, is unable to make decisions that could improve life and love. However, hope for change does brim in \\"How to Find Your Way in Woods.\\" Sarah invites her ex-boyfriend David for a holiday trip, but regrets the invitation once he arrives.

Now that I've got your attention, Joann Ellison Rodgers, winner of the Lasker Award for medical journalism, has authored \\"Sex: A Natural History.\\"     The topic is stripped down.  The biology, genetics, psychology, and so on of sex are examined.  Why do men have a propensity for sleep after an orgasm?  Why is the brain the engine of sex?  How does smell play a part in a woman's choice of a mate?     Rodgers discusses numerous theories.   Scientific studies on animals, insects and humans are used frequently.  Careful attention and rereads are par for the course for the lay person.  Some of the text seems more at home in medical journals.   However, she sustains our attention with humor and an upbeat tone.       Getting to \\"yes\\" with the right people is an amazingly more subtle and complex process than one would imagine.  Rodgers carefully examines the many aspects that entail sex: attraction, flirtation, arousal, love, and fidelity.  The author's scientific treatise on sex is not dumbed down and still remains accessible.  At times, the countless studies of fruit flies, monkeys and other hapless creatures went overboard for my taste.  Nevertheless, the data presented confirms the notion that sex coevolved through cooperation, not conflict.     In conclusion, Rodgers successfully showcases sex and its evolutionary wonders.  But she admits, \\"No, we don't know (yet) exactly why sex evolved, or why there are thorns among the roses.\\"  Attempting to answer questions about the history of sex is akin to untying the Gordian knot.  Some questions may remain unanswered for awhile or perhaps forever.  Overall the romp through \\"Sex\\" was didactic and entertaining.     Bohdan Kot	2005-01-28

The historian offers numerous interesting insights that are gleaned from Gandhi's privileged childhood, barrister days, and early campaigns in South Africa. Wolpert dissection of various clues reveals how he became a living god. Hinduism, Christianity, and Buddhism were early influences that lead him to develop a philosophy of nonviolence.     Wolpert exposes inner conflicts that plagued Gandhi while he maintained the difficult road of \\"ahimsa\\" (nonviolent love). One such inner conflict was his battle with lust (a naked Gandhi slept besides his assistants). However, Gandhi's faith in \\"ahimsa\\" for India and the world proved to be stronger.     Fasting, imprisonment, boycotts were some of the peaceful weapons he imposed. Behind every action was a message of love and peace. Gandhi's vision to free India, banish untouchability, and make India viable rested on a crux notion: there is no gain through the horrors of modern war and power. The frail thin man warns, \\"Retaliation is no remedy.  It makes the original disease much worse.\\" Gandhi's legacy list luminaries such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Lech Walesa, Nelson Mandela, Dalai Lama and countless other leaders. Wolpert's biography is a page-turner that competes with the best of fiction. \\"Gandhi's Passion\\" will give the reader a crisp view of the complex man and his times.     Bohdan Kot	2005-01-28

Author Elisabeth Eaves in the prologue of \\"Bare\\" tells us she wants to understand her past experience as a peep-show dancer.  The event haunts her for answers about her motives and also larger issues such as the status of women's sexuality within society.  Eaves therefore quits her reporter position to return to the stage once again to achieve the aforementioned goal.  Besides drawing from her own experiences, she also intimately chronicles the lives of four other sex workers/friends.      As a memoir it works; Eaves writes with ease as if talking to an old friend over a long phone call.  However, the author comes up bare on any sociological depth.  Prurient interests will be satisfied; there are plenty of detailed scenes about the daily work life of affording men a sexual release.  But one is not closer to a lucid view on women's sexuality at the end of the book.  \\"Bare\\" would be an ideal reading assignment for an introductory women's studies course or a 101-sociology class.  Stereotypical notions about strippers-being stupid, abused or druggies-are shown to be inaccurate, the women showcased are far more complex, often having college degrees and considering themselves as \\"feminist strippers.\\"     Eaves' narration effectively portrays the ladies with a bitter-truth honesty and shows how they \\" . . . become subservient to cash.\\"  We helplessly watch the women's lives slowly over time become increasingly used more instead of using the profession to garner large amounts of money to pay for college, start a business, enjoy free time and so on.  Eaves states, \\"In the end I decided that all sexuality for profit was insidious.  Sooner or later, the effect of money would turn sex into something dishonest, and I didn't want that to happen to me.\\"  But for the majority of these women it is too late as their life is tainted with ruined relationships, broken family ties, and psychological damage.

The aphorism, the cure is worse than the disease, is an apropos motto for \\"Over Dose.\\"  Drug company policies rake in billions while harming the very patients they are meant to help.  Dr. Jay S. Cohen opens more cans of worms than a fisherman could hook in his lifetime.  The  evidence is horrifically overwhelming - America is being overmedicated.        Dr. Cohen is not anti-medication; he advocates the reasonable usage of these powerful meds.  His mantra is \\"start low, go slow.\\"   The well researched (53 pages of references) is adept at uncovering the shortcomings of the pharmaceutical companies and their adverse effects on the public - 46% of Americans take at least one prescription daily.  Cohen shows how the drug companies' one-size-fits-all dosage is literally killing people.  Nearly 300 people die daily due to a medication reaction.  The dire facts keep on coming.   The author's case against the drug companies is convincing.    Dr. Cohen's precise writing is somber.  But the real sad part of this tragedy is how avoidable it can be.   Dr. Cohen is equally effective in offering realistic solutions. He clearly states, \\"My goal in writing `Over Dose' is to provide you with informed consent about the unacceptable state of medication treatment today...to reduce your risks-and to begin to end the side-effect epidemic.\\"  \\"Over Dose\\" is a must have; the expose may alter you life for the better and perhaps even save it.

Reinaldo Arenas, author of the memoir, Before Night Falls, brings us an imaginative collection with Mona and Other Tales.  14 short stories and one essay comprise the posthumously published book.  Arenas, a self-imposed Cuban exile, fled for New York City in 1980.  Castro's iron fist fell harder on Arenas, a gay intellectual.  The author was a political prisoner in Cuba for much of the 60s and 70s for his writings and lifestyle.  His novel, Hallucinations, had to be smuggled out of Cuba.  The book propelled him into international fame, however the author died in 1990.     No one word or phrase can accurately describe Arenas' energy.  He weaves sentences succinctly and soon, a beautiful tapestry lies before one's eyes.  Like an acrobat who has perfected his or her art, there is no strain here.  Arenas' words flow across the page. His humor is quick and subtle.  Most interesting is the footnotes in the short story, \\"Mona\\"-both bizarre and hilarious.  In the first footnote, the author pokes fun at himself.  \\"Besides being frivolous, Arenas was a real ignoramus.\\"      \\"Mona\\" also verges into the fantasy genre.  The main character, Ramon Fernandez, seemingly attacks the Mona Lisa painting at the Metropolitan Museum.  I say seemingly because the strange story becomes stranger as it unfolds in a high-paced manner towards a surprising conclusion.     The short stories \\"Parade Begins\\" and \\"Traitor\\" bear out the raw, difficult life in Cuba.  One can feel the anguish of living in a non-tolerant Communist Cuba.       My personal favorite, \\"Halley's Comet,\\" follows the five Alba sisters in 1891 from their Andalusian home to a small town in Cuba.  A simple, pure joy is expressed in this amorous short story that was inspired from Federico Garcia Lorca's play, The House of Bernarda Alba.     Mona and Other Tales showcases Arenas' versatility.  We peer into the mind of a sleepless boy on Christmas Eve, delve into an essay on Latin-American literature, understand the psychological horror a Communist regime dispels, and so much more is offered-a cornucopia of thoughts and emotions.     Arenas will delight and horrify-an amazing collection of short stories that will jumble the brain with its originality.    Bohdan Kot	2005-01-28

Fuller, a professor of Religious Studies, says \\"The United States is arguably the most religious nation on earth.\\"  He offers a myriad of statistics to cement the aforementioned notion.  The meticulously researched book focuses on about 20% of the American population who are \\"Spiritual, but not Religious.\\"  Fuller states his purpose \\"is to explore the history and present status of unchurched religion in the United States.\\"     Fuller delves headlong into the Herculean task by elucidating the late 1600s and forward into the 21st century. Our modern times are exposed in the humorously titled chapter, \\"Barnes and Noble as Synagogue.\\"  An enormous amount of information is disseminated.  At times it feels like one is reading a textbook for a religion class.  However, a history of the seeker is clearly expounded.       William James (1842-1910), the \\"highbrow intellectual,\\" personifies the seeker.  He receives the most coverage, but Fuller covers numerous individuals and topics efficiently, e.g., mesmerism, Edgar Cayce, New Age movement and Swedenborgianism. Fuller explains why spiritualism is appealing to those who \\"decided that existing churches were both emotionally and intellectually stifling.\\"  This book is only a start for anyone who wants to truly understand the emerging complex group labeled, \\"Spiritual, but not Religious.\\"   Nonetheless, a thorough, historical overview of unchurched America is presented.

At first glance, \\"Colossus\\" appears to be answering one simple question, \\"Is America an empire?\\"  The answer that streams back is a resounding yes, however, the inherent problem is the negative connotations that the word \\"empire\\" brings up.   Empires have become synonymous with evil, therefore, nobody dares say the \\"e\\" word-America's own inhabitants and current president deny this label. <br /> <br />     Niall Ferguson, the economic historian, tracks the rise of the United States from its humble beginnings after the Revolutionary War and up to its present struggle in Iraq where America has been once again reluctant to take the role of \\"pax Americana.\\"  Ferguson argues that an American empire has the potential to do tremendous good with its bountiful resources.  Prime examples of an effective U.S. intervention are found in Germany and Japan after World War II.   The U.S. aid of money via the Marshall Plan, a prolonged manpower presence (10 years in West Germany and 7 years in Japan) and several other factors such as NATO helped prime the economic pump of these once devastated countries.  This is in sharp contrast to the failure that has been the norm for U.S. involvement in most countries that recently have included Liberia, Rwanda and Haiti.   The main reasons for those failures the author argues are \\"a fatal combination of inadequate resources for nonmilitary purposes and a truncated time horizon.\\"    <br /> <br />    On the surface \\"Colossus\\" is a persuasive history book that points to one inexorable conclusion:  the United States is an empire.   But the core of the text is a critique of U.S. foreign policy and a dissertation that encourages the United States to use it empire status to better the world and inevitably itself.  He states, \\"Toppling three tyrannies within four years is no mean achievement by the standards of any past global environment.  Since 1999 Slobodan Milosevic, the Taliban, and now Saddam Hussein all have been overthrown.\\"   The author then quickly points out details, at times excruciating to bear, that the aftermath is often a greater disaster story after an U.S. intervention.  Ferguson says, \\"The United States has invaded and occupied many countries over the past two centuries.  Yet in terms of their economic and political institutions relatively few of these have evolved into anything remotely resembling miniature Americas.\\" <br /> <br />    Ferguson observes three deficits that \\"explain why the U.S. has been a less effective empire than its British predecessor.  They are its economic deficit, its manpower deficit and-the most serious of the three-is attention deficit.\\"  The author's historic arguments are cogent for an \\"anti-imperial imperial\\" United States to rule with a benevolent hand for its own sake and the world's.  He invokes history lessons in order to steer the United States away from the disastrous paths taken in Haiti and Rwanda.  \\"It would be a tragedy if the same process were to repeat itself in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq.\\"    But a weak point is the author never allows for the opposing viewpoint that perhaps America and the world would be better off without our interference in the first place.  Just because the United States is the supreme power, that does not automatically mean it should flex its strength over less fortunate countries, appears to be a foreign concept to Ferguson. <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot <br /> <br />	2005-01-28

However, she has difficulty understanding irony, metaphors and the finer points of being a human; Pierce's jokes at the expense of her ignorance usually come off flat because the punch lines are often transparent.     Once the conflict begins- Phyllis leaves her maker to pursue acting in Hollywood movies- some interesting offbeat characters are introduced, like Eddie, the owner of a strip club. But Eddie and the rest of the oddballs Phyllis meets on the way to stardom are not given any considerable space to flourish, therefore the characters appear to be shallow.     Hoping the novel gets saved with pithy insights from Phyllis is never rewarded. Keen observations from Phyllis do surface at times, but generally her attempts to be philosophical are sophomoric. The concluding section is far-fetched, even after believing Phyllis has been able to pass as a realistic human being. Berger even writes in another artificial being that makes a brief appearance, which just adds to this surreal, but very improbable novel that tries too hard to sound realistic.

John Gimlette, a travel-magazine writer and lawyer from London, England, delivers a concise travel and history book about Paraguay. \\"At The Tomb of the Inflatable Pig\\" entices and delights by immersing the reader into Paraguay's history and culture from its days of the Conquistadors (1524) to its present time. Pulling you in like a good novelist and increasing your expectation for juicy stories, he says in the introduction, \\"Paraguay is not merely isolated, it is almost impenetrable. Small wonder that it has become a refuge to Nazis, cannibals, strange sixteenth-century Anabaptists, White Russians and fantastic creatures that ought long ago to have been extinct.\\"     The author's journey traverses the entire country; his account is broken into the three geographical areas of the quixotic country: Asuncion, Eastern Paraguay and The Chaco. Gimlette alternates with historic tales and personal travel asides through the use of vignettes. What could have easily been a dry, insufferable history read is instead a breezy, fun, and informative take on the country. Numerous photographs and illustrations supplement the text, but Gimlette's wordsmith magic is powerful enough to enliven even the dullest of imaginations. \\"At The Tomb of the Inflatable Pig\\" retells history that proves truth is stranger than fiction, for no Hollywood screenplay writer would even dare to pen some of these tales for the risk of being labeled hyperbolic.

Baker opens the novel with, \\"Last night my sleep was threatened by a toe-hole in my sock.\\"  The chapter goes on in clear, exacting details about his inane conflict and we see Emmett as ourselves struggling with a toe-hole in the sock and have to let out a little laugh.      Brief chapters, many only four to five pages long, comprise the novel that often reads like a long humorous soliloquy.  Baker's writing is so adept at showing Emmett's world that one will believe a photo album was placed in the reader's hands.  We journey through Emmett's entertaining eccentric thoughts on unplugging a bathtub, the mournful sound a train whistle makes, the grandfather who \\"believed that what the world needed, above all, was more autopsies\\" and so on.  However, an underlying pain underscoring the novel is most evident as Emmett casually describes several suicide fantasies.  He suddenly starts one chapter, \\"I am the only passenger on a roller coaster that is fitted out with a horizontal blade at the top of one of its turns.\\"   Despite a subdued melancholy presence, this novel, without being preachy, affirms life to be both meaningful and joyous by illuminating the ordinary to be something extraordinary.

The characters struggle to be happy, but the fog of a recent death or an approaching one, sometimes their own, proves to be an insurmountable obstacle.   The title short story has the teenage Helen taking care of her terminally ill mother, Lenore.  Helen learns of the aboriginal people called the Ainu and their sacred ritual:  they would capture a bear cub, nurse, raise and treat the bear wonderfully as a \\"honored guest\\" till the time calls for its sacrifice.  Helen summarizes the perspective of Williams' characters, \\"To live was like being an honored guest.\\"           Funerals, suicides, and illness dominate the stories while any happiness is approached with caution.  The storylines are bleak and despondent, but the downward spiral lives are beautifully illustrated thanks to Williams' sword-sharp details and touches of black comedy.  Helen relates a story about a classmate's failed suicide: \\"A girl had taken an overdose of Tylenol which of course did nothing at all, but word of it got out and when she came back to school her locker had been broken into and was full of Tylenol, just jammed with it.\\"         Williams' exploration of death will be uncomfortable for some readers.  However, what is most frustrating is that none of the characters seem equipped to handle life or death.  They act as helpless as the Ainu bear, the \\"honored guest.\\"     Bohdan Kot	2005-01-27

Graham Burnett, an assistant Princeton history professor, brings us a lively, honest look at the inner world of juries in the slim volume entitled, A Trial by Jury.  Burnett's writing style is casual and easily accessible in describing the jury he joyfully found himself leading.      The Manhattan murder trial has the defendant claiming self-defense.  The burden of proof lies on the state to prove Monte Milcray did not act in self-defense after stabbing Randolph Cuffee twenty-odd times.  Milcray's story about the hot August night changes several times.  Erroneous facts spring forth as key elements begin to slowly seep into the story: a rendezvous encounter with a transvestite via the dating phone service.  Unfortunately, the author decides to reveal the verdict in the opening pages of the book.  Burnett then back peddles to the beginning: a week of jury selection, two weeks of evidence and then the four days of closed deliberations.      Clearly those who need instant gratification will love the author's choice for the up-front verdict.  This reader would have preferred more tension in the vein of 12 Angry Men; the movie magnificently portrays the inherent conflict of twelve disparate people dissecting evidence to reach a conclusion.  That balled-up tense feeling one gets in the gut is sadly absent here since we know the outcome early on.     However, there are many keen insights and fine discussions about law and justice.  The juror Adelle says,      \\"I realized that what I keep wanting here is for us       to figure out some way to do justice, but I am       starting to realize that the law itself may be a       different thing.  What is my real responsibility?      The law?  Or the just thing?  I'm not sure what the      answer is?  We've been told that we have to uphold      the law.  But I don't understand what allegiance I      should have to the law itself.  Doesn't the whole      authority of the law rest on its claim to be our       system of justice?  So, if the law isn't just, how       can it have any force?\\"    Burnett effectively brings us the emotions felt within the sealed jury room. The writing is palpable and quickly sparks one's imagination. The reader is privileged to the endemic shortcomings of the court. A Trial by Jury enables you to be the proverbial fly on the wall, listening and watching twelve individuals from various backgrounds decide a man's fate.    Bohdan Kot	2005-01-27

Anita J. Prazmowska's attempt at encapsulating the country's history within two-hundred plus pages is a worthy, but an overambitious project.  The entire book is as dense as a gross anatomy textbook whose main objective is to instill information.      History to be understood needs to be spread out and have time to unwind its story.  Unfortunately, Prazmowska injects the reader with one historical fact after another, therefore Poland's stories are packed as tight as the proverbial sardines in the tin can - no room has been allotted for expository writing to explain the meaning behind Poland's historical events.  When the entire history of Poland's middle ages is contained in about thirty pages, one gets the feeling that some crucial information must have been left out.  To further bog down the reader, the author's sentences are generally on the long side, forcing one to ingest loads of facts, dates and historical figures without a breather.  For this reason, \\"A History of Poland\\" works well only as a reference book - a helpful index enables the reader to pinpoint the highlights of Polish history with ease.     Bohdan Kot	2005-01-27

The characters usually speak about their inner lives in a confessional-style prose. Often the protagonist will reminisce about a past that seemed so much better than it truly was.    The opening short story, \\"River of Toys,\\" encloses a revealing thought, \\"A neighborhood is whatever anyone wants to remember about it.\\" What makes the characters poignant is their self-knowledge of drowning in the mire of an average life they abhor. The notion is most striking in \\"Burt Osborne Rules the World.\\" The short story's title soon becomes apparently oxymoronic as the character of the title's name laments, \\"I could have done a better job of being Burt Osborne.\\" He peaks during sixth grade, the height of his unique individuality, and then dives headlong into mediocrity.    In short, Allen covers the terrain of an unfulfilled life like a consummate foreign correspondent. Memory turns out to be an ever-increasing bubble that holds characters within its isolated limited world of the past while pushing out the possibilities of living in the present and having any hope of a joyous future.

Dawkins' essays are often brilliantly interesting and a pleasure for those who thirst for a deeper understanding of science. However, it can be difficult at times to comprehend, especially for the non-scientist, when the text is heavily laden with scientific jargon.     The range of topics varies considerably - Africa, genes, evolution, trial by jury and a couple of eulogies. Dawkins' cornerstone aim of every essay is to reach truth; his love for the truth seeps through each page, therefore the collection is often an infectious read. However, the author's diatribe on religion quickly becomes counter-effective due to his angry tone and the empty reasoning offered for refusing to debate creationists.     Dawkins is most accessible and honest within a letter to his ten-year old daughter entitled, \\"Good and Bad Reasons for Believing.\\" It begins, \\"Have you ever wondered how we know the things that we know?\\" The next six pages are as good as an entire scientific textbook espousing the scientific method. The simple, yet effective word choices in the letter, if used more often throughout \\"A Devil's Chaplain\\" would of made the book a hit for the common reader and not just the scientific one.

The poet felt the interview was an art form, an opportunity to discuss and teach about writing, music, spirituality and whatever topic may surface. Although some celebrities may shun the interview, Ginsberg clearly held a passion for the medium which is quite palpable throughout this collection. In fact, Ginsberg does not flinch at any of the questions, but instead attacks them with fervor and honesty.     The editor, David Carter, includes several vigorous and worthy spars. A conservative William Buckley begets a heated discussion about America in 1968 concerning drugs, censorship and the Vietnam War. A stoic Christian confronts the Buddhist devotee with God's Word. Ginsberg patiently reaches for truth and understanding with compassion in every interview. He is generous with his thoughts but at times the interviews are long-winded. This is the inherent danger of being spontaneous, the cliche of beatniks being free-spirits who spout non-sequiturs off the top of their heads seems eerily true at times. However, the text is a lucid portal for the reader to glimpse the beatnik world through the eyes of one of its gods. Ginsberg's history is an indelible part of beatnik culture. William Blake, Walt Whitman, Jack Kerouac and numerous other notable influences are also discussed.     Bohdan Kot	2005-01-27
