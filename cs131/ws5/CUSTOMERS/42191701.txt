Most guides feature many colored plates and or photographs of the birds.  That is very useful if you are within a reasonable distance from the bird and the light is decent. <br /> <br />However, with birds of prey, you frequently see them from a considerable distance and from below.  Most of the time you only get a good idea of their shape and flight characteristics.  That is where this book comes in handy.  Featuring nothing but B&W drawings (David Sibley) and B&W photos, \\"Hawks in Flight\\" shows you the bird as you will likely see it - a shape consisting of just a few colors (white, grey, black, brown) featuring some defining marks. <br /> <br />The authors also do a great job of describing what are the defining marks of each species and also telling you how to make a determination between similar birds (featuring B&W photos next to each other). <br /> <br />Highly Recommended	2005-08-19

It seems like this would be a very good book for beginning birders to learn about raptors before reading something more substantial.  It offers very basic information (range, eating habits, simple ID characteristics) that you could get elsewhere but would not be able to absorb the information as well. <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.	2005-08-19

I disagree with that approach, not just because they are quite different in more ways than just storyline, but because \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was a good thriller with elements of history mixed in, but it is not even in the same league with this book.  <br /> <br />\\"The Historian\\" is an epic work of historical fiction that sweeps across Europe during the four decades between 1930 and the mid 1970s.  It just also happens to involve the Dracula myth and a good dose of suspense.  Now, some people may object to me calling this novel a work of historical fiction because it is mostly fiction and contains very few real characters.  That is true, but Kostova does such an amazing job of making the Dracula myths come alive that you can't help feeling that the legends and the story are real.  Her research is stunning in its attention to detail and the wide range of topics Kostova must've studied.  A previous reviewer slightly criticizes Kostova for spending too many pages describing the pilgrimage routes of monks hundreds of years ago.  While sections like that do slow down the pace of the novel somewhat, they don't distract from it.  The last book that I read that combines elements of history, suspense, and great characters as well as \\"The Historian\\" was \\"The Devil in the White City\\". <br /> <br />Highly recommended!	2005-06-14

A few are worth 5 stars, the rest 4 stars, but all of them have been consistently enjoyable.  Unfortunately, his new book is not consistently good. <br /> <br />I read somewhere in an interview that Palahniuk has originally planned this book as a novella and then would release the short stories separately.  While a book of just these short stories would have been worth 5 stars, the novella about the writer's retreat could have damaged his career.  I hate to say it, but it is just not very good, and not even close to what he can write. <br /> <br />The main story about the writers who go on the retreat is just not believable to me.  In a normal Palahniuk book you meet some really weird people who do some crazy stuff but it manages to barely stay within reality.  Not this book.  I just can't picture people hacking off body parts, ruining their food supply, eating each other, and intentionally sabotaging their escape just to be able to cash in on the book and movie royalties about their experiences when they finally \\"get\\" out.  It has some classic Palahniuk moments, but the plot is just too unreal.  Also, I never found myself caring even the slightest bit for any of the characters.  They could have all died or all lived and I would not have cared. <br /> <br />However, the book is not without merit.  The characters who attend this retreat write some stories and it is these short stories that are the shining light of this book and the reason that I rated it a 4 instead of a 3.  Almost all of them are good and some of them are just plain great.  The now infamous story \\"Guts\\" is included, along with others that are almost as nuts. <br /> <br />I find it hard to criticize an author whom I enjoy so much, but I know he has the talents (proven in the past) to write something much better.  The book is worth buying for the short stories (I am sure many people will also like the main story) though I can't help feeing that it could have been one of his best books if the main story had been more realistic.	2005-05-04

I don't think I could ever actually do it since I am quite attached to life in the modern world.  But still, I sometimes think that getting away from it all would be worth giving everything up. <br /> <br />Also, events over the past few years and the blurring of boundaries between religion and politics has lead me to do some reading on Christian writers who have a progressive (liberal) worldview. <br /> <br />Naturally, these two interests lead me right to Thomas Merton.  The Seven Story Mountain is the first book of his that I have read and it has inspired me to read much more of his writings.  I am not a very religious person and sometimes have a hard time not rolling my eyes at his professions of faith and statements.  However, I know that everything he writes comes straight from his heart and that gives an emotional edge that allows readers like me to absorb it instead of skimming over it. <br /> <br />Sometime in the next couple of years, after I have read some of Merton's other writings, I am going to reread this book and I think it will have a much more profound impact on me. <br /> <br />Highly Recommended	2005-04-27

I am not going to play spoiler so I will only say that this is not only a great book, but it is also very well written and reads just like a suspense/thriller -- could not put it down.  I am a big Star Wars fan but I have only read a few of the books that have been published (Zahn trilogy and Labyrinth of Evil).  I typically read books that are considered \\"literature\\" instead of \\"fition\\".  If it is up for an award or was in the NYT Book Review, it is on my list to read.    This book, however, has sparked my interest in future SW books and also rekindled an old interest in other Sci-Fi/Fantasy books.  Somehow I will find the time to read the 200+ books lying around my apartment.    P.S. - Matthew Stover came and signed books at my store and said that the book contains a fair amount of material that will *NOT* be in the movie and there will be stuff in the movie that is *NOT* in the book.

This increase in poverty led to more crime. Also, since so many people were broke or bankrupt due to banks taking their property, bank robbers were viewed as heroes to many. <br />  <br /> 2 - The FBI in 1932 was primarily an organization designed to find kidnappers. This all changed when, for the first time, an FBI agent was killed in the line of duty (Kansas City Massacre). From then on, the FBI, under Herbert Hoover, went about trying to make itself into a national police force. <br />  <br /> 3 - The large number of criminals operating at the same time made it appear as if America were experiencing a &quot;Crime Wave&quot;, when in fact it was just a short term by-product of the Depression. <br />  <br /> 4 - The FBI should've caught all of them numerous times but blew it because they were still trying to work out the kinks in their new role as a national police force. <br />  <br /> I don't want to give too much away, so I will simply say this: <br />  <br /> Even though the real stories of these criminals is less exciting than the myths about them, Burrough does a wonderful job of telling their stories, which are still more interesting and exciting than any fiction I have read in years. <br />  <br />  <br /> Highly Recommended!	2004-08-04

Democrats of the last few years have been silent, even though they are a majority. In violation of the old proverb \\"let sleeping dogs lie\\", Bush II and his far right policies have aroused us and we have begun fighting back.<br />Every chapter in this book attacks the policies of the last three presidents plus our current governor. To all you republicans reading this, his numero uno target happens to be Clinton. Imagine that, someone criticizing a member of his own political party. I think you republicans should try it once or twice.<br />In the chapter \\"Democrats, DOA,\\" Moore indicts the democratic party for its rightward drift. He even rattles off a list of offenses that sound like Bush II but are Clinton policies and directives.<br />In \\"Idiot Nation,\\" a chapter on the sad state of education and knowledge of foreign affairs in America, Moore takes on Bush's education policies and gives us a lesson in current heads of state around the globe.<br />The best chapter though has to be \\"We're Number One.\\" In it Moore challenges our perceptions about the world and he offers funny yet serious insightful commentary on international current affairs. It also contains a wonderful open letter to Arafat asking him to stop the violence and adopt the tactics of Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. and act nonviolently. He says that if Arafat and the militants will do this and Israel still keeps bombing and repressing them then the world will see the truth and the Palestinians will win. But if they keep bombing Israeli Jews, then (due to the understanding that Israel fears, rightfully so, that they are targets for elimination once again) he will have to stand with Israel.	2003-10-08

Wesley K. Clark lays out his thoughts on war, diplomacy and the current state of our country.  Although this book was written before he publicly announced his run for the Democratic nomination, it sounds like he has known for some time where his political affiliation lies.<br />The firs couple chapters discuss the war in Iraq and it's successes and failures.  Clark says that, while the military did their job very well, Bush and his administration failed when it came to planning for the post-war situation.  Clark also takes the Bush Admin to task for failing, or not trying hard enough, to get broad international support for the war.  While we could have easily won the war in Iraq by ourselves, Clark feels that the burdern of rebuilding Iraq is going to weigh on America for years to come.<br />The next couple chapters discuss Clark's thoughts on the direction of America's foreign policy.  He thinks we need to concentrate more on building alliances with countries, who will help in the war on terror.  According to Clark, the Bush Administrations war on terror will fail because they are targeting &quot;nation states&quot;.  This will fail because the terrorists will just keep moving and spreading around.  We need to develop and implement ways to end the recruitment of new terrorists while finding and capturing the current ones.<br />The last chapter covers the current direction of America's domestic condition.  Clark feels that the large Bush tax cuts were the wrong thing to do during a time of war and recession.  He also is disappointed with the current political climate in which Republicans attack anyone who dissents or disagrees with the &quot;war on terror&quot; (quotes are mine).  Clark's presidential campaign is calling for a &quot;New American Patriotism&quot; in which love of country and dissent are both welcomed.<br />Highly Recommended!	2003-10-08

Taking the reader on a voyage across the globe, David Quammen tries to distill the essence of man-eating predators down to something that people across the world can appreciate before it is too late.<br />Quammen focuses on four distinct predators: the asiatic lions of the Gir forest in India,  the crocodiles of the Arnhem Land Reserve in Northen Australia, the brown bears of the Carpathian Mountains of Romania, and the tigers of the Sikhote-Alin range in the Russian Far East.  It is the predators, people and their interactions that make up most of the book.  Sort of a travel narrative that focuses on the people and wildlife.  The rest of the book contains Quammen's ruminations on the predator in human culture and literature (Beowulf, Gilgamesh, the Bible, the Alien movies, etc...).<br />Throughout the book, the reader gets the feeling that things are not going well for the predators and Quammen focuses on that at the end of the book.  Predators are slowing going extinct, and due to their nature as &quot;keystone species&quot; (species whose small populations control the populations of other animals and fauna in their respective regions) could have an adverse effect on life across the world if they do disappear.<br />All around, this is a great book.<br />Highly Recommended!	2003-09-21

He was in the same unit that held many of the state legislator's sons.  There was no chance in hell that they were going to see action in Vietnam.  Plus, where did W go during those months that nobody can seem to remember seeing him on the base?<br />-He is more beholden to special interests and big corporations than I thought he was.  He placed former oil lobbyists on the Government commission that oversaw the oil business.<br />-His past business dealings -- anytime he got in financial trouble, someone was their to bail him out and save his reputation.<br />-His connections to the Religious Right -- I had deluded myself into thinking that Bush was only tolerant of them, but now I see that he is willing to use them, and them use him.

It would also have been nice if they would have actually tried to avoid war through diplomacy.<br />Maybe it never would have had to happen if we had known:<br />1 - Saddam had unacknowledged permission from the Reagan Administration to use the gas against Iran, because the U.S. viewed Iran as the bigger threat. We know he used it, and did not care or even reprimand him. We even continued to give him weapons and finacial aid for years afterward. In 1990, a senatorial delagation led by Bob Dole visited Saddam and basically told him to ignore and not to worry about the growing questions being raised by the U.S. media about Saddam and terror. Of course, once he invaded oil rich Kuwait, we finally turned against him.<br />2 - Iraq did not kick out the UNSCOM weapons inspectors in 1998.

Instead, he feels that the energy used to opposed the war should instead be used to support the people of Iraq and helping them spread liberal democracy across the Middle East.<br />I am no fan of the Bush administration, and I think its attempt at diplomacy was embarrassing and will have negative repercussions in the future.

Pi along with a large Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker (due to clerical errors) must develop a undrstanding with each other in order to survive.  Along the way they help each other survive (Pi provides the food, Richard Parker provides the companionship).<br />But it is the ending that makes this book.  Read it and you'll know what I mean.<br />Highly Recommended!	2002-07-28
US	42191701	R3LZA0X26PLQHW	038549081X	709722953	The Handmaid's Tale	Books	5	7	12	N	N	Belongs on your shelf next to "1984" and "A Brave New World"	If you really want to scare yourself, read this book along with \\"1984\\" and \\"A Brave New World\\" within a couple week period.  Doing this will scare you more than any horror movie or book ever will.  Why?  Because these three books were all written years ago (mid 1980's for this one) and they keep getting closer to becoming fact instead of fiction.<br />Maybe you see things with a different political slant than I do, but give this a read.<br />1) A Handmaids Tale - A fundamentalist religous group has taken control of the country and immediatelty imposes Biblical law.  Women are subject to control by man and those that can reproduce (the environment is so polluted that infertility is rampant) are kept as slaves for families that cannot have children.  --- More than any of the other two stories, this one has already come close to fact in many third world countries.  Most notably - the recently Taliban controlled Afghanistan.<br />2) 1984 - A world in which we are constantly at war.  An elite class of people rules and enjoys all the luxuries while the rest must try and get by every day.  Oh yeah, in order to maintain the safety of the empire/country everyone is under constant surveillance and can be arrested and imprisoned without trial. -- Sound slightly familiar?<br />3) A Brave New World - An elite class controls society and spends their time taking \\"Soma\\" a drug that relieves anxiety and allows them to live in complete peace and ignorance.  Instead of working, the elite class has devised a way to clone people to do the laborious work. --- \\"Soma\\" could be television of Prozac, while cloning is becoming more of a reality.<br />Read them. Then watch as they slowly come to life.	2002-07-28

Therefore, it focuses on only three aspects of barbed wire - The trenches of WWI, The concentration camps of the Nazis during WWII, and the use of barbed wire by American ranchers during the mid/late 1800's, ending the roaming ways of the Native Americans.<br />There is alot to say about the book, but the book says it best.  So I'll sum it up - barbed wire is one of the most overlooked inventions of death during the last 200 years.<br />Highly Recommended!	2002-07-28

I know \\"Twelve\\" may resemble may other books, most notably \\"Less Than Zero\\" and \\"Bright Lights Big City.\\"  <br />But does that really matter?  <br />No.  It is still a very good book with believable, if maybe a bit stereptypical (Hey, the kid is 18.  Everything was slightly stereotyped when I was that age.  You haven't had a chance to experience life yet.)<br />I won't rehash the plot, you can get it from the above editorial reviews, but I will say that the story is an interesting mix of teenage angst and a slice-of-life shot of the social activities of today's high school age youth.<br />Recommended	2002-07-23

I have read Kavalier & Clay twice and have read both his short story collections.  I also just finished his upcoming novel, \\"Summerland.\\"  Therefore, I was slightly disappointed when I finished TMOP.  Not that it wasn't good.  It is just that I have read his later works, which I can say have put him near the top of the current author crop, and TMOP shows Chabon's youth and inexperience.<br />While the characters are interesting and developed, they still carry many stereotypes.  I also found myself uninterested in the outcome of the book.  I didn't really care what happened to anyone.  This is not something that happens in his later books.<br />Anyway, it is a good book and I hope it will work itself into my personal favorites someday.  If not, at least one of his novels (Kavalier & Clay) will always be on my bookshelf.<br />Recommended	2002-07-15

Mr. Cordingly obviously knows his material and also knows the myths that have formed about pirates.  He easily renders those myths obsolete with this book while informing the reader about many other events and persons unknown to them.<br />The only problem I have with the book is that it is written in a very disjointed style.  The chapters, instead of being chronological or event/person based, cover each of the characterisics and/or myths of the pirates.  Therefore, the reader comes across the same story/person/event multiple times.  It also, unfortunately, creates a reading environment that is difficult to get deeply involved in, causing the reader to miss some important information.<br />Very informative, but could have been organized better.	2002-07-15

What a movie it would be.<br />I don't want to give away the story at all, but \\"Chemical Pink\\" is one deeply disturbing trip through the world of professional female body building.  Drugs, sex, and more drugs.  <br />It is written in a very engaging, moving style that keeps you going - sort of like reading a thriller.  Which was strange, considering the storyline.

I've quit thirty of them, been fired from nine, and as for the other three the line was a little blurry.\\"  <br />He labels himself a modern day Tom Joad.  The only difference?  Tom Joad didn't blow $40,000 on a English degree.<br />Throughout the book, Levinson describes his experiences at some of these jobs and introduces us to some of his former co-workers.  Although the stories should not be funny, you cannot help but laugh at Levinson's self-deprecating humor.  You also cannot avoid getting angry at the treatment of the workers who are underpaid and overworked.<br />There is a wonderful irony to this book.  Levinson claims that his English degree was usless and that is why he had to suffer these jobs.  Now, because of talents he probably honed in English class, he was able to write a great book.<br />Highly Recommended	2002-05-30

I grew up along the Missouri river in central North Dakota. All my life I heard about Lewis and Clark's amazing expedition to the Pacific. I've visited The Mandan villages and fished on Lake Sacagawea.<br />Some have called this book a biography of Meriwether Lewis while others say that it is a history book. I say that it is the best of both.<br />...As a biography of Lewis, it is well balanced, portraying Lewis as a brave and intelligent commander (he was the ranking officer, but he treated Clark as an equal). It also portrays Lewis as a depressed man who frequently lashed out in anger and frustration, putting the mission and his men in jeopardy. It also does not try and cover-up his tragic last years and his suicide.<br />...As a piece of narrative history, it is a riveting account of the expedition and a stunning look at America before cities and the destruction of it's forests and wildlife.  Based on the journals or Lewis & Clark, Jefferson, and others.<br />Highly Recommended!!	2002-05-30

He gives them a name and rough personality, but then the situation shapes them (like real life,) unlike many writers who have a character in mind and have to create a story around them, therefore making a choppy, unrealistic read.<br />The book also ends different than I thought it would when I was half way through.

I heard about this book from a little article in some book magazine.  The author was supposed to be an amazing new talent who had just received a large advance for this book.  I tend to doubt such reviews because frankly that's what is said about all new writers these days.<br />After one page, I knew that I was reading something that would be unlike anything I'd ever read previously.  Jonathan Safran Foer (also the name of a character in the book) has written a spellbinding account of one man's search for his Grandfather's hometown and the family that may have saved him from the Nazi's.  <br />I use the word spellbinding, not so much relating to the storyline (which is good,) but to the writing and language used.  One of the main characters, Alex (Jonathan's guide and amateur writer), has a very poor grasp of English and tends to use large, unwieldy words while speaking and writing.  This is one of the major highlights in this book, for Mr. Foer is able to use Alex's speech problems as humor.<br />The book can be a bit difficult to follow at times as it changes narrator and time (it also tells the story of Jonathan's Grandfather chronologically every other chapter or so) but is well worth it.  As my title says, the more I think about the book the better it gets.<br />Highly Recommended	2002-05-05

After finishing &quot;Founding Brothers,&quot; I now have a good idea of what to expect and which characters will interest me the most (Jefferson, Adams, and Thomas Paine, whom the author seems to rather dislike.)<br />This is not an in-depth study of the founding brothers.  You would need to read multiple volumes of biographies, letters, and historical works to fully understand them.  Instead, it is a collection of vignettes that are able to convey the founders personalities and ideologies to the reader.<br />Focusing on the six events, Ellis is able to show us the men behind the story.  These seven men, Adams, Jefferson, Washington, Franklin, Hamilton, Madison, and Burr, were responsible for the shaping of our country more than any other man or woman.  Ellis also explains the reasons for the event and its future implications on the fledgling nation.<br />Highly Recommended	2002-05-05

Never one to pass on a book just because the storyline or plot seem dull, I gave it a shot.<br />As you see from my reviews title, I am glad that I gave it a shot.  Atwood is able to take the story of an elderly woman reflecting on her life and turn it into a riveting story featuring suicide, adultery, labor strife, and blackmail all in story that unexpectedly turns on itself in the end and surprises you with an ending so good and planned that you realize that it was all there in the book while you read it.  <br />...<br />Highly Recommended	2002-05-05

Packed with pictures and stories	I've been hooked ever since my dad told me stories about Mantle and Maris.  I quickly latched on to Don Mattingly and I've never stopped loving this team.<br />This book is packed with photos and stories covering the entire history of the Yankees.

Famous sportswriters, television personalities, and famous fans pick their personal all-time Yankee teams.

Zinn once again captures that feeling with the newest book from the Open Media publishing movement.<br />&quot;Terrorism and War&quot; is a collection of interviews (both Zinn and Chomsky are at their best when speaking, as their writing is too scholarly.)  Throughout, Zinn speaks about our need and Constitutionally protected right to dissent, or more specifically, our right to oppose war.<br />Packed with news accounts and historical facts (10% of the book is notes and index), Zinn systematically proves that the war on terrorism, as currently being waged, is not a just response and will only make things worse in the future.  He is not opposed to a response, even a violent one, but he feels that the bombing of Afghanistan and the targeting of Iraq are unjust and incredibly harmful to us.<br />Read this book, then debate the war with someone you know who either supports it or is unsure.  There is a very large group of people who, if given a dose of truth, will start seeing both sides of the story.  Save yourself the time and ignore the ones who actively support the war, they will just call you un-American and nothing you say will change their closed hawkish minds.<br />Highly recommended - Discuss this book!!	2002-04-03

Well, since it is fiction, I guess they are not actually his words, but Peter Carey writes with such heartbreak and desire to live free, that you feel like you are reading Kelly's words.<br />This is the story of Ned Kelly, the Australian bushranger (thief) who evaded the authorities for two years, during which he nearly sparked a revolt against the British Crown.  Life was never pleasant for Ned Kelly.  Constant problems with the law, mostly because he was of Irish descent, and extreme poverty led his mother to &quot;sell&quot; him to the famous outlaw Harry Power.  It was his time with Power that Ned Kelly learned how to evade the authorities.  Other events force Ned to leave is life behind and become an outlaw.  Following a shootout with some constables who were searching for him, Ned becomes the most wanted man in Australia and so begins the two year manhunt for the Kelly Gang (Ned, his brother Dan, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart.)  During this two year span, Ned's life inspires the poor farmers to defy the government and help Ned hide.<br />With the book's &quot;authentic&quot; prose style, fascinating characters, and a plot based on love and loyalty, &quot;True History of the Kelly Gang&quot; is one of the best books of the past decade.	2002-03-25

He explains why he became a Reaganite, even after attending and graduating from Berkeley.  Brock explains that during a speech by Jeane Kirkpatrick, the Berkeley crowd booed her until she left in disgust.  This event turned Brock sharply to the right and he began seeking out conservative professors and writing a conservative columns for the campus paper.<br />He moves to Washington and after a couple stints with conservative media, he lands a job with the \\"American Spectator,\\" where he met and started hobnobbing with a young conservative crowd.  While at the Spectator, Brock made a name (and good money) for himself with articles and books about Anita Hill and Troopergate.<br />But, according to Brock, things were not as they seemed.  He was wary of his sources and constantly needed/wanted second opinions before he would publish something.  Nobody ever asked him to document or corroborate his sources.  For his article on Anita Hill, Brock admits he used information from sources that he never met or talked to, he just did what his bosses wanted him to.  He was a hit man.<br />Brock's life was miserable.  As a closeted homosexual, he was unable to enjoy a social life and maintain his career.  Brock chose his career.  Day in and day out, he was surrounded by people who were commonly racist and homophobic.<br />The beginning of the end occurred when, scared of being outed, Brock outs himself.  At first things seem fine.  His conservative 'friends' pretend to accept and defend him.  Following the publication of \\"The Seduction of Hillary Rodham\\" the unthinkable, at least in Brock's mind, occurs.  His conservative friends were anxiously anticipating an attack book that would help destroy Hillary's image.  Instead,they got a fair, balanced book that actually seemed to pity Mrs. Clinton for the mess she was in.  <br />Brock's friends disappeared overnight.<br />Now it's their turn to see what it is like to be on the receiving end of one of his character assassinations.<br />Highly recommended	2002-03-07

This book is the result of those years and it is one of the most entertaining and informative books I've read in years.<br />The subject of the first chapter is Omar Bakri Mohammed, the so-called leader or Islamic Fundamentalists in Britain.  After reading the chapter though, you get the feeling that Omar is all talk.  He uses Jon for rides and makes him pay for things because he is broke and does not own a car.  Conversations between Jon and Omar also prove that Omar isn't nearly as bad as he wants to be.<br />Later chapters cover Ruby Ridge, the David Koresh incident in Waco, David Icke vs. the ADL and people who believe that a small group of men rule the world (Bilderberg Group.)  <br />Through every chapter, Jon manages to fit in and is able to interview his subjects in a very relaxed manner, thereby allowing them to speak freely with him.  <br />-- The Klu Klux Klan leader who won't allow his Klansmen to use the \\"N\\" word.  <br />-- David Icke, who believes that we are descendents of 12 foot tall aliens who now control us through select leaders.<br />-- A writer for a conspiracy magazine who thinks everyone is following them or hiding something from them.<br />-- Rachel Weaver, daughter of Randy Weaver (Ruby Ridge), who in great detail tells Jon the story from her point of view.  (A sad story, no matter what side you may take)<br />There are so chapters that don't quite fit in with the rest, but they are interesting anyway.  In between laughs, you'll be discover that most extremists are not that different from me or you, they just took it further.	2002-02-26

By transcribing the debates with Gore you are able to see how sly and slippery Bush can be when cornered. Read silently to yourself, Bush's words are mixed up and honestly sound like incoherent gibberish. But read aloud they actually seem to make sense and flow together into meaningful thoughts (Ah! The joy of TV). <br />\\"If you don't tand for anything, you don't stand for anything.  If you don't stand for something, you don't stand for anything.\\" - Austin American-Statesmen, November 2, 2000<br />\\"Dick Cheney and I do not want this nation to be in a recession.  We want anybody who can work to be able to find work.\\" - 60 minutes II, CBS, December 5, 2000<br />\\"It is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil.  More and more of our imports come from overseas.\\" - Beaverton, Oregon, September 25, 2000; Slate<br />Actually those still make no sense at all, but for a culture used to \\"sound bite\\" news casts and possessing the inability to follow verbal discourse, Bush is the right man. Like his father before him (No New Taxes/A New World Order) the facade will soon wear off and the people will see that they have been fooled...	2002-02-20

Books	5	529	619	N	N	Stand up and fight for America and I will stand up with you	Michael Moore has an uncanny knack for speaking up just when he is needed most.<br />Over the past year or so, I've read quite a few books about the stolen election, lack of media freedom, foreign relations, and plenty of books that have some liberal agenda to them (environment / bio-food / political repression of dissent).  After reading all those books, I've sort of developed a defeatist attitude.  Positive, progressive change looked so distant and remote that I only seemed to want to know more, but not do anything about it.<br />....<br />Many conservatives feel that liberals are weak and don't like to fight.  These conservatives have obviously never been to a Michael Moore reading or a Ralph Nader rally.  Democrats of the last few years have been silent, even though they are a majority.  In violation of the old proverb \\"let sleeping dogs lie\\", Bush II and his far right policies have aroused us and we have begun fighting back.<br />Every chapter in this book attacks the policies of the last three presidents plus our current governor.  To all you republicans reading this, his numero uno target happens to be Clinton.  Imagine that, someone criticizing a member of his own political party.  I think you republicans should try it once or twice.<br />In the chapter \\"Democrats, DOA,\\" Moore indicts the democratic party for its rightward drift.  He even rattles off a list of offenses that sound like Bush II but are Clinton policies and directives.<br />In \\"Idiot Nation,\\" a chapter on the sad state of education and knowledge of foreign affairs in America, Moore takes on Bush's education policies and gives us a lesson in current heads of state around the globe.<br />The best chapter though has to be \\"We're Number One.\\"  In it Moore challenges our perceptions about the world and he offers funny yet serious insightful commentary on international current affairs.  It also contains a wonderful open letter to Arafat asking him to stop the violence and adopt the tactics of Gandhior Martin Luther King Jr. and act nonviolently.  He says that if Arafat and the militants will do this and Israel still keeps bombing and repressing them then the world will see the truth and the Palestinians will win.  But if they keep bombing Israeli Jews, then (due to the understanding that Israel fears, rightfully so, that they are targets for elimination once again) he will have to stand with Israel.<br />I look forward to the book tour, it should be interesting.	2002-02-19

You've been duped!	Oh boy, where do I start.<br />Many years ago, when I was a mindless drone in the corporate world I developed a small love affair for a fat, boisterous man who had a TV show.  I thought we was so on target and full of information that I listened to every word and couldn't wait to use something from him the next chance I was in an arguement.<br />After awhile though, I began to feel uncomfortable with all of Rush's quick edits and the video clips ending right before I thought that the &quot;commie-lib&quot; was going to say something else.  I even took it upon myself to read the articles that Rush was refering to and watch the news more often hoping to hear the full version of what was said.<br />Needless to say, that made all the difference in the world.  I realized within a month or two that my chubby friend was a liar and propagandist of such magnitude that I was honestly overcome with shame and anger towards myself for falling for it.<br />I am not going to give examples from the book because you have better things to do right now (hint: buy the book.)  Suffice to say that Mr. Limbaugh's love of distorting (ie: only letting the listener/viewer hear what he wants them to) and lack of fact checking have caught up to him.<br />Bye Rush, it's been a bittersweet ride but I'm not sad to see you go.	2002-02-16

We need you more than ever before!<br />I've never read anything by Alice Walker before and I was mildly surprised at how much I like her.  What do you know, it does pay to expand your mind and read something unknown.<br />Although the book is incredibly small (the price is great though)  Walker, in a speech on September 22nd to the Midwives Alliance of North America, is able to articulate her beliefs and give her take on the ways that we as a human race can deal with tragedy and violence in the world today.<br />I was slightly confused by some of the sections (maybe just not focused or maybe needs a second reading) but I feel that I was able to receive her message more or less.  She feels that people don't feel connected or welcome in society and are unable to give voice to their concerns or anger in a acceptable manner.  She also believes that a major source of violence today is caused by people who feel unloved.  Therefore, the best way to fight anger or violence is with love.<br />I personally feel that this may be to simple of an answer, but I would like it to be the correct one.  The world would be a better place if everyone shared some of Walker's beliefs.<br />I would like to give it five stars, but like I stated earlier, I found it confusing at times and difficult to fully comprehend.  Like a great poem, maybe it will take on more significance with further readings.	2002-02-16

With all due respect to David McCullough's \\"John Adams\\" and Robert A. Caro's impressive Lyndon Johnson volumes, this is the best presidential biography ever written.<br />Starting with Theodore's birth and ending with the death of President McKinley, thereby making Vice-President Roosevelt the youngest (still) President ever, this book covers every aspect of Roosevelt's life and his ascent in politics .<br />We see him change his mind over and over in college about what career he will pursue.  We witness him attempting to win over the heart of Alice and later her death while in labor on the same day as his mother's death from cancer.  <br />We follow his rapid political career.  First as state assembly man, then as federal Civil Service Commissioner, then New York City Police Commissioner.  Also well documented and are his years as Governor of New York, Assistant Secretary of the Navy (his passion) and finally his short stint as Vice-President.<br />More than anything else, we see Theodore Roosevelt the human.  His personal triumphs and defeats.  His loves (hunting, reading, writing and reforming) and his dislikes (corruption, ignorant people who have more power than him).  We also see him at his happiest and his darkest days.<br />As a former resident of North Dakota, I always heard about Theodore Roosevelt while growing up.  After reading this first part of the planned trilogy, I feel like a close personal acquaintance.  I almost feel like a friend.	2002-02-15

After reading a few of the small bios in it about activists such as Bill Moyers, Noam Chomsky, and bell hooks to name a few, I bought it.<br />The best thing about the book is not the bios of the famous.  It is the moving and inspiring stories of the unknowns.  The activists who have worked tirelessly for years and decades to fix some injustice that they will receive very little praise for.<br />It made me realize (I guess I had known, but needed verification) that one person can make a  REAL difference and after reading this book, I won't stand idle while a problem openly exists.	2002-02-15

Notice it doesn't say anything about staying silent and never openly showing dissent towards your government.  That's because our country was founded on the belief that we have the freedom of expression along with other freedoms...<br />Anyway, for those who actually want to READ the book, here are some of my thoughts on it.<br />Michael Moore, for those unfamiliar, is a one of todays most outspoken mainstream progressives.  A die-hard supporter of Nader and the Green party, Moore is most well known for TV Nation and the indie movie \\"Roger and Me.\\"  <br />In \\"Downsize This,\\" Moore takes on the both Democrats and Republicans in hilarious essays that will make you laugh while you growing angry.  He also takes on that bane of Democracy: Large, rich corporations.  <br />The best essay in the book is \\"Would Pat Buchanan Take a Check From Satan?\\"  In it, Moore takes an old political trick from Buchanan's days with Nixon and uses it against Mr. Buchanan.  According to Moore, Buchanan cashed checks from \\"The John Wayne Gacy Fan Club,\\" (famous serial killer) and \\"Abortionists for Buchanan.\\"  Pat still hasn't cashed the Satan one yet.<br />Look for Moore's new book - \\"Stupid White Men....\\"  It was nearly banned and destroyed because he dared criticize the President.	2002-02-14

In this book, Stephen Byler's debut novel, we are introduced to Wilson Hues, a rather average modern man.  Through the 11 short stories told in this novel, we are witness to some of the more profound and some of the more touching events in the fictional life of Wilson Hues.  Wilson is your everyday male trying to fit into a world that attempts to force the sexes into certain roles.  He hangs out with an acquaintence who turns out to be a much more aggressive and unbalanced man than originally thought.  He has problems fitting in with his college tennis team because he won't join in their macho woman bashing.  When he attempts to avoid telling his girlfriend about his past, it comes out later to cause even more pain.  Simply put, Wilson has nothing but poor luck.  In the end (as a reviewer put it) you want to give him a hug and tell him everything will be just fine.	2002-01-10

(with one exception)<br />The tale takes place on Nollop, a made-up atoll.  Nollop happens to be named that way because the atoll was founded by a man named Nollop, the man who thought up the sentence &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot;  As the tale goes on, added elements of the alphabet fall off of the statue of Nollop.  As each element of the alphabet falls off the statue, the heads of Nollop state that those elements of the alphabet cannot be used/spoken.  As you can guess, bad events take place. <br />Okay, I give up.  That's too hard.  But it is exactly what Mr. Dunn does throughout the entire book to wonderful effect.  As the book nears the end, almost all the letters have fallen off and the remaining islanders (most have fled) must devise a panagram (sentence using all 26 letters) in less letters than Mr. Nollop used in his.  <br />This book is great for people who love words and letters.  It is also an interesting study of oppression.	2001-12-21

I am glad that I read it though because I now know exactly what conservatives see as liberal bias in the media. Mr. Goldberg's statement that most \\"media elites\\" don't even realize that their beliefs manifest themselves is probably very true. So is the statement that most \\"media elites\\" vote Democrat. These are not problem though. Most news stories are so harmless and focus on such \\"entertaining stories\\" that their bias cannot show itself. The big problem is the fact that the news is no longer newsworthy and won't cover a story if it won't interest the majority of viewers or may offend an advertiser. Will NBC ever run a story about General Electric? Will ABC ever run a negative story about Disney or the Anaheim Angels baseball team? The answer is NO! <br />Mr. Goldberg sounds like he realizes this but decided to write instead about Dan Rather and company and their liberal bias. I applaud Mr. Goldberg's courage (I hope I would have the guts to speak out against friends to hold my beliefs) but I think that he fell into the trap, writing his book with the hopes of selling copies and not fully exposing the flaws with today's corporate media.	2001-12-17

Ever since Jonathan Franzen spoke out against his book being chosen as an Oprah Book Club Selection, his rating has dropped at an unbelievable rate. Wonder why??? I have been around and read many books in my life and I am 100% serious when I say that you can without a doubt ignore any review below two stars, because it probably came from an angry Oprah fan. This book is incredible!!! It has wonderful writing, the most in-depth characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about, very witty sarcasm, and incredible references to some very obscure but profound events in history. I apologize to anyone offended, but I think that this book was a bad selection for Oprah's club, because it is well beyond what her average viewer wants or understands. It deserved the National Book Award and should go down as one of the best books of the last ten years.	2001-11-15

The characters in Dogwalker are some of the best and oddest I've ever encountered.  They make you laugh out loud and would probably make you cry if they were not so damned emotionless.  It is the lack of emotion in the characters of Dogwalker that allow Bradford to write in his simple, unassuming, mutant-dogs-are-an-everyday-occurence style.  For those who have been dissapointed with Bradford's simple prose, I think that it is the perfect style for his stories and characters.  Beautiful prose and long flowing sentences would have buried the unique characters that he invented.  Bradford is friends with and received glowing back-cover blurbs from Dave Eggers, David Sedaris, Zadie Smith, David Foster Wallace and Matthew Klam.  For an added treat, check out Bradford's website...and listen to him perform \\"Rosalyn's Dog\\" or see him at a live reading.	2001-10-16
