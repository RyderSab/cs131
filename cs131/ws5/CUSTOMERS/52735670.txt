US	52735670	R3I4F11RWFRZM	1893660028	383774479	Doc Holliday's Woman	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Watershed Western	I was impressed most by how this story shows that history can be made fascinating by the dramatic genius of a novelist, without taking liberty with the facts, while blowing life into long gone actors and creating full sensory appreciation of their time and place. Author Jane Candia Coleman, has been recognized for her special touch in this respect, with three Heritage Awards from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame (more than any other woman has received) two Spur Awards from Western Writers of America and five Pulitzer nominations, to say nothing of numerous grants for research. Her twenty-two books all disprove the knee jerk presumption that academics are dull writers, since she is a mentor in the MFA in writing program of Carlow University at Pittsburgh, where she co-founded the Women's Writing Program and initiated a unique program called Madwomen in the Attic.<br /><br /> Here novelist Coleman has brought to truly magnificent fruition the earlier work of research that finally revealed to the public the true identity of Doc Holliday's Woman, familiarly known either as Big Nose Kate or Katie Elder. The facts derived from that research not only included Kate's own thumbnail biography, but her letters and recollections of family and friends who knew her.<br /><br /> In 1976, a noted Earp writer and researcher turned his sleuthing genius to Big Nose Kate. His discoveries up till that time and in fact until this day have made available to the public most of the new information uncovered since 1965 about Wyatt Earp and his coterie of associates. Most notably this was the source of all that was new and authentic in the two most recent Earp movies. His trailing of Big Nose Kate started when a college history student asked him if he knew more about Kate than had been published up till that time. Which is to say more than the highly speculative pictures drawn by several pseudo-biographies of Doc Holliday, which contained little about Doc, but a lot about his era. In fact one of them, unaware of even Kate's real name, nonetheless confidently dashed off a few pages of psycho-biography of Kate as an ignorant, bonbon eating strumpet of the variety portrayed in movies by a varied cast of female stars, including Linda Darnell, Jo van Fleet, Faye Dunaway, and Isabella Rosellini with Italian accent intact - bless Hollywood for sterling work here in  repairing America's notorious, lamented but uncorrected deficiency in historical knowledge. Pray they don't turn to mathematics in similar sturdy resolve, or future generations will puzzle over the sum of two and two.<br /><br /> The above researcher stuck his neck out and told the curious college student he might show her something they didn't teach in academic history courses. Here serendipity rushed to his rescue and he was actually able to do that. He fortuitously encountered a lead to Dr. Albert William Bork, who as a graduate student at the University of Arizona had attempted Kate's life story due to her request through a mutual friend. She was at that time spending her sunset years in the Arizona Pioneer's Home, where she died in 1940 as Mary Katherine Cummings, and lies at rest today in their cemetery. Other writers had approached her, and as Kate told Bill Bork, \\"They don't pay so I don't talk.\\" One of them resentfully cooked up the story that never dies about how Kate was fatally shot in Bisbee, Arizona's Brewery Gulch The bullet entered in an unusual physical locale that rendered the location of the wound hard to find. In this vicious canard, the bullet hole is finally located through an examination by Doc Holliday (now a surgeon instead of a dentist). Aside from this lesson in forensic medicine, there was no \\"fundamental\\" connection to reality in the fabrication. This was about par for the course regarding what was known about Kate. Wyatt Earp, who knew her, and most likely had done his own youthful examination of her physique, went to the grave mum on the subject. He also didn't know her real name. One wonders if Doc did. If so he never said. In fact he said nothing about her in print.<br /><br /> As a result of finding Dr. Bork, a mutual effort resulted in telling the world for the first time the true identity of Big Nose Kate. The news broke in an article in \\"Arizona and the West,\\" the Quarterly of the University of Arizona.<br /><br /> Among the more startling revelations - and it is dramatically told in this book - was that Kate, far from being a frontier floozy, had been born into minor Hungarian nobility in the city of Budapest. Moreover, her father had been a physician to Maximilian, and accompanied him on his ill-fated attempt to become Emperor of Mexico. His name was Michael Horony, and he exercised greater discretion than Maximilian and fled Mexico before the collapse of the condemned expedition from which the French army withdrew support. (The close of the American Civil War freed troops to overawe the chicken French Emperor, Napoleon III, and cause him to drop his meddling project in Mexico.)<br /><br />Michael Horony settled among the numerous Hungarian refuges in the city of Davenport, Iowa. He and his wife died within a year, leaving Kate, age sixteen, and her four siblings as orphans, and county wards. Kate fled her foster home, where her foster father apparently was attempting to examine her physique in a manner that disgusted her. She decamped on a Mississippi River steamer, and disappeared from the pages of history as Mary Katherine Horony, to reappear as Big Nose Kate, feisty consort of Doc Holliday.<br /><br /> If the reader thinks he or she knows exactly, or even approximately, what happened after that they are apt to be much mistaken. This book tells the story as historical fiction that is close to biography and it is indeed a fascinating drama. Of course some of it is speculative, which is a matter accepted artistic license. But not to worry - we may look forward to Hollywood uncovering, as a public service, whatever errors appear. I hope they spell her name right. If this author and the aforementioned researcher, on whose findings much of this book is based, make as much `moola' on a `moom-picher' as he did from the recent two Earp movies (that appropriated his research through piratical surrogates), they won't be able to buy a sack of potato chips with their take.<br /><br /> I note only one disappointed reviewer here, \\"coming to foretell\\" the necessary book \\"that finally tells the full story.\\"  Due to my own experiences I conjecture that another aspiring psycho-biographer whose \\"crystal ball\\" fantasies were pre-empted by the earlier appearance of this book, will grant an awe-stricken world with that \\"full story.\\" As is usually the case in these epiphany-books, I predict that Coleman will one day be asked by a puzzled friend if she rewrote this book under a pseudonym and offer to loan her money if she's that badly in need of it.t know her real name.

US	52735670	R2AOJNRF3YDRHH	0060761288	877820062	100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (And Al Franken Is #37)	Books	5	6	15	N	N	Sunlight Treatment for a Lovely Crew of 100	Author, Bernard Goldberg, has the distinction of having been fired for suggesting that CBS, where he'd been employed for years, ought to get a little balance in its news programs. Before he was shelved, he caused Dan Rather to get \\"viscerally angry\\" in the same phone conversation in which Dan earlier had said, \\"I was your friend yesterday, I am you friend today, and I will be you friend tomorrow.\\" Well, it's tomorrow and I expect Dan isn't his friend. The situation that got Goldberg relieved led to his writing his absolutely `fracturing' book Bias, in which he reports the foregoing conversation with Rather.    The issue on which I judge this book as well as Bias is that the only game in town is survival and its principal facilitator is information. Correct information. (Rather learned that too late and didn't survive.) The main pollution of information that Goldberg deplores appears in the liberal print media and TV reporting. As he says in his Introduction: \\"And it won't take you long to notice that there are a lot of liberals on the list, which, of course, is just how it ought to be. If I were compiling the list years ago, say when I was in college, there'd be a lot of conservatives on it. But this isn't years ago, and besides, I'm smarter now than I was back then . . . I understand that Al Franken (shortly to be worked over) and Michael Moore may not agree with this analysis, but one can only hope that over time they will grow and begin to see the light.\\" (Don't hold your breath Bernard; if you could expose a jerk to himself it wouldn't be necessary.)    My own view is that if they change it will be due to growth, not Goldberg's theme or anyone else's but I have little hope for it even in the first case.    And what is Goldberg's theme? He starts with an incident in which he and an airliner full of people suffered through a man yelling into his cell phone loud enough for everyone on the plane to hear when he tells whoever he's yelling at: \\"It's all f**cked up!\\" Goldberg comments, \\" . . . I find myself remembering that there was a time in America when not even a drunk in a bar would say the word f**k out loud. Today Chevy Chase calls the president of the United States a \\"dumb f**k . . . in front of a packed house in Kennedy Center . . . \\" [My judgment is that Chevy did his best work in The Three Amigos when his aim fetched the Invisible Swordman; he should stick to that caliber of target.]    Goldberg continues, \\"Yes, we've come a long ways from the old days when `Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,' [in Gone With The Wind] caused a ruckus. But that, of course, was a different time, and a different America, long before genuine crass vulgarity, polluted not only our relatively private lives, but out public, civic lives. And you know what? It's an America that, in all kinds of ways, a lot of us miss.\\"    I think one of the ways is the knowledge that back then people could walk our streets day or night without fear - even women - or especially women. Most men were not like the supine cravens that were scared to even call the police to prevent Kitty Genovese from being stabbed to death. For another thing it was a world of good manners, where even the poorest strove to be ladies and gentlemen, and tried to teach their kids the importance of growing up to emulate their example. Those were, of course, also \\"the bad old days,\\" as Goldberg admits, but the aim of the majority was always to make America truly into \\"the Land of the Free - from sea to shining sea\\" in fact, rather than only in patriotic songs. And we've made a lot of progress, and are still working on it. We acquired a lot of heavy unnecessary baggage enroute, such as bad manners, permissiveness to the point of self-destruction, and forgetfulness that \\"the land of the free\\" is the shield that must be preserved at all costs, the umbrella under which we strive to improve.    Goldberg's list of 100 represent the kind, for the most part, who have made it closer to \\"The Land of the Spree and Home of Deprave - a title I keep trying to find the time to add a book to. Remember you read it here first in case someone cops my title and turns out the book. More power to them if they do it right, such as to point out that $100,000.00 Executive Exercise Centers and $24,000.00 cook stoves are not exactly necessary, and like that, and also face up to the fact the we now need Frontier Marshals in our schools.    The people on Goldberg's list are threatening our survival by advocating that we bury our heads in the sand and hope tomorrow never comes, usually for selfish reasons. The \\"Better Red Than Dead\\" crowd. Why either before our time? Goldberg hopes they will grow (up) and learn better.     The U. S. became a nation \\"dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\\" To achieve that we had to fight domestic enemies - the Tories in our fight for independence; the Copperheads in the Civil War - despite them Lincoln launched us on the path of making black slaves equal. Every war against aggression, human oppression, and totalitarianism had its opponents and presidents managed the narrow majorities needed to eventually fight them and win, as always must be done. Wilson had the problem in WWI and had to promise to \\"keep us out of war\\" to get reelected, yet he had to have known that our eventual involvement was inevitable. Harry Truman and subsequent presidents had to fight opposition to stick with it and win the Cold War. Recognition of this is why Goldberg has identified his list of the top 100 of that kind of (sometimes well-meaning?) obstructionists today. We survived all of our challenges despite such strategic blunders as Viet Nam and emerged with \\"the land of the free\\" intact and stronger: \\"the last best hope of earth.\\" The freeloaders such as Michael Moore, who is number one on the list, enjoy the fruits as well as everyone else, but show no awareness through appreciation; on the contrary they abuse the freedom of expression thatthe umbrellas guarantees them by rampaging like spoiled brats taking advantage of parents' love and consequent toleration.    I learned who Al Franken is, or thinks he is, by reading this book. In fact he is the #37 who appears as a subtitle on Goldberg's book. He's a popular New York radio show host. If you don't know who he is read the book, not that you need to know. I didn't. Goldberg reports his insane antics during an interview he had on Franken's show, letting his host's own words make the case that he's really an imbecile. I pray that the \\"fool killer\\" of Yankee tradition visits him soon.    I can't think of a thing that Goldberg wrote with which the silent majority is apt to disagree. And besides he's entertaining in making his case. Unfortunately books like this: \\"fire bells in the night,\\" are not famous for changing minds. Experience does that. By my definition, experience is the type of learning we acquire by not having it when we first need it. Next time (except in cases like Louis XVI's) we do better if we're reasonably smart, which is the point of \\"remembering history.\\" Unfortunately experience is an absolutely non-transmittable type of learning.    I highly recommend this book only to those who already agree with it, the type that read the Wall Street Journal. Nonetheless, it will also benefit those who dote on the New York Times if they need to file down a projecting tooth without the expense of a dentist. The Times' publisher is #2 on Goldberg's list for reasons that suggest that someone should ask him if leans to supporting the kind of people who flew an airplane into the Twin Towers, or those who died as a result.    Michael Moore is #1 on the list. If the natural consequence of the America-bashers ravings such as he lead us to waving the white flag the result will be somewhat like stupidly letting Alaric sack Rome. His type will be among the first to go, perhaps first, since the Goths didn't suffer fools gladly, and in fact not at all. Neither do our enemies.    I note that this book got damnation with faint praise in the New York Times Book Review. Naturally it publisher, (#2) Sulzberger, had nothing to do with such a review since the Times is notoriously even handed. As Dan Rather observes, \\"it's middle of the road.\\" Well in a way it is, since the road has a single track - take the first turn to the left. I seem to recall that the Times motto once was, \\"all the news that's fit to print.\\" My view as that it's degraded to \\"all the fits that are news to print.\\"    In any case, read this book if for no other reason than that it's funny at the expense of a bunch of people that desperately need the gentle finger of fun pointed at them. Also read Goldberg's earlier book: Bias.    PS  Also read The Lucifer Principle which points to our destination as both individuals and as a nation if we're too damned cowardly to want to remain Top Gun.     PPS  I note the low star rating of this book - I wonder who is giving it fits, since it's number 23 on Amazon: it will probably always be a great mystery.    PS 29 Apr 06    I note that a preponderance of review readers do not think my review is helpful. Does any shrewd judge of human nature conclude that they are liberals who object to having it said like it is? I suggest they petition Michael Moore for his solution to how we get along with Terrorists. When he lays out his formula I also suggest they endeavor to get it published in the New York Times, that great crying towel of impractical idealism and revival of historical failed solutions.	2005-08-28

He was there when the race took place to be first over Raton Pass and also through the Royal Gorge (where Bat Masterson organized a posse that unsuccessfully held off the Denver and Rio Grande RR as I recall with members of the Dodge City fraternity that included Doc Holliday, Ben Thompson and other notable gunfighers and even Eddie Foy, later a great comedian, who went along for the excitement)all typical of the early days of railroading in the West. Morley was also an associate of the New Mexico participants in the Colfax County War in New Mexico, a parallel to the Lincoln County War that made Billy the Kid famous. Equally famous was Clay Allison, a wild man of the West who was a principal character of the War, which was centered in the vicinity of Cimarron, New Mexico. Agnes's father died in Mexico while pushing the railroad from Benson, Arizona to Guamas, Mexico. He was either accidentally shot in taking a rifle from his buggie, or as his grandon thought, was murdered as part of a plot relating to railroad competition. After his death his strong wife took over the rearing of their children. She managed the Cimarron newspaper that irritated Clay Allison, and he burned it out one night. In the aftermath he learned that a widdy woman ran it, helped set it back up, stating that he didn't make war on women. She later settled on the large range that her husband had aquired north of the present small town of Datil. The adventures there of her family are classics of Western experience that are not exactly things of the past. Read about her and her brother (who went to college and is in the football hall of fame) as they walk down the top rail of their corral with a pet bear cub, a rooster, a goat and sundry other animals following along on the ground. Read how, when she was away to school her brother wroteof the mountain lion that raided the place, killed their bitch hound who defended her pup and generally wrought havoc. Her brother wrote her the information and told her, \\"You should have been here, there was a hellacious fuss.\\" which she read to her horrified teachers and class, not realizing it was anything out of the ordinary. She knew outlaws and lawmen, such as Elfego Baca, who Disney immortalized in a movie. When he defended her neighbor in a self-defense killing, she recommended to Elfego that he forget the fancy arguments and just tell the truth. He said, \\"The truth! The truth! This is a murder case. We lie. They lie. Everybody lies.\\" As I recall the killer was convicted on his first trial. He told Agnes, \\"Elfego took my cattle on the first trial and when he got me off on appeal, he took my ranch.\\" Elfego lived until 1946 as a fixture in Albuquerque. His type are by no means gone. You can go to Datil and vicinity today and see the old west exactly as it was then, with the bark off. The last big cattle drive took place just to the east on the San Augustin Plains. Moderns drive rapidly by and console themselves that the violent old west is dead. If so, the body is keeping damn well. The sheriff of Catron County which encompasses the old Morley ranch requires all heads of households to own and keep handy a gun. Good idea, too. I used to roam that country with my five dogs, camping out in my specially designed pickup which everyone called \\"the teahouse of the August Moon,\\" due to its resemblance to that edifice. Agnes also tells of such characters as Montague Stevens, an Englishman who lost one arm in a hunting accident, who was a famous bear hunter. I'm writing this substantially from memory but it's close enough. Go see for yourself. And if you only read one book about New Mexico this would do. Another dandy is \\"Land of Enchantment.\\"	2005-08-01

It could have been the best. Estleman was provided with the confidential files of the world's foremost Earp authority and chose to betray the trust that gained him access to them, which he had obtained by his statement: \\"If I do this story right, no one will ever have to set the Earps and Doc off down Fremont St. again. \\"RIGHT\\" IS THE KEY WORD IN THAT STATEMENT. BUT HE DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT, OR EVEN COME CLOSE. He did it wrong almost from the first scene, which famous \\"classical\\" Western writing Icon, Dick Wheeler characterized as a scene, \\"THAT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY.\\" WHAT WILL BLOW ONE AWAY? WELL, THIS SCENE HAS THE DEATHLESS WORDS; \\"Doc Holliday was dying a little faster than usual.\\" It takes place in Doc's room at Fly's boarding house in Tombstone where he is allegedly coughing up blood into the wash bowl and examining it. Unfortunately for RIGHT, Doc's TB was in arrest all the while he was in Tombstone. Loren doesn't miss another opportunity to blow us away by a reference in this same scene, to the night soil in Doc's (long john?) underwear, either, foretelling a litany of filth to follow. <br /> <br /> <br />This is a book full of references to stench and excrement, suggesting that the author is fascinated with filth and other things that repel most people, or is trying to appeal to the part of the public so afflicted, which he must assume is a majority. <br /> <br /> <br />In addition he may unconsciously reveal his own religious bias in slurs against Catholics characterized by a scene in an Ursuline nunnery where Doc Holliday's mistress Big Nose Kate, as a girl, is allegedly subjected to a lesbian rape by nuns. He doesn't fail to mention the smell of fish he thinks was involved. This is history? This is more filth and also evinces the obvious bigotry that got him widely attacked by Earp aficionados, and the family and friends of those on whom he attempted character assassination. The reaction included the Christian Science Monitor, where the editor who had published an initial favorable review (perhaps based on reading no more than the dust jacket) was aghast at the backlash, and published much of it. <br /> <br /> <br />This is a book that might better have been left in the word processor. Jeannie Williams, a longtime resident of Cochise County in which Tombstone is located, and noted for the depth of the research that characterizes her books on the West, took Estleman to task for his ignorance of the most fundamental aspects of the country - Estleman has the San Pedro River flowing south (thus uphill) the crash of gunfire from the famous gunfight echoes back from the Huachuca Mts. (35 miles away) the smoke from the Tombstone fire is seen in Prescott (200 miles away beyond several intervening mountain ranges) the last buffalo wanders up out of Mexico (buffalo never having been seen west of the Rio Grande some 160 miles east - and moreover the \\"last buffalo\\" scene is a direct steal from Moreton Frewen's \\"Melton Moray and Other Memories\\") an armadillo runs around the San Pedro River bottoms, (being native to Texas), cedar trees grow in Tombstone. As Tombstone's official historian Ben Traywick commented on that, \\"Holy Cow! He should have known better - he was here at least two hours.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Estleman's editor, Greg Tobin, pronounced Estleman \\"the real thing.\\" He was obviously as ignorant as the readers victimized by this pap, being famous himself for writing in one of his own books, how Benito Juarez, president of Mexico, expressed concern for the fate of the Sacred Tilma (a Catholic sacred relic) ignorant of the fact that Juarez was rabidly anti-church. <br /> <br /> <br />Needless to say both Estleman and Tobin are lauded on their dust jackets as \\"meticulous researchers\\", a mantle so loosely conferred and so popular as to have given rise to the term: \\"Dust Jacket Historian.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />I pity innocent readers whoare roped in by this sort of garbage. As one Earp authority commented, \\"If he'd titled this book Seedy Bludgen\\" it would have come closer to the fact. A small publisher offered to turn it into a classic if ever reprinted, by inserting the subtitle: \\"An unconscious burlesque.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />What can one say further? Well, maybe: \\"Save your time and money.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />And if you're really interested in the Earps and Tombstone, read some of the earlier books, contributed to by the first hand knowledge of those who were there: Helldorado by Billy Breaknridge; Tombstone by Walter Noble Burns; Wyatt Earp, Frontier Marshal, by Stuart Lake; I Married Wyatt Earp, by Wyatt's widow; but for Heaven's sake don't read Frank Waters EARP BROTHERS OF TOMBSTONE, a fraud from the first word to the last. These books are all reviewed on Amazon, by the way. Read the reviews. <br />	2005-05-21

Not only charmingly erotic, but witty, instructive, and often hilarious, put across by an unforgettable cast of characters and an intriguing plot. <br /> <br />I interviewed the publisher and discovered that two of the author's lady friends, one a lesbian, admitted the only reason they took their eyes off the book (except the author's rear cover photo in one case) was to attend to cooling off. The boys all said they envied the protagonist, John Pelham, who tells his wild story first person in a style like Spillane's wise guy, Mike Hammer. <br /> <br />Maverick character, John Pelham, a retired Army colonel and pilot, puts his hobby - HYPNOTISM - to work in two good causes: supplementing his lousy retirement pay and helping people quit smoking. <br /> <br />Pelham tells how his good intentions meet their predictable fate when his SMOKING CLINIC really starts to smoke as he helps customers with other problems, and it turns into a coed whorehouse operated by Hypnotic Suggestion.  <br /> <br />And all perfectly legal, not that you couldn't get hung for it.

His Billy the Kid helped establish once and for all the legendary status of the Kid. Wyatt Earp reported Burn's first visit to his friend, movie star, Wm. S. Hart, saying he was happily convinced Wyatt would allow him to do his story.    Unfortunately, for both Burns and Earp, Wyatt's friend John H. Flood Jr. had just written Wyatt's story, which was being circulated to publishers with the help of Wm. S. Hart. More unfortunately was that Earp loyally declined Burn's offer out of regard for Flood. The rub there turned out to be that Flood obviously couldn't write for beans. (Ask me. I found, bought and published his work after historians had sought for years this rare document, all copies of which had dropped out of sight.) As one editor said of Flood's work, it was \\"stilted and florid and diffuse.\\" That may have been an understatement.    In any case, shifty Burns, despite what others have more kindly said about the sequel, tricked Wyatt into thinking he would instead do a book on Wyatt's intimate, Doc Holliday. And under that pretext he got a lot out of Wyatt, and used it to do a book that Wyatt finally concluded, was more about him than Doc. In fact when it occurred to him that he'd been tricked out of what amounted to the most interesting part of his life story he considered suing Burns. His friend Hart encouraged him, and thought he'd probably win big time. But suits cost time and money just as they do today. Moreover, Wyatt was old and tired. So Burns got away with his trickery, and brought out one of the most interesting, and accurate, books on what had gone on during what could be called the Earp, Behan, Clanton, McLaury, Cowboy Gang Feud. Behan was the crooked sheriff in spades. Burns did not learn that beneath much of the violence at Tombstone lay the fact that Wyatt had swiped the sheriff's cute, young, gal, Josephine Sarah Marcus. (Who later became his third and last wife, at least by common-law.) SEE THE STORY OF HER LIFE WITH WYATT ON AMAZON: \\"I MARRIED WYATT EARP.\\"    Burns success in portraying things as they were was based on the fact that he found many of the participants still living, just as he had in the case of Billy the Kid. Burns was, however, basically a tenderfoot. For example, while researching Wyatt, an idea for another book occurred to him to cover the shenanigans of the many colorful old timers out in Cochise County, and he proposed to have the father of my old friend Ben Sanders act as his oracle and guide in seeking out old scoundrels. Bill Sanders reaction was: \\"You must be joking. These people are my neighbors!\\" If the implication isn't obvious to law professors from back East and that sort, he meant he'd have to move out if he blew the whistle.    In any case, this is a book well worth reading. It's author ended a colorful career shortly after the book came out, by dying quite young. Pity.    There is less fiction here than modern writers, who are shot in the pants with debunking, would like us to believe. Burns knew the foremost guide to writing such books was \\"stick to the facts, till you run out of them, and only make up as much as you have to in order to eat regularly.\\" Editorial ethics then and now were much the same. In any case, Burns was not \\"stilted and florid and diffuse.\\"    Since Flood's Ms. was not saleable, when Stuart Lake came along a few years later he took it over and made it that way. And Lake's so-called biography of Wyatt is a lot more truth than fiction. Read it, too: WYATT EARP: FRONTIER MARSHAL.    Burns was the first of the big name writers that started Wyatt Earp on the trail to fame and eventualy six-shooter Sainthood. I have a notion Wyatt would have liked the money in it, but not necessarily the fuss and bother of meeting celebrity seekers.	2005-01-03

In TOMBSTONE TRAVESTY, Allie Earp, brother Virgil Earp's wife finally has 'her' say, and it's about time. This is historical fiction, but it is close to autobiography. <br /> <br />Using Allie's 'bonafide' memoir, given to Earp family friend Glenn Boyer by LaVonne Griffin, Allie's grand niece to whom she dictated it, Coleman and Allie tell it like it was, not as Frank Waters fabricated it for his own dark purposes in THE EARP BROTHERS OF TOMBSTONE. When Waters read Allie his proposed manuscript for that book, and one wonders why he did, she threatened to kill him if he ever published. He didn't let a smidgeon of it out until she was at death's door. He knew that even in her nineties, Allie was capable of loading him with buckshot. <br /> <br />Coleman brings Allie to life here as she has so many frontier women, such as Doc Holliday's mistress, Big Nose Kate, in DOC HOLLIDAY'S WOMAN, and the unique stagcoach holdup woman, Pearl Hart, in I, PEARL HART, and Augusta Tabor, wife of silver king H.A.W. Tabor, in MATCHLESS. <br /> <br />A remarkable journey into the past, brought to you with such realism you are there.	2004-12-31

I don't know of a Western Buff who isn't aware that the Earp Bros. and Doc Holliday appeared at a preliminary hearing to decide if they should be bound over for trial. Such a hearing can hardly be termed a trial, which this author surely knew, even though he is only an academic attorney. It was fully covered in \\"The OK Corral Inquest\\" by Al Turner years ago, based on the long lost (or stolen) original court transcripts uncovered by the researcher who provided them to Turner as the basis of his book. Without them this author wouldn't have a clue. The term Murder is also misleading in Lubet's title. The case was dismissed with a suggestion by the judge (actually a JP) that if the community didn't like it the Grand Jury then in session could take it up. They didn't. <br /> <br />Moreover, this book has a dilletantish odor of distaste for anyone who would shoot a gun in such fashion as to improve the moral climate of a community, which was actually regarded as a virtue under the \\"Code of the West.\\" Either this academic author is unaware of the need to treat incidents and human nature in the text of the time, or was not conversant with what the very-different-from-today \\"mores\\" were then. <br /> <br />If the sheriff hadn't had a grudge against the Earps, in the spirit of those times the community would have cast hero medals for the Earps and Doc Holliday. <br /> <br />I wonder why the author and a publisher felt this book would contribute anything worthwhile - certainly the lace doily analysis of the courtroom tactics would have a tough time in competition with the label on a can of beans in my opinion. <br /> <br />Read Al Turner's The OK Corral Inquest, and get it with the bark off and sans a lot of unnecessary academic quibbling. And by someone who was thoroughly conversant with the participants so that he didn't misspell their names, of have to look them up in the first place. <br /> <br />A better acadmemically sound title would have been \\"A Scholarly Dissection of the Preliminary Hearing Regarding the Shooting on Lot 3, Block 17, in the Village of Tombsone, AT on the Afternoon of October 26, 1881.\\" <br /> <br />Am I being droll? Is this author being serious? I can only guess in his case. <br /> <br />Buy Turner.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-28

The land is accurately portrayed, the author obviously knows horses and cattle, as well as Western history, and the people are believable, and there is a lack of sensationalism such as Louis L'Amour specialized in by using contrived situations (a shooting on every 7th page) which, of course depended upon unsoud motivation. None of that is here. We find charachters who are believable, based on historical precedents, who remain in character so that it doesn't take An Act of God to get them ojut of pickles they get in by acting basically stupid.<br /><BR>Dolf Morgette is a former lawman who was railroaded to prison for being honest and opposing the politcal &quot;ins&quot;. He is recently paroled and returning home when he is re-embroiled in the same politcal web of &quot;baddies&quot; who really don't want him around. The first attempt to kill him occurs on the way to the depot to head home on his release from prison.<br /><BR>He is supported throughout by his friend Doc Hennessey, a former supporter in the Cattle War that sent him to prison, Chief Henry (a Chief Joseph look alike) Hal Green, a crusading editor, and his son, now maturing, Dolf Jr., his brother Matt and his grandmother, Mum, a sterling character, who comes West to manage her grandsons.<br /><BR>Dolf survives a lot of trouble engineered by people trying to get rid of him before he evens old scores, which included the murder of his father and two older brothers in the Pine Bluff War, named for the mining district in which all of this took place.<br /><BR>Sounds like the same old plot for a Western Grade B Movie, but it really isn't and the reason is the characters for the first time are Grade A., including Chief Henry's daughter, Margaret, educated in &quot;White Man&quot; school, with whom Dolf is romantically involved. After exonorating himself, and evening scores, he leaves the district with her and they are married later.<br />	2004-06-19

As my title indicates, if this book were realistic, the kid would have shot the s.o.b. Hud when he caught him in a rape. The book would have ended there. It follows that although the rape was pure Hud, the kid, whom McMurtry didn't really intend to be a chicken, stepped out of character. A fatal defect. This book takes a lot of suspension of belief. It beats hell out of Lonesome Dove in which two Texas rangers, retired after twenty years service in the Rangers (as of the year they were officially formed) are cavoting along the Rio Grande at the little burg of Lonesome Dove, and there is not a tree to be found for twenty miles.

I think I know. It makes reputations for PhD's who find it easy to send their graduate students to the library to assemble a (new?) book for them.<br /><br />It reminds me of Victor Borga's famous act in which he excerpts scraps from the Blue Danube and Shubert's Serendae, plays them, sometimes backward, pastes the scores together, we are told a he goes along, and finally plays the result, which he calls Blue Serenade by Strubert. At least he made no bones about it. Happily it is nearly impossible to compose original music in a library, and unhappily it is easy to appear to compose an original book in a library.<br /><br />I am waiting for the day that an &quot;uppity&quot; and enterprising graduate student notices that he can use the Library's computers to find relatives of Custer and those who were his associates and do a book about the survivors and what they may be able to find in the attic that hasn't yet been published.<br /><br />They will have to look for a new &quot;advisor&quot; and perhaps a new school to get their Graduate Degree, but they may get famous in the process.	2004-04-12

There is absolutely nothing new here. Any bright High School kid could have written this book in a good library.<br /><br />In addituion to this criticism, I find a combined error and omission that is typical of academic authors who try to write about everything and everybody. This author states that General Sheridan never got to the scene of the 1876 Indian War. On the contrary read Willert as to exactly where and when he did. Furthermore, related to this is the fact that Sheridan arrived belately because of the riots in New Orleans that took him there. Hutton missed this and its significance, which could have lent the added ingredient to his work that would have made it significant. Sheridan in the earlier Indian War on the Southern Plains cooped up the reservation Indians so they couldn't join the hostiles in the field. He would undoubtedly have done the same (in time - he did it belatedly at War Bonnet Creek) and prevented one of the key elements of Custer's disaster (i.e. too damned many Indians).<br /><br />Big reputations are made on this sort of actually superficial copying, partly because of an old boy netword, one suspects. The victims are fundamentally ignorant readers. There is little that can be done about this before the fact, which is what reviews are for.	2004-03-10

It is almost entirely derivative, a catalogue of previous writings.<BR>I recommend to readers not conversant with such books as those that preceded it, on which this one is entirely based, that they first read the basic books and learn that they don't need to read this one. Also learn if they read it how a \\"quick study\\" author missed a lot. For example I see that Marks is bewildered that Mrs. Earp commented that a man named Billy Allen was suspected by the Earp Party of taking a couple of sneak shots at them at the famous gunfight. Why be bewildered? It is in the court testimony that appears in full in Alford Turner's \\"The OK Corral Inquest,\\" which is surely one of the books that should be read not only before this one, but in preference to it. This, taken alone, is a quibbling point, except that numerous similar \\"gee whiz\\" comments show lack of in-depth knowledge.<BR>Marks also mistook a well-known literary hoax, \\"An Illustrated Life of Doc Holliday,\\" as fact. (Excusable in a way: Haley in writing of the Apaches mistook \\"The First Hundred Years of Nino Cochise,\\" as a valid biography.)<BR>Also notable is that this author's only acknowledgment of the major contribution to Earpiana of Wyatt's long-lost Autobiography is to say it was privately printed. One wonders why (especially) an academic author took great pains to avoid specifically crediting the remarkable detective work that went into finding a long-lost document eagerly sought by scholars for years. It's publication amounted to a great public service.<BR>This book, in my opinion, shows evidence of being an error-ridden, non-objective work, an obvious \\"quick study\\" and as a result a seriously flawed work.<BR>Other books to read on this subject before (or instead of) this one are: TOMBSTONE, by Walter Noble Burns; WYATT EARP, FRONTIER MARSHAL, by Stuart N.

These characters are certainly interesting, but the plot is strong as usual in      's books, and the reader will get a humanized take, conjectural of course, on many of the well-known names in Custeriana. In the process their surroundings are brought forward convincingly so that the reader feels he is there while meeting these characters in humanized guise for a change.<br />As the publisher notes on the dust jacket: &quot;It's not easy to breathe life into a tale told many times before, yet that is precisely what       has managed to do. Fear, folly, suspicion, terror and distrust combined to bring about this harvest of death [the Battle of the Little Big Horn]. It will be impossible to read this story and continue to think the same way about these events.&quot; [By which is meant, of course, if you have read much about Custer.]<br />Three readable maps, allegedly drawn by the narrator, [see below] that wonderfully clarify the strategy and tactics.<br />The story is narrated by an old man, now rich and retired, who as an orphan street urchin in St. Paul was run down by the buggy of Gen. Terry, who feels obliged to take care of the victim. As a result he becomes an intimate not only of the Terry household but meets the Custers and is figuratively adopted by the whole clan, whom he finds &quot;entertaining as hell.&quot;<br />He is in at the kill and sees Custer shot off his horse, and presumably killed, but not in the fashion usually accepted. And, as he says, he's had some wonderful informants in telling his story. As an old fellow, before his fireplace at night dozing after few drinks, he is visited by Custer himself, who finally is allowed to tell his side of the story personally.<br />Magic realism?

His father had joined the rush to Nome as a boy, only forty-six years before. The point of this is that today we can still find a lot of Alaskan pioneers around from forty or fifty years ago and talk to them, and get the flavor of things the way they were right after WWII in Alaska - not much different from the Gold Rush Days as a matter of fact. Thus when Glenn Boyer was first in Alaska he found lots of old timers around from whom to get the flavor and feel of things and he obviously did it and can put it across to readers. You can smell, feel and visualize \\"how it was.\\" But he himself obviously experienced a time much different than today's Alaska and a lot more like the historical period he covers so realistically here. How many of you remember Cap Lathrop or Archie Ferguson from first hand contact?<br /><BR>This is the second book in a series about Dolf Morgette, a legendary lawman in the tradition of Wyatt Earp. He comes to Alaska on a manhunt for a killer who shot his good friend, Harvey Parrent, having mistaken Harvey for Dolf himself. He is only partially successful and the manhunt continues in the next volume MORGETTE ON THE BARBARY COAST.<br /><BR>Oddly, reviewers (some of them women) haven't picked up on the fact that Boyer's Morgette series is full of strong women doing things as well or better than men. Morever, many of them, such as Dolf's wife, Margaret are minorities. Although Boyer never makes clear her exact tribe, she is obviously a Nez Perce, indicated by the exploits of her father, Chief Henry, a Chief Joseph look alike. Dolf and Margaret adopt the native daughter of their Indian nurse, who has died of tuberculosis, as so many of them did.<br /><BR>Margaret bears their son, Henry, in Alaska and almost dies in childbirth, saved by the timely visit of Dolf's old friend, Doc Hennessey, who performs a Cesarean delivery. Following a winter in the vicinity of Dyea, they push inland and travel down the Yukon in boats they build themselves, just as the other spampeders did, only they are ahead of the Dawson Rush and go in to the Sky Pilot Diggin's, an obvious parallel to Preacher Creek, and the town that they found parallels Circle City.<br /><BR>They are dogged by the usual bunch of bad guys who are attempting to reach the diggin's ahead of them, apprised of the secret that Jack Quillen, a sourdough is the only one who knows the exact location. Behind the bad guys is one faction of early developers, and behind Dolf and Quillen are another, like the AC Co. and N.A.T.T. who were to pioneer Alaska. John Hedley, local strong man of Dolf's faction is derived from pioneer John Healy (for whom Healy, Alaska is named) and a rare old scoundrel. For those of you who like historical tie-ins, read about Healy's Montana and Canada career in such books as Whoop-up Country.<br /><BR>The story starts with efforts to get rid of Dolf, starting on the steamer north, where someone tries to murder him, continue in Dyea, and follow him down the Yukon, where they cut loose a boat in which he's nursing a severely strained leg, just above Miles Canyon. Here he is rescued by his wife Margaret's heroic swim to the boat to save both Dolf and their baby, Henry.<br /><BR>These bad guys are so mean they don't even clean their fingernails. Treat yourself to some real fun in the tradition of old time Western writers who had been there and wrote for Western Story Magazine in the hey day of the pulps and graduated into \\"Satevepost\\" and \\"Colliers\\" and quality Westerns where even the bad guys knew the difference between right and wrong. (They just didn't give a damn - something like Pete Rose.)

His father had joined the rush to Nome as a boy, only forty-six years before. The point of this is that today we can still find a lot of Alaskan pioneers around from forty or fifty years ago and talk to them, and get the flavor of things the way they were right after WWII in Alaska - not much different from the Gold Rush Days as a matter of fact. Thus when Glenn Boyer was first in Alaska he found lots of old timers around from whom to get the flavor and feel of things and he obviously did it and can put it across to readers. You can smell, feel and visualize \\"how it was.\\" But he himself obviously experienced a time much different than today's Alaska and a lot more like the historical period he covers so realistically here. How many of you remember Cap Lathrop or Archie Ferguson from first hand contact?<br /><BR>This is the second book in a series about Dolf Morgette, a legendary lawman in the tradition of Wyatt Earp. He comes to Alaska on a manhunt for a killer who shot his good friend, Harvey Parrent, having mistaken Harvey for Dolf himself. He is only partially successful and the manhunt continues in the next volume MORGETTE ON THE BARBARY COAST.<br /><BR>Oddly, reviewers (some of them women) haven't picked up on the fact that Boyer's Morgette series is full of strong women doing things as well or better than men. Morever, many of them, such as Dolf's wife, Margaret are minorities. Although Boyer never makes clear her exact tribe, she is obviously a Nez Perce, indicated by the exploits of her father, Chief Henry, a Chief Joseph look alike. Dolf and Margaret adopt the native daughter of their Indian nurse, who has died of tuberculosis, as so many of them did.<br /><BR>Margaret bears their son, Henry, in Alaska and almost dies in childbirth, saved by the timely visit of Dolf's old friend, Doc Hennessey, who performs a Cesarean delivery. Following a winter in the vicinity of Dyea, they push inland and travel down the Yukon in boats they build themselves, just as the other spampeders did, only they are ahead of the Dawson Rush and go in to the Sky Pilot Diggin's, an obvious parallel to Preacher Creek, and the town that they found parallels Circle City.<br /><BR>They are dogged by the usual bunch of bad guys who are attempting to reach the diggin's ahead of them, apprised of the secret that Jack Quillen, a sourdough is the only one who knows the exact location. Behind the bad guys is one faction of early developers, and behind Dolf and Quillen are another, like the AC Co. and N.A.T.T. who were to pioneer Alaska. John Hedley, local strong man of Dolf's faction is derived from pioneer John Healy (for whom Healy, Alaska is named) and a rare old scoundrel. For those of you who like historical tie-ins, read about Healy's Montana and Canada career in such books as Whoop-up Country.<br /><BR>The story starts with efforts to get rid of Dolf, starting on the steamer north, where someone tries to murder him, continue in Dyea, and follow him down the Yukon, where they cut loose a boat in which he's nursing a severely strained leg, just above Miles Canyon. Here he is rescued by is wife Margaret's heroic swim to the boat to save both Dolf and their baby, Henry.<br /><BR>These bad guys are so mean they don't even clean their fingernails. Treat yourself to some real fun in the tradition of old time Western writers who had been there and wrote for Western Story Magazine in the hey day of the pulps and graduated into \\"Satevepost\\" and \\"Colliers\\" and quality Westerns where even the bad guys knew the difference between right and wrong. (They just didn't give a damn - something like Pete Rose.) But, as they should, they get theirs in the end, except - as I said - the worst guy of all escapes, whom Dolf has to track back to the Barbary Coast in San Francisco. (Natch!

There is some truth in this. An Honest John Montgomery did co-own the OK Corral in Tombstone. The rub is that Wayne's grandfather, John Montgomery, was a lifelong farmer near Petersburg, Illinois.<br /><BR>Wayne concocted his story about John Montgomery with too little research, so that it leaked badly. Unfortunately, he roped in True West Magazine (which I suggested should be called True Wind in that respect) and the Tombstone Epitaph National Edition. See the book, THE EARP CURSE, also available on Amazon for the details, covered in the Chapter titled: &quot;Meet Windy Wayne and Dubious Dean.&quot; Montgomery had the bad judgment to sue me for my exposure of his baloney, and I countersued both him and the Tombstone Epitaph (who unwisely supported his imposture) and obtained a handsome out of court settlement from their insurance company in 1980.<br /><BR>The &quot;brother of the evil spirit&quot; is woven all throughout Wayne Montgomer's fabrications which, over the years he also had published in a small, insignificant publication by historical &quot;groupies.&quot; Their degree of integrity was high-lighted by the fact that they never apprised their readership, after Wayne was exposed in my libel suit. Future generations who happen to find a copy of the publication in some library may go through life believing in &quot;the brother of the evil spirit.&quot;<br /><BR>You needn't go through life in that shape. Believe me, it's another baloney tale like Nino Cochise's FIRST HUNDRED YEARS, and Frank Waters' EARP BROTHERS OF TOMBSTONE.<br /><BR>The co-author of this book, Carl Briehan actually did the writing, fully apprised of the specious nature of the source not only by knowledge of the result of my libel suit, but by former associates, after Wayne Montgomery had died. The publisher, informed by my attorneys of the truth, with irrefutable proof, still persisted in publishing this book and apparently is still doing it. They should be ashamed of themselves and discontinue publication.	2004-01-03

He would not have sued, of course, since he knew a legion of people who tolerated his act, but deplored it, would present themselves as witnesses in such a situation.       Ben Traywick, official historian of Tombstone, who worked for the Post Office for a number of years, will be happy to inform anyone of Nino's real name. Nino received his Social Security checks under that name and was probably about thirty years younger than he claimed to be. Ben's mailing address is PO Box 891, Tombstone, AZ 85638.      We all liked Nino in Tombstone some thirty-five years ago when his pose was flying high, and applauded especially the fact that German and French tourists seemed unusually susceptible to his bunk. We remembered him as the fellow who'd once raised skunks in a store down next to Ringo's old bar - since burned down. Nino undoubtedly got his idea to become an Apache from having a small part in the old TV series, \\"High Chaparral.\\"      One day I was buying the old `con' a few at the Crystal Palace Bar and slyly said, \\"Nino, I don't think you're getting the publicity you deserve. I think I'll get the three major TV Networks together to interview you . . . \\" at which he brightened up right smart, until I added, \\"and we'll get some Apache full bloods down from White River and Ft. Apache and do the thing in Apache.\\" He said, \\"For Bleep sake Glenn, don't do that! You'll blow my act!\\" I have his photo inscribed to me with the words: \\"To my friend Glenn - thanks for not blowing my act.\\" Why should I? He wasn't hurting anyone very much. Caveat Emptor!      I am surprised, however, that respected historians were taken in by him and didn't notice that he had Apaches violating the taboos of eating fish, and killing bears, and engaged in suchunlikely practices as scalping.      This book is pure baloney from end to end. One wishes that he and his fellow conspirators (who may have been innocent of any intent to deceive) had done a better job of research.      Being a terrible practical joker in the best Mark Twain and John Phoenix tradition, after almost scaring Nino to death about an interview with full bloods, I offered to fireproof him by getting him lessons in speaking Apache. Little did he know that I and another practical joker, who was then an itinerant glass blower in Tombstone, and a full blood Sioux, were all set to teach him some Sioux, which he wouldn't know wasn't Apache. The lessons continued until the glass blower left town and I suppose when Nino died he was able to handle a smattering of Sioux and \\"true\\" Apache. I mention \\"true\\" since, for his other fireproofing, Nino always said, \\"Those young fellows have forgotten how to speak \\"true\\" Apache.\\" Can't you see him confidently working on an interview such I had earlier proposed, and doing his part in Sioux to the amazement of everyone but me the glassblower, and any Sioux watching the program?      Buy this book as a curiosity, if you wish. But be aware of what it really is. Bunk, in the best Barnum tradition. Nino, I hope that you're in the Great Buffalo Range Beyond having a hell of a fun time, cadging drinks - and pulling the legs of gauche French and German tourists. Vaya con Dios, amigo!	2004-01-03

In my possession are the letters of Hildreth Halliwell, Aunt Allie's grand niece, saying only that Allie threatened to &quot;sue&quot; Waters. (She actually threatened to kill him.) As Hildreth went on to say, &quot;I get so mad every time I think of what Frank Waters wrote after spending hours with Aunt Allie I go berserk . . . he published a lot of lies . . . &quot;<BR><BR>I make that clear in my Epilogue to I MARRIED WYATT EARP and did on two other occasions while Waters was still alive, thus giving him an opportunity to sue me for libel if he chose. Naturally he didn't.<BR><BR>Before Frank realized what I knew for sure, I visited him when he was writer-in-residence at Colorado State U. at Ft. Collins, in 1966, ten years before my I MARRIED WYATT EARP was published. I asked him what Aunt Allie had said about his book. He said, &quot;She said it was the truth.&quot; I still have extensive notes from that meeting.&quot; He naturally said that, but it wasn't true, of course.<BR><BR>This book certainly is a &quot;travesty&quot; as Bruce Trinque comments in an adjoining review, and it is far worse than that. Of course Bruce is referring to Frank Waters' initial title, TOMBSTONE TRAVESTY. Travesty is mild, however, this book is an outrage. It is my opinion that principle requires that it no longer be published.<BR> <BR>In sum, Waters' book is garbage, although many passages are pure gold. The book's value is as a source for the more knowledgeable to attempt to separate the gold from the garbage. It certainly is a curiosity. But it isn't a dependable memoir.	2003-12-26

I don't buy two kids as the lone survivors of a Comanche massacre of a wagon train on the Oregon Trail, who have to travel west for hundreds of miles from the scene alone to make it with a big stud horse to find the boy's Pa at Ft. Bridger. I don't buy the boy's father trying to find them and following tracks of a horse where the horse hasn't yet trod. I don't buy the two kids not finding a soul on the deserted Oregon Trail because it's late in the year. Someone  rode that trail often, day and night every day of the year, over every foot of the trail, from the time it was opened, either Army, or civilian travel was constant. This is malarkey by a man who had a reputation as a historian based on reader ignorance, not his own knowledge. That and PR hype.<br /><BR>Sorry, this is baloney and so are most of his other books and stories. For example, Hondo, where his reputation as a &quot;historian&quot; was first born in a PR conference. In Hondo it is obvious that Looie first wrote just a book, set roughly in the never-never land of traditional Westerns. When his promoting geniuses tried to make it over into a historial tour de force, they fell on their faces, and did him no favor so far as reputation went. Bank account is something else.<br /><BR>I recall standing in my back yard while my horse shoer stopped and spit tobacco juice and said, &quot;I was readin' Hondo last night. It's fairly obvious that when he said &quot;there was no water between Lordsburg and the Fort, he meant Ft. Huachuca over there. What did he think that is over there behind me?&quot; He motioned toward the nearby San Pedro River. &quot;It's sure as hell between Lordsburg and the fort. And get this: this clown is carryin' a forty pound saddle across the supposedly waterless desert. What the hell for? You wouldn't make a mile with a saddle. But is sure looked good in the picture on the cover of the book. If they called this guy Looie Manure they'd come closer to the truth. I threw the damn book in the wastebasket.&quot;<br /><br />Looie was a good old boy who wrote an interesting story, and I don't begrudge him his readership any more tahn I begrudge fast good joints their customers who may not even know what a five star restaurant is, or care, but let's not take that historian&quot; business too seriously.	2003-12-24

Boyer from Tucson,, AZ USA<BR>This is a poet of universal understanding, as all should be, but so few are. When you first dip into this poetry you follow a most unusual spirit inside and outside and around what she knows, and she knows what Winston Churchill knew - we are first and foremost spirit - that we never die because we are a part of everything. Even Victoria Tester's Index turned out to be poetry, whether she knew it or not, because when she writes that's what she writes. <br />It is often impossible to follow great lyric language, or wade through the imagery that became substance instead of form in modern poetry. Imagery here takes us back to Whitman, the first American poet of the land, and what it nurtures - life, strong life, boisterous life, celebrating itself as the gift of God that it is. You have no trouble understanding what is written here, and to know that the writer experienced it. Though there is inevitable acknowledgment of pain, and despair, which are part of life, most of all there is the underlying, wonderful life, of which despair is usually not a dominant part. We are reminded here that suffering is made endurable by the hope that life will go on and become better, and we will again live to celebrate life at its best. There is a voice here that says, \\"when all else fails you in extremis, reach out and you will touch God because He is always there, though we often forget that when things are going well.\\" <br />Here is a poet that brings to life what England's poet laureate, Alfred Tennyson meant when he wrote: &quot;Tell me not in mournful numbers, life is but an empty dream.&quot; There are dreams here, \\"magic realism,\\" strong spiritual acknowledgement, but the dreams in which theyare encountered are never empty. <br />Tester's life is joy, affirmation, an invitation to rush into the world and holler, &quot;Ain't life wonderful, and full of wonders?&quot; <br />How she does this with such incredible eloquence without obscuring a clear understanding would puzzle me except that I have seen often enough how God gives a gift to a very very few, to share with the rest of us. You will read these poems over and over and become stronger for it, be comforted, because faith flies out from every page. <br />Definitely Pulitzer quality, but most of us know how hard it is to be noticed by the august Committee that conferred on LAUGHING BOY the big one and ignored LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL.	2003-12-20

S. writers sat around like geese trying to hatch a porcelain doorknob, and academics made faces over Western heroes, it took an enterprising Englishman to look up Wild Bill's family down in our neck of the woods at Troy Grove. They added the smidgen of new information and the personal touch that Rosa used to make his reputation as the world's foremost Hickok authority, which he incontestably is.<br /><BR>However, readers should be wary of claims of sensational new information uncovered in this sort of book, where the writer has obviously spun off a new version of the same old thing, with perhaps a kernel or two of new stuff, which indeed makes the new book worthwhile if you want a comprehensive Western Library, but hardly justifies kleig lights. We all knew 95% of what Rosa chews and re-chews from the Chicago Tribune Sunday supplements, but he winnowed the chaff of sensationalism out of it, and identified the pure grain, much to his credit.<br /><BR>Hickok comes across as what he was - a good, brave lawman who faced some bad characters that tried to kill him for his peace keeping efforts on behalf of various communities and finally for his reputation. Don't believe anything else. My great grandfather was parish minister for the Church of God at Troy Grove, and I have his 1871 license yet. My family knew Wild Bill as Jim when he came home on visits. He frolicked in the creek with the farm boys, helped get in hay, and generally was an all around good fellow. Naturally people tried to pry blood and thunder tales out of him, but didn't have much luck. If he'd ever told one, it would have come down to us in his home territory. They could always get a pistol shooting display out of him, though, and when I was a kid, we didn't talk about Wyatt Earp, of whom few had heard, but of Wild Bill.<br /><BR>Generally a derned good book to have, and certainly has the first believable verification of the fact from public records that Jim Hickok  really was a very very good pistol shot and cool under fire. He was 75 yards away from Dave Tutt when he shot him dead center, and was under fire when he did it. None of us back home doubted the stories of Hickok cutting a card edgewise at 25 yards or so, or hitting dimes thrown in the air, but nobody made a sworn statement about it.<br /><BR>Another thing about what we heard that should be remembered is that we heard it only fifty years after he was gone, from people that remembered how he looked, the sound of his voice and laugh, and what they saw with their own eyes. (Fifty years ago today is 1953 and the world is full of people who were already adults at that time and thus capable of mature judgments.)<br /><BR>Go it, Joe! Another good job.	2003-12-10
US	52735670	RADQQMZV2ZK16	0963177257	169696641	The Death Of Warren Baxter Earp, A Closer Look	Books	1	3	6	N	N	This certainly is not a biography, but has some small merit.	It seems that this writer continued his characteristic practice of employing researchers. But the rub is, to quote Bacon on the school-men who are famous for speculating on how many angels could repose on the head of a pin: \\"From an infinite agitation of wit, they produced not very much matter.\\" Implicit in Bacon's criticism is that such investigations overlook a lot, such as that many even in his day questioned the existence of angels. And even many that didn't question that would wonder why angels would waste their time sitting on a pin. Many, we may be sure, also didn't give a damn one way or the other. And drawing a parallel may suggest why this book doesn't rate high in Amazon's sales record.<br /><BR>The main theory of this author that Wyatt Earp avenged his brother's death by stalking and ultimately killing all those he suspected had a hand in it, falls short of tenable in that the killer named by the coroner's jury, who was not seriously trying to hide out since he lived under his own name, was allowed to live for years and die a natural death.<br /><BR>Certainly Wyatt and his brother Virgil (and even his brother Jim whom history has perhaps consistently underrated) would have looked into the matter, and undoubtedly did, and stories of old timers, for what they are worth, which is sometimes quite a bit, state that at least brother Virgil was seen in the area not long after the killing took place.<br /><BR>It is a worthy speculation that Virgil, and perhaps Wyatt, after personal local inquiry, which would have gone beyond that in the record today, concluded as anyone would who read no more than the recorded testimony of the coroner's jury, that Warren - a great pain in the neck even to his own family - was asking for what he got. In view of this, it is unlikely that either of those two rather careful men would jeopardize their futures by entering into a blood feud simply because a malodorous family member had been killed. Wyatt's last wife said that Virgil was evasive about the matter when she asked him directly. Possibly he thought the Earp Brothers were expected to have exacted vengeance and would be criticized if they hadn't.<br /><BR>As a criticism of this book's touted thoroughness, one wonders how that \\"legion\\" of researchers, who led to the author figuratively dragging in the history of every yellow dog roaming the streets the day of the killing, missed the fact that Warren had been married. Or that he made a college try at killing his partner in Spokane, Washington in days of yore.<br /><BR>We know why they didn't try to scout up the living descendants of his wife for whatever they might contribute? But think what they missed. Was he a wife beater? Why did the marriage break up? Does he have surviving relatives? Was Warren so malodorous that even his wife's family would not have said anything good about him? They certainly should have been given a shot at the record if they could be found. The above are questions that might have been answered. Does that family have old letters from the other Earps explaining that they looked into Warren's \\"offing\\" and deemed it justifiable?<br /><BR>C'mon. This is not a biography and is actually a rambling speculation about a killing that only attracts notice since the deceased was a brother of a man who achieved wide spread but \\"questionable\\" fame.<br /><BR>Carefully examined, the life of Warren Earp makes obvious that he wouldn't have deserved a biography for any reason. As much would have been concluded about his brother Wyatt if those who wrote of him knew in time that he had stolen horses, that he was a notorious whore master and pimp who, moreover, had deserted his wife of at least a decade for a wiggly little thing. As for the deserted wife's legal status, she certainly qualified as a common law wife. The \\"wiggly little thing\\" confirmed that in the eyes of her collaborators on her aborted biography, who said that she still evinced guilt over the deserted wife, who later committed suicide, and that her guilt was PRONOUNCED even after the passage \\"of all those years.\\" Over fifty at the time.  (Letter extent in a private collection.)<br /><BR>This book is not worth the price, certainly not as what it claims to be, but has some merit for independent research of frontier characters and matters. It is not in my opinion a \\"must\\" book for Western buffs' libraries, or even for many libraries of any kind. It ranks as curiosa and not much more.	2003-12-08

SO WHAT?<br /><BR>My opinion is the same for Melville, Hawthorne and James. Many share my opinion and express relief when they find a fellow unbeliever in these icons; they are happy to at last be allowed to say in public, and above a whisper, the &quot;no no&quot; that all of those writers are dull dull dull. Masterpeice Theatre rescued James, and could probably manage with those mentioned above, and may have for all I know, but I defy anyone to make something worthwhile of STONES OF SUMMER with unrealistic characters (kids of eight sounding twenty eight - c'mon - this is suspension of belief to the max. And when they get to be eighteen they sound eight.) There is simply no door in this thing to some worthwhile place. A total downer. One wonders why it ever found a publisher, but then one wonders why it takes so long for some stunning books to find one, and that some don't find one at all during the writers' lifetime and we may well conclude that some never do. Perhaps the most worthwhile book ever written has never seen print and never will. Publishing is a crap shoot at best. Save your money.<br /><BR>I am not happy with writers who would conduct a cavarly charge at a walk, send their attorneys down to the OK Corral to negotiate instead of going themselves, ride merrygorounds instead of real horses, and would have made Sherman's March to the Sea look like a retreat.	2003-11-09

I don't understand the many attacks upon its authenticity unless they stem from personal animosity of reviewers. This is one of the most heavily researched books ever published. No Western Buff's library should be without it. If you were to read just one Earp book to get a feel for the man this would be that book. Here appeared the first public knowledge of a vast new quantity of information that is today accepted as fact in the Earp Saga, and here many new pictures were first introduced. Before this book was published, Wyatt Earp's third wife was little more than a name. The author personally knew most of his informants, and knew Mrs. Earp casually from a couple of meetings when he was a young man, having been an Earp family friend for half a century and a member of a family that had associated with Wyatt Earp and his wife since the turn of the century.	2003-05-08

His own books have seen to that, but this doesn't detract from the fact that he should be legendary. But there is something about legendary flyers that is often missed. Those of us who were around them didn't know they were legends, and neither did they.<br />In my own flying career which started after Buck's but paralleled his last quarter of a century, the critical period he himself identifies as the high water mark of flight development, I was aware of only one true legend: Lindbergh. Buck has a high opinion of him from a couple of meetings with him, and forgets or forgives his leather-headed period during his America First days before WWII when anyone with an iota of sense knew that America would have to get into the fight against the dictators and their bloody regimes. Lindbergh didn't think so. That position lined him up with those we damned and hated around our supper table in the late 1930's, the Isolationists who kept us out of the War until it was almost too little too late. Thus, the one time I met Lindbergh, I thought, \\"No doubt you're a great aviator, but you're actually a jerk about some things.\\" So much for legends. <br />It appears to me that reviewers overlook something in this book that is actually its main theme. The fact that you can't get out and walk when flying comes after you with the idea of killing you dead as a door nail. Thus, always in the back of the mind of all good pilots is the need to plan every move, to try to anticipate every eventuality and decide what to do in advance. This is to say that the fear of death is always in the back of a good pilot's mind and should be to assure planning; leaving nothing to chance that can be prepared for.<br />Thus, what it boils down to is that Buck in one scene after another, without doing it literally, is repeating that old truism: \\"There are old pilots, and there are bold pilots, but there are no old, bold pilots.\\" To which I add, \\"If there are theywere [darn] lucky!\\"<br />I loved flying, but I always knew it might come and get me. So I learned and you will find that Buck did in spades, that a couple of the surest ways to avoid catastrophe in flying are: [1] to recognize the proposed flight that shouldn't leave the ground in the first place after everything that should be is evaluated, and [2] to turn around when headed into the trouble you are mortally certain can involve dangers you are not reasonably sure you can handle. (Such as finding you can't fly with no fuel by trying to make it too far.)<br />Naturally I loved this book, recognized the right of the writer to say every word he wrote, disagree with almost nothing he says, or did (except failure to fire a hostess who was an obvious damn fool, as well as insubordinate) and think his prose ranks with the best.<br />If you never read another book on flying, this one would give you a taste for the whole thing.	2002-12-31

(I would love to think I was the catalyst for getting this remarkable book at least a little of the attention it deserves.) I am happy to see a near consensus in the reviews now appearing here about a couple of things: (1) that this book should be covered in Lit. Courses and (2) that it is indeed recognized by at least an elite, as that fabled literary phenomenon: \\"The Great American Novel.\\"<br /><BR>I was and am immensely impressed by a writer like Ross Lockridge, Jr., who could craft a thousand plus page novel that is more of a lyric poem. Yet, at the time of its publication, some reviewers lightly passed it over as prolix or superficial, notably competing author Hamilton Basso, whose review, one suspects, might reveal that he'd have cut his arm off to be able to achieve Lockridge's pinnacle of word-use that sweeps our minds away like a Pied Piper demanding we follow him.<br /> <BR>I followed this Pied Piper gladly, into a nostalgic tour of magical long gone years and fascinating people departed forever. Moreover, we were never far from the realization that those during the Civil War were raised to \\"give their last full measure of devotion,\\" to the highest cause, preservation of \\"The Last Best Hope of Earth.\\" We need to be rededicated to that cause today.<br /><BR>At some places in Lockridge's monumental tribute to America, in the hands of this genius, the cumulative effect transcended words, as only music can do. He tugged me into a wonderful, tragi-comic trance-like dream of pure thought where still liveda world of America's heritage. Ross Lockridge undoubtedly fathered that elusive thing: - The Great American Novel.<br /> <BR>I thought as I read a son's account of his father and his work on this remarkable book that its history of creation should remind us it's time to take a second look and face the truth that we were granted a short stay among us of a literary angel, who bequeathed us a treasury of jewel-like words and images beyond price.<br /> <BR>I wrote in my review of Larry Lockridge's remembrance that I would review its inspiration, the book Raintree Country itself, when I had time. I added: \\"In any case, I want to record my discovery of the conundrum of the book, Raintree Country, a mysterious message buried in its maps that no one I have ever encountered had noticed.\\" I did that. Contrary to Ross Lockridge's deliberately (?) misleading words, we could look for Raintree Country on the Map and it `would' be there.<br /> <BR>Finally, I must say that the movie, like most, was - in my opinion - the usual uncomprehending travesty of story mangling and miscasting. Only Flash Perkins was properly cast, in my opinion. I don't think the producers had any more idea of what they had grandly muffed than a baby has of the consequence of throwing its bottle out of the crib. Maybe someday an English production company of the caliber that gave us \\"I Claudius,\\" and \\"Lily\\" and \\"The First Churchills,\\" will redo this classic.	2002-10-05

This book left me wondering who the hell Eisenhower was. I also got the impression that I shared that curiosity with Ike himself. It confirms all the bad mouth of him I heard during and after WWII while in the military. For example, one very high ranking officer who was in a position to know offered this assessment: \\"He never made a decision in his life! He left them to his staff and took the credit if they were right, and blamed his staff if they weren't.\\"<br /><BR>This book confirms the near truth of that without exactly saying so. Eisenhower may have been a \\"soldier statesman\\" using euphemistic terminology, but it appears to me from the testimony of this deeply researched book that he was more of a man in a grey flannel suit. A company man. Also an apple polisher and \\"yes\\" man. These, of course, were exactly the traits necessary to make him the ideal man for the job that made him famous, \\"Supreme Commander\\" for the allies in Europe. If he had been any tougher in his decisions and in enforcing them he'd have been fired, or had to resign. He was, as the British said, \\"Chairman of the Board.\\"<br /><BR>Having lived those times and been familiar with the famous names, I can't think of a single man who could have filled his shoes. D'Este suggests that Gen. Marshal was considered for the job and wanted it. I think he'd have been canned as too abrasive in the long run.<br /><BR>Ike's lack of combat experience was often painfully apparent as this book shows? It also shows that those who had such experience screwed up as often as he did. Examples are his principal subordinates, Montgomery and Bradley.<br /><BR>One strong point of this book for history buffs is the detail on Eisenhower's youth and early career. He was born into a very poor family headed by a father with problems that Ike may have inherited. First was a recognition, profoundly apparent in his father, that he was a born loser (which his son may have inherited and gone to extreme lengths to deny to himself, conceal from others and overcome in any case. ) Second was his father's inability to show love, or much emotion at all.<br /><BR>Eisenhower frantically engaged in contact sports and was a workaholic for whatever reasons. Men such a Pershing and MacArthur almost worked him to death, with little protest from him. It made him indispensable as a staff man and prevented his serving with troops, which he sorely wished to do. It also ultimately brought him to the attention of the top men in his profession on whose staffs he performed remarkably well and faithfully. Because of this Gen. Marshall ultimately recognized him as the Chairman of the Board that they needed in Europe to manage the prima donnas from several nations who held the top military commands. This made Ike famous since he automatically got credit for their successes. This book led me to wonder, however, if even becoming President ever really overcame a dark inheritance from Ike's roots.<br /><BR>Perhaps unrealistically, this book is full of episodes of grown men blowing their stacks, especially Ike. I was never yelled at by a General in my life and worked for a lot fo them, and never raised my voice at a subordinate in anger. It isn't typical military conduct, and especially not becoming livid while doing so like a kid with a tantrum. Big men becoming livid, like high school kids, is a chronic condition in this recital.<br /><BR>This is a tour de force of detail, a convincing revelation of the truth of Gen. Orville Anderson's appraisal: \\"We didn't beat the Germans because we were better men, but because they were stupider than we were.\\"<br /><BR>On balance, a depressing book, since it is inevitable to conclude it is telling it like it was. The book suggested to me that I should read or reread a lot of other WWII memoirs and the biographies of the principal characters, since I am curious to know if during WWII, I and most Americans in and out of service, were living in an optimistic \\"fool's paradise\\" induced bywar propaganda as this book suggests to me.<br /><BR>Ike's unhappy relations with his wife are also covered sketchily. I'd bet she was the classic example of a woman totally unqualified by background to be a military wife, or even an upper class one...	2002-09-20

Yet, everyone should master its contents as a short course in becoming a Rennaissance Person. There's an implied presmise here, which is that &quot;everyone should be a Rennaissance Person.&quot; Why not? Of course making the course cuts down on Television.<br /> I have appreciated Barzun ever since his &quot;House of Intellect&quot; suggested we are becoming a PhD-acy, or as John Stuart Mill feared, are licensing brains. This book is a great road map to the world of literature that makes it unnecessary to attend school and get your ticket punched in order to be educated. As Thomas Carlyle pointed out: &quot;The only real education in any era is a good library.&quot; I quote from memory and this may not be literally what he wrote. Of course that statement also implies that one reads and comprehends what they read in that library.<br /> The reader will not always be on familiar ground with &quot;From Dawn to Decadence,&quot; and may take issue with Barzun's notion that we are over the hill. I do. I feel we have at least one or two more good Imperialistic Wars in us of the variety that will be decried by those who profit most from them.<br /> Also, be prepared to have lots of reference works at your elbow as you delve into Jaques. I do anyhow, but had to run for the libary every once in awhile. If you have a laptop, make the equivalent of flash cards to review what you didn't know. (And if you don't have a laptop, make the flash cards.) Christ how smart you'll sound at some future cocktail party.<br /> And please, please do put some of it to use. For example if a Crusade arises trying to overcome the great misconception that shooling automatically equates to education, join it.<br /> Not recommended for the congenitally dull and no danger they'll try it in most cases.<br /> I wonder where all those copies of this book went that were purchased when it was on the New York Times Best Seller list. Are they ostentatiously displayed on coffee tables? Mine isn't. I'm rereading it and stuffing all those good notes into my laptop. Stay away from me if you don't wish to be sloshed with erudition.<br /> And, thanks Jaques. Even if you did remind me that we are all comparative ignoramuses.

I couldn't agree more that the recent course of history suggests that mankind is tending toward recognition of the fact that the only legitimate form of government is based on the consent of the governed.        But there is a higher object of information: Survival of the Race. It is obvious that if we survive by adaptation (natural selection resulting in survival of the fittest) that accurate information is indispensable. It was my feeling for many years that communism in the USSR was doomed since every child, biologically programmed to use information to survive, was born an enemy of the state. Furthermore, the USSR always thought it was perfect, so why evolve when we are already perfect?        One can see where that took them.        In view of this I sense that our two authors of this book would greatly profit by reading and heeding THE LUCIFER PRINCIPLE and GLOBAL BRAIN, both by Howard Bloom before revising their book if they ever do. Both books make the real challenge obvious. Survival of the race.        I applaud the recognition of the authors of the fact that persons of less than desirable integrity give the press its current bad name. I've encountered enough of them myself, having had moles sicced on me by what amount to impostors, both so-called journalists, but in view of the fact that the result was my photo occupying the entire front page of a wide circulation \\"rag\\" in full color, I had no objections. As John Barrymore said to the Press, \\"Just spell my name right, boys.\\"        I write books. Name identification sells them and it hardly matters what we are identified for.        I highly recommend this book to anyone with an ounce of public spirit. It is long overdue for the pracitioners of the trade to start policing their business better.After occupying the moral high ground with this pair of authors, however, for the jaded reader who is exhausted with the prospect of the monumental task, I recommend the work of another journalist: Ben Hecht. His CHILD OF THE CENTURY may not recount the highest form of journalistic integrity, just the opposite occasionally, but who can help but roar over a headline of his spicy journal covering the rape of a patient by a dentist?: \\"DENTIST FILLS WRONG CAVITY!\\"    Following my initial review of this book, a chorus of \\"unhelpfuls\\" followed. Do I get any bets that most of them are not primarily by so-called journalists over having the whistle blown on them as fundamentally undereducated and myopic? (For example find one major journalist who warned us of gathering muslim terrorism fifty years ago when his kind were inventing the generation gap to augment circulation.) And I'd bet some \\"feminist\\" journalists had a hissy over my quote from Ben Hecht's book, regarding \\"dentist fills wrong cavity.\\" I have a special treat for you, girls; my definitions of a liberated woman: a dodo who gave up a kitchen dictatorship for an office peonage; or, a sister who wanted to be a brother and instead ended up a mother. [Read Joannie in Doonsbury.] Or, pardon my suspicions, but an unfortunate seeking on a public platform the sexual satisfaction that has eluded her everywhere else. These are intellectual hypotheses, of course, so I'm sure they will be accepted as respectable and within proper review guidelines.        Go it, boys! And especially you ladies.	2001-05-14

This form of abuse is subtle and insidious, but nonetheless equally as painful as beatings, perhaps more destructive of the soul.<br /> <br />As this book emphasizes, the first step needed for a woman to escape to a normal life is to recognize that she is abused. (Of course women are not the sole victims of psychological battering &#8211; or abuse, as it&#8217;s more commonly called &#8211; men are sometimes abused as well, both physically and mentally, but not as often as women.)<br /><br />This book is a primer, based on real-life experience by a prize-winning author who recounts a parallel to her own story in the novelized form for which she is well known. This is fiction, but based on solid first-hand knowledge.<br /><br />The first &#8220;desperate act,&#8221; is the suicide attempt of Nan&#8217;s teen-age son, Jamie, who has become desperate enough to do anything to escape the constant abuse of his father. This awakens Nan to her responsibility to save someone beside herself &#8211; the next generation. Only then does she fully comprehend that the primarily abused people have perhaps greater responsibilities to help their children escape and gain a hope for a normal existence. Yet, even with this incentive, she is paralyzed with fear of her husband, Jake.<br /><br />She is driven to her own desperate act, the pivotal point of the book, after she is subjected to an outrageous cruelty when she is almost too ill to move. Still fearful, Nan braves up to the huge first step, which is to get a lawyer and discover her options. Writer Coleman makes clear how important this first step is, since most abusive husbands have convinced their wives that they can&#8217;t live without their support &#8211; can do nothing on their own, have no rights.<br /><br />Even after she files for divorce and flies to a distant hideout, Nan is still afraid. She wonders if she can support herself and her son. She meets a man she is attracted to who appears to be everything she wishes Jake had been, but wonders if she can ever trust love again?<br /> <br />Jake told Nan, who was actually a stunningly talented writer, that her writing was trash and she could support herself as nothing better than a paper grader in some backwater school if she left him. She had her doubts, but never quite believed him despite his hold over her. However, his almost complete hypnotism of her is something she must overcome, and although she realizes it, and sometimes almost overcomes it, it recurs and she constantly has to fight the fear that he is right, or that he will follow her, make her come &#8220;home.&#8221;<br /><br />Bonuses in this story are the parallel experience of Nan's lifelong girl friend with an unfaithful husband, which she valiantly concealed for sixteen years and the experience of Nan&#8217;s black maid and supportive friend with a troublesome man.<br /><br />Nan and her lifelong girl friend are amazed to discover how successfully they veneered their misery in order to keep it from the public. Nan&#8217;s uncomprehending mother, a stereotype of proper upbringing, and her demanding mother-in-law contribute to her daily slavery. These older generations are at the root of fear of scandal if one&#8217;s marital misery is exposed. The feeling is always there for conventional wives, planted by the old ladies in their worlds, that perhaps there actually is &#8220;something wrong with them,&#8221; as their sick husbands keep telling them. The reactions to Nan's final desperate act of her mother and mother-in-law provides some of the most surprising scenes of this story.<br /><br />Jake's obdurate belief that he is normal and everyone else is aberrant, and his antics to avoid facing himself are instructive.<br /><br />It is not clear at any point whether Nan will fail or succeed in recovering her identity, and what her destiny will be. Author Coleman skillfully maintains the tension over this dual possibility of tragedy or redemption until the final pages. Nan&#8217;s story could be a tragedy or a success story, as she is all too aware, and the outcome is solely up to her right up to the wire.<br /><br />This is a book that could have a great effect on correcting a barely recognized, widespread tragedy by alerting the public to the true nature of a mental problem of alarming prevalence. Too many women are alone and desperately afraid, for their lives and those of their children, unaware of the fact that there are houses of refuge for them. There are men who &#8211; dependent on an insane domination of women &#8211; try to recover by any means, including violence, their wives or &#8220;others&#8221; from such shelters &#8211; a horrifying but true fact.<br /><br />This book is an eye-opening shocker and should also be read by ALL MEN. It obviously would be a waste of time, however, for Jake&#8217;s type, who cannot see themselves as less than perfect, but facing reality would be a delightful punishment...<br />	2001-05-14

So many now burden the shelves of our libraries that almost any literate individual could write an equal to the others by going no further than the stacks in a first class library. Add to that a connection with an editor and the writer would be a cinch as the next wonder in the field.<br /><br /> But are any of these writings biographies? Contrast them with a true biography such as one of Lincoln by a first rate scholar, and you will notice something missing in the Earp field: the vast number of letters and opinions of family, friends and contemporary associates, and the public at large, the newspaper coverage almost daily after the subject's arrival on the stage of history, the letters and speeches of the subject, etc. None are there in the case of Earp. Thus we get snippets of history about what Earp did. Even most of his surviving letters available to researchers were written by his wife or his friend and informal secretary John Flood. So, let's get one thing straight, this isn't and can't be a biography.<br /><br />If what has been previously published was removed from this book, it would be slimmed down to no more than a long grocery list. Thus, logically speaking, one might ask why it had to be written. Of course we know the answer - you can advertise anything, sell it and make a profit. A new Earp book is a shoo-in for sales.<br /><br />But, for the newcomer to the field, I recommend doing a lot of reading in formerly published works before reading Tefertiller. I predict you will then wade into this one and say, so what? Couple that with a clumsy writing style and you have a formula for adding your book to the other sixty or so used ones now on sale on this page.

It was destined to raise a huge cloud of dust and a storm of controversy, and Jahns' book was partly the reason. It all started out innocently enough. The editor of the Reminder Press was also the President of the local Historical group which was looking for a manuscript to adapt for a typical Old West \\"mellerdrammer\\" of the Variety Theatre type. They asked Glenn Boyer, who just happened to be passing through town and who later went on to write extensively about the Earps and Doc, to try his hand at turning out a story to be adapted to the stage. Boyer, obviously a practical joker of the Mark Twain/John Phoenix journalism school did the subject up brown. In the Foreword recently issued as a supplement to this booklet, he makes it obvious he was panning such works as Pat Jahns and John Myers Myers Doc books, which were very little about Doc, and a lot of speculation about everything, including the \\"frontier world,\\" by gum, which Jahns at least, added to her title. <br /> <br /> According the new foreword, Boyer decided to kill three birds with one stone: (1) provide the basis for a \\"mellerdrammer\\" for Gaslamp theatre, (2) use the first as a handy medium to pan so-called biographers of the \\"frontier-world-of-and-a-heap-more,\\" and also (3) concoct a platform to expose the widespread practice of stealing pictures from one another by Western magazine writers, such as those who filled the pages of True West (a.k.a. True Wind and more recently True Waste - the former conferred on it by Boyer and the latter by his son, an equally evil balloon buster.) Accordingly he planted a number of bogus pictures which were duly copied by larcenous writers, as he had hoped they would be, so he could later expose the practice pro bono publico. Hedecided to give the medium a five years gestation period before revealing what he had done. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile back at The Frontier World of Doc Holliday, it is interesting to note, as others have, that Pat Jahns (pronounced Yahns, by the way) is a proven psychic in that she is able to divine every thought of Doc, which other reviewers also seem to be annoyed by, perhaps out of jealousy - but more likely out of well-founded skepticism. She also does a psycho-biographical thumbnail sketch of Big Nose Kate, whose true name she didn't know (no big fault at that time since no other Western writers did either) and portrays her as a gum chewing, bon bon gorging Hollywood Grade B strumpet. (Read Linda Darnell and Fay Dunaway.) She has Kate pronouncing the name of the Comique Theatre as Kom-ick-kue, since she was unaware that Kate came from minor Hungarian nobility and spoke the common European court language: French.  <br /> <br />And, contrary to the accepted picture on the Earps, especially Wyatt, Jahns is certain that they are no damned good; so bad they don't even clean their fingernails. This somewhat faults her \\"frontier world\\" virtue, since what they did was normally a practice that netted the six-shooter benefactors a silver medal struck off by the blacksmith for public service. Unfortunately the sheriff, Johnny Behan, was the quintessential villain from Grade B \\"oaters,\\" a died in the wool crooked sheriff. (Worthy to note the first of a long line of similar scumbags with ethical astigmatism in that locale.) Behan went after the Earps tooth and nail, and he and his political toadies, including an under-sheriff who was a fair hand at journalistic smear tactics, left behind the picture that debunkers so love today, in effect bequeathed to debunkers the major body of the work they use to tar and feather the Earps. Jahns, not necessarily a debunker, was roped in by the plausible propaganda. <br /> <br />It seemed to escape Jahns that WHEN the Earps and Doc shot it was from the front in daylight, while just the opposite applied to their enemies. She was also unaware of the cause of Behan's rabid hatred for Wyatt Earp: due to Wyatt having swiped his warm, wiggly concubine. (See book on Amazon: I Married Wyatt Earp.\\") <br /> <br /> In sum, as someone else commented in these Amazon reviews, a much better book on this subject is Karen Holliday Tanner's Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait, not surprisingly, since she is Doc's first cousin three times removed, and thus his closest living Holliday blood relative. Karen's book released a flood of formerly \\"closely held\\" family secrets. A real \\"goodie\\" is that Doc's cousin, Sister Mary Melanie Holliday, between whom and Doc Pat Jahns concocted a crystal ball romance, was called by the Holliday family, \\"that damn nun.\\" Nuntheless, her name was used, as Karen Holliday reveals, as the prototype for virginal Melanie Wilkes in Gone With the Wind. More startling, Margaret Mitchell was a Holliday relative, and used one of the Holliday clan's mansions as the model for her Tara. And, hold onto your hat, the figure of Doc Holliday was the prototype for sorta-likeable-renegade Rhett Butler. Had enough? Well, tough! There's more. <br /> <br /> Karen Tanner reveals, though not in her book, that Doc was known to the family as John Henry, the tragic outcast, doomed by his disease to an unrefined life in the West far from cultured friends and family. But only until Walter Noble Burns' book Tombstone (see also on Amazon) revealed poor dear, tragic, John Henry's identity as \\"Doc\\" the murderous sidekick of Wyatt Earp. And then, as Karen says, \\"he falls out of the family picture entirely, and the proper little old ladies (read Aunt Pitty Pat with fan) never mentioned his name again.\\" <br /> <br /> I ain't through yet, either. Doc had a harelip. And so extensive is Karen Tanner's grab bag of family memorabilia that she has photos of the doctors who operated on him to correct it that appear in her book. And don't give up yet, one of them is the prototype for the kindly, harassed, old doctor in Gone With the Wind who is going out of his mind in Atlanta trying to take care of a flood of wounded soldiers as Sherman's army closes in and angelic Melanie decides to \\"birth a baby.\\" <br /> <br /> Maybe you think that all of this peripheral stuff will be more interesting than Jahns' book, and maybe it is, but Jahns can be commended for some pretty good research. She found Frank Waters' deceitful hatchet job in manuscript, which later appeared as The Earp Brothers of Tombstone, and she found and consulted members of Doc's family. She probably was swayed by Waters' negative portrayal of the Earps, a self-serving artifice, and inexcusable, since it has misled a lot of readers. See Bruce Trinque's expose of it also on Amazon. Waters' book is now recognized as, at best, a curiosity. And Jahns' book isn't all that bad, on balance, if you've first read this label on her product. She does have some nice touches, such as deflating Wyatt Earp's grandstanding by observing: \\"throw him a fish!\\" <br />	2000-03-11

This category, of course, is not applied by the copyright office, but by the publisher. In this case, his secretary assumed that this would rope in even kids in order to sell more books.     While the writing is so clear that most kids could understand almost any passage, this is definitely a mature presentation. Also, in my opinion, the best ever written. As for errors of fact, the facts in this case, and there must be some, are so controversial it would be hard to get a consensus about any assertion that aspired to be a fact. What are presented here as facts are presented so credibly that this book rates higher as factual than any I have seen in the Earp field.    It appears more likely that criticisms of this book, which were so heavy when it was first issued were by adversarial Earp researchers who have since gone down the road suggested by this major inquiry and discovered that perhaps the signs were all pointing in the right direction to begin with.    And one must never overlook motivations of jealousy among competing writers. This book has been saluted as a classic of the writers art by a good number of professinal writers with no ax to grind. Try it out. So many have commented that this book transports the reader into the time and place. This is probably since the author is both a novelist and a great researcher, old enough to have rubbed elbows with the participants and their contemporaries.	1999-10-23
