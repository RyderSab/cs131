The story revolves around the William Beckwith, a young gay aristocrat who is approached by the elderly Lord Nantwich to write his biography. As he learns about and unravels the mysteries of the life of Lord Nantwich, he realizes that the writing of the biography is an assignment he cannot accept. He is appalled by certain details of Nantwich's gay life and finds his emotions at conflict when he realizes that Lord Nantwich was put into prison by his very own grandfather, who led the anti-homosexuality efforts with the Home Secretary and British police. <br /> <br />Through the wittily crafted words of Allan Hollinghurst, we gain an insight into the psyche of gays and homosexuals. The writer exposes the promiscuity of homosexuals, who are often overwhelmed by lust and bodily desires. The happenings within public changing rooms, shower cubicles and gymnasiums, the one-off sexual escapades with strangers and the undercurrents in clubs and pubs introduce us to this group of individuals whom we know little about.  <br /> <br />Aptly named \\"The Swimming-Pool Library\\" because of the protagonist's role as the swimming pool caretaker in his school days, the book is a breakthrough for a novel of the 1980s. Though it contains some graphic descriptions of sexual encounters, the book's erotica is definitely not the focus of the story. It simply weaved into fiction the complexities of gay life in modern society. To accept or disapprove of gays? You decide. <br /> <br />Interestingly enough, when the book was first released in pre-AIDS London, it caused a stir among the readers. A decade and a half later, with cases of AIDS steadily increasing over the years, could the promiscuity of gays be put in the spotlight once again?  <br />	2005-10-09

Weather was scorchingly hot and dry, land was parched and harvests were unsatisfactory. To the Joad family, their livelihood, well-being, families, and happiness - in short, their everything - all hinge on the cultivation of that piece of land. However, they were forced to move west in search of money and food when their land was taken over by the bank, symbolized by the tractor. The early chapters of the book hence gave a poignant portrayal of the encroachment of capitalism on a largely agrarian society and the resulting clash between workers and owners of the land. As the families moved westwards they encountered various problems, such as lack of food, low wages, floods, torrential rains and unreasonable policeman. Yet they did not give up.<br /><br />John Steinbeck ended the story with finesse (I shan't elaborate on this here, lest it spoils your reading experience), further reaffirming the central message of the book - the triumph of human dignity, determination and perseverance. The story did not end with the Joad family making big money, transforming themselves from rags to riches. The writer chose to end it in a more subtle way, leaving room for readers to imagine. `Grapes of Wrath' also paid tribute to motherhood, as Tom Joad's mother rose to become the figure of authority in the family, giving support and charting the direction forward for the family in the later part of the book.<br /><br />I like the way John Steinbeck incorporated detached, short and sweet third person narratives into the story, giving it a fuller and more complete touch. I also fancy the dialogues, and the interplay between the imagery of the environment/weather and the development of the storyline. In all, I enjoyed reading `grapes of wrath'. A very apt metaphoric title indeed, for anger was brewing in the hearts and minds of the migrant family who helped pick the grapes that were in abundance in the orchards, but yet did not get to eat them.<br /><br />P/s: Frankly, if not for the American names, dialogues, and locations, I would have thought that the story could have also happened in Communist China in the early 1900s. Is the writer trying to mock at capitalism gone wrong? Do segments of the story not sound like a reversal of the American ideals of freedom, liberty and equality? A reflection of the state of American society after the great depression??s, but yet did not get to eat them.  <br /> <br />P/s: Frankly, if not for the American names, dialogues, and locations, I would have thought that the story could have also happened in Communist China in the early 1900s.

The theme of the malleability, vagueness and unreliability of memory runs through all of Ishiguro's novels, and `When we were Orphans' is no exception. Set in London and Shanghai of the 1930s, the novel is about a renowned detective Christopher Banks returning to his childhood origin of Shanghai in search of his missing parents. He later discovers the true story that proved to be starkly, and shockingly, different from his preconceived notions and expectations. Kazuo Ishiguro is an excellent writer who works his craft in a subtle, moving way. The story tugs at your heartstrings with its portrayal of the genuine friendship between Banks and his Japanese friend Akira, of the everlasting love between Banks and his mother and a short yet sweet love relationship between Banks and Sarah Hemmings.  <br /> <br />I always had a liking for stories which weave into them critiques of social phenomenon or insinuations at major affairs happening then. Hence `When we were Orphans' fit the bill perfectly with its mention of the opium war, buildup of war in Europe, life and condition in Shanghai with its corruption and foreign influences. The buildup of the story towards its climax took Ishiguro around two-thirds of the book. However, far from being monotonous and boring, the storytelling is skilful and captivating. If there were to be one complaint about this novel, it would be that certain parts of the story appeared to be rather contrived. But then again, that did not spoil the reading pleasure, for it was compensated for by Ishiguro's unique style and his use of the motif of the `texture of memory'.	2005-03-04

Understanding the Divide Between East and West	Books	5	19	21	N	N	Intellectually engaging and well-argued	In this collection of essays written by Mahbunai, a career diplomat and scholar, he seeks to answer questions relating to the new and evolving global order. The essays have been written about a decade ago(from early 1990s), yet the key ideas addressed still retain their relevancy in today's times. To help us better understand the global climate, the writer discusses questions such as `Can Asians think?' `How do Asians view issues such as press freedom and human rights\\" and \\"What can Asia teach the West?\\" Do not rush to think that the writer wrote his essays with an anti-West, pro-Asia bias. In fact, although he argues that the new millennium will see the rise of Asia and the declining dominance of the West, he maintains that the West, especially the US, will maintain a core leadership role in the world, and may become an even more cosmopolitan and vibrant by absorbing cultures from around the globe.  <br /> <br />Mahbunai employs a relatively objective tone throughout his essays. His essays are well researched, cogently argued and incisively presented. The book written in a similar vein as that of Huntington's \\"Clash of Civilizations\\", but it differs by offering an Asian perspective on the changing global order. Now, that makes for essential reading (for both Asians and Westerners).	2005-01-29

A boy (Pi Patel) from India decided to migrate to Canada together with his family and the animals from his zoo. Unfortunately, their ship sank in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Pi's parents went missing and he himself was left stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger. Exciting encounters with the tiger and the surrounding environment followed as Pi engages in a human vs nature battle.  <br /> <br />However, a deeper message underlies the simplicity of the plot. `Life of Pi' is a story of human strength, optimism, courage and wits in times of crisis. It is a story about believing in yourself and in God's willingness to help you out. It is also a story about trusting unconventional experiences and thinking out of the box, as evident from the last chapter.  <br /> <br />Yann Martel injects a healthy dose of humour into his skilful storytelling, making the story highly enjoyable and light-hearted. He packages themes like religions and God, survival and death in a more palatable way for the reader. `Life of Pi' may appear to be a children's book on first glance, but let it simmer in you after a first read and you will find yourself relishing in the afterthought. For those who do not believe in God, reading this book will probably not change your mindset, but it certainly allows you to see this world in a much more positive light.	2005-01-29

Can Asians be good leaders? Must they necessarily conform to the Western ideal of leadership - loud and heroic? Or can they use the `reticent inclination' in their culture to their advantage? These were the sort of questions that I hoped the book could address. <br /> <br />Yes, Badaracco did expound his views on how `quiet leadership' can function in the modern world of unexpectancies and fluidity. But whether those guidelines function well in reality remains to be seen. It is virtually impossible to carry `quiet leadership' to the extremes. You will inevitably sacrifice decisiveness and efficiency for that extra bit of prudence and caution. I feel the ideal is a cross between `quiet leadership' and `showy, heroic leadership'.  <br /> <br />\\"Leading quietly\\" was to me still a book on quiet leadership in a Western context. I guess I should start looking at Asian writers for a real picture on the Asian model of leadership.  <br />	2005-01-16

Orhan Pamuk came across as being controversial for the sake of controversy. By presenting the two opposing camps in Turkey through dialogues between the characters, he caught my attention immediately. There were the fundamentalist Islamists (who insisted on the wearing of the headscarves and opposed the westernization of Islamic Turkey) and the liberals (who advocated a Western-styled development model for Turkey). But after the various arguments were presented (and then annoyingly repeated throughout the rest of the book), my interest waned. Orhan then built the novel on a flimsy and lame storyline, which failed to engage the reader.  <br /> <br />\\"Snow\\" would have been better off being a memoir or a non-fiction read, and hence gain more credibility. Nevertheless, those who wish to learn more about the establishment of a secular Turkey against an Islamic context should read the novel. It certainly acts as a bridge between Turkey and the rest of the world. 2 stars off \\"Snow\\" for its dismal performance in the category of \\"recreational value\\".	2004-12-31

It is also part memoir, part travelogue, and part history text. Through the book, Azar Nafisi reveals her life as a teacher in an Iranian university in the 1980s, who was later expelled from the university due to her refusal to wear a veil. Her life story is interwoven with living conditions then in the Islamic Republic of Iran. We feel for the oppression, the terror and the lack of human rights experienced by the people living under the reign of the Ayatollah. It was a time of revolutionary sentiments, with the Islamic fundamentalists spearheading the movement to rid Iran of decadent Western values and to establish an Islamic state, where religion and power are merged into a single entity.  <br /> <br />The texts Azar Nafisi had chosen to discuss - Pride and Prejudice, Daisy Miller, The Great Gatsby - are all part of the Western canon. Having lived in America for quite some time, Azar adopted a Western perspective, with its ideals and values, in criticizing and analyzing the conditions in Iran. What resulted in hence a very pro-Western, one-sided portrayal of the Iranian situation. That's regrettable, for I would have loved to see her using a more balanced, considered approach.	2004-12-18

Never have I come across any literature book that possesses such immense force and power to tug at heartstrings and evoke torrential emotions from the reader. By virtue of the book's ability to emote, \\"The Kite Runner\\" is irrefutably one of the most representative reads this year.     Set in Afghanistan of the 1970s, the plot revolves around the emotional conflicts and life-changing experiences of Amir, the protagonist. It juxtaposes the rural, simple, traditional lifestyle of pre-war Afghanistan and the turmoil and hardship during the war years (when Taliban ruled Afghanistan) with the carefree, laissez-faire lifestyle of America. It also fleshes out two contrasting characters - Amir, who is self-centred and insensitive to others and Hassan, who places a high premium on friendships and is willing to sacrifice even himself for his friend. By touching on themes such as friendship and betrayal, savagery and bravery, sacrifice and redemption, \\"The Kite Runner\\" presents a plot that engages the reader from the start right to the end with its twists and turns. However, you will not think that Hosseini is trying to create suspense for the sake of suspense, because the story, the dialogues, the characters are so `real' and `life-like' that it is hard not to feel for them.     Amid the novels on the market now, which tend to be satirical or reflective of certain social phenomenon, \\"The Kite Runner\\" stands out for remaining true to the purest of morals and human emotions. It sets us pondering whether, in the midst of a materialistic and hectic society that we live in today, friendships and qualities such as honesty and compassion still exist in their unadulterated forms.	2004-12-17

A pretty innovative approach, I thought. But in so doing, not only did he miss out on important details in the content, he fell short of conveying what meager ideas that he had left in a lucid and effective way. He assumed that the reader has sufficient background information and hence plunged right into the `deep end' of the subject matter. The already mind-boggling reading experience was worsened by the choppy, inadequate translation of the original French writing. The lack of illustration, annotations, maps/diagrams will contribute to the bewilderment, and not the enlightenment of the poor reader. <br /> <br />If you were to buy this book, just read Chapter 1 (a general review) and the chapters on Islam, Latin America, USA and Russia. The rest of the book is not worth your effort getting mired in the entanglement of information (or rather, lack of information and insights) and having to bash your way through. Furthermore, the book was written two decades ago, and hence the information presented is not up-to-date. Well, treat it as a `time capsule' of facts then.	2004-12-17

Using the historical background of the years of World War II, Nazi Germany and US in the Great Depression, Michael Chabon accentuates the reason for the rising popularity of comic books - readers want to escape from the harshness of reality into the realm of hope, fantasy and inspiration depicted by comic books.  The example of the comic \\"The Escapist\\" mentioned in the novel sums it all up - The Escapist possesses the miraculous ability to free himself from any clutches and locks that he gets trapped in.   <br /> <br />The book also touches on the themes of brotherhood (between Kavalier and Clay) and love (between Kavalier and Rosa Saks, and Clay and Rosa Saks), henceforth making it a delectable concoction of both hard facts and emotional appeal. \\"The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay\\" is supposed to be, and should be, a highly interesting book packed with details, action and dialogues, bound by a fast-paced storyline. However, due to its length (six hundred over pages and small print on each page), my attention waned towards the last one third of the book. A pity, considering that the book has so much to tell.	2004-12-10

Reading it reminds me of books of similar genre such as \\"The Alchemist\\". But what sets it apart from the rest are its simple yet powerful writing, unique suburban setting in Botswana Africa and captivating detective storyline charted forward by Precious Ramotswe. The characterization of Precious Romatswe is so effectively done that the reader genuinely feels for her, thinks like her and connects with her. Plot aside, what I find so refreshing in this book is the nostalgic feel for the old simple way of life in Botswana when foreign influences were kept to a minimal and people upheld morals and traditional values.<br /><br />The novel sends an upliftingly positive message to the readers and incorporates various insights on life, that are universally true and equally relevant, be it in Africa, the West, Japan, China or Southeast Asia. One such insight that remains etched in my mind is, \\"... it is possible to change the world, if one is determined enough, and if one sees with sufficient clarity just what it is that has to be changed\\". In a nutshell, this book successfully integrates humour with solemnness. You will undoubtedly crave for more in this series of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.	2004-11-27

Critics of the book claim that Samuel Huntington over-simplified the emerging world order into a mere paradigm of seven major civilizations. I beg to differ. Without some simplification and assumption, can we ever discuss and probe into the intricacies of the workings of international politics? Furthermore, Samuel Huntington has never denied the existence of other factors which will come into play in shaping the developments of the world. What he did was to lay out a framework for laymen like us to better understand the potentially complicating nature of contemporary global politics, and to seek to portend the state of world politics, after the fall of communism, for the reference of policymakers. <br /> <br />It is perfectly reasonable to postulate that, for the decades to come, global politics will be shaped along the lines of civilization. After all, the tendency to mix with `likes' is intrinsic in human nature. Even birds of the same feather flock together. The revival of Asian cultural identities, the rise of China as a global player, and the conflict between Islam fundamentalists and the West, still hold true today, eight years since the book was written. Although Samuel recognizes the alignment and regrouping of countries according to civilizations, he maintains that one should seek common space in the kaleidoscope of diversity. This progressive viewpoint, along with three approaches which he suggested to ensure world peace - abstention, joint mediation and commonalities rule will resonate well with many.  <br /> <br />Cogently argued and meticulously researched yet lucidly expounded, \\"The Clash of Civilizations and the remaking of world order\\" is indeed a book for the masses. Unlike its counterpart which predicts the dominance of liberal democracy, \\"The Clash of Civilizations\\" looks set to remain relevant in the years to come.	2004-11-17

My experience of reading this novel epitomizes the meaning of the expression, \\"The higher one's expectations, the greater the disappointment\\". No doubt Joyce is a great writer, but \\"The Tattooed Girl\\" certainly falls short of her best efforts. The writer seeks to explore the themes of anti-Semitism, the fleeting and impermanent nature of one's identity, and the irrational origins of hatred. The lead-up to the conflict took Joyce almost two-thirds of the book, yet the resolution was a lame attempt at hitting home her intended message. <br /> <br />\\"The Tattooed Girl\\" is likely to be on the reading list for Joyce's diehard fans, but for others, it may end up as a book which failed to move.

Using a conversational tone throughout the book, Thomas Foster chose to emphasize on symbolism and patterns used in literature. Incorporating examples from a wide selection of books (mainly classics or renowned novels), he explains the way symbols are inherent in novels and imparts techniques to the readers on how better to fathom the deeper significance of the contents. According to Thomas, meals, diseases, blindness, weather and seasons, roads present in novels are all written for a purpose. For example, meals signify communions whereas roads represent quests. <br /> <br />There is much to be learned from this book, but I doubt it will be of much use to serious students of literature. I would have preferred if the author also touched on other aspects of literature, such as themes and characterization. Using an entire book to explain symbolism seemed a tad too long-winded. <br />	2004-10-27

Milan Kundera employs his trademark meditative, philosophical writing style in his, novel \\"The unbearable lightness of being\\". If you are looking for a flowing cohesive storyline, look elsewhere, for this book is essentially a book of musings and inner speculations based loosely on the themes of love and infidelity. The story revolves around two couples, Franz and Sabina, Tomas and Tereza and their attempts at infidelity and betrayal of love.  <br /> <br />The book makes for an interesting, light-hearted read, which inevitably sets you to ponder over some of the issues raised. Milan Kundera approaches certain subjects from pretty unconventional ways of thinking, such as those on the kitsch, the duality of soul and body, weight and lightness and the non-recurring nature of life. He exposes you to a plethora of perspectives and compels you to question your own beliefs and viewpoints. The narrative is unimportant here. Removing the veil of the flimsy storyline, what you get is what Milan intends to explore - the essence of \\"being\\". Though this book may have come from a Czech writer, with various allusions to Czech history and its way of life, the topics discussed are universal and will resonate with any reader in any part of the world. <br /> <br />I was touched by the last chapter, \\"Karenin's smile\\" (which related the death of a dog) and amused by the chapter \\"Words Misunderstood\\" (which offered contrasting viewpoints on a single topic). \\"The unbearable lightness of being\\" is yet another book which deserves a re-reading, for only so will you uncover and better appreciate many of the gems hidden in the pages. \\"3 stars\\" for I expected much more out of the book - perhaps something heavier and more gripping.

Creatively apt metaphors abound, \\"Beloved\\" showcases a feast of brilliant storytelling techniques which promises to mesmerize the reader. Well-crafted life-like dialogues, a convoluted yet captivating storyline and heartwrenching themes are just some of the gems that can be found in the book. Through a story set in rurual Ohio several years after the Civil War, \\"Beloved\\" is founded on the aftermath of the protagonist(Sethe)'s escape from slavery. The opening statement \\"124 was spiteful\\" set the tone for the book. Though a free person now, Sethe is still tortured by memories of the past. She wants to let go and start life anew, but her child whom she killed, the tree-like scars on her back, stories of from Paul D and Stamp all return to haunt her. Not many will be able to rationalize Sethe's intention behind murdering her children. However, considering the setting of the scene with \\"four horsemen\\", reminiscent of the biblical Apocalypse, we are actually more inclined to empathize with Sethe.<br /><br />The inhumane treatment of the black slaves described so vividly reminds us of the atrocities of slavery. \\"Beloved\\" also seeks to illustrate the theme of love - mother-daughter love, sisterly love, heterosexual love and brotherhood love among the blacks. The book's allusion to a ghost wreaking havoc in the house is only an excuse for the unfolding of the plot.<br /><br />\\"Beloved\\" is a book that scores on the depth of the issues covered, the marvel of its storytelling and the soundness of characterization.

Essentially an autobiography detailing the lives of three women spanning three generations from the era of warlords in the early 20th century to Communist China under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, \\"Wild swans\\" is a must-read for any who want to experience vicariously, through the eyes of Jung Chang, the atrocities of life undergone by millions of Chinese in the last century.  \\"Wild Swans\\" did not disappoint me. It is not simply a recounting of events, political campaigns and hard facts in chronological order. It includes human interest anecdotes, stories which are not usually found in history books, thus giving a different perspective to the subject. Not only will you read about about the Cult of Mao, the Cultural Revolution, the Rise of the Chinese Communist Party, but also lesser events like the marriage to a warloard general, the learning of English in Mao's Wake and life as a peasant and a barefoot doctor in Mao's China. There were points in the book that tugged at my heartstrings, especially so after I read about the tragic death of Jung Chang's grandmother. One particular episode provided food for thought. Jung Chang's husband was a firm advocate of Communism, who refused to bend the rules even for his suffering and dying wife, for he claimed that as an official, he had to set a good example. That brought a question to mind. Which is more important - rules or humanitarianism? The book ended on a high note, with the ushering in of the reign of Deng Xiaoping, who showed more tolerance towards democracy and capitalism in Communist China. It was especially uplifting to witness the triumph of \\"good over evil\\" and the final emergence of the silver lining beneath the dark clouds that have loomed over China for long. The author and her family now lead pleasant lives, though most of them have forsaken their homeland to live in the West. The stifling oppression for decades havesparked off in them the desire for autonomy and freedom, something severely lacking in China thirty years ago.     My interest on Chinese history was piqued after reading \\"Ten Thousand Miles without a Cloud\\". I must say reading \\"Wild Swans\\" has consolidated that interest and left me craving for more. It has given me a fantastic overview of the history of modern China - a platform from which I can continue to explore this intellectual interest. Do not treat this book as a mere autobiography, for it is more than that. Part memoir, part history book, part travelogue,  \\"Wild Swans\\" promises to inspire and mesmerize.	2004-10-15
US	49699601	R3N8GB39KAZXKD	0679748083	877380177	The Kitchen God's Wife	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Great storytelling!	This is fiction that comes alive through vivid details, realistic dialogues, fast-paced storytelling and credible characters fleshed out by Amy Tan. Through the description of the life story of the protagonist Winnie Louie, Amy convincingly conjures up the situation in China in the early part of the 20th century, with its wars, chaos, political uprisings, customs and traditions. Although generally accurate in her depiction of China, there were some glaring errors in the explanation of Chinese terms. For example, Amy translated \\"tang jie\\" as sugar sisters, when in fact, the term just means female cousins of the paternal side with the same surname. She also explained \\"Open the door, you can already see the mountain\\" as grabbing all opportunities and turning them into something big, when it just means getting straight to the point and not beating about the bush. However, these factual accuracies are extremely minor and they do not affect the flow of the story. <br /> <br />The use of different voices to tell the story is indeed a smart move on the part of Amy, for it spices up the story and better enables the reader to follow the storyline. It is evident that Amy took pains to craft the dialogues such that the voices of Winnie and her daughter can be easily distinguished. While her daughter speaks with a more contemptuous and superficial tone, Winnie's was more stolid and mature.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading the last few chapters of the book for they gave the story an unexpected twist and did a good job in tying the loose ends of the story. You will also discover for yourself why this book is named \\"Kitchen God's Wife\\" - though the reason is really quite subtle. My attention wondered off the book occasionally but was swiftly recalled, thanks to skilful storytelling by Amy. More than just a story about life in China, the atrocities of war, soured marriages, themes of infidelity and perseverance, the book is about the unspoken bond between mothers and daughters. Steering away from the usual heart-wrenching and tear-jerking narrating, Amy employs a light-hearted approach to portray a potentially serious theme of mother-daughter love. Pretty inspirational. Kudos to Amy. <br />	2004-10-06

This is a book that narrates the role the Chinese play in the United States of America, beginning from the late 19th century, when the first wave of Chinese arrived at San Francisco from China after hearing stories that gold nuggets could be easily picked up along the streets of America. Driven by the dream to become wealthy yet often hindered by racist inclinations inherent in the white community and volatility in the global political climate, the Chinese led a life of ups and downs. The book is essentially about the history of America in the 20th century told from the perspective of the Chinese Americans. It also relates to the history of modern China (such as the China under Mao rule) and the history of the world (such as the Cold War, Great Depression), as these closely affect the lives of the Chinese living in America. Wide in its scope, interdisciplinary in its coverage yet incisive in its focus, \\"The Chinese in America\\" promises to be an engaging read.  <br /> <br />One of the reasons why this book is so close to heart is that as a Chinese Singaporean reading the book, I can draw numerous parallels between the Chinese Americans and Chinese Singaporeans. The Chinese, who are not `natives of the soil', play a pivotal role in the development of the country in both regions. Their ancestors were immigrants from China, who ventured into unknown ground in search for better lives.  The most obvious of the similarities is the struggle to find an identity in a Westernized society. Whether to disregard our ethnic roots and embrace fully the influences of the West is a question that till now, remains unresolved.  <br /> <br />Iris uses a consistently objective tone throughout the book, presenting facts without distortion. Incorporating vivid accounts and quotable quotes from famous personalities, and a lucid writing style, Iris makes the contents of the book less intimidating. One star off the total as I would personally prefer if Iris couldinclude more of her own opinions and insights into the subject at the end of the book, giving a splendid finishing touch to it. <br />	2004-10-02

The setting of pre-revolutionary China is only an excuse for the unfolding of the heart-wrenching plot. A story simply told, \\"The Good Earth\\" is about the life story of a farmer, Wang Lung, who undergoes the ups and downs of life: its terrors, its passions, its ambitions and rewards. Weaved into the story are themes of lust, infidelity, filial piety, hard work and self-sacrifice. The heroine of the story is O-lan, formerly a slave in the great Hose of Hwang, whom Wang Lung married. A humble, industrious worker in the family who never complains, she was a symbol of strong will and independence. Even at her deathbed, she puts her family before herself, in spite of the atrocities committed by his husband.<br /><br />Throughout the story, Pearl S Buck attempted to include various allusions to Chinese culture and the conditions of the Chinese society then. Dialogues in the book were translated rather literally from the Chinese syntax, giving them a more authentic Chinese touch. The land which Wang Lung owns played an important role in the book, reflecting the sentiments the Chinese attached to their land then, a source of wealth which supports the family. Chinese traditions were observed, for example, Wang Lun's newborn son was dressed in a red coat, wearing a hat with small gilded Buddha sewn and shoes with tiger faces. The book also mentioned about the presence of foreigners in the cities of China, and an ongoing revolution in the country (though the author did not really go into details about that).<br /><br />Pearl S Buck, a non-Chinese herself, transcended the differences in culture and came up with this sufficiently convincing book that captures the state of pre-revolutionary China in the countryside. A poigant yet simple story that teaches a thing or two about life, \\"The Good Earth\\" is relevant regardless of the part of the globe you are residing at. I have only one minor complaint. Although the use of simple language makes this book a fast read, the lack of a buildup to a climax causes this book to lose its focus at times.x causes this book to lose its focus at times.	2004-09-27

Through extensive and in-depth research, Giles Milton details the various endeavours made by the European powers in the 17th century to acquire spice, a resource in high demand back in Europe, in the Malay Archipelago region (now South-East Asia). Among the plenitude of European adventurers, the heroic Nathaniel's experience stands out, for he catalyzed the development of Manhattan, a small trading centre back then in 1667, to enter a period of rapidly increasing prosperity.  <br /> <br />And I have just summarized in a few sentences the essence of the book. Granted, the book provides an interesting read as Giles Milton managed to pack into the book various exciting accounts of the spice trade, marked by heroism, tragedy, scheming of minds, ruthlessness and even bloodshed. But most the book is inconsequential other than probably the prologue and chapter twelve, which will tell you more than what you need to know to fully appreciate the book And though the book is entitled \\"Nathaniel's Nutmeg\\", more than 50% of the book relates to people other than the supposed hero Nathaniel himself. <br /> <br />I will recommend this book to die-hard fans of popular history books, for it indeed stimulates and captivates, thanks to the lively writing style of Milton. But if you are a more serious student of history, give this book a miss. <br />	2004-09-27

Packed with nuggets of information ranging from the dawn of civilization in the Nile and Tigris-Euphrates valley, to the rise of the Hellenistic and Roman empires to the development of ancient Judaism and Christianity, the book successfully compressed a year of history's work into a week of enjoyable reading.  <br /> <br />The book provides food for thought in many aspects. According to Cantor, archaeological finds conducted to date have proven the Exodus in the Bible false. He even suggested that Saint Paul had not seen for himself Jesus in the flesh. Though controversial at times in his statements (which may not be bad after all, since it makes for a more stimulating read), Cantor generally presented the rise of ancient civilization in an objective manner.   <br /> <br />I personally liked the way the book is organized. The first fifty pages give a general outline of antiquity, with the barest of information that any educated person should know. The second half of the book then delved into something more detailed and specific. Certain chapters, such as Ancient Judaism and the Civil Law, shone with Cantor's comprehensive treatment and novel insights, whereas others such as Christianity paled in comparison. Cantor attempted to use the dialogue between St. Augustine and Vincent to elucidate the essence of Christianity, but he certainly left the reader more bewildered then enlightened.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the straightforward style of Cantor makes \\"Antiquity\\" a gem, for it does not assume prior knowledge of the civilization of the ancient world and hence makes it more `digestible' for non-experts. One of its kind in the market, Cantor's \\"Antiquity\\" certainly fills up the gap in introductory literature on Antiquity. <br />	2004-09-26

This book shows how biogeography and environmental factors affect the development of human societies, not differences in intelligence and certainly not the intrinsic qualities of peoples of different skin colours and races. I was a reluctant reader of this book initially, thanks to the thickness of the book and the seemingly distant fields of knowledge touched on, such as, epidemiology and archeology. However, I was proven wrong. <br /> <br />The writer employs lucid writing to explain how archaelogical evidence actually point to the fact that all of us originate from the African continent. After our ancestors migrated to various parts of the globe, their destinies were affected by geographical factors, which in turn affected their abilities to form organized government, manufacture sophisticated weapons, procure food and develop writing. Interspersed with diagrams, tables, maps and picture of aborigines, the book convincingly demolishes the grounds for racist theories by relying heavily on scientific evidence.  <br /> <br />The book is simple enough for readers with no background information at all to understand it, yet comprehensive enough in its coverage to satisfy the needs of more seasoned readers. Do not let the thickness of the book set you back, for the knowledge gained from reading it will prove worthwhile.  <br /> <br />p/s: it's short of being awarded five stars because it can get quite repetitive at times.	2004-09-24

However, the book is everything but those. <br /> <br />Bill Bryson chose to talk about the \\"history\\" of events dating from the Big Bang to attempts by various scientists to unravel the mysteries of the earth (such as its weight, circumference, constituent elements, internal structure... and plate tectonics) to the rise of life on earth to the emergence of mankind as result of evolution.  <br /> <br />Credit goes to the author for making a topic, which could potentially bore readers off, so delightfully captivating. This indeed sets it apart from the other science books. By incorporating background information of significant scientists, personal anecdotes and a characteristic sense of humour, this book promises to engage both the generalist who wants a introductory read to science, and the specialist, who wants to develop a broader perspective on the origins of the world.  <br /> <br />But the author could do better if he incorporated more topics, touching on chemistry and cosmology(e/g greek mythology surrounding cosmology). Nevertheless, the in-depth research that the non-science expert like Bill Bryson had done for the book should at least compel you to give it one read.	2004-09-24

I would recommend this book to better readers as it is rather difficult to comprehend the African context written in the book.
