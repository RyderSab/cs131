It was more like a magazine article than a book. It was only 100 (very small) pages and a bunch of those pages were photographs. But I did agree with the basic sentiment of the importance of \\"battling one's way through all the easy excuses life offered for giving up\\" and that now we bestow self-esteem on children at birth rather than have them earn it through accomplishments attained with hard work and sacrifice. I hope that parents everywhere take an hour and read this short book.	2005-08-23

Many who follow the NFL know the importance of the '58 championship game. The Author sets up the background leading up to that game, including the original NFL clubs and the upstart AAFC (all-american football conference - original home of Browns and 49ers). There are scores of fascinating personalities - commissioners, owners and players. The author makes it clear how important the three commissioners, Tagliube, Rozelle and Bell were. He looks at a lot of different factors that lead to the ascension of the NFL to the top of the American sports heap, including the revenue sharing decisions, TV, Monday Night Football, and the desire for \\"parity\\". If you are at all interested in the history of the leaque, I highly recommend this book.	2005-08-17

She was inspired by protests at the university she taught at. The book shows that the issues of global trade are not as clear cut either \\"free-traders\\" or anti-globabilizaiton protesters would have us believe. From the cotton fields of Texas, to the factories of China to the bizarre import quotas the issues are complex. The book will make you think no matter where you stand on the issue of global trade.	2005-06-25

The author's ideas were very interesting but not always well supported (IMHO). The author explains that correllation does not prove causality, but then seems to make the same mistake himself. The theory that legalization of abortion is to credit for the drop in crime rate is interesting, but is really only supported by attacking other theories for the drop in crime rate, not really showing that abortions were responsbible. The same can be said for many other discussions in the book. Still worth reading though.	2005-06-25

Some of the situations just went a little over the top for me (why would one of the characters use a weed-whacker as a prosthesis for a missing hand?).

It has a chapter in the table of contents (Annotated Solutions  to Past Free Rsponse Questions) that is nothing more than the URL of the companies web site, which in turn just provides a link to the college board web site.

Our professor recommended this book. I found it to be pretty interesting. The authors do a detailed analysis of a video study from the TIMSS study. Their analysis compares how math is taught in the US, Germany and Japan. Their conclusion is that the US approach focuses on teaching terms and procedures where as the other countries emphasize understanding concepts. They go onto to propose a system of &quot;lesson planning&quot; to improve teaching in the US. Lesson planning calls for teachers to work in teams and develop a single lesson plan (maybe one per semester). The process of developing the lesson plan and refining it imparts to the teachers involved a kind of &quot;best practices&quot; that they can then use in their everyday planning. I am not sure if this is practical, but it sure sounds reasonable to me.	2004-02-16

This book shares some of their insight. The advice is fairly straightforward and not earth-shaking: set your goals, pick an assett allocation in line with your goals and risk tolerance, diversify. From there they go into picking funds addressing such things as evaluating fund manager, looking at costs, judging past performance etc. I found the book helpful, but I am more philosophically aligned with the advice in Bogle's book (Common Sense on Mutual Funds : New Imperatives for the Intelligent Investor by John C. Bogle) that emphasizes index funds. I thinking chasing hot funds can almost be as bad as chasing hot stocks. Finally, the book deals strictly with mutual funds.

It is fairly short and an easy read. It is set long ago, but it is completely familiar. It makes some obvious points (follow your dreams) but also some more subtle ones. The more subtle ones have to do with observing omens and believing that the universe (or god or whomever) helps you in the beginning of your journey and challenges you in the end. While there is probably some logical explanation it helps to think of it in these mystical terms. All in all a worthwhile read.	2004-01-09

I read the book on a trip to Hawaii. I will say it did give a good feel for the place and the history of it. But it was just way too long with what I fealt was too much detail in many parts. Also I found it impossible to keep track of the characters. There are 5 missionary families that intermarry and use last names for first names. I could not keep Hoxforth Hale straight from Hale Hoxforth. (Yes I know there were family trees in the back, but I could not spend my whole time flipping back and forth).

I saw his book in the Cornell Alum magazine (he is a Cornell Grad). I enjoyed reading through, but that may be because I agree with many of his opinions. But even if you disagree with what he says it is worth thinking about. He can't be pigeon-holed into either conservative or liberal. He argues that profiling makes sense (why are searching white-haired grandmas in Airports instead of focusing on members of groups who are more likely to be terrorists). He argues for energy conservation (along the lines of the Sierra Club). He is for legalizing marijuana (and other non-victim crimes like prostitusion, he could be a libertarian). He believes that self-sacrifice is healthy, but that no politician would push us for it. He believes America is a great country, but argues for how we could be better. Overall a worthwhile read, and maybe I will tune in to his show now.	2003-02-11

While not as interesting as the stories of the astronauts (e.g., Lovell's Lost Moon, Shepard & Slayton's Moon Shot) or mission control folks (Chris Kraft's Flight and Gene Kranz's Failure Is Not an Option) it does tell an important part of the story of how we got to the moon. Being an engineer, I appreciate the engineering that went into the development of the moon lander. Sometimes Kelly spends a little too much time on explaining organization charts, but when he sticks to the design, development and deployment of the space craft the book works. I also would have liked a few more illustrations and photographs. If you are looking for a book on the Apollo program this is not the one I would start with, but if you have read about the astronauts and mission control folks and want to learn about the engineers then Moon Lander is definitely worthwhile.	2003-01-23

He went from succesful wall street tycoon to significant scientist. He had no degree in science just a keen interest. Of course his money helped by giving him access to some of the best scientific minds of the time.

I found the most interesting stories in the first half of the book. These stories of scientists who so strongly believe the theories that their experiments can't help but achieve the desired results. These misguided scientists explain away conflicting results with the apparently sincere explanation that unless you want to see the results you won't be able to. The second half of the book gets more into how politics can impact science, specifically looking at Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. The book can be a little slow in points, but a worthwhile read for all who are interested in science to remind us of the importance of skepticism.	2002-12-11

Turns out that is Senator John Kerry from Mass, not Bob Kerrey from Nebraska. Regardless of the political future of the author, this book was a disappointment. Senator Kerry tells two stories, the first of his uncle who was killed in WWII. Second, his own story of growing up in Nebraska, joining the service, going to Viet Nam, being wounded and recovering. However, there is no analysis of the events past the obvious &quot;Viet Nam was a mistake&quot; and we were not fighting to win.

It is more about patents and legal wrangling than about aviation. But the topic of patents and how they are interpreted is important to today's world and many would argue (although the author does not get into this) that a similar battle is taking place today in the information world, in particular with Microsoft playing the part of the Wright brothers. The book is fairly short and a worthwhile read.	2002-10-24

For the very least it makes us remember that in the not too distant past news (or any information for that matter) did not travel the seas any faster than the fastest vessel. The story of how the translantic cable gets laid is interesting both for the technical feats involved but also as a look at the beginning of more entrepeneurial pursuits.	2002-10-18

He does a good job of providing enough technical detail to make it clear why certain discoveries are important without overwhelming you. His choice of focusing on Hydrogen does limit him a little as to what he looks at though. A fairly short book so worth the investment in time for me.	2002-10-18

The bulk of it is just a chronological listing of his matches, with a little insight from John about the match. He does talk a little bit about his antics, his marriages, and other non-match related stuff, but not enough for me. If you loved Johnny Mac back in the 80's I guess you would like this, but for the rest of us, I would pass on this book.	2002-10-07

His original work on dreaming up a &quot;thinking machine&quot; that would eventually become what we know as a computer and his work on breaking the German &quot;enigma&quot; code are worth knowing about. His tragic end is cause for us all to remember the importance of tolerance. However, I found this book to be too long and detailed for my tastes. I think the story could have been told in one half or one third the space. So I would recommend that anyone interested in the history of science read a biography of Turing, but a different one than this book.	2002-09-26

It is mainly about Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky, the main founders of Palm. It treats them a little reverently - they seemingly do no wrong. But leaving that aside it is a good story of start up and the struggles it goes through as they eventually leave to found Hanspring. The only other negative is that the book just kind of ends at the beginning of this year (2002) and the future is so uncertain. Will Handspring's Treo product be like the original palm in the it completely takes over the market? Maybe the authors should have waited a year to the history is a little clearer.	2002-08-25

His previous book, Code, was a little more abstract, but is a good introduction for this book. In Code he explained that although we think the internet is all about freedom it need not always be that way. In this book he specifically shows how technology is being used to provide owners of intellectual property GREATER control over how their work is used. Today we accept that we can go to a library and get a book for free or borrow a copy of book from a friend. However, music companies (one of many examples) are working technology so that every  listening of a song (in electronic form) could be tracted (and presumably charge for). With the current debates about internet radio charging, embedding of anti-piracy technology in all PCs, allowing music companies to plant viruses to punish file-sharers this book could not be more timely (well maybe it could have come out a little earlier). I don't agree with all of Lessig's opinions, but I did agree with his overall premise that we are in the middle of vast shift of how intellectual property is controlled and it requires more thought than we are giving it today.	2002-08-09

There are many books about dot com startups, but the two authors of this book had a real product they based their product on. The product was simply a mouse shaped like a golf club. It was not a world changing product. But we see the problems of manufacturing and distributing a real product. Some of this can be a little less than exciting, but overall it is fairly interesting. My biggest problem is that it seemed like the authors should have waited another year to write the book so we could know the fate of the mouse driver and their company.	2002-07-07

At first you don't like George, the main character. But by the end you can't help but sympathize with him. His daughter, Lucy, is the most interesting character.

I guess they are supposed to be tied together because they are mostly about the same woman and her relationships (although there is one story in the middle about one of her neighbors). But the stories are all a little too independent for me, I would have liked to have seen them tied together more. Having said that, the stories do each offer an interesting look at relationsips.

He does a fairly good job explaining the math. But even if a lot of the math goes over your head it is still interesting because the author explains why the theorems are important in the historical context and also the personalities and politics involved.

The author tries to avoid reading like a text book to try and make math come alive. He is moderately successful, but it is hard not to have some mathy jargon and notation, which I think will discourage those who don't have some motivation to think about math to start with.

It is a short little book that only takes a half an hour to read. It has a simple message that change is not something to be feared but can be embraced. Hopefully most of realize this on some level already. The message is told by a little story about mice in a maze. It does not deal with a lot of details; how can tell you tell when change is really for the better? what do if change is really for the worse? how do you get others to embrace change around you? etc. But it does not require a big investment to read and can help reaffirm a good thought.	2002-02-22

I live in the New York metro area and grew up listening to WNEW (Richard Neer's station) and WPLJ (the biggest competitor). So many of the characters (mostly the DJs) were familiar to me.  Richard Neer does a good job of intertwining his story with the larger story of the FM radio and rock music industries.

But like so many things in life it does not go exactly as planned and the father dies after the first preseason game. The author improvises a little and does backwards looks at his relationship with his father. He also examines the strange relationship between a town and its team. The town pays for the stadium to bring the Brown's back, but it is not really a team of the common Clevelander, which is probably true of most of the NFL. While these are the two main topics (the author's relationship with his father and the new Browns) the author bounces around on other topics such as his own drinking issues and race relations in America (or at least Cleveland). In almost every topic he touches he shows how life is almost more complicated and messy that it seems it should be. Overall, a good read for football fans.	2001-09-20

It describes the battles within the company to determine how to change in the face of the internet revolution. The author provides tremendous detail, much of which is taken from email correspondence made public by the antri-trust case. Some of the detail may be a little dull for some. My major problem with the book is with the author's premise that Gates has &quot;broken&quot; the company by not adapting to the internet quickly enough and instead focused on protecting and extending the windows dynasty. Nobody has really figured out how to make money off the internet, so why blame Microsoft? Gates did protect the Microsoft cash cow (windows). The internet has not made windows extinct, at least not yet. I think a little time is required to see if Gates' strategy was the right one or not. However, still a very worthwhile read for any interested in Microsoft and the PC industry.	2001-09-04

I would recommend to anyone who is interested in the history of the net before it really took off. Unfortunately the history of the internet is lacking in compelling personalities that would make the history more interesting. This is especially true compared to the history of the PC with the likes Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. The men who built the internet were a bright bunch of men, but lacking in ego that made for the battles of the PC era. The lack of personalities is not the book's fault, but just makes the story a little less interesting than some other technology history books.	2001-08-16

How can you not like the story of Linus Torvalds who is not trying to do anything great or get rich or achieve fame. He just wanted some better software. His curiousity about low level programming and desire to build something better led him to create Linux. His desire to have others help him build better software led him to give it away free. But he is no rigid idealist either. He enjoys the money that he will make later and buys a nice house and toys (e.g., BMW Z3). His guiding principle is just to have fun. How can you not like the guy? <br />Also the book gives a good look at the &quot;open source movement&quot;. It provides some insight into how and why &quot;hackers&quot; are motivated to work on projects that don't directly lead to paychecks. The book does this without being fanatical about open source.	2001-08-06

The image of treeing being cut down in a heavy woods, but still standing becasue it was so intertwined with the other trees really struck me. <br />However, there is not much of a plot to the book. The plot is more like little vignettes that show the importance of family and ancestry to the characters of the novel.

The majority of the book is told from the first person of the youngest of the generations. The oldest generation is told from a diary. I found the story from the diary disconnected to the other stories, other than the fact that the women was the mother of the middle generation woman. The middle generation, who is elderly and suffering from Alzheimer's, has just one or two chapters from first person perspective, which I found uneven. Either don't bother to use first person for her perspective or give her equal treatment with the other two stories. The writing was fine and the story of the youngest generation woman was fine and times very good. But overall, did not blend well enough for me to recommend.	2001-07-30

It will also make you appreciate how it changed the country. We think the world has changed so much in the last half of this century, but in 1800 nothing, including news, traveled faster than a horse. But through the railroad and the telegraph, the world was transformed. <br />Ambrose tells the story in a purely linear chronological way. I find that a little dull at times. He also fills us with a lot of detail about how much track was layed on a monthly basis. But overall a worthwhile read for anyone interested in the history of our country.	2001-05-28

And the opening chapter is a riveting story of observing a lynching. But from there the book tends to be a mundane list of places George lives. How about some theme to tie it together? Also large pieces of time are just missing. OK, but could have been a lot better.	2001-05-09

The book does a good job detailing his life and the struggle he lead for civil rights in this country. My main problem is that book seems to be too reverent of MLK. His extra-marital affairs are not examined at all in the light of how such a moral leader could have betrayed his wife. Also, the book examines his stand against the Viet Nam war, but never really asks the question of how much more the civil rights struggle might have progressed if this stand had not been made. But MLK was a great man and all Americans should know his story. Even though I knew had the book had to end, I still felt choked up when I read through the section of his murder.	2001-04-09

However, I found the book tough to read due to the language. Many of the terms were unfamiliar me. The book includes a glossary at the end, but I needed the glossary to be about 10 times as large. If you are looking for a good outdoor adventure book try one by Jon Krakauer (Into Thin Air or Into The Wild).	2001-03-05

This book tells the story of the legal battles that were mainly lead by Thurgood Marshall leading up to and including Brown vs Board of Ed that ended &quot;separate but equal&quot; and the cases after. The book follows Marshall's life to his appointment to a judgeship, the Solicitor General in LBJ's administration to his time on the Supreme Court. However, I found the time period from post WWII to the 60's as the most interesting. The importance of these legal battles is often forgotten. I guess it took MLK to really turn the nation's hearts, but Thurgood was the one who changed the laws. Williams does not deify Marshall and discusses his shortcomings - he was a heavy drinker, cheated on his wives and he his behaviour would be considered sexual harassment today. I am very glad that I expanded my knowledge of the history of the civil rights struggle by reading this book	2001-03-05

Of course I am a Jets fan (season ticket holder). I thought Parcells was fairly open and criticized folks who deserved it. I also thought he provided good insights into the job of coaching an NFL team. My main complaint is that I thought the book could have been a little more detailed and longer.	2001-01-21

It is fairly technical both from legal and technology point of view. But the point it makes is important enough that reading it is worth the effort. The point is basically that all of us should think about how we want &quot;cyberspace&quot; to be. It is not naturally any one way. We may have been led to believe that cyberspace is &quot;naturally&quot; libertarian. Lessig does a good job explaining that is the original architecture, but as the internet evolves from the research based ARPANET to the commerce based WWW, new architectures will evolve that will support new abilities for control and monitoring. While I don't agree with all his suggestions (he seems to think that open source code is the answer to most of the problems) I do agree that these issues need to be considered and discussed by all citizens. This book is a good starting point for those discussions.	2000-12-24

While I found most of the essays interesting, the book lacked an overall thesis or theme to pull it all together. Many of the essays were contradictory (which is fine, but needs resolution). I loved Gleick's biography of Richard Feynman so I was a little disappointed by this book. However, it is well worth a read to have yourself think about how you use time in your own life.	2000-12-05

The story is more about surviving cancer than biking. Some of the detail on cancer treatment may be a little much for some people.

The book does a good job of examining both  Lombardi's good side (the winning, the love by and for his players) and bad  side (scandals on his teams, family life) in a fair manner. During the  period from the late-50s to mid 60's (basically Lombardi's pro coaching  career) pro football went from playing second fiddle to college ball to  being the national obsession. I found this story of the rise of the NFL as  interesting as Lombardi's.	2000-08-24

While I did not find this book quite as interesting as Love to  Water My Soul (which I wish I had given four stars now) it was still a good  book. Jane Kirkpatrick does a good job of mixing history with story to  enhance both. I really felt like I got some idea of what life was like in  Oregon in the late 19th century. I think at some points she works too hard  to incorporate real events. There were a few odd episodes during the book  that seemed a little out of place, but then I saw them mentioned in her  notes at the end as historical events she had discovered in her research.  But overall a good book.	2000-08-17

This book was interesting in its own way - focusing more on the impact to one's family of doing an internet startup. But I found that story  fairly predictable - of course you have to work hard and miss many hours  away from home.

Most books have enough ambiguity so that running the examples is cumbersome. Not so in this book where instructions are  explicit, examples have no typos and screenshots are useful. I also found  the content interesting - it shows you the inner workings of MFC. Finally,  I applaud the authors for trying to write a smaller book (only 140 pages  compared to 1000 pages for most programming books).<br />Negatives: The book  does not use the Visual C++ wizards. The author states this up front. But  who would actually use Visual C++ without the wizard tools? I think after  showing the information about MFC the author could have then shown how to  do the same things with the wizards.	2000-05-23

Each task is small enough that it can be described in 7 or less steps (2 pages). Illustrate the steps of the tasks  with screen shots. <br />However, the execution of the book is bad to poor.  Many times the tasks are not tasks but just information presented as tasks.  There are many editorial errors (spelling errors, inconsistencies between  text and screen shots, inconsistencies between steps in a task) that make  it hard to execute the tasks (I guess you could argue that teachs you  debugging...). Maybe future editions of the book will be cleaned up.	2000-03-17
