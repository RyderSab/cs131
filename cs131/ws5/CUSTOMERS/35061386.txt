Guns N' Roses has a history of poor bios - both in literature (\\"The Band That Time Forgot\\" by Paul Stenning) and video (\\"Axl Rose: The Prettiest Star\\" and that awful GN'R \\"documentary\\" that was released a few years back).    Here, author Jake Brown (a metal freak) traces the story of Izzy Stradlin, the Guns N' Roses guitarist. (Slash was in lead and Izzy usually handled the chords or arpreggios - good examples being Paradise City and Sweet Child O' Mine, where Slash took the solos and overlays and Izzy handled the sweet strumming.)    Izzy is often overlooked by general public because when we think of GN'R, we think of Axl and Slash. Any GN'R fan knows otherwise. Izzy was a vital element of the band's success - and part of their failure as well.    His departure before the Use Your Illusion world tour in 1991 left the band unstable. His replacement, Gilby Clarke, was not enthusiastically greeted. Confusingly, he bore a striking resemblance to Izzy, which only made everything harder to take in. (For example, not many people know, but Gilby is in November Rain's music video, not Izzy.)    Jake Brown doesn't really trace any of this. He uses Axl Rose as the story's evil villain and Slash, Duff and Steven and Matt as Axl's pawns. He basically just uses the book as an opportunity to spew hatred towards everyone who went against Izzy.    Here's the thing: Izzy left in '91 because the band had become too large. It was one of the few things that WASN'T Axl's fault. By his own admission, Izzy preferred to play in smaller \\"garage bands\\" - fame wasn't his piece of cake. Axl cried after he left the band and pleaded with him to stay. Axl said mean things about him afterwards on the tour (continually referring to him as a Double Talkin' Jive Mother...), but they remain friends today. (Izzy being one of the few human beings on earth who has heard studio tracks from Chinese Democracy.)    Anyway... the book is poorly written and doesn't focus on any of this stuff. It basically saysIzzy left GN'R because Axl rubbed him wrong and Slash and Duff [..]. That's not the case at all. [..]  What is it about all these GN'R books that they can't seem to pass them through a simple spell check before sending them to print? The FIRST SENTENCE of Paul Stenning's bio had a spelling error. Izzy's book is similarly erroneous.    All in all I'd say if you're a GN'R fan you already know the truth about why Izzy left the band, and certainly know more than Jake Brown does. He makes up facts, provides his own opinions on topics, drops random Izzy quotes in the middle of chapters, reiterates himself, and so on and so forth. It's like reading a long tabloid piece written by a hack journalist who didn't even bother to take the time and double check his facts.	2005-08-27

I used to enjoy watching Al Franken on \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" and he was always a good writer (as well as performer) on the television show. The first time I recall seeing him was in the comedy \\"Trading Places,\\" starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd. I never expected the guy playing the dumb security guard to write a book as intelligent and witty as this. <br /> <br />I'll outline my complaints first, because it's always good to be over with the bad before delving into the \\"good.\\" <br /> <br />For one, I didn't personally approve of Al Franken's continual plugs and self-praise. I understand a certain portion of it is simply his comedic shtick (like Chevy Chase before he lost his sense of humor, part of Franken's base humor derives from acting arrogant) - but nonetheless it's rather grating and does portray Franken in a lesser light. I counted at least five references to other books he wrote, and in one or two chapters he encourages readers to go buy one of his older books (\\"...it's still in print,\\" he says). <br /> <br />Two, I found his constant belittling of the right-wing party offensive at times. Of course he's a liberal, and for the most part he avoids the stupid \\"he-said-she-said\\" arguments that highlight the media these days (an aspect of which helped me enjoy this book even more), but it's still there. For the most part he avoids slamming conservatives in general, and instead goes after specific party leaders; but a few of his \\"attacks\\" were a bit strong. And also, I think it's kind of funny that Franken claims the media is not liberal by nature - FOX is one of the only networks to be accused of being right-wing, and why is this? Because most other networks report from a liberal perspective.  <br /> <br />Here's another way of looking at it - name all the conservative actors in Hollywood. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Adam Sandler, Gary Oldman... and that's about it (at least in terms of popular actors). Now, count how many liberals are in Hollywood. Hmm... Tom Cruise, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Billy Crystal, Martin Scorsese - these names off the top of my head. The list goes on forever. In fact, everyone on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" is a liberal. It's ironic that, during his days as a staffmember on the show, Al never stopped and realized, \\"Hey, everyone in the media is a liberal like me.\\" <br /> <br />I'm not trying to \\"prove\\" anything, just saying that I disagreed with Al's opinion on this matter (I think statistics would probably reveal most actors, directors, writers and news reporters are librals) - Al claims all the \\"higher ups\\" are mostly conservative, but by the time the news passes down to the anchors, they'll deliver their perspective. A good example is a recent broadcast on a local news station, where - after detailing one of Bush's latest blunders - the anchorman made a sarcastic remark about Bush. If the media were truly conservative in nature, it would never happen as often as it does. <br /> <br />Nevertheless Al manages to prove good points about Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. I really enjoyed the book, found myself agreeing with it more than I expected. <br /> <br />What I admired most is that Al doesn't throw insults around like so many other writers are today. Sure, some of his chapters sound offensive at first - but once you start reading them you'll realize it's just to be funny and the actual content is far from insulting. <br /> <br />The book is well-written, informative and offers a fresh, intellectual stance on politics. I highly recommend it to liberals and conservatives alike.	2005-08-25

I have to say, I admire Stallone. I think he's a good actor, better than Arnold Schwarzenegger (\\"Rocky\\" and \\"Cop Land\\" showcase great performances). He's really good at playing particular roles, like Arnold; I don't buy him in all his film roles, but when he finds the right character, he can be really terrific.  <br /> <br />A few years ago I weighed about 200 pounds. I went on my own diet, started working out, eating right, and dropped down to about 140 and put on twenty pounds of muscle. My two \\"heroes\\" during this time period were Arnold and Stallone.  <br /> <br />I bought Arnold's Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding and that helped a lot. It's just as much a weight-loss book as a bodybuilding one; it doesn't just teach you how to get super-super buff, following its instructions will basically just help you lose weight because it offers exercises and dieting programs that will shed weight fast. <br /> <br />As such, Stallone's book seems like a bit of an afterthought, and I personally found it to be a way of advertising his new dietary supplement product line. (There are about ten ads for it per Muscle & Fitness magazine issue.) Yes, it has worthwhile advice, and is inspiring; if you don't have Arnold's book(s) yet, this is a nice read and will set you on the right path. <br /> <br />But at the end of the day it's more or less a way of plugging Stallone's product and I found that a cheap marketing tactic. (He also conveniently published his Sly Magazine in sync with his new product line, and to feature Rocky 6 comic strip segments to boost popularity for the film, which is now in pre-production thanks to Stallone's smart tactics.) <br /> <br />From the book description:  <br /> <br />>>Is there anyone who could better embody the ultimate action hero physique than Stallone? Of course not, which is why this guide to getting buff hits the nail on the head. <br /> <br />Well, I'd say Arnold better embodies the ultimate action hero physique. Both actors used steroids, so die-hard Sly fans can't say he's natural and Arnie isn't. <br /> <br />Between the two books, I prefer Arnold's. It's over a thousand pages long, offers loads more advice on exercise, dieting, and other things. <br /> <br />I'm not pro-Arnold and anti-Stallone as some people seem to be. I like them both, \\"Rocky\\" is one of my very favorite films, and I have great admiration for Stallone; I think he's very clever, smart and a good businessman.  <br /> <br />The \\"good businessman\\" aspect relates well to this book. It's basically a way of helping to sell his product. Whether you find that a good or bad thing will probably alter your perception of his book.	2005-07-07
US	35061386	R3AKX2F8D7LY8I	0006532306	252268552	De Niro: A Biography	Books	1	13	13	N	N	John Baxter should go piss up a flag pole.	This is a really terrible book. For starters, it's unfair. Most biographers should find a balance between negativity and praise - a good example is Laurence Leamer's recent Arnold Schwarzenegger biography, \\"Fantastic,\\" which details his faults and strengths. <br /> <br />\\"De Niro\\" (oh, what a unique title!) by John Baxter is a terribly painful ordeal. It's clear from the beginning that he dislikes De Niro, and considers his last good performance to be in the film \\"Taxi Driver\\" (1976) -- thereby forgetting \\"The Deer Hunter\\" (1978), \\"Raging Bull\\" (1980), \\"The King of Comedy\\" (1983), \\"Brazil\\" (1985), \\"Midnight Run\\" (1987), \\"Awakenings\\" and \\"GoodFellas\\" (1990), \\"Casino\\" and \\"Heat\\" (1995). (I'm one of De Niro's fans who also likes his comedic ventures, but if you're a snobby film critic, chances are you'll consider \\"Casino\\" his last great film, if that.) <br /> <br />Anyway, Baxter's first mistake is that he tries to offer film criticism. Simply put, he sucks at a critic because he can't get his facts straight. He says \\"Awakenings\\" came out in 1987. Claims \\"Deliverance\\" came out the same year as \\"Mean Streets.\\" Incorrectly quotes De Niro and Scorsese on many occasions, as well as erroneously makes assumptions about their box office failure \\"King of Comedy.\\" He misspells names frequently, occasionally making mistakes altogether (replacing one name with an entirely different one). He gives incorrect plot summaries and seems to like comparing Pacino and De Niro in his section on \\"Heat\\" and other films - a mistake, I think, since they're two very different actors, and anyone who tries to compare them is doing something utterly pointless. I mean, really, they're two great actors - let's just get over with it already, okay? <br /> <br />Another thing Baxter does is try and make a claim to support the fact that De Niro is stupid, inarticulate, weird (because of his intense privacy), and so on and so forth. I think that's a very cheap shot. He's inarticulate BECAUSE he is shy, dumbass. Privacy doesn't automatically make someone a reclusive weirdo. I'm a private person, too, and am not very good at expressing myself through speaking publicly. I don't think that's \\"strange\\" - it's just different personalities. If I had to define Baxter's personality, I'd say he's one of those arrogant snobs who belittles others to make himself feel better. But that's my opinion. <br /> <br />Baxter is a really bad writer and he can't get any of his facts straight. His bio is unauthorized and as a result he has nothing worthwhile to say; save your cash and wait for an authorized biography in the future.	2005-07-07

He said Kindergarten Cop was an allusion to the Reagan era and the small children represented the divorce of modern society from the 1960s, or something like that. And just think, I always thought Kindergarten Cop was a comedy about a male macho cop who's stuck with some little kiddies for a week as a teacher. I was wrong, I guess. (End of sarcasm.) <br /> <br />Andrews has no \\"authorization\\" in his bios, meaning he hasn't been given exclusive permission by Travolta (or Arnie). In this case he's just pulling stuff out of his butt and most of it is garbage. He tries to become a film critic and fails. He tries to detail Travolta's life, and fails. He tries to come up with insightful facts - and fails, because he has no permission to write anything of substance. <br /> <br />A piece of garbage; the Schwarzenegger one is even worse.	2005-07-07
US	35061386	R21CNA35H7TW3E	0312333382	899659165	Fantastic: The Life of Arnold Schwarzenegger	Books	5	21	21	N	N	A fair and insightful look at Arnold that doesn't take sides - the best of his bios!	There have been some really bad Arnold biographies in the past. They've either been written by huge fans of the actor who ignore all his mistakes and \\"unlikable\\" traits, or authors who detest Schwarzenegger and smear tabloid reports all over their pages. <br /> <br />\\"Fantastic\\" is the best Arnold Schwarzenegger biography out there, and it's a very insightful - and fair - portrait of the man. <br /> <br />Author Laurence Leamer is a huge Kennedy fan (he's written books \\"The Kennedy Men\\" and \\"The Kennedy Women\\") so it's reasonable to assume he is a Democrat. Arnold, as we all know, is not. Leamer has likely written this book because Arnold is married to Maria Shriver, a Kennedy family member. <br /> <br />As a result he doesn't paint everything picture-perfect. I get the feeling he likes Arnold, but also sees another side of the action star that people don't know about - a vicious, mean-spirited man with an obsession for fame and fortune. <br /> <br />Leamer recalls a story surrounding the release of \\"Red Heat\\" in 1988. Schwarzenegger was crying, a newspaper in his hand. One of Arnie's friends asked what is wrong. He pointed to the paper: \\"Red Heat\\" had debuted at no. 2 at the box office with only $37 million (back then, that was actually quite a lot, but it still didn't match the gross of his earlier films). \\"Don't worry, it's number two,\\" his friend told him. And Arnold replied, \\"But I want to be number one!\\" <br /> <br />This book covers Arnold's life from childhood to political adulthood. It doesn't skip over the harsh stuff - it details his sexual lust (traced back to his early days of bodybuilding) and quest for fame. It mentions his affairs, and his row with Sylvester Stallone in the late '80s and early '90s. (The entire ordeal is fascinating, something I had never been aware of - I always thought they were friends! Now the Stallone put-down in the movie \\"Twins\\" takes on a whole new edge!) <br /> <br />At the same time, Leamer is respectful of the movie star and points out his good traits, as well. He paints him as a joyful, light-hearted guy who just likes to have a good time, but can be obsessive at times and, when aggravated, rather vicious. <br /> <br />\\"Fantastic\\" is, well, a fantastic insight into the life of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the first true Arnold bio to deliver the goods without skipping over crucial events or focusing solely on his mishaps. <br /> <br />A very good read: well written and intelligent, I recomend it to fans - or non-fans, even - of Schwarzenegger without hesitation.	2005-07-07

I'm still bemused and puzzled the mechanics of toilet-flushing. My wife (may she rest in peace) bought me this book as an anniversary present last month before she was tragically torn apart by a rabid pack of alligators at a Wyoming nature preserve. Anyway, life moves on. <br /> <br />Much to my disappointment this book did not teach me everything I should know how to do. \\"But Fred,\\" you might be saying (and I'll be saying \\"Fred isn't my name, idiot!\\"), \\"how do you know what you should know if you don't know what it is to begin with?\\" <br /> <br />Ah, well, let me explain. See, if Tchikavoslky taught me one thought, it was this: I know nothing. <br /> <br />So it is with this deep insight into my own mind that I came up with the following Things I Should Know, based on what I currently do NOT know: <br /> <br />1. How to start a hurricane. This is very important. <br /> <br />2. How to kill a man with a toothpick. What if you met a hitman at a fancy restaurant and found out your were his next victim? Scary. <br /> <br />3. How to run a nuclear powerplant with a one-man army. I don't want to be the next Homer Simpson! <br /> <br />4. How to raise children. I've raised ten and still haven't figured out what a diaper is. <br /> <br />5. What a diaper is. I don't know, my wife used to talk about them a lot. <br /> <br />6. How to drive. Sure, technically we're supposed to learn how BEFORE we get our driver's licenses, but like many people, I just got a fake one when I was 12 and have been driving since then. I've been in over three hundred vehicular accidents and been charged with five counts of manslaughter, so I figured it might be good to learn how to drive. <br /> <br />7. How to stalk a celebrity. You just never know. <br /> <br />8. How to put on underwear without leaving stain marks. You fellas know what I'm saying! <br /> <br />9. How to make coffee. People ask me to all the time, and becauseI don't know how, I just take some warm water and pour mud in. Thankfully no one's noticed my inadequacies yet, but I'm sure soon enough they will, after another person dies of food poisoning and internal infection. <br /> <br />10. How to kill yourself. I don't want the aliens to get anything out of me when I'm taken hostage. I saw it in that Tom Cruise movie, and it was sure scary! <br /> <br />So with these things in mind, I'm severely disappointed by this book, and feel it is mis-marketed and stupid. <br /> <br />Please, Barbet Schroeder (or whoever the author was), write a better book next time.	2005-07-03

I read Michael Crichton's \\"State of Fear\\" and instantly realized it was, sadly, one of his lesser works. Although I happen to think \\"Timeline\\" is very underrated, his other recent novels -- \\"Prey,\\" \\"Airframe,\\" etc. -- have all been just \\"good\\" and not particularly great... at least not in the vein of \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Sphere.\\" <br /> <br />To suddenly criticize Crichton for the decline in his writing seemed a bit odd to me. I looked up reviews and a vast majority of (at least professional) critiques nailed Crichton's novel and bashed it left and right. However, I soon realized that more so than the book itself, they were lambasting his \\"message\\" -- a debunk of the Global Warming Theory. <br /> <br />It just goes to show how backwards this country has become. A writer who _backs up his facts_ (as Crichton does) is accused of being a liar, yet Dan Brown -- who includes _no bibliography AND CITES FALSE REFERENCES_ -- gets exceedingly positive reviews. <br /> <br />The simple fact is that the critics out there don't like the idea of a Conservative-oriented novel, and would much rather praise the anti-religious propaganda. <br /> <br />I don't have a say on either issue. It is what it is. They've both just novels. I'm not going to talk politics, because frankly I just don't care. <br /> <br />But what I will say is that after reading THE DA VINCI CODE, not only is Michael Crichton a far better literary writer, but he backs up his claims in his bibliography, and writes an introduction in which he kindly explains that it's his theory and he's willing to provide the bibliography for those who wish to question anything in his text. <br /> <br />That's what a great scientist, writer, researcher, or theorist does. On top of that, Crichton's story is still well written. The dialogue is ten times better than the stiff 20-page-long theoretical monologues in THE DA VINCI CODE, which provided some of the most unrealistic dialogue I've ever read. <br /> <br />After reading THE DAVINCI CODE, it instantly reminded me of a poor man's Michael Crichton novel. And it gave me newfound respect for Crichton's recent work -- I realized just how bad it could have become, and how good it remains. <br /> <br />By the way, I provide this source for anyone who questions the \\"facts\\" in STATE OF FEAR: <br /> <br />[...]	2005-04-27

However, Jurgen Muller's BOOKS OF THE '90s is by far the worst I've read out of the series so far. Whereas the '70s book listed all the iconic films of the 1970s, Movies of the 90s excludes some of the most definitive - such as Reservoir Dogs - and opts for stuff that wasn't even very good. (Such as Crash.) <br /> <br />If this was a list of the iconic films of the '90s such as \\"Films of the 70s\\" was, then perhaps including Dumb and Dumber also would have been a smart move. I know this sounds ridiculous, but it's better than many of the mediocre films they include here. <br /> <br />It's not a bad list, it's just missing a lot of titles I'd personally include, making up for their absence with mediocre titles that aren't even very popular.	2005-03-13

Also, Perrin doesn't spend much time explaining the actual promised \\"breakdown\\" of Slash's work - the full title of the book is THE TECHNIQUES OF SLASH: THE BEST OF GN'R, but the title seems to change throughout - sometimes it's a demonstration of Slash's techniques, sometimes it's just tabs of their best songs with little explanation.<br /><br />For example, he notes the \\"power strumming\\" for Civil War, but doesn't give any advice on how to strum the opening, which is in my opinion the hardest part.<br /><br />It's still a good book and very useful because it contains accurate transcriptions of the songs, and many of them are indeed their best. However I also bought a tab book for Appetite for Destruction - the only bonus here is a few Use Your Illusion tracks and a CD, because the \\"tutoring\\" they promise on the back cover isn't exactly very helpful.<br /><br />Also, don't be fooled by the back cover - November Rain, Bad Obsession and various others that are listed are NOT transcribed; brief solo passages are contained within a section called \\"Signature Slash Licks,\\" which basically means you learn to play part of the November Rain solo, NOT the entire song (as I was lead to believe).<br /><br />There's so much Appetite content in this book, I feel as if I paid twice for the same thing! But at least it has _some_ UYI songs, such as Yesterdays, which is fairly easy to play.<br /><br />However also be aware that this is very hard - the solo for Sweet Child O' Mine is the hardest solo I've ever played, and they don't make it any easier with the CD.

Stenning admits in the prologue that he was an obsessed GNR fan as a teenager and this has somewhat continued into his adult life, so it's a relief to see someone NOT bashing Axl Rose endlessly. In fact Stenning provides a good balance to the criticism and reveals that Axl wasn't always at fault - such as the cancellation of their last world tour...more went on than just \\"Axl quitting.\\" <br /> <br />He also puts to rest the idea that Kurt Cobain was \\"attacked\\" without being provoked by Rose. Included is an interview snippet in which Cobain says GN'R are \\"worthless\\" and pointless and, basically, a horrible band. Courtney then teased Axl at the music awards and Axl threatened to beat him up. So this whole thing about Axl saying stuff about Kurt behind his back isn't true, either. It goes both ways. <br /> <br />On the downside this has a HUGE number of typos. I mean, the first sentence in the book is missing a word. It doesn't make sense. That's kind of a bad start. Also, Stenning is a very mediocre writer. <br /> <br />Also, the constant use of quotes -- seemingly random, with no actual reference to the material at hand -- is a bit baffling. It's as if Stenning just got bored and thought, \\"Hey, here's a good point to put in that quote I really like from 'Estranged.'\\" <br /> <br />The formatting of the book is quite poor and reminded me of vanity printing. The only good thing was the photo section, which is surpisingly high quality. I only found one picture a bit odd - Axl standing next to a black man, obviously poor quality picture taken with a standard camera. Perhaps it's a picture of Stenning with Axl? But he claims he wasn't able to meet him to go over the writing of the book, so.... <br /> <br />Overall this is indeed a very flawed book but it's still quite easy to read and has some fascinating stories I hadn't heard before (like Duff's drug rampage). Pretty good stuff, and the best GN'R book I've read so far (there have been worse ones, trust me).	2005-02-21

Robert Hamburger is a prepubescent kid who thought it would be funny to start an Internet site/parody a la his idol Maddox [...]. The huge difference between Robert and Maddox, however, is the following:    - Maddox is (or was) funny    - Maddox plays immaturity for laughs, whereas Robert really just is immature and doesn't understand the basics of humor nor irony    - Maddox understands satire    - Maddox doesn't rely on utter stupidity, bad spelling and lots of random punctuation marks and capitalization for comedic effect.    Here's something that \\"genius\\" Robert Hamburger wrote, taken directly from his (very lame) website:    \\"Apparently, there was this ninja who was hanging out with some kid.  They played basketball and ate hamburgers together.  One day the kid was like \\"Do you want to hear something that will mess up your life?\\" The ninja was like \\"What are you talking about?\\" \\"A real live ghost story,\\" said the kid.    \\"O.K.\\" said the ninja.    Then the kid began...\\"These two buddies were eating tacos together one night at a bar and it was raining really hard (outside).  They were just talking.  Then all of a sudden, there was a noise, like a gurgle or squirt.  The buddies were like \\"What the heck is that?\\"  And guess what...it happened again!  They were both completely freaked out.  (One buddy couldn't even finish his meal.)  They briefly looked around the bar for clues, but they never found out what it was.  And both buddies went home scared to death.\\" After hearing the ghost story, the ninja was so scared that he grabbed the kid and spanked him until both parties squirted urine.\\"    ====    Oh yes, very funny, I'm just bursting with laughter. (Insert sarcasm here.)    Furthermore, this kid has some nerve. His painfully unfunny and pointless rip-off website is online and attracts attention (millions of visitors thanks ONLY to Maddox's cross-link), and he decides to write a BOOK?!     If he kept his website updated, and offered something funny, I could understand it. I mean, Maddox releasing a book? That would be completely understandable, as he was \\"the\\" pioneer of this OTT Internet humor stuff and has been around longer than anyone can seem to remember.    Hamburger is just a kid who thinks he's really funny. He got his book published because his website gets traffic from Maddox's. I'm surprised by the amount of positive reviews here. Simply put, if you think people saying things such as \\"I love ninjas with all of my body (including my pee pee)\\" is funny, you're gonna love this.	2005-01-29
US	35061386	RH30HG6EIZZWV	076455106X	803667008	Guitar For Dummies	Books	3	17	30	N	N	Good reference for experienced players - not beginners!	First of all let me say that by the time I received this book as a gift I had already been playing piano. Musical is very natural for me - as a child I took place in piano \\"contests\\" and concerts and my family (including myself) \\"outgrew\\" our piano teacher and we had to find a more experienced teacher. <br /> <br />However as I grew older I came to resent my new teacher and as a result I lost enthusiasm in piano. I disagreed with her teaching methods and still do - for example she never, ever focused on musical theory, scales, keys, octaves, etc., which is VERY important for experienced players, as it's the foundation of music. Instead she just thought it was important to know how to play notes, but nothing else. If you ask me to play a C Major scale, I won't have a clue what you're talking about. <br /> <br />As a result when I became interested in guitar as a teenager I was lost. Had she taught musical theory I would have adapted well, but nstead I practically had to start from scratch. However I did end up adapting rather well to the basics of playing chords and notes, etc. and I remember my guitar teacher being so impressed he expected to see me \\"on the front of a CD some day.\\" (Well that's enough bragging for me right now I suppose!) <br /> <br />Unfortunately my family moved and I had to give up lessons. So I received GUITAR FOR DUMMIES as a gift and used it as a reference. <br /> <br />But to this day it still baffles me. It's very poorly written and moves too fast. Ironically, considering it's written for \\"dummies,\\" some of the stuff is presented rather complex - they seem to overkill on the simple stuff, and then they'll sort of add a finishing sentence that totally confuses the reader. Example: After explaining what double-stops are for three pages: <br /> <br />\\"So, in conclusion double-stops are easy to play - you might also want to use some arpreggios and remember to play in box.\\" <br /> <br />WHAT?! <br /> <br />Later on they explain what appreggios and boxes are but it would help to know this in advance. Sometimes when I'm reading I think I've missed something because they'll reference something that I haven't seen before. I skim through the earlier pages, then turn to the index and realize that what they're referencing isn't explained for another 100 pages! So why drop a reference in the middle?! <br /> <br />Also, similar to my piano teacher, it teaches NOTHING whatsoever about musical theory. If you are truly interested in learning the fundamentals and basics of guitar, you could do worse - but you could also do a lot better. You will not be an expert guitar player after reading this book. You'll be lucky to come away understanding anything at all, to be frank. <br /> <br />First of all the two authors seem too focused on trying to make their readers laugh rather than teaching us how to actually play. They make (poor) jokes throughout the entire book. Example? On playing with calluses: \\"Like a Supreme Court Justice, you have calluses for LIFE!\\" Har-har. Very amusing analogy (not really), if totally pointless. And that's really how I feel about this whole book. Maybe instead of becoming a guitar teacher/magazine editor, Jon Chapelle should have pursued his (very obvious) true desire - being a comedian.  <br /> <br />Another thing they fail at doing is telling the reader how long to practice before moving on. For example they teach all the basic chords - A, C, D, G, Am, Em, etc. - but never really tell the reader how long to practice before trying to learn Am7, etc. They just move really fast without slowing down and really explaining anything. WHY is it called an Am7? Well according to them because it sounds more \\"funky and bluesy\\" than regular chords. Okay, but why is it actually NAMED an Am7? I understand that it's a \\"moody\\" chord - but what does the addition of the \\"7\\" actually mean? What's the reason behind this? <br /> <br />Also their constant brown-nosing of guitar/musical tradition really grates aftera while. Example: They rename chords/methods because they think the original names are silly or too confusing to remember. This is OK for a beginner as a helpful tool to remember things - but not to totally change stuff just to suit their liking. And their constant digs are grating too - they mention that some people buy entire books containing finger practices, but make snide remarks about these books claiming they're no good and you can just as easily make your own finger exercises. They proceed to include some in their book, which seems sort of hypocritical. <br /> <br />But I'm digressing. My biggest beef is really that I would have appreciated some more musical theory. In addition they focus on playing tabs rather than being able to successfully read notes, which is an important talent for experienced guitarists. <br /> <br />Overall I picked up this book after having had experience with piano and guitar and it still confuses me and I find much of it difficult to follow. And no, I don't consider myself a \\"dummy\\" and I'm sure many of the other people who have given it similarly negative reviews on Amazon aren't, either. Some of the Dummy books are really good - this is not. <br /> <br />This is a good reference point for players with some experience - it has a chord chart and some good stuff you might not learn other places about some of the more basic stuff such as slides, bends, etc. <br /> <br />But for beginners? <br /> <br />I recommend taking lessons, or even searching for free online guitar tutorials. You're likely to gain much more experience - minus the total frustration of this book. <br /> <br />I do not recommend \\"Guitar for Dummies\\" to beginners and only moderately recommend it to the more advanced players out there.	2005-01-04

Maltin is a horrible film critic and a total historian - basically meaning that any film predating 1960 MUST be given 4/4 (unless it's really mediocre which, according to him, is rare). However he didn't hesitate to give BATMAN AND ROBIN 2.5/4 and TAXI DRIVER 2/4.<br />He also gave THE BLADE MASTER, one of the worst films ever created, 0.5/4, yet he's given some truly decent films &quot;turkeys.&quot;<br />I'd rather read a video guide by Ebert because unlike Maltin, Ebert doesn't judge different films of different genres of various years against each other. He's pretty fair. Maltin is not.	2004-07-12

Needless to say I enjoyed reading Ray Atlee's odyssey, well-written by Grisham, with one of those &quot;I can't believe I didn't see it coming&quot; endings. Unlike most mysteries, this one isn't quite as far fetched. It's grounded in reality and a very addictive read.<br />I can't understand the negative reviews.	2004-07-07

Even the font on the pages of the novel is very &quot;homey&quot; and elegant -- reminds you of some sort of writing that would be found in the South...I honestly don't know why.<br />The story is good, a bit dark and sometimes disturbing in narrative but yet it is far from being a horror tale. It's the entire setting of the book (gypsies, murderers, unlikeable characters) that is so &quot;filthy&quot; (you'll understand what I mean when you read it) -- which just goes to show how good of a writer Grisham really is!	2004-07-07

This is an unusual Grisham novel, not his best by any means, not much happens, just some old high school friends thinking back on their &quot;glory days&quot; and Coach Eddie Rake, who taught them all how to play - and win. Unfortunately it seems Grisham didn't consider this manuscript very important and skimmed through it quickly like a reader - the dialogue is often pretty fake but overall if you're out on a beach it'll keep you entertained. I read it in a few hours and I'm glad I did.	2004-07-07
US	35061386	RVY3J22OCIZEK	0802136869	887543792	True Romance: The Screenplay	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Addictive	The single review on Amazon for this screenplay is about three words long and doesn't discuss the merits of the literature AT ALL. I'm starting to think Amazon should place word limit restrictions so reviewers can't submit comments such as, &quot;cul movie!&quot;<br />If you've read my review of Tarantino's PULP FICTION script you'll see that I called it very addictive, and the same is true here, in fact it's more enjoyable to read. I printed it out off of my script website (wiredonmovies.com) and read it rather quickly. The movie itself disappointed me, and seemed like a fanboy's &quot;wet dream&quot; as some have described it. All in all the elements don't quite add up and the film (directed by Tony Scott) has an edge but lacks the humor of Tarantino's edge.<br />The screenplay is a blast, and differs from the film sometimes, especially the end. I imagine Quentin's version of the film (he originally planned on directing it but turned it down for RESERVOIR DOGS and used the money he made off this script to fund that project) would have been superior to Scott's own outcome.	2004-07-07

After this I found Tom Clancy's novels unnecessarily long and sometimes rather boring when he goes into long passages of Military descriptions and technical info. There's fifteen pages in Executive Decision devoted solely to explaining how Jack Ryan is drinking his coffee. That's a bit much, and explains why his novel was over 1200 pages long.<br />However before he went overboard Clancy struck gold with this one. Addictive, sometimes a bit boring but with a killer ending (literally!). Better than the movie. I own all of Clancy's books - this is still my favorite.	2004-07-07

Clancy hasn't written a book this great for a long, long time.

PULP FICTION, the film, is one of my favorites, and I own both the DVD and the screenplay by Quentin Tarantino. Now, as with most things, since Quentin has become ultra-popular, it's suddenly become &quot;cool&quot; to dislike him and his movies (particularly FICTION). Quoting Dave Thomas (SCTV), &quot;Let's get down to the nitty gritty here&quot;: Whether or not you like the film, Quentin DOES have a knack for superb dialogue, and here is proof.<br />Recommended on all levels - one of my hobbies is scriptwriting and this is a definite inspiration as it was written by a man-child who never took a single screenwriting course. He just did it, and that's always been my own strategy when it comes to these things.	2004-07-07

As always they had a limited supply of products, usually shipped over from stores such as Wal-Mart with surplus inventories, etc. Not quite sure. Anyway, needless to say the film was coming out in a few weeks over in the US, and a few months in the UK, so I thought it'd be fun to read the book and see how it fared.<br />It's not the most well-written book in the world. Chances are Stan Redding, who co-wrote the novel with Frank Abagnale, Jr., did most of the typing, and Mr. Abagnale most of the story telling itself. No matter, this is a rather fascinating true tale - something you have to read to believe.<br />Thought the (very good and faithful) movie was a stretch? Check out the book. You'll never believe some of the stuff this kid got away with. I started wondering how much Abagnale actually made up! I suppose none, although he did admit he sometimes stretches the truth of his tales a bit for dramatic effect.<br />Overall, a very interesting memoir of a very interesting man who now lives a very normal life!	2004-06-28

I had sent him an e-mail and explained that I was an Internet critic, and that I had a real interest in film, and his response was very kind and supportive.<br />After reading the book, I think it is a &quot;must-read&quot; for anyone interested in films. Why? Because even if you don't LIKE the movies (I'm sure Ebert doesn't love all of them), these are *the* essential films for film critics, lovers, enthusiasts; whatever. If you really have a serious interest in movies, these are 100 movies that are extremely popular, milestone motion pictures.<br />Ebert later told me that he does not like The Godfather Part II as much as The Godfather. That is probably one of the only movies I'd add to the list, and I couldn't believe he didn't like it very much. But other than perhaps one missing title, the book is great. And if you look online, you can find a bigger list at suntimes.com/ebert--and my favorite comedy of all time, &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles,&quot; is on there, which means the list can't be very bad at all!<br />The Great Movies II is coming out soon, and I'll be first in line to buy it!	2004-05-18

Steve Martin is perhaps my all-time favorite comedian, and he has been for quite some time. He stole that personal rank after I watched his best film, &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles,&quot; a film that also solidified my love for John Candy, and the first comedy of the 80s starring two comedians (not exactly known for great films) that proved to me that sometimes you shouldn't judge a film by its cover.<br />What makes me prefer Steve Martin to someone like Jim Carrey or Chris Farley (who I despise), is that he actually relies on pure humor and old-fashioned comedic talent. But he ALSO does slapstick physical humor very well -- watch him run in &quot;Planes...&quot; and you'll laugh yourself silly!<br />Yes, Martin is also very smart in real life, quite shy and an adamant collector of rare arts. There's a lot of quality and beauty lurking within his soul, and it is all unleashed in &quot;The Pleasure of My Company,&quot; which isn't as laugh-out-loud hilarious as it is touching and uplifting.<br />Daniel Pecan Cambridge is 29, 31, 33, or 35, depending on how he feels on a given day. (His real age is revealed at the closing of the book.) <br />Daniel has obsessive-compulsive disorder, and this novel -- told through a first person narrative -- is essentially Daniel's journal and memoirs, beautifully written by Steve Martin in a simple, elegant, fast, and amazingly smart fashion. (I also noticed that the paragraphs had a space in between them, something not usually done in novels.)<br />Because I missed out on Martin's first novella, &quot;Shopgirl,&quot; I saw &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot; at my local commissary and was eager to read it soon. The book is only 162 pages long (not counting the acknowledgements and so on), and so I read it in about a day -- but it's a very good book.<br />Not quite as rude or laugh-out-loud as one might expect, this is truly a beautiful book that Martin has written. And although he nails obsessive-compulsive disorder perfectly, with the character coming off a bit like Nic Cage's in &quot;Matchstick Men,&quot; he doesn't poke fun -- it's the story of a restrained, lonely man who learns to open up to the world.<br />Beautiful.	2004-01-01

It wasn't. Nothing like the extraordinary film, it's perhaps the ONLY book I've ever read that is WORSE than the film adaptation.<br />Then I found out other people felt the same way as me, and I wondered why I had ever bothered with the novel.<br />Why is it so phenomenally bad? A few things:<br />Brody's wife, Ellen, gets into an affair with Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss in the film) and it's ridiculous. Pointless. It really serves nothing to the plot, and the detail is sickening. In the end, I thought to myself, What did that accomplish? Nothing but 10 - 15 extra pages for Benchley to fill in.<br />Benchley must have been &quot;excited&quot; when he was writing the affair parts. (If you catch my drift.) It was just so pathetically immature of Benchley to include a long passage of pointless eroticism.<br />The entire book was just pretty dumb. Quint is undeveloped, as well as all the characters. It's disturbing, and unlike the film, the so-called &quot;heroes&quot; are not nice at all. I don't think I was rooting for them -- I was rooting for the shark to eat them all!<br />The ending is nothing like the film, either, and it feels anti-climatic. <br />I've read thousands of books and this is perhaps the only one worse than the film adaptation.<br />The movie is far superior.<br />Much like &quot;JAWS,&quot; Benchley's &quot;Shark Trouble&quot; is a bit stupid.

I found MC's new introduction to his earliest breakthrough novel, A CASE OF NEED, quite interesting. He talks about the controversy the book stirred when it came out, and how his pseudonym -- Jeffery Hudson -- was used so that nobody in the medical world would know who wrote it. He never planned to be a writer -- he was in Harvard Medical School at the time and needed cash (so he turned out paperback spy stories about the cold war) -- but when he won an award for the novel, he had to accept it in person and his so-called secret was out.<br />If you enjoyed JURASSIC PARK, SPHERE, RISING SUN, or any of MC's other truly fabulous novels (I've read 'em all along with thousands of other classical and modern works of literature), you'll love this oldie from the late 60s. It's like reading a film noir -- told in first person perspective, it's about a doctor investigating the murder case of a fellow employee of a local hospital who has been arrested for aborting a young girl's unborn child and, in turn, unintentionally killing the girl later, after she suffered blood loss from the operation.<br />But did he really do it? That's the question that our protaganist tries to solve -- and the outcome of it all is so simple, and yet also so stunning. As the final page turns, you'll wonder how you never solved it beforehand.<br />It has its flaws. Michael Crichton's early work shows signs of minor problems he would solve later -- whether it be plot mistakes or simply story flow. Plus, I doubt whether a doctor would turn himself into Sherlock Holmes quite so well as he makes the character in this book.<br />That all doesn't matter, because you'll absolutely love this novel, especially if you're a fan. If you're new to Crichton, I suggest JURASSIC PARK, the first novel of his I read (and which totally took me by surprise). But if you're a fan, or you want a good medical thriller from the creator of ER, check this out. It's one of Crichton's better quick-reads.	2003-12-10

He's almost a socialist leftist - his views on America and conservatives such a George W. Bush is not only wrong and harsh and totally undeserving, but also not worth wasting your time on.<br />His newest book, Dude, Where's My Country?, is more of the same. The world is being run by conservatives -- we need more liberals. Yeah, right. The world is being run by liberals enough already -- Hollywood, the news world, everywhere we look. If Bush had been found cheating in office he would have been kicked out of the White House pronto. But because it was Clinton...never mind, I won't bring up past issues.<br />You can recommend this review or disagree strongly with it. It depends on your outlook on political issues. But if you ask me, Michael Moore needs to take his ego down a step, stop bashing the world and the way it works, open his eyes and realize that conservatives are far away from ruling the world.	2003-12-09

I read hundreds of books every year, ranging from Shakespeare to Hemingway to Stevenson to Lewis, and so on and so forth. <br />And I was also an enormous fan of film. When I first saw &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; in 1993, I said, &quot;I can't imagine a book being any better&quot; -- how could imagining dinosaurs be better than seeing them on screen?<br />So sorting through an old attic of treasures and antiques in downtown Fredericksburg, I came across a battered, weather-beaten old copy of Michael Crichton's &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; boasting &quot;Soon to be a major motion picture!&quot; on the front flap. I figured that, for 25 cents, maybe I'd get a kick out of reading it and comparing the manuscript to its superior film transfer.<br />It blew me away. As much as I enjoy reading Tom Clancy novels, he often digresses into long passages of military dialogue that sorta becomes old. As much as I love reading John Grisham books, and as much as I love his gripping narrative...the stories themselves, I often find, are quite empty.<br />Crichton has everything -- pacing, gripping narrative passages, excellent dialogue, and extremely researched plots. How can a guy ever turn the prospect of live dinosaurs on modern Earth into a realistic novel? Crichton does it because he knows his stuff. Unlike Clancy, he rarely tries to make the reader feel that he knows everything about his field of writing. He simply DOES know everything, and it's evident in his writing. And, unlike Clancy and Grisham, his books all contain bibliographies. He's simply my favorite writer of all time, and I found him through a battered old 25 cent paperback that I still have stuffed in between a bunch of other Crichton novels in my room, too frayed to read. I have since updated to a hardback of the novel, but I still keep the paperback as a reminder.<br />Crichton introduced me to reading as a pleasure, not a chore. Now that I have read basically all his novels, I find his writing one in a million; no other author has ever pulled me in and kept my attention like Crichton. Even with Grisham and Clancy novels, I often find myself taking short breaks for a week or so before I continue reading their novels. <br />Not so with Crichton. I mail-ordered his latest novel, &quot;Prey,&quot; and devoured it in less than two days. He is just that kind of writer.<br />Pathetic things for someone to say who has read classic literature, perhaps? Not really. As much as I admire and respect classic literature and their authors, I'm &quot;classicked out,&quot; so to speak. After reading them in the thousands, my eyes are weary for more pleasurable novels. <br />I've never found a better novel than &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; and I don't think I really ever will. I respect Michael Crichton as both a fellow writer and for the simple fact that he opened my eyes to the sheer pleasure of writing and reading once more. Some may beg to differ, but my best bet for a favorite novel is certainly &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;	2003-12-09
