I had never heard of this author before, but I took a chance and I am so glad I did.  Anyone who has children can sympathize with the main character Anita.  There was never a dull moment in this one.

I enjoyed her last one (Blindsighted) too, but this was even better!  It has a very sad &amp; disturbing plot to it that makes you angry that this could happen to children.  This author is a wonderful story-teller.  I can't wait to read her next book!!  And, by the way, I am not a friend or agent of this author as a previous reviewer suggested about people who give this book a 5-star rating.	2004-02-23

The characters were likeable enough but the story was just so-so.  I didn't find this book suspenseful at all.  And also, the last sentence on the back cover about the killer's \\"bloody agenda\\" targeting Brady's daughter is misleading.  I thought this was a book about someone stalking or trying to kill the girl but it is not like that at all.  If you must read it, pick it up at the library, don't buy it!!	2002-11-02

I almost rated this book 3 stars because I didn't care too much for the main character, Rainie.  But despite that, this book is pretty good.

I was so disappointed when I started reading it.  This book is nothing at all like Survivor.  In fact, this book is more about biological terrorism than reality tv. I know a lot of people gave this book good reviews, but it just wasn't at all what I was expecting.  I don't recommend this one at all.	2002-07-09

I read 100 pages of this book before finally giving up.  There were so many other things going on with the main character, that the real storyline gets lost.  I  was so bored with it that I gave up.	2002-06-22

I really didn't feel sorry for any of these women.  Especially Ellie.  I found her character to be very boring and annoying.  Madame Zoya does not appear until more than halfway through the book.  But all in all, people who like romantic novels will probably like this book.  I liked the way the ending was done. But the rest is just mediocre.  Pick this one up at the library like I did.	2002-06-21

I was expecting more excitement, more drama with this book.  It was disappointing.  The only remotely intersting character was Zack.  This book is more like a Harlequin romance book, very little substance.  I don't recommend it.	2002-06-17

I liked the characters and the story-line but I thought the suspense was lacking until the end of book.  And, having recently lost someone to cancer, I found the Nan/Rupert story-line sad &amp; depressing.  Other than that the book was good.	2002-05-18

I didn't care for the main character, and I found this story so boring that it just didn't matter to me what happened at the end.  The author also uses a lot of medical terms that I didn't understand.  If you're a Robin Cook or Tess Gerritsen fan, then don't bother with this book.	2002-05-18

If not for the way the author chose to end it, I would have given this story 5 stars.  I liked the characters, and I had a hard time putting it down.  It was one of the most gripping medical thrillers I have ever read.  However, I absolutely hated the ending.  I could not wait to find out what happens to the clinic, and what happens to Laura's baby but I was totally let down.  The reason is:  the author chooses not to tell you the answers.  The book just ends.  If you like to be left hanging, then you'll love this book, if you don't, then don't bother reading this one!	2002-05-13

Maybe because I have no interest in wine-making at all, but I've read all of Nora Roberts' books and figured she would make it interesting. I was wrong about that.  But on the plus side, I liked the characters in this book.  And, the story isn't so bad either, but a little on the long side.  I think this would have been better if it had been shorter.	2002-05-05

There are so many characters in this book it is hard to figure out what purpose they have in the story.  And also, I didn't find any of them interesting, even the main character.

There is never a dull moment in this one.  My only complaint is that it ended too soon.  I wish there had been an epilogue at the end.  I can't recommend this one enough!!	2002-03-06

The phone calls from the person who wants to kill her is a small part of the story.  There is very little suspense in this book.  And it is far from scary!!  If you like a book about how women cope with the breakup of a marriage this book is for you, if you want a thrilling, suspenseful book then forget it!  You'll be disappointed.	2002-02-27

I loved the characters and the plot.  I kept turning the pages to see how far Jane would go with this game.  Highly recommended.	2002-02-24

What a stupid book this was!  The characters were boring, the dialogue was hokey with words like &quot;yonder&quot; and &quot;ye&quot;.  And the title does not fit the book.  There is no revenge.  It's just about a woman who goes back to her hick home town to defend her brother.  This book is a waste of time!	2002-02-16

This book started off good, the first 2 or 3 chapters were great, and then I don't know what happened.  The only suspense in this entire book is in those first chapters.  Don't bother with this one!

This one was a typical D.S. book but I didn't think it was all that bad.  I didn't care for Meredith or Cal,  but I liked Steve.  I was not expecting what happened to Steve at the end,  that was a little bit of a surprise.  You don't get many of those in Ms.  Steel's books. I liked this one better than Bittersweet and The Ranch.  Not  a total waste of time.	2000-05-10

There was very little suspense (the last 15 pages or so were good, but that's about it), and with the exception of Maggie, these characters were boring.  Most of this story takes place in  or centers around a nursing home.  I found this book boring and depressing.   Don't bother with this one.	2000-04-20

I've just started reading MHC books, and I was a little disappointed with this one.  I wasn't particularly crazy about any of these characters, and the story was rather  boring at times.  One good thing I will say about it is I did not know who  the killer was until the end.	2000-04-10

I have read all her books (except Chances Are because it's out of print), and they are all fantastic.  This one was no exception.  You feel as if you actually know  these characters.  It's a fast-paced story with a lot of plot twists.  You  will not be disappointed with this one.  I can't wait for the next book  from Erica Spindler.	2000-04-05

In fact at times (in the middle of the story) it was pretty dull, but it made me feel sorry for this poor little girl, and I wanted to finish it to see how or if she would  ever get out of the woods.  I might have enjoyed it more if I was a  baseball fan, but I'm not.  But, all in all it wasn't bad.	2000-03-20

You can't compare this book with Watchers, simply because Watchers is a great book, and this one is awful!!  Very wordy, too much detail (as usual), I could not get into this book.  No more Dean Koontz books for me.	1999-02-04
