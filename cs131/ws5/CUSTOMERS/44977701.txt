Books	5	45	50	N	N	DeStressing lready	An excellent book! <br />Dr. Colbert walks a fine line in this book - he empathizes with his patients' and readers' stresses in the modern world, yet shows them ways their own thought patterns can contribute to the stress and ways that changing their thoughts and behaviors can reduce the stress, while not telling them, \\"It's all in your head.\\"   <br />He walks this line with finess. <br />His suggestions for reducing stress are practical and easy to understand, and they work!  I've tried some already, and can affirm that they have helped. <br />Some of parts I found most helpful included the ways that people with \\"passive\\" or \\"aggressive\\" personalities can become \\"assertive\\" without being obnoxious, ways to lighten worry, and the importance of setting aside grudges.  The exercise and diet tips were also helpful, as was the study of adrenal fatigue. <br />I also liked the stories of Biblical figures (especially Abraham) from the perspective of their worry and stress - it's a fascinating, fresh and sometimes humorous way to look at the familiar stories. <br />Also, this book was from a Christian perspective, but I really appreciated the lack of the right-wing extremist politics that dominate so much of Christian literature today.  The lessons in this book appeared caring, nonjudgmental and open to everyone, regardless of his or her political bent.   <br />Stress is something we all face, and I would recommend this book as a way to help cut it down to a manageable size.   <br />For more on reducing stress and time management, I would recommend Margin and Overload by Dr. Richard Swenson.	2005-06-30

Even Jesus Christ forgave sinners and said, \\"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\\" but Dobson apparently feels he is above this attitude.  I think this book will turn away potential Christians, and gives an ugly, mean and judgmental look at Christianity.  Plus, quite frankly, the writing style and ability is surprisingly poor for a published book.	2005-06-26

The sad part is, it could have been an interesting story, if the author had stuck with Teresa's point of view and explored her thoughts, feelings, actions, and allowed the reader to become immersed in her life.  But instead he insists on jumping back and forth between Teresa and a reporter (who is deadly boring and self-important) telling Teresa's story, which made it impossible to keep any connection with the story, the events or the characters. <br />Don't waste your money on this one.	2005-06-18

Her characters are like the people next door - but she sees them in a special, deep, sympathetic light - and makes them shine. <br /> <br />Her stories are funny and heartbreaking, all at once. <br /> <br />I have read this over and over, and could not put it down.  I enjoyed all of it, but my favorite chapters are about Nancy, Dee, Kev, Rupert, and Tom.

Okay... <br />The biggest problem with the ideas in this book is that I don't think most of them work in real life.  According to Dr. Schlessinger, a woman is supposed to make her husband and her marriage her main priority, and knock herself out twisting into what he wants to please him, but I would think a man would get bored with this after the first glow wears off. <br />I think literature and fiction give a much better view of relationships.   <br />In the book The Memoirs of Cleopatra, one of the most passionate love affairs in history is documented - the love of Cleopatra and Julius Caesar. In this book, Cleopatra is depicted as a passionate woman, a brilliant and caring queen who works hard for her country and people, a loving mother, and a political genuis.  She meets Caesar as an equal, gives him political advice, (at first he gets angry, but when he calms down, he admits she has a streak of political genuis, and goes wiht some of her advice, although not all\\"), presents herself as a strong person and queen, and is not in any way subordinate to Caesar.  He remains attracted to her, enchanted, and says a reason for his attraction is that they are both gamblers, both strong, and there is an immediate and lasting connection between them.  She doesn't have to hide herself or pretend anything to avoid \\"emasculating\\" him - her strength and power and personality makes him stronger. <br />I think when a woman is fully herself, no acting, pretending or changing necessary, she will attract the man who is meant for her, and their marriage will flourish.	2004-10-25

While the setting is intriguing and her warmth is there, the characters are boring and one-dimensional, and the story is so plodding and predictable it is unbelievable - I kept reading it, expecting one of the famous Binchy twists, but it never came.  I kept wondering where her startling insights into characters had gone - these were stock characters, with none of the unique and human foibles that make most of her characters so memorable and alive. <br />If you are not a Binchy fan, please don't judge her books by this one - read London Transports, Next Year It Will Be Different, Circle of Friends, Dublin Tales, etc.  Those are all wonderful, and show why she is so beloved by readers.	2004-10-12

Although it is more than 900 pages, it never fails to capture the excitement of the struggle between Rome and Egypt, the west and the ancient world of the east, and the political geniuses who battle for expansion and control of their world. <br />Finally, the character portrayals are marvelous.  Cleopatra is beautifully and sympathetically drawn - her pride, strength and scheming even when confronted with hopeless situations, her shrewd wisdom as a politician, her love of Egypt, her children and her friends, her turbulent and passionate love affairs with Caesar and Marc Antony, and finally, her pride and courage in her final act are spectacular, making her admirable, almost larger than life, even while her flaws are apparent.  Caesar is likewise shown as a brilliant general, a larger than life man and a great lover, yet his vulnerabilities are shown, too, especially his weaknesses and misjudgments as a politician.  His love affair with Cleopatra is touching and moving.  Marc Antony is well drawn - he is shown as being honorable, admirable, a wonderful father and lover, but with a tragic flaw - he is a weak man who falls under the control of whoever is around him who is stronger - including Octavian and Cleopatra.   <br />I would strongly recommend this book to anyone.  It is a book to be read and reread. <br /> <br />	2004-10-10

There is nothing you have to change to \\"attract\\" him - it just means he's \\"not that into you,\\" not right for you, and you should stop wasting time trying to twist the relationship into working and move on to find someone who is right. <br />Simple advice, right?  But in the hodge podge of relationship advice and changing sex roles, common sense and self-respect have gotten lost, and this book brings it back. <br />Men are not frail, shy, helpless, confused creatures - if a man wants something, he'll go for it - and if he's not going for it, he doesn't want it. <br />Every lady in the dating world should read this - its a long-needed shot in the arm of a healthy dose of self-respect - the best medicine.	2004-09-24
US	44977701	R34ONUED4BFXHH	0312194390	627904901	The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes by His Fool, Will Somers: A Novel	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Superb!!!	Usually when a book is this long, I have a nagging feeling that an editing hand would have made it better, (see The Crimson Petal and the White) but not this book!!  It is gripping, spectacular and superb!  I stayed up several nights to read it, and I could barely put it down.  This book is written from the perspective of Henry VIII - and it makes him more human, more sympathetic, yet more chilling, all at once.  He appears to be a smart man, a strong leader, charismatic, and a wise king - but he had a strange childhood of neglect and disfavor by his selfish parents, suddenly interrupted when his brother died and he became king, and was thrust into a world where there were no limits, no brakes upon his conscience, or his power.  This odd combination led to a man who, despite his strengths, was  in his personal life like a big, dangerous child - when he got tired of wives or friends, he killed them.  Yet the final results of his rule, including the introduction of new ways of viewing religion into England, a breaking up of the old, stale social systems, and the brilliant Queen Elizabeth, were all positive.    This book, fascinatingly written from the perspective of Henry VIII with notes from his very wise fool, Will Summers, explores these contraditions in a clever and attention-catching way.  The notes by Will add a fresh perspective and balance to the book.  Also, the book touches the personality of his wives and shows them as real, flawed humans, the good Queen Katherine, who nevertheless allowed her extreme piety to blind her to her husband's needs, the scheming, shrill Anne Boleyn, the quiet and beloved Jane, the ugly but kind and humerous Anne of Cleves, the (...) Katherine Howard, and finally, the wise Katherine Parr.    All of these characters, as well as the mood of the times, of the diverse English people, the war ridden Europe and the superstitions and religious ferver of the age all come alive in this brilliant book.	2004-09-18

There is a strong underlying ethical dilemma in the deliberate production of a human being for this purpose, and this book deals with it in an interesting way. <br />For the genetically engineered daughter is also a human being, a fact that her family seems to overlook until she sues her parents for the right to stop donating body parts to her dying sister.  The dilemma of the daughter, who feels guilty, scared, and defiant, the parents, impossibly torn between the lives and well-being of two children, the brother (the other overlooked child of the family) and the more distant relatives makes a fascinating study. Also, the struggle and suffering of the family was poignant - I was especially moved by the hospital dance.  <br />Also, the lawyer in the trial struggles with a disability of his own, shown by the poignant yet humerous example of his service dog and others' insensitive reactions to it.  \\"Here's the Braille menu.\\"  \\"You don't look blind.\\"  His ability to face his condition, at the end, added a special touch to the book. <br />So why three stars? <br />Well, first, the ending.  I understood the symbolism in it ***WARNING, SPOILER AHEAD***, (the daughter designed to sacrifice body parts to the other daughter makes the ultimate sacrifice) yet it just didn't work here.  Especially the bit about the sick daughter suddenly becoming \\"all better\\", the father's brief drinking problem, the problem brother becoming a policeman, etc - I found myself just muttering \\"sure, sure\\".  Also, as other reviewers have said, it felt like a teary \\"movie of the week\\" cop out to avoid addressing the real issues. <br />Second, this book was full of filler.  Brian, the father, was a likeable character, but he yammered on so much aboutthe stars, fires, etc, that I soon ended up automatically skimming the parts where he was the narrator.  The \\"moving lines\\" at the end of each section were overdone and tedious.  Finally, the romance between Julia and the lawyer was boring, overdone and detracted from the main theme of the book.  I wanted to know more about Anna and her feelings - not factoids about astronomy, or some woman who let a long-ago high school crush dictate her life.  There was too much distraction in the book, and not enough of the real story.  For this reason, it was hard to really relate to Anna - she seemed distant, cold, a bit cruel, and half-drawn in the story. <br />In conclusion, this was a good book, and wiht a lot of editing and tightening of the story, it could have been great.	2004-09-18

Instead,to my astonishment, I found myself agreeing with almost all (emphasizing almost) of what Buchanan said!  And my agreement continued when I read it more closely. <br />He is absolutely right about the outsourcing and NAFTA.  Our economy is shifting to a low-paying service economy, and is losing our strong middle class and manufacturing and producing base.  This is disasterous for our future.  Bush, in cutting taxes for the rich (ie, striving to eliminate dividend and inheritance taxes) is relying on the middle class to carry the tax burden of his expensive wars, etc, but he ignores the fact that soon, with the jobs, the middle class will be gone - and low paid service industry workers cannot meet the huge deficit tax burdens Bush's war has placed upon our country.  The only growing profession in our country is the medical field - but a country not producing, just treating the sick, cannot thrive.  <br />He is also correct about the war in Iraq - we are now in a quagmire we will not escape in our lifetimes, and we went into it based upon lies.  We have wasted valuable resources in this war, which we will not have to fight the real terrorists - the still growing Al-Quaida.  Our allies see us as arrogant fools, and will be slow to help us if terrorists attack again.  We are less safe now than we were before the war in Iraq, since it depleted resources that should be used to defend us against terrorists.   <br />I also agree that we should not be supporting Israel, or allowing the Jewish lobby to dictate our foreign policies. <br />Obviously, I did not agree with his recommendation of Bush over Kerry, hence the four stars.  Another four years of Bush would be ruinous for our country. <br />	2004-09-12

Sue Miller has a beautiful, subtle, understated writing style, and I found her portrayal of Georgia's life fascinating - a turn-of-the-century girl exhausting herself caring for her relatives, a doctor who deliberately exagerates her TB diagnoses her to put her in a sanitorium to get her away from that life, her love in the sanitorium and her marriage to the much older doctor, etc.  But the book kept jumping bath to Cath, a fifty something modern divorcee who was incredibly whiny and boring.  I wish the book had been solely about Georgia, and explored the themes of Georgia's life in depth - it would have been a masterpiece. <br />As it was, it got pretty confusing, and the parts about Cath were mind-numbing.	2004-08-15
US	44977701	R3KIPVZLFDUCI2	0399151842	49815623	Amagansett	Books	5	26	28	N	N	Beautifully Written First Novel	I walked into Barnes and Noble and requested a book I saw reviewed in People.  It sounded fascinating, but it had a strange name I couldn't remember or pronounce.  The bookseller said several people had asked for it, but nobody could remember the title, a \\"wierd Indian name,\\" as she stated.  Luckily, People magazine was there, and we figured it out from that.  I'm glad I persevered - it is a beautifully written debut novel.  It centers around the murder of a young, beautiful high society woman, Lillian Wallace, whose body was found by shell-shocked veteran and fisherman Conrad Labarde.  As detective Tom Hollis delves into the mystery, he discovers a web of deceit involving the highest society on Long island, which ensnares members of two groups at conflict with each other, the fishermen and the high society, and resurrects lies going back years before to an unsolved murder of a young girl.  Each intricate discovery brings a new surprise, and the climax is chilling and satisfying.  The author also skillfully weaves in the mood and events of the times; prohibition, World War II and the crumbling of the classes.  The characters are wonderfully drawn, and both the detective Hollis and the fisherman Conrad are sympathetically and intriguingly portrayed as Conrad draws Hollis into the mystery and uses Hollis' skills to achieve a brilliant resolution.  The lingering effects of war upon a veteran are senstively shown. Finally, the cross-class romance is believable since it contains none of the usual tired stereotypes, but instead is an honest love between two people struggling with their pasts.  This is a mystery far above the norm, and I would strongly recommend it.  I look forward to Mark Mills' next book.	2004-08-15

It was stunning. It showed the mind, growth and development of an artist, and how things - feeling like an \\"oddball\\" in school, the death of an acquaintance, hurts in love, an unusual childhood - can affect an artist deeply, and at the same time contribute to her art.   I also loved the 1940s flavor of the book - everybody smoked like fiends, wore fur, even the children drank, and her piano teacher had a live in valet. Her books all have such an east coast/European intellectual artist feel - its like entering a different world. You could never imagine a L'Engle character, even one in the 2000s, watching \\"Outback Jack\\", going on the Adkins diet, or shopping at WalMart.   Also, L'Engle's minor characters were fascinating - I wanted to know more about Julie Forrester - she seemed just out of reach, and very mysterious. Everyone seemed to admire her, despite her glaring flaws, and she enriched the others' lives in a strange, indescribable way.  L'Engle's talent is unbelievable.  I strongly recommend this book.	2004-08-07

Yes, at first she is sympathetic - a girl who loves the land, but will be ousted by her spoiled brother and the entail system.  But the killing of her father and her lack of real remorse, then the crippling of her lover, the incest with her brother, etc, were sickening.  However, when she meets Dr. MacAlden and enjoys true love, I was still hoping for her redemption, and that would have made a wonderful story - if she had redeemed herself, become a better person through this man, and then she and the doctor would have faced together the consequences of her earlier evil.  However, she goes on to commit evil after evil, and I started skimming the book after awhile and just read the end, where I was glad to see she got what she deserved.   <br />Don't bother with this book - read the two I mentioned above instead.	2004-08-01
US	44977701	R2DC64MJOGCN4B	0743246071	237333289	The Queen's Fool	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Spectacular	I couldn't put this book down; it is incredible.<br /><br /> The story follows two fascinating lines of development; the turbulent times in England following the death of Henry VIII, and the growth and development of the heroine Hannah Verde, a young secretly Jewish girl who is endowed with the &quot;sight.&quot;<br /><br /> The famous characters of the time are portrayed in unique ways through the perspective of Hannah - the devastatingly handsome and charming rake Robert Dudley, &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; Tudor, who is portrayed as a good, sympathetic character who becomes unhinged and does horrendous things due to her precarious position, the constant threats to her throne, her childhood suffering and her husband's conduct. (And in the end, her legacy is to have a nasty-tasting cocktail named after her!) Elizabeth is portrayed as a young character who is charming, intelligent, confident, something of a slut (Hannah sees her in a vision as &quot;the virgin queen who is not a virgin&quot;), flawed, frightened at times, and very clever. She is not as good a person as Mary, but her common sense sympathy with her people make her, in the end, a much better queen. Even minor characters such as Amy Dudley are well portrayed, as Hannah foresees a glimpse of her bitter end.<br /><br /> Hannah herself is fascinating. She begins as a young, uncertain, frightened child with horrible memories of her mother's death and a girlish crush on Dudley. The book shows how she grows and develops in the royal court, and keeps her innate goodness even as other characters crumble. Through the book she develops and matures, and in the end she triumphs: her rather obtuse betrothed learns that he must treat her with respect, and she turns down Robert Dudley's proposition in order to be a good wife.<br /><br /> This book is an exciting, unique, fresh look at history, and one of the best books I have read.	2004-07-23

A wonderful book!!!<BR>I have been following the basic ideas in this book regarding diet, exercise, focusing on vegetables, fiber, and ways to classify foods (I admit I haven't had a chance to try the actual recipes, not being much of a cook, but when I read them they seem manageable, and I intend to try some soon.)  I have already lost five pounds in half of a month - without feeling hungry or cranky.  Even if you're a microwave meals in minutes type, the basic ideas in this book can work. In accord with the author's suggestions, I just substitute soy burgers for hamburgers, nonfat or soy cheese for regular cheese, bean burritos for regular, up the veggies and fruits and cut down on the desserts - and it is pretty much painless.<BR>I strongly recommend this book, and it seems much better than the wacko diet of the week books that seem to be dominating the market.  And you can't argue with results - the examples of the Okinawan centurians are inspirational, and show that with proper diet, exercise and attitude, old age can be an enjoyable and healthy part of life - disability and sickness are not inevitable.<BR>I would also recommend the companion book, The Okinawa Program.

It started out with an intriguing scene, in which it was unclear if Snow had been murdered or committed suicide, then continued through the investigation.  Snow was well portrayed - a man who alienated friends and family through his demands for perfection, and whose demands on himself were so great they actually caused him to have seizures.  However, the book never really gripped me the way Ablow's prior book, Psychopath, did.  This book felt scattered, awfully slow at times, and I had a hard time making sense out of the key characters' actions or beliefs. Snow's decision to escape his life never quite rang true, somehow. This book did not have the original look inside the killer's mind which made Psychopath so exceptional.  Also, the ending felt contrived.  I did not get any sense of chemistry between Clevenger and Whitney this time, and the travel and scenery, which were excellent in Psychopath, were not well portrayed here.  I look forward to Ablow's next book, and hope it is better than this one.	2004-06-27

Frank Clevenger, a forensic pathologist, is on the trail of a strange and unique psychotic killer.  Meanwhile, Clevenger struggles with a blossoming romance (with a blonde, slim, beautiful FBI agent, of course - no hero could possibly fall in love with a woman of average weight.), and a troubled stepson, which both add to the tension.  The best part of the story involves the trips inside the killer's mind - unique and utterly chilling, and at times the killer was almost sympathetic, which made the book even more creepy.  I could not put this down and eagerly look forward to Ablow's next book (which I already bought in hardback.)  My only complaint is the title - I felt this book should have been called something else.  The title feels like a rip-off of Hitchcock, and detracted from the merits of the book.	2004-06-25

Then it went downhill.  There were too many plots, subplots and characters - it was hard to keep it all straight.  Lana and Doug were interesting, but I could not sense any chemistry between them - their romance seemed contrived and fake.  Callie and Jake fared better, and their dialogue was really sharp and fun (and I liked it that Callie had her faults - it made her more human), but Suzanne was just plain weird, and the mystery was a disappointment - there was no clue about the murderer until the last pages.  Also, it was tiring to wade through the clutter of characters and plots - I found myself skimming parts of the book.  I think cutting out the Lana/Doug romance (keeping the characters - I liked them, and maybe hitching Lana with someone totally unlikely, like Digger, for comic relief), and cutting out some of the extraneous characters and plots, and strengthening the mystery, would have made it a much stronger book.	2004-06-23

This book felt awfully slow - the characters were predictable and frankly not that interesting, the murderer turned otu to be an outsider who was not even introduced into the book until near the end, and there was nothing unexpected or even particularly interesting about the romance.  The secondary characters were not especially original, but seemed completely like stereotypes.  I would not recommend this book even as a beach read.	2004-06-06

It is a quiet mystery - no car chases, captures, narrow escapes, etc, but the writing is beautiful and lyrical, and the mystery is powerful - the author deftly weaves the horrible events from Graves' childhood with the mystery he is exploring, and fills the book with intriguing suspects, twists and turns, and surprises.  Underneath this is a powerful thread - Graves' guilt, which both destroyed his life and allowed his success as a writer, and the horrors of the Nazis, which crept into the quiet world of Ravenwood.  ***WARNING - SPOILER AHEAD***  Graves tears at the reader's heart - he was a good, hardworking teenager who was confronted with horrors that were too large for him to handle and made a choice based upon these, but he cannot see that as a teenager he was not to blame for the choices, and should not carry a lifetime of guilt for them.  At first I was very angry about the ending, but when I reread it carefully I realized I misunderstood it, and the ending is actually perfect - a chance for Graves' redemption and forgiveness.  Overall, this book is dark and very moving.	2004-05-24

Her stories are tied together by the violence of the crimes, but distinct in the different locations, personalities and lifestyles of the victims, and motives of the killers.  The investigations into the crimes are explored in meticulous detail.  One of my favorite aspects of the book was her very sympathetic, detailed, respectful and personal portrayal of each victim - with a few deft strokes she showed each one as a real, unique person, not just another blood and guts image on the screen. This, in turn, showed the loss society suffers every time a crime of this nature occurs.  Interestingly, the opening and title story of this book was not as good as some of the later ones - so if you don't care for the first story - keep reading. It's worth it.	2004-05-14

Frankly, I think he may have been guilty.  He clearly is a user - he married Deborah in large part because he was impressed with her earnings and achievements, and then he expected her to transform herself to suit him - ie, he valued neatness, order and schedules, so she was a bad person because she did not.  Clearly, her fall from confidence and sanity during the marriage had something to do with having a husband who conveyed that she was not ok as is, but needed to change to meet his standards to be acceptable to receive his love.  He was an adulterer who used both Deborah and Celeste, and seemed more concerned about his own feelings and problems than any danger to his children.  Which makes me wonder, like other reviewers, if he didn't set Deborah up for a fall because he was tired of being married to her, especially based upon his reaction at the time of the fire.  Also, all the emphasis on handsome v. ugly bugged me, since I didn't think Mike was handsome, on the inside or the out.<BR>It would be fascinating to know the real story - which I feel is still hidden beneath the facts in the book.	2004-05-13

The part about the sister battling cancer and her families' reaction was interesting, especially the reactions to the various doctors and hospitals - but even that - especially about the alcoholic father, was formulaic.  The part about Hollywood, the letters to the boyfriend, etc, were just plain boring.  I ended up skimming much of the book, and was not moved, even at the ending.  What is going on with literature lately - poor writing and emotionally manipulative books seem to get this incredible publicity.	2004-03-28

This book was just plain boring.  There was a lot of supposedly \\"witty repartee\\" by Vic's family and friends that had nothing to do with the story and appeared to be in there just to show how cute they all were - I found myself starting to skim every conversation in the book.  The \\"quirky\\" characters came across as demented and strange, and I got tired of all the emphasis on how beautiful Vic and Chris and various others were - I think this was supposed to be some political statement that not all lesbians are masculine and ugly, but she kept making this point over and over, and it got tiresome.  Vic made more long, tedious speeches than a politician, and at times the book felt more like a lecture than a story, with some sex scenes thrown in that were also surprisingly dull, given how steamy they were - in fact, very little seemed to happen.<BR>If this is your first Rita Mae Brown book, don't judge them all by this - the Mrs. Murphy series is a million times better.	2004-03-17

As always, Tucker, Mrs. Murphy and Pewter are a riot - and in this book, we see much more of Simon the Opposum, who is another lovable character.  This book has some rather grisly humor (I won't give away more) that really perked it up - as well as interesting interactions between the various humans.  In these earlier books, Miranda is really a character, and she is a lot of fun that way (Brown tones her down a little too much in the later books).  I would highly recommend this book - especially to pet lovers everywhere.	2004-03-13

His accomplishment of losing 171 pounds is impressive and lends credence to his advice, and the advice is sane, sensible and solid (eat less, move more, etc).  I loved his very positive attitude about the whole weight loss game, and found it inspirational that he had this attitude both when he was at his higher weights, with a long way to go, and when he was nearing his goal and only losing a small amount each month. I have some weight to lose, and have found adopting his positive, enthusiastic attitude about weight loss has helped me &quot;stick with it&quot; rather than the beating myself up which I formerly did, which formerly caused me to get discouraged and quit. Some of his best advice involved maintaining a positive attitude, everything in moderation, the importance of exercise,and the importance of natural foods and sensible eating rather than starvation  or crash diets, pills or surgery.  Most importantly, he urged people to realize they are in control of their weight and health - I know with weight, its always easy for me to tell myself I can't control what I eat when I'm stressed, pressed for time, under pressure, traveling, (wearing green, under a full moon, etc, etc, etc),  but his book showed what nonsense this is!<BR>Go Hunk!!!	2004-03-04

This book is an excellent mystery in Crozet as members of Harry's class are mysteriously murdered - and Harry may be next!  The author's grasp of human nature is dead on here - and her grasp of animal nature can't be beat.  Mrs. Murphy, Pewter and Tucker, who talk to each other and can understand humans, but cannot be understood by them, are hilarious.  The animals' personalities really come forth in this book, which triples the fun.  This is a delightful, original mystery which I would recommend to anyone, and I look forward eagerly to reading her other Mrs. Murphy books.	2004-02-08

Once the murderer is revealed, it becomes dull, since we know the ending.  Plus, the kinky sex scenes with the art dealer are embarrassing, juvenile, and actually got boring after awhile, since they seemed to have nothing to do with the book. I would not recommend this book.	2003-12-31

The story is obvious, and Laurant and Nick are cardboard characters.  They have no chemistry, yet we're supposed to believe there's this love between them that they have to fight to resist.  Plus, the use of cliches is distracting - at one point, she stated Nick &quot;had the body of a Greek god&quot; and a few minutes later when Laurant tried to seduce him, Nick &quot;looked like a deer caught in the headlights.&quot;  For some reason, I kept picturing a Greek god caught in the headlights. And the humor with the old ladies fell awfully flat.  I heard her historical romances are better, so maybe I'll try that.  And the FBI in this book seemed awfully unprofessional.Finally, the &quot;false suspects&quot; - the property buyer who was foaming with rage and the kid who flattened the tires, were so obviously false as suspects they seemed ludicrous.	2003-12-22

It always amazed me that so many people in a country like ours, with the latest medical technology, are so sickly and have so many ongoing, chronic health problems.  Well, this book gives the answers.  In an easy to understand style, it emphasizes the importance of healthy eating (less meat, avoiding fad diets), exercise, and inner peace.  I especially liked the part about the strong yet easygoing personalities of the centurians, and how their spirituality contributed to their long lives.  It made me realize how totally screwed up our lives are, despite the latest technological advances, and how much we need to slow things down, learn to relax, and rely on discipline and our own power rather than neglecting our health and then relying on advanced medicine to fix it.  It was refreshing to learn that the health problems of old age are not inevitable - we can combat them, and live long and happy lives.  I would recommend this book to everyone.	2003-12-05

Its fun how Kellerman's books are \\"so LA\\" - anyone who doesn't wear designer clothing and drive a beamer is presumed guilty of something. My only three complaints are these - the Arab-bashing was racist and completely out of line and unconnected with the story, Robin is gone but replaced by an equally boring new girlfriend (Kellerman is so good at creating interesting characters - why can't Alex have a girlfriend with a personality) and I was disappointed at the revelation regarding Eric at the end.  I was hoping he was just a man with a quirky personalty, who would make a fun \\"foil\\" for Petra in future books.  The revelation of his suffering kind of spoiled that.  But overall I would recommend this book.	2003-11-29

It shows marriage as a place where there is no security, no understanding, no grace, no forgiveness, no leniency, and more work than two full time jobs.  The part about living on the husband's salary and the wife using hers for spending money is ridiculous, in this day and age - parties to a marriage are supposed to be a team, working together for the good of the marriage and family, but this system puts them in a parent/child position.  Also, its ridiculous to ask people to give up activities they may enjoy alone or with friends, and only do things together - that would be stifling, and I think would lead to tremendous resentment, and a feeling of relief if the marriage failed.  Finally, I think all the emphasis on looks is shallow - everyone grows old, and no woman wants to live in fear that she will be left if she doesn't watch her appearance with an eagle eye.  I can't believe this book claimed to be Christian.	2003-09-29

The concept is intriguing - a chameleon-like man who changes identities to match the women he marries, preys upon their weaknesses, and changes their lives.  The portrays of the women were fascinating, well-drawn and sympathetic - I really rooted for Birdie in the beginning, hoping she would recover from Ken and move on, and then felt increasingly sad and frustrated when it became clear she would not recover.  Joan, the second wife, became ill and never had the chance to recover, and finally Dinah, the third wife, made the triumphant recovery.  The weakness of the book was Ken - why on earth were these women so lovestruck with a man who was a bad lover, no companion, had horrible table manners, uninteresting, a liar...Birdie I could understand, but Joan's obsession just didn't quite work, and Dinah's just seemed unbelievable - she was almost contemptuous of him throughout the marriage, but she stayed, and stayed, and stayed.  And finally, I felt the ending was weak because it made him too one-dimensionally evil - even destroying his business success.  He would have been more interesting had he been shown as more of a person and less of a caricature.	2003-09-18

Realizing that her husband and children are taking her for granted and walking all over her, Delia simply walks out of their lives and hers, and begins anew.  That is probably everyone's favorite fantasy, but few people have the guts to actually act upon it.  Delia does, and the austerity and aloneness of her new life give her time to mature, get to know herself, and relax, away from the frenetic demands and expectations of others.  But then she begins to seek out relationships, and finds her new life becoming more and more like her old one.  Eventually she returns to her old life with a new appreciation of its benefits, and, significantly, the others and especially her husband now seem to appreciate and respect her as well.  Finally, there is a touching sub-story about an old man, Nat, who tries to redo his past by fathering a child in his 70s, and realizes the past can never be redone and in trying he has made a horrible mistake.  Beneath the flippancy of the story, there are many powerful themes to this book, and it is worth the read.	2003-09-02

The author skillfully creates an atmosphere of trepidation, gloom and a foretelling of disaster on the ship - while maintaining historical accuracy about life on the ship, in Ireland, in England, in prison, in the New York harbor, and in a myriad of other settings, which he must have researched with meticulous care to create such believable scenes.  He creates characters that are fascinating and flawed and devious, twisting them in the reader's mind so the reader moves from sympathy to dislike or understanding or liking or revulsion in minutes.  Then he throws in one character who is so good and honest it is breathtaking.  He shows so many people broken by circumstance, and one character who rises above it.  This is a masterpiece.	2003-08-21

Ann, the main character, was witty, funny, realistic and vulnerable, and the other characters of Bea, Roger, Father Stevens, Kevin, etc, were well-drawn, likeable and intriguing.  Throughout the book, the suspense rose, the humor continued, fascinating bits of history were brought in, and an intriguing conflict between the various characters' Christianity and atheism was introduced and well tied in with the conflict between Christianity and ancient religions in the house.  A storm lead to an exciting climax.  Then...thud.  The ending was a complete let down; it was as if the author got tired of the story or ran into a deadline and just plunked it down.  I enjoyed the rest of the book so much that the ending was quite a disappointment and I almost felt cheated.  I look forward to reading other books by this author, and I hope in those the endings match the quality of the stories.	2003-02-03

It's a little hard to get into at first due to the fact that the author uses authentic language of the times, but once the reader becomes used to the language, it is dark, yet moving.  The character of Bartholomew Roberts is richly drawn - his brutality, his struggles as captain, his personal struggles, his loneliness, his motives - he is like a hero of mythology - tragically flawed, yet great and above most men.  It was a book I read several times.  The brutality of the slave trade and the times, and the startling lapses into kindness, are well drawn, and keep the reader alert.  The author explores rich emotions in response to circumstances.  He has also very carefully researched the history, adding authenticity.  I would highly recommend this book.  My only complaint is that there is way too much spitting in the story!	2002-08-16
