It is very intriguing from the get go as one learns the outcome of the novel first and then the story develops afterwards. The protagonist Juan is a reclusive painter striving for acknowledgement. Maria becomes an obsession since she is the only one who can understand his work. His passion, obsession and desesperation leads him to kill Maria and gives the readers insight to his \\"tunel\\" (his torchered inner soul).  <br /> <br />The only other novel that I read along these lines in terms of uniqueness of plot and intrigue was L'entranger by Albert Camus. Definitely they are both one of kind novels. A recommended read.	2005-05-22

Que Nada Le Cuesta: Repertorio de Errores Comunes en el Espanol de Puerto Rico	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Tremendous research on PR  Spanish	I could only imagine the type of fieldwork and research involved in putting together such a thorough, accurate and detailed resource about Puerto Rican Spanish. I always hoped to ascertain a reference that is as specific meaning Spanish spoken by a particular group (socio linguistics) since the Spanish language is so diverse. I stumbled across this book in Latin bookstore and have been analyzing it chapter by chapter to appreciate the depth that it offers.    To be able to benefit from Digalo bien and even possibly auto correct your own Spanish you must keep in mind it is NOT a grammar book. So don't expect grammatical explanations to concepts covered. The book is broken down thematically. Meaning it covers errors in Puerto Rican Spanish as it relates to lexicology, morphology, syntax, etc.    One aspect that was immediately evident is that the errors referenced are common in Caribbean Spanish in general (this includes Cuba and the Dominican Republic) as well in many other Spanish-speaking countries. There is historical context behind this linguistic phenomenon as well.     The book reveals many anglicisms and false cognates in Puerto Rican Spanish and how the meaning differs in one language to another. I also found the section on incorrect verb usage extremely helpful and accurate in which an answer to an age hold question about a phenomenon common in Spanish speakers regardless of educational levels was answered. As well great detail was provided about the incorrect usage of words like \\"de\\" and \\"que\\" very common among Spanish speakers.     The last few chapters cover basic overall observations, not category specific for example vocabulary in Spanish that tends to confuse speakers and its incorrect usage, nationality in Spanish (but of the city. For example someone from Arecibo is \\"arecibeno\\") and also there is a mini test at the end.     This reference is ideal for those who have mastered the Spanish language at a high level, for native speakers who want to polishtheir Spanish, linguistics majors, socio-linguistics majors and anyone who wants to know more pragmatic aspects about Spanish.	2005-04-07

Mercedes Salisachs has a unique writing style and the ability to express herself eloquently with beautiful prose and carefully selected vocabulary. This novel is a soliloquy about the author's life and the two principle men who have caused her grief, happiness, pain and the ability to \\"love\\" over the course of time. Sagra, the main character is torn between the dedication she feels towards her husband Jaime and the secret love she feels for her brother-in-law Juan Luis. A marriage doomed from the start in my opinion due to Sagra not being the ideal one for Jaime (class segregation) and also her being infertile the relationship has many ups and downs. Via Sagra's sililoquies throughout the book the novel is a story of woman in love, out of love, confused and hurt who never really finds true happiness.	2005-02-20

This is not a novel with plot but rather a culmination of events protagonized by various characters and the central character, Ana. The reader gets a glimpse of Spanish society in a specific era (post Franco I believe) and we witness tales of \\"desamor\\" and other life's ups and downs. Ana, is a single Mom, a somewhat unsettled and unsure female who has interesting experiences with males but not really loving any of them. At the same time is searching for self-fulfilment on a professional level in world where men dominate makes Cronica del desamor a novel that anyone can relate to.

I certainly can understand their point of view but would like to give my perspective. The book does clarify meaning and explain the lexical difference of words from country to country. There are ample examples of this throughout the book. Depending on your background this book can be either enlightening, too regional, or too diverse but all in all it will explain what certain everyday words mean that may be common to a group of people and foreign to another just because of their regional differences. One aspect I find totally sad is the influence of English in Spanish vocabulary which is evidenced by the many examples provided in the book. However, a refreshing factor is that many of these words that originated and  are used predominantly by North American Spanish speakers  who have fusioned the two languages together have not yet been approved by the RAE (Real Academia de la lengua Espanola). Therefore, with that in mind I resist from discrediting the words (English slang) that are in the dictionary. Personally I refuse to use a slang anglicized word when there is an existing word in Spanish. Keeping all this in mind you can get some good information about the meaning of words and colloquial phrases that are detailed in this dictionary. It's not an exhaustive resource and certainly there are much better ones on the market. (3.5 star rating)	2004-08-18

As controversial as his novels may be I think Jaime Bayly has written an exceptional story. El huracan lleva tu nombre depicts not only Jaime's unique style of prose but also confirms his ability to combine polemic themes with underlying sensitivity that is manifested by the characters in the novel. Jaime's principal theme differs slightly in comparison to his other works. Instead of the protagonist struggling only with his homosexuality in this novel Gabriel struggles with his bisexuality. As the love story unfolds between the three main characters Gabriel-Sofia-Sebastian, the reader learns about the inner torment that Gabriel has to face because of society's intolerance to his sexual orientation. Gabriel is a typical Jaime Bayly protagonist who is tormented and struggles on a personal and social level better known as homophobic discrimination as described by the protagonist. Desperate to leave Lima but not happy in Miami the quest to find personal and professional gratitude becomes a battle while he dates a woman, Sofia and craves for a man, Sebastian and eventually many others. The time frame of the story is 1992 during the time of Hurricane Andrew in Miami.  <br />  <br /> Jaime Bayly also taps into the hypocrisy in Peruvian society as Gabriel's mom is a loyal member of Opus Dei and her concern is what others think about her son and the family's image- cucufateria. Don't do this, don't do that, what will others think etc. The fathers in this novel both Sofia's and Gabriel's are pathetic characters but also stereotypes as well. Sofia's father is divorced from her mother, left the family and Lima to live in isolation. He does not have a close relationship with Sofia or her sister and attempts to kill himself but is unsuccessful. Gabriel resents his father for his ill treatment towards him when he was young which Sofia believes is the reason for his inclination towards men because he was neglected by his father but insists that her &quot;Gabriel&quot; is not bisexual.  <br />  <br /> Their relationship is definitely a hurricane as they struggle to stay together against all odds and obstacles. However, due to Gabriel's inclinations and Sofia needs, the two eventually go their separate ways but not after going through life's most daring experience that of giving birth to a child in spite of their turbulent relationship. This novel definitely confirms that all kinds of love; heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual has its trials and tribulations. The constant struggle between Gabriel and Sofia makes this love-hate relationship a moving story and an easy identifiable. From the onset the reader grows with the characters as they constantly experience emotional turmoil. The hurricane is definitely the shaky relationship in itself and its name is Sofia (according to Gabriel) because of all the ups and downs he experiences is with her. Jaime Bayly has triumphed with this novel and it will stand strong in the face of all critique.	2004-07-23

Solo para mujeres can help women of all ages deal with issues as they relate to female sexuality and discover solutions to problems that may have plagued women for years. This book is written by two female doctors who address problems, symptoms and solutions accurately and are well explained with proper terminology used at all times. I purchased the book out of sheer interest because I think it is important for a woman to understand, identify and be comfortable with her own sexuality. Reading it once however is not enough.  Once read it can be used as a reference and a first step guide to determining whether the problem needs professional attention. This is a highly  recommended reference for females and for males who are in a relationship with a woman who may be dealing with some of the issues discussed.	2004-07-19

You may want to read this book first although I did not (I wish I did) in order to get a feel for Pedro Juan's style of narration which is quite bold, frank and at the same is a very unique form of prose that so far is unchallenged when I compare his literature to other contemporary Latinamerican authors that I have read. Pedro Juan G reveals his struggles and experiences post the fall of communism in the Soviet Union which had a direct impact on Cuba. Chapter by chapter each not correlating to one another Pedro's experiences are  a reflection of his frustration. No job, no stable home, lack of food, lack of freedom, rum, endless encounters with women and desperation. Pedro Juan is a vagabond who aspires to be a writer, a journalist, a painter and many other professions but can't achieve either long term in a land where drinking, music, unlimited and uncommitted relationships with women is the order of the day. Many might be reluctant to accept this perception of Cuba but the streets of Havana have a lot of destitute people and Pedro Juan's life is just a microcosm of human suffering. I recommend reading this book and others in the series that relate specifically to his desperate situation and loss of self worth. They are Nada que hacer, Sabor a mi and Trilogia sucia de la Habana. This is a good book, easy to read but there is a notable slow down towards the end.	2004-07-02

In this book the victims of mistreatment are females. The experience of these severely ill-treated revolutionary prisoners is mind boggling and once again makes one question the value of &quot;human rights&quot; in a country where humanitarian rights of any kind are not respected. The title is a reflection of the main theme of the book &quot;Dios en las carceles cubanas&quot; directly refers to never ending praying and spiritual presence of God in the jails as their only hope for survival. The protagonist Ana (in the first part of the book) is secretly holding religious gatherings in the jail which is completely forbidden and against the rules. These victims resort to God and the African spirits as a means of survival and a hope for the future. This book is the testimony of several female Revolutionary prisoners who describe only what I can imagine to be only a part of the torture that they suffered for many years and some did not live to tell their stories. Once again this is an aspect of Cuba that is kept in the closet that many outsiders do not see, know or hear about. The Cuban population needs to be liberated. That's my only hope and hopefully it will be soon.	2004-06-28

Although the themes are interesting and thus has the potential to be an exciting novel it lacks the exciting narrative that I have seen from others authors like Pedro Juan Gutierrez and Jordi Sierra who have addressed the same issues. The author should have been more daring and more revealing with his vocabulary, an aspect that would have created intrigue and curiosity. Overall the book was okay but too simple which made the read quite mundane at times. The characters were developed but relatively simple and predictable. In this novel the two main characters Mariano and Armando visit Cuba with the hopes of having the typical vacation that male Spaniards have in Cuba. They do have some encounters with a few women of the night but Mariano also gets to see the other side of the Cuban struggle through his relationship with a local, a Cuban female doctor who becomes his love interest. If you are interested in reading about prostitutes in Cuba and Spaniards who go there to solicit their services Jordi Sierra's books Regreso a la Habana and La noche de la jinetera are my suggested readings. Both are excellent novels on the subject matter and much better narrated than this one.	2004-06-05

In comparison to two of his previous novels- No se lo digas a nadie and Fue ayer y no me acuerdo, this book is the most serene of the three but deals with the same issues. The characters are well developed and Gabriel, the protagonist is a typical Jaime Bayly character. He is gay and suffers throughout the novel due to the fact that his desires are repressed and, as result is frustrated and struggles with his family, life etc. There is satirical humor throughout this novel and is carefully revealed through the dialogue and local jargon.<br />La noche es virgen is an easy read and if you like Jaime B's style of literature you may find the book excellent to read. Personally, I thought the book was good but Jaime B needs to diversify. All his books have the same principal themes (even the newer ones such as La mujer de mi hermano). He is a great author of contemporary Spanish literature but needs to move on. Also I found the book hard to read because there are no capitals.	2004-04-11

The chapters are laid out for the most part in a question and answer format. The chapters are quite informative and factual. I especially found the chapter on STDs an eye-opener because there is still so much that is unknown. As well the chapter on \\"frigidity\\" (frigidez) may help clarify exactly what is taking place anatomically instead of women acquiring a label of being uninterested. The chapter on contraceptives as well deserves mention. It covers plenty of detail ie. how each contraceptive works, the risk factors and side effects.

There is no plot at all but the book is just a narration of the narrator's obsession for a woman named Aida who he falls in love with but more so in love with her body. The narrator is weakened; saddened, mesmerized by his love for Aida but most of all I would say ironically is an unhappy \\"solitario\\" because he does not really share a life with Aida but admires, dreams about her and has a relationship with her from a distance. The beauty about this book is the narrative because the vocabulary and use of metaphors are exquisite but the lack of a plot and true storyline makes this book a potential bore. Once you start read it you may or may not continue. This is not Cristina Peri Rossi's best literature. However, I still appreciate her literary work.	2004-02-06

For example: &quot;Effective&quot; in English is &quot;eficaz&quot; in Spanish and not &quot;efectivo&quot; as I often hear. &quot;Efectivo&quot; in Spanish means &quot;cash&quot;. \\"Sensitive&quot; in Spanish is &quot;sensible&quot; and not &quot;sensato&quot; which ironically means sensible. Those two words always challenge students. A list of words like my examples is detailed in this handy manual. It explains the meaning of the cognate in both languages with examples. If you are conscious about speaking Spanish correctly this reference will help you achieve your goal. It not exhaustive but it certainly should be a part of students library of Spanish references.	2004-02-04

Paulo Coehlo has moved himself up to the forefront of Latin-American literature once again with this his most recent novel Once Minutos. I have not read much of his works but this novel caught my attention after reading the summary at the back of the book. I was immediately intrigued by the real life aspect of the themes and decided to purchase this potential bestseller. The book lived up to its expectations. It's full of intrigue and the life the protagonist Mara is an interesting one from start to finish. We meet her first in her homeland Brazil and then later she moves to Switzerland and becomes a prostitute with the hopes of turning her life around for the better with the money that she earns. We learn of the emotional roller coaster that Maria experiences from being with many men and indeed she does meet some out of the ordinary clients who my opinion in some way cause her internal conflicts but out from those experiences Maria learns interesting life lessons. I also think the title of the book is so appropriate which is explained about a quarter of the way through which is a reflection of creative thinking by Paulo Coehlo. In a nutshell, this is beautiful literature not so much for the writing style but because the themes allow one to relate closely to the protagonist. A truly emotional book as it allows the reader to feel so many emotions: sadness, pain, grief and hope. No question about it Once Minutos is a potential best-seller by far my favorite by this author.	2004-01-31

Por Pasiones Asi is a most interesting book and it is the first time that I am sampling this author's work. I bought the book based on the synopsis on the back cover and the publishing house Seix Barral is very renowned so I was confident with my purchase. The protagonist of the book a Spaniard gets a one-year assignment as a journalist in Argentina. Among his many endeavors he meets an exotic dancer and they become passionately involved. Their relationship evolves throughout the book but it is not really based on anything real. We also get a taste of the clashes between the Spanish and Latin American culture as well as the Spanish and Argentinean culture. Also we learn about the differences between the Argentinean elite and the non-elite. Andres Sebastian, the protagonist is covering stories in Argentina during a very turbulent time in its history. Basically a period of economic and political instability but is unable to really come up with a big story. The book is interesting from a political and social point of view and may have a special interest to those who know about Argentina's modern economic and political history. Lots of colloquial dialogue also the Spanish spoken is typical Argentinean Spanish throughout the book.	2004-01-24

Idioms are difficult to grasp in any language and Spanish is no exception. This resource has many of the most commonly heard idioms in day to day speech and those learning Spanish must eventually learn the meaning and use them when speaking Spanish. Understanding and learning fixed expressions authenticates one's usage of the language and brings an individual one step closer to native competency. I seriously recommend this resource for Beginners and Intermediate level students. For advance speakers I think a more challenging resource would be more beneficial to their development in the language. I recommend the McGraw-hill Diccionario del Argot: El Sohez for advance level students.	2004-01-23

As in any language this is usually hard to learn and understand without exposure and because Spanish is so broad whether you are a native speaker or not it is sometimes necessary to consult a reference to clarify the meaning of a word or expression. An everyday word in one country can be considered vulgar and totally unacceptable in another.<br />This book contains data from Street Spanish 1,2,3 and a thesaurus of terms thematically categorized. If you wish to understand these terms as they are used and terms more specific to a particular Latin country or region, this thesaurus will prove beneficial. I also recommend the Mcgraw-Hill Diccionario del Argot: El Sohez. It is very advanced but is thorough and helpful if you wish to explore the world of idioms and slang in Spanish.	2004-01-22

What can I say, Sabor a mi details events of the author's life - Pedro Juan Gutierrez- during  a specific time frame which includes his years in jail and when he was set free again to roam the streets of Cuba. If you are familiar with other books that he wrote prior to this one- Trilogia sucia de la Habana, Animal Tropical etc. you will understand that his books do not really have plots or a continuos story-line. The chapters detail events that have happened to him and Sabor a mi is no exception. Sabor a mi depicts Cuba in the nineties and the day to day strife of its people. Through the daily episodes of Pedro Juan G the reader gets an understanding of how some of the most destitute Cubans live. In a nutshell, some have resorted to selling themselves just to survive because there is no other  alternative unless they meet a foreigner or have become vagabonds over the years. It's an average book but Pedro Juan needs to move on. His books have repetitive themes and situations.	2004-01-06

He explores the same themes as in No se lo digas a nadie. However, the protagonist Gabriel is very different from the protagonist in his previous novel. Jaime Bayly once again focuses on homosexuality and drug abuse & addiction as the two main themes and a secondary theme is the lack of acceptance by his parents and his own personal struggle with his identity. Reading a book like this gives one exposure to a controversial theme and the internal and external struggles that homosexuals face in society. My only question is: Will Jaime Bayly stray from this subject, ever? This is the fourth Jaime Bayly novel I have read and in all his novels the same themes are addressed. But nevertheless this hard to ascertain novel is worth the read.	2003-12-28

Jaime Bayly explores the world of homosexuality and the reactions by the society in which one lives and the reader gets a taste of how people react, scorn, and alienate etc. homosexual and gay culture. The reader gets a picture of how the theme is dealt with in Lima, Peru but I think the reactions of people would be similar in other Latin cultures. <br />Joaquin, the protagonist struggles against traditional values, his father's machismo while he discovers his own homosexual tendencies. Also, we learn that the protagonist is drug addict- cocaine in Peru is not that difficult to ascertain. This book is worth the read if you want to explore the many themes that are revealed by Jaime Bayly in the book: homosexuality, drug addiction, and the presence of machismo in the Latin culture. The language is strong but it goes hand and hand with the theme of the book.	2003-12-28

The story revolves around the love relationships and ups and down of the protagonist, Blanca and as we progress through the book we learn how she deals with the various stages of her life that she experiences with her husband and two other men that come into her life at a later period of time.

It definitely fills in the gaps about the specifics that can possibly be found in other references but not as hands on. The grammar specifics covered are mostly pragmatic concepts about Spanish and usually they relate to the differences between English and Spanish, which make pitfalls so difficult to overcome. The book is well divided into three main sections: Parts of Speech, Sentence Structure and Special Topics. This book will definitely clarify some queries that you may have. It will prove beneficial once you keep in mind that it is not a grammar book but rather a grammar reference. This is a great reference for those who are natives, advanced students and teachers.	2003-12-20

This is the first book I read from this author and I am really pleased with her writing style. It is exact, subtle and very exquisite at the same time. I am always pleased with books that have a broad range of vocabulary but yet a unique simplicity that's makes the book an easy read. The book was interesting as I did not know what to expect from the title El amor es una droga dura.The protagonist Javier is fixated with Nora  a young model who men love to love (or at least they think do). They meet via a photo shoot  that she arranged with him and henceforth his obsession with her becomes an addiction. His goal is just to have her for one night but Nora proves to be hard to get and refuses to tie herself down to any man. The irony in the story that is revealed only at the end is that Javier has an addiction because he does drink, he did use drugs and overall had health problems (which we do learn about in the beginning) so his &quot;addiction&quot; to Nora could have stemmed from his other addictions. The author presents an interesting concept about the interconnection among the addictions that makes the title of the book so appropriate. It was a good read, interesting fictional literature by a good writer. I will pursue other works by Cristina Peri Rossi.	2003-11-28

In Carne de Perro we see the same Pedro Juan G that we have seen in Trilogia sucia de la Habana, El insaciable hombre arana and Animal Tropical, one who is starving for a promising future, food, and  women on a regular basis. His life in Cuba is a destitute one and the readers learn a little bit about life in a socially and economically repressed country whose revolution has failed miserably. Who are the victims?- the Cubans.  Pedro G in Carne de Perro tells it just like it is but with much less anger and resentment. I enjoyed the book. It was short but the message was sent. It also was an easy read because I read all the others he has written and I have seen the different stages of the protagonist- Pedro Juan G in each book.	2003-11-03

Young teens have questions, many of the answers they ascertain are from a wrong source or one that gives partial information. The book however clarifies many questions in a plain and fun to read way which is the type of language that a young teenager may appreciate. Chances are anything too complicated will not be read but it is light in tone but accurate in detail which I find makes it ideal for young males and females to read. I read the Spanish version which is a translated version of English (Que pasa alli abajo) and I found it quite enlightening and could easily be understand. The way the information is presented is valuable for the target audience. Teens need to know and understand their corporal changes, know the implications of  early intimate relations, STDs etc. In the day and age in which we live kids increasingly have more exposure to these themes at an early age and it is important that they get correct information and not a fabricated version from their peers. As a parent you may want to read the book and then decide if it's adequate for your teens. I thought it was superb for the target audience.	2003-09-10

I purchased this book because it was on the top ten most read books in Miami in the month of May and I thought it would be fun to read something light thematically speaking. No politics or historical details nothing of that nature but it was a struggle to get through this book without being tempted to stop reading it completely. The plot was very predictable and the development was too slow. <br />This book, I suppose is an attempt to give readers a glimpse of modern day Cuban-american culture. Margarita the protagonist of the book is a prominent lawyer as well as her husband Ariel. They have a son who is well-cared for by the in house maid and most of Margarita's day is spent with her two closest friends Vivian and Anabel doing anything and everything around Miami. Maragrita gets a suprise call from a former love interest Luthor and all hell breaks loose when she starts to see him secretly during her lunch hours at his apartment nearby work. As the story progresses, she becomes pregnant and doom lingers as to whether her husband or her lover is the father. However, we learn that the preganancy is a conspiracy between her very \\"Cuban\\" mother, her husband and the local pharmacist.<br />I believe the intent of the author was to make this an exciting read as the book is very contemporary with the setting in Miami. However, I just found it unchallenging, predictable and just boring. The last fifty pages of the book was interesting otherwise this was a boring read. I would say it is the reader's choice but if you have other books on your list to read, read them.	2003-08-01

If you are familiar with this author's writing style and his themes, you will easily identify with this book as it is an extension or better yet a part of a series of four books that depict Cuba from his own personal experiences (the other three are Trilogia sucia de la Habana, El Rey de la Habana and El Insaciable hombre araa). This one is more focused on two periods in his life and his experiences with two women in particular- Gloria and Agneta. Gloria is his Cuban interest and Agneta, a Swedish female that was a part of his life for a brief period of time. What we see in this book in comparison to la Trilogia and El Insaciable hombre araa is Pedro Juan Gutierrez in his fifties, still destitute, poor, unstable in every sense of the word (professionally, monetarily and relationship wise) who is holding on to a dream of being an author and a professional artist. Due to the numerous obstacles that stand in his way and his inability to dedicate time to being what he wants to become we witness the same issues that were part of his life in his earlier years as a younger person. His life as we see it is dictated by his insatiable desire for a women's body, rum and drugs. Out from these experiences the reader is also getting a small history lesson about what Cuba was like in the 90's and still very much so today however, the 90's seemed to be the culminating point of the modern Cuban depression due to the fall of the Soviet Union. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. I was not at all offended by the language and vivid descriptions of his actions. All was taken in context. Once again I found this writing style of Pedro Juan Gutierrez daring but true and reveals details and the consequences that sometimes result due to extreme poverty.	2003-07-17

This  book is a lifesaver if you are looking for a resource that is well organized and thoroughly explains grammar concepts in Spanish appropriate for Intermediate and Advanced level students. In 48 chapters essential grammar concepts are analyzed with practice exercises. There is a strong focus on verbs, their functionality and the different moods and tenses which is essential if mastering the spoken and written language is your goal. Many examples are provided and the practice exercises allow for immediate application of the concepts that are taught in each lesson. The only downfalls of this workbook in my opinion are: 1) it was not always easy to understand the objective of practice exercises which made filling out the blanks or the task a bit challenging 2) there is no answer key and as a student that is a requirement as one does not want to practice making the same errors. However, there may be an answer key as a separate purchase which is usually the case when the answers are not provided at the back of the book. Overall, this is a thorough workbook. I recommend it to Intermediate and Advanced level students.	2003-07-09

Women's issues were divulged, the weaknesses of the Black male were brought to light, relationship abuse was exposed and most of all poverty in a brought sense closes out some of the key themes in this novel. I read this book ten years ago when it was first released with no prior knowledge of the author or the type of book that I was getting into. I read an excerpt from ESSENCE magazine and was immediately intrigued and it lead me to believe that the book was a captivating love story. Was I prepared for what I was about to read? Probably not. However, because of Terry McMillan's tremendous writing skills, I was totally engaged once I began to read this novel, the story of Zora and Franklin and their love-hate relationship. This book was an eye opener and enlightened me about relationships that are doomed from the start and how it can eventually lead to destruction as both parties slowly destroy each other due to  unresolvable conflicts. Zora and Franklin are no exception and the role that each plays is representative of what can happen in a relationship between two people like Zora and Franklin. Zora, a Black career-oriented female is in a relationship with a Black high-school drop out who can't hold a job and is full of empty promises. Needless to say one can't build a relationship on dreams and illusions and eventually Zora's success becomes the source of Franklin's jealousy and anger which in my mind turned the relationship into a verbally, physically and sexually abusive one. Without providing more detail for fear of revealing all the good aspects of the book, this is highly recommended reading if you are interesting in some insight on what happens in some Black relationships and relationships on the whole for that matter but written from the point of view of Black author who had a very powerful message to convey. I read this book twice and I am considering a third time may be in Spanish just to diversify. This is highly recommended reading.	2003-06-26

Salome (the mother) and Camila (the daughter) never met each other because Salome died when Camila was very young.<br />Salome was a famous poet in the Dominican Republic and lived during a difficult historical period in her country. On the other hand we see the life of Camila, a retired schoolteacher who is about to leave the US to live in Cuba and play a role in the Cuban Revolution.<br />Salome is by far the more interesting character and her poetry was pivotal in the Dominican revolutionary period. Out from her writings the reader learns more about the DR during the 16th century. Camila seems more disoriented, unsure of herself and did not live the life that she wanted to and being more active in the Cuban political sphere did not change her life at all. <br />The book is interesting from the point of view that it relates the story of two people's life, mother and daughter in two distinct time frames but it would have been more interesting if I had known more about Dominican political history because the book is heavily oriented around their history. I think this one of those books that will either captivate you or not interest you at all but I say it the reader's choice if you are curious and if you like Julia Alvarez as a writer.	2003-06-22

Meaning, Cuba itself, prostitution, balseros, sentiments about the Cuban revolution and the desperation that Cuban's feel to better their life. The book presents the above-mentioned themes in a captivating way via the two main characters, Daniel and Aneylin.<br />\\"La noche de la jinetera\\" is about the love affair of Daniel Pos, a journalist and writer who travels to Cuba to investigate the murder of Estanis Marimon, a journalist as well who was doing a report on Spaniards in Cuba. The story slowly develops via the two protagonists Daniel and Anyelin, the prostitute who falls in love with him with the hopes of being able to leave Cuba and have a better life.<br />The book also deals with three other related events related to the Cuban revolution that develop in the midst of Daniel's investigation. There's a protest against the Cuban regime, an attempt against Castro and the Cuban runaway crisis.<br />For me the book is a portrait of modern Cuba, we see the lives of the prostitutes and convincingly we get a glimpse of the daily life of Cubans who are struggling to survive in an oppressed country. The story was heartfelt because it made me think if these prostitutes or jineteras as they are now called can really love someone without people thinking that they have an ulterior motive and that they are just taking advantage of the Spaniards who come to enjoy unlimited pleasures with women. I enjoyed the book but it also left me with a very disturbing feeling about the way these young Cuban females are forced to live. <br />I recommend this book if you would like to know more about their world that is totally different, sad and risky but for these prostitutes it is just a way life.	2003-06-22

Jose Saramago is a renowned novelist and has many novels that can easily fall under the category of magisterial literary works. In this book, he immediately engages the reader in it as the theme of becoming suddenly blind reveals itself in a mysterious way. Various people in a town become blind for no apparent reason except the wife of the principal character in the book- the doctor. Out from this sudden loss of sight we see how the characters become desperate, helpless and frustrated and to a certain extent rely on their other senses to just to carry out their basic daily routines. We also see how people's natural negative aspects become evident when those who became blind are forced to live in isolation together in order to prevent an epidemic of grand proportions. The book is full of intrigue and mystery as we see how the characters struggle with their loss of sight. This book was great to read. It's intriguing and keeps the reader in suspense. I recommend this novel if you are a fan of good modern contemporary literature. Also I recommend reading the Spanish version as opposed to the translation.	2003-06-06

This is an interesting book by Jaime Bayly in the sense that it's just a serious of confessions in the form of letters that were written to various people who were a part of his life at one point of time and in the letters he expresses repent, sorrow, sentimental feelings etc. The book comes across as one in which Jaime Bayly once again reveals the intimacies and at this point complexities of his life. However, what are consistent in this book and others of his that I have read are his language skills and his unique way of expressing himself, which I think, is his strongest attribute. In a nutshell, this is a book with no real plot and the letters written to various friends he once had do not necessarily relate to each other. If you like Jaime Bayly it may be a worthwhile read otherwise you may want to read his other more credible works such as: Yo amo a mi mami and No se lo digas a nadie.	2003-06-06

This dictionary is perfect for an intermediate level Spanish student who wishes to have a unilingual resource without lengthy and complicated definitions. It is an adequate size dictionary with about 30.000 entries and a grammatical appendix. It does contain quite a diverse vocabulary with common idiomatic expressions associated with some of the words. It does also indicate where applicable if the word is familiar (colloquial), considered vulgar or regional (specific to one or more Spanish countries). I use it quite regularly for everyday word clarification and the words are normally referenced. Since I am doing a specialization in Spanish it's not a primary reference for me but as mentioned above the dictionary is a perfect daily desktop dictionary and great for a student who needs a small to midsize reliable unilingual resource.	2003-06-05

It deserves 10 stars!	I saw this dictionary last month at Borders and I had to own it. The only deterrent was the price. Without giving up hope I decided to purchase it from Amazon and not only was it half the amount but I was happy to know that I would be able to ascertain this fantastic resource. This dictionary is unilingual, diverse, and provides examples of usage of every word in the dictionary. This dictionary is from the University of Salamanca which is the oldest university in Spain and the most reputable in terms of preserving the Spanish language. It also classifies the words where applicable. For example, if the word has a restricted use, regional use, considered vulgar, pertains to medicine etc. which is extremely helpful when trying to choose the most appropriate word. Also with adjectives it indicates whether it is normally used before or after a noun in some cases both positions are acceptable in Spanish. I own a version of the Real Academia about the same size as this dictionary and this one is better by far. The definitions are clear, concise with examples and idioms that really clarify the meaning. You can't go wrong with this dictionary. Not only is it a great reference to research the meaning of words but you will definitely expand your vocabulary by using it. This is one of most thorough dictionaries that I own. I sincerely recommend it.	2003-06-05

I stumbled across this dictionary in a Cuban bookstore in Miami last month, which appeared to be old when I was browsing through the contents but I decided to buy it nevertheless. It has truly been helpful and it gives a broad range of Cuban vocabulary, examples of usage and where possible the origin of the word or expression. This dictionary, which is one in a series of many, is a lasting resource, as expressions, slang and colloquial speech never completely become extinct in a language. This dictionary is arranged alphabetically thus making the vocabulary easy to locate. It's quite detailed and definitely will shed some light and clarify understanding of words if you are unfamiliar with Cuban colloquial Spanish. If you can purchase it from Amazon great, otherwise there are plenty of similar dictionaries on the market. This is a helpful reference for those who want to understand and know Cuban colloquialisms.

The book is very complete and discusses the most common myths and realities about \\"el sexo joven\\" and many enigmas as well. The book is not only for adolescents, it's definitely beneficial to adults as well who have teenagers or have questions themselves that they would like to have answered without having to go to a gynecologist or urologist depending on the nature of the problem.  The book is divided into the following four chapters:<br />1) Sentidos y sin sentidos del sexo joven<BR>2) Preocupaciones puntales<BR>3) El sexo mal entendido<BR>4) Cultura sexual de ultima hora<br />Dra. Anbel Ochoa covers all grounds related to the myths of sexuality, cultural taboos and today's societal concerns as they relate to sexuality, sexuality transmitted diseases, contraceptives, pregnancy and the list is endless. Once again the thoroughness is what makes this book so enlightening as it covers many aspects of this diverse and in some cases controversial topic due to cultural differences. It is easy to read and all correct terminology is used which is important especially for adolescents who definitely need to understand the importance of their own sexual development and corporal changes from the beginning. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for clarification and understanding of sexual culture. The editorial review on the product page is also very thorough and gives insight to the topics covered in the book.<br />I read the Spanish version, I am unsure if there is a version in English.	2003-06-01

This book is from the collection of four such books by the author Pedro Juan Gutierrez in which he reveals the sordid details about Cuba that still are unknown to many around the world. The life of Pedro Juan G in Cuba in the 90's was full of repression, day-to-day struggles, strife and female encounters. This book -El insaciable hombre arana- is just a series of episodes chapter by chapter each not necessarily relating to each other but reveal episodes of his life as he struggled to survive in Cuba post the decline of the Soviet Union. There is no real plot. Reading the book was once again very enlightening however, I did not find this book as illustrative as the other two that I read which are: Trilogia sucia de la Habana and El rey de la Habana. Perhaps it could be that by this being the third on this subject matter it was no longer an invigorating experience. Nevertheless, I appreciate the details and the opportunity to see this side of Cuba through the experiences of the author. It's worth the read if you are curious. I give the book a rating of 3.5 stars.	2003-05-27

When I bought this book a few years ago I was quite surprised with the level of detail and the approach of the authors used to clarify this grammatical difficulty. The explanations are in English with examples in Spanish. The approach of the logic of usage is from Spanish to English rather than from English to Spanish which most textbooks use and perhaps that's where the confusion begins. It does clarify the notion that Ser and Estar are sometimes interchangeable (and they are not) and using one or other will definitely change the meaning of a phrase. This is the only book that I have come across thus far dedicated to the analysis and usage of these two verbs. If you are looking for an accurate and concise clarification of the usage of these verbs this book is highly recommended and not to mention is very economical.	2003-05-26

I consider it a study aid only because it uniquely covers grammatical points that are geared towards the Intermediate and Advanced speaker but it certainly does not go into depth and definitely does not cover any complex structures. I found it to be very practical, with clear and concise explanations and examples provided. It's not a workbook so don't expect any practice exercises. The back of book serves as a handy reference and covers subject matters outside of the grammatical realm such business writing, idiomatic expressions, thematic vocabulary etc. This book is an excellent complement to a good grammar book. It definitely is handy for clarifying doubts from time to time and the grammar topics cover are the most typical reoccurring grammar points that present difficulty for learners of the Spanish language. The lessons are in English with relevant examples in Spanish.	2003-05-23

I found it very easy to relate to and very sentimental since many females have and have had at one point in their life a close relationship with their mom. The memories are based on her life in Madrid when Soledad was a child and then eventually married and had her own children at which time her mother played an integral role in the life of her children as a grandparent. The book to me serves as a reminder to all of us of the importance of familiar relationships and that nothing last forever. Important people in our life need to be appreciated and oddly enough we sometimes only realize that when we become older or when they are gone... forever. This was a nice read and a pleasant reminder.	2003-05-21

This book may offend those who are fond of the Cuba that is portrayed as a paradise to many around the world but unfortunately the lifestyle of Cubans is not at all what the tourists enjoy. Also, some may be offended by the way the author portrayed is own life as an average poor Cuban male, who survived the best way he could by living a vagabond life with the company of the rum bottle, sexual encounters and salsa music. What else could a poor destitute Cuban do in a communist country whose government provides its people with the bear minimum and even less at times.<br />I think book just tells it like it is without any polishing which I think gives the reader a clear portrait and reveals another aspect of Cuba with respect to survival especially during the peak crisis of the 90's when the shortage of everything was notable. The basic staple needs like soap, toilet paper, food etc. could not be met and the situation is still quite comparable today in 2003. The book brings the Cuban experience to life via the language that the author uses which is at times very vulgar, raw, inappropriate and downright Cuban however, the language and the style is what brings his recounts to life and helps to situate the reader in that time frame and to identify with the author's experiences. Also, there are some interesting references to the Gods of Santeria a religion that is still practiced by many Cubans today. <br />Overall the book presents and aspect about Cuba that is real, hard to believe and depressing but at the same time is an eye opener and a reality check about a country who has its citizens living in poverty and in some cases below human standards.<br />I read the Spanish version. I believe a book like this should always be read in its original form. The language here I don't think can be carried over successfully in a translation.	2003-05-19

The book will also be helpful to advanced students, teachers and native speakers who have an interest in the specifics of the language such as the art to vocabulary building. The book focuses on Spanish suffixes and the possible equivalents in the English language where applicable. This book will help you to grow your vocabulary, better understand the roots of Spanish words and also help you to strengthen your foundation in understanding the logical aspect in the formation of words in Spanish. For example:<br />Words that end in -ity- in English usually end in -dad- Spanish. Humanity=humanidad and eternity =eternidad and the gender is feminine.  -ence- and -ency- in English is equivalent to -encia- in Spanish. Agency= agencia and Afluency=afluencia. <br />Also at the end of every suffix studied there are samples of idiomatic expressions at random that are very helpful which will also increase your vocabulary and knowledge of fixed expressions in Spanish. Examples from the book include:<br />1) a suplicacion- on petition or by request<BR>2) andar en lenguas- to be the subject of gossip<BR>3) hora punta- rush hour<BR>4) noticia bomba- sensational news<BR>5) huelga decir-needless to say.<br />I have not seen anything comparable to this guide on the market.

The guide is quite informative and does explain the root cause of many diseases that affect women and offer suggestions on how women can help themselves and how your doctor can also play a vital role in the recovery process. I found the section on sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer and menopause quite detailed and helpful as every women's body is different thus each one's experiences are different as well. The book is quite an easy read and not over burdened with medical terminology that is difficult to understand but at the same time proper medical terminology is used throughout the book. The book emphasizes the necessity to recognize symptoms in all stages in our lives since our body changes as we get older and the key to successfully overcoming some illness is detecting them and arresting them as early as possible.	2003-05-13

This book is raw and spares no expense when it comes to describing the life of Rey, a young Cuban street boy who struggles to survive life on the streets by stealing, abusing his body and basically prostituting himself (for fun and natural desires only not for money) as he moves from town to town just hoping to beg for enough money for at least one day's meal. The Cuba portrayed here is representative of the urban street life of many young Cubans both male and female who are forced to adopt this life style at a young age when faced with numerous adversities. A Cuban himself wrote the book so the picture could not be more real. Prepare yourself for some harsh and vulgar language, drug abuse and unlimited female encounters. Out from his ability to clean up streets and women he is know as \\"El Rey de la Habana\\". This is a sad portrait but a very true one in country that has forced its citizens to live impoverished and destitute lives. This is a well written novel in my opinion because the author did write the book using the everyday speech of these \\"street people\\". I suggest reading the book in Spanish only and purchasing a dictionary of Cuban colloquialisms because there are plenty and the meaning can not be assumed. Otherwise it is a great read and I don't think a translated version can retain the rawness and crudeness of the language.	2003-05-12

The dictionary also has verb charts of irregular verbs in various tenses which are located randomly throughout the dictionary. Along with the definitions and synonyms an example of the word in a phrase is also provided which really clarifies the meaning of the word if the reader still has doubts. Although it's considered a junior dictionary, I think it's an all purpose dictionary especially since it is unilingual and provides a broad range of terms that can help anyone in search of a word that is part of everyday speech in Spanish and not a colloquialism or a regional terminology. It is definitely a handy reference for native speakers and bilingual students. The dictionary is worth every penny.	2003-05-06

At first glance this book seems great but as you go through it page by page the errors become evident. <br />Terminology in a language must be correct and I am surprised at this production by Barron's because they usually do have good educational material even in a foreign language but this one has some really bad translations which a learner of Spanish and even natives have to be aware of since English has great influence in the spoken and written Spanish on the US and Canada.<br />Some of the many errors include:<br />1) Contact persona= \\"la persona de contacto\\". This is such a literal translation and as a result is incorrect. Sometimes the long phrases are the only equivalents. It s/b \\"la persona con quien puede hablar\\"<BR>2) Think about it= Piense en eso. More correctly in Spanish it s/b \\"Piensalo\\"<BR>3) How long ago= Hace cuanto. It s/b \\"Hace cuanto tiempo\\"<BR>4) Take a seat= Tome un asiento. It s/b \\"Tome asiento\\"<BR>5) Mutual Funds= los fondos mutualisitas. Please do not repeat this one. It s/b \\"fondos mutuales\\" or \\"fondos de inversion\\"<BR>6) Sunglasses= gafas del sol. This is a big grammatical error. It s/b \\"gafas de sol\\".<br />These are just a few examples but the list goes on. The editors of this book should have caught these errors because they could really jeopardize the quality of your Spanish. Even the basic command structure is incorrect. In the book \\"vamos a... is translated as \\"let's\\". That is incorrect. Vamos a = we are going to....\\" Let's\\" is a command and requires a special verb form. For example let's work= trabajemos. It cannot be translated as \\"vamos a trabajar\\". <br />All I can say in a nutshell is proceed with caution. The same way this book may help you it may very well embarrass you.	2003-04-22

There is a pronunciation guide in brackets beside every word but I don't think it would be helpful if you are a true beginner in Spanish. I believe that sounds and phonetics need to be taught to ensure correct pronunciation and accentuation. I found the vocabulary to be interesting at times but there are so many ways in Spanish to say a word it just depends where a person is from but I think that Barron's tried to use the most generic word at all times. I really believe the book is good if you want to learn some Spanish vocabulary without having to worry about grammar and sentences etc. If you decide to purchase this book you will instantly increase your vocabulary and most of all know how to say everyday household terms in Spanish.

The learning approach is extremely user friendly with plenty of pictures, short but beneficial practice exercises, a vocabulary builder section and many question and answer opportunities. There is some grammar taught but it is not the focus of the workbook. There is also a focus on reading and expressing one's ideas using the vocabulary taught in the chapters. This workbook is definitely geared towards a junior audience, grades 3-6 and can be used in the classroom or at home. With proper instruction and dedication the young Spanish student will increase his/ her reading, writing and speaking skills in Spanish. An important note there is no answer key provided however, there is a glossary at the back of the workbook.	2003-03-02

The learning approach is thematic, meaning each chapter focuses on vocabulary pertinent to a theme such as: At the airport (En el aeropuerto), On the airplane (En el avin) or At the train station (En la estacin de ferrocarril) to name a few. The book provides ample practice exercises, with an answer key at the back of the book and what I found really valuable was each chapter has a mini paragraph about the theme in question that incorporates the vocabulary taught in the lesson. The workbook will definitely help the student to expand his/ her vocabulary because the chapters encompass everyday themes thus detailing everyday vocabulary. I feel it's more for an Intermediate level student because one would have to have a solid base to benefit from the new material presented in the chapters without feeling frustrated and also have beyond beginner reading and comprehension skills. This is a good supplementary study aid to classroom lessons or independent study.	2003-03-02

The books cover all the essentials of Spanish grammar and if mastered, one can speak concise Spanish with optimum grammar control. This book was designed to emphasize the fundamentals. Of course, Spanish grammar goes way beyond the scope of this workbook however, it's true to it's objective and it does clarify key grammar points that can enhance one's writing and speaking abilities. I believe workbook is a great supplementary study aid to classroom instruction. It has ample practice exercises and an answer key which is vital when learning a language. The workbook is a worthy purchase.	2003-03-02

I was very pleased with this dictionary when I purchased it recently. I wanted a reliable English/Spanish dictionary for everyday usage and this one stood out among the selection that was available. Not only does it provide a translation of the word in question but it has ample examples of word usage in a phrase, idioms, fixed phraseology and it's quite up to date. There is also a Spanish verb conjugation table of model regular and irregular verbs as guide to correct verb conjugation. I recommend this dictionary to beginner and intermediate Spanish students and to those who are using the Spanish language on a daily basis. It's a great quick reference tool. This is a worthy and economical purchase.	2003-02-05

This is a new release by McGraw-Hill and is a very handy resource that offers a wealth of definitions and clarification of usage of everyday colloquialisms, slang, vulgarity and their meaning. When I saw the book in the store I was a bit hesitant to purchase it because of the price but I quickly realized that the price was incomparable to wealth of information offered. It's obvious that there was a considerable amount of time and research spent in order to produce this handy tool and I do believe it would most benefit those who are natives of Spanish, advanced students, professionals, journalists, translators, interpreters and writers. This dictionary would be overwhelming for a beginner as it is written in Spanish and the vocabulary used in the definitions and examples is advanced at times. The only flaw in this reference is does not give the country or countries where a typical expression may be used which I think is very valuable because what may be a friendly word or expression in one country may be totally offensive in another. Here are some examples of expressions detailed in this dictionary:    1.chochete- mujer joven (a young woman). This was new to me. I would say \\"jovencita\\" or \\"doncella\\".  2.en cuerpo y alma- plenamente, completamente (completely) This is an everyday expression in the Spanish language.  3.mala leche - mala suerte (bad luck) (Everyday expression).  4.curichi- avaro, tacano (greedy)   5.meter la gamba - equivocarse (to make a mistake) I would say \\"meter la pata\\".    These are just some examples I selected at random and #4 , # 5 are new to me. I know the generic expressions but not the slang, which is valuable, and somewhere down the road I may come across these expressions. As mentioned above this resource is priceless and it will broaden your scope and understanding of everyday Spanish and aid you with correct usage.This is money well spent!	2003-01-26

I stumbled across this textbook in the campus bookstore, glanced at a few of the chapters and immediately decided to purchase it. I have the 3rd edition, which is slightly different from this newer version offered by Amazon however the grammatical exercises are the same. This text covers an abundance of grammatical concepts that will help students who are already bilingual (Eng/Spanish) and wish to clarify and fortify specific queries about Spanish grammar. Each chapter focuses on one Spanish speaking country, provides some key historical facts and questions, one grammatical concept with corresponding exercises, some phonetic and orthographic nuances, idiomatic phrases or expressions and other miscellaneous exercises. The book is a great review for advanced students and a reference for Hispanics who learned Spanish in the home but had no formal training. The only flaw in this text is that it does not have an answer key, which is vital if the student is pursuing independent study. As a former Spanish teacher, I solidly recommend this text to those abovementioned as it offers valuable grammatical clarifications. It's a bit pricey but the good things in life usually are.  I honestly recommend the purchase of this text.	2003-01-26

Not knowing anything about this author, I decided to take a chance and read the book. It turned out that I liked his style, his broad range of vocabulary, and his unique way of expressing himself as an author all of which encouraged me to read other works by Jaime.    \\"La mujer de mi hermano\\", his most recent book is very unique as well. Once again, the author has managed to develop sub themes within the main theme of the book, which do play an important role in the plot as well. In a nutshell, this book is about adultery, one of the main characters, Ignacio is a victim of the love affair between Zoe (his wife) and Gonzalo (his brother). Jaime Bayly paints a very real image of the characters, which facilitates reading the novel and also enables the reader to get fully involved in the lives of the three protagonists. As the secret relationship between Zoe and Gonzalo gets more complicated, Ignacio becomes increasingly insecure, jealous, and furious and displays his lack of trust towards Zoe and his brother.    The strongest message that this book has to offer is how human instincts seemingly harmless can complicate the lives of innocent people purposely or not. Zoe and Gonzalo are physically attracted to each other but \\"she is his brother's wife\\" which me hands off. Overall, the story progresses slowly but is quite interesting via the creative use of internal dialogue by each character and Jaime's vocabulary, which keeps the reading interesting.    In conclusion, I liked this book, it was intriguing and the theme is very contemporary. What makes the book a good read is Jaime's vocabulary and syntax skills. He has a unique way with words and can be very strong when expressing his ideas. Those who like \\"contemporary Spanish literature\\" will find this book by Jaime Bayly a worthwhile read. (I read it in Spanish I would suggest the same. I can't imagine an English version having the same vocabulary and syntax structure with any effect).    PD. I was mislead by the first reviewer's comments. I'm glad that I did decide to read the book as it does have an audience especially those who like Jaime Bayly.	2003-01-26

I would strongly recommend it to teachers, translators, interpreters and writers. Advanced students in Spanish would also find this dictionary helpful. This dictionary is monolingual-Spanish only and it provides a wide range of synonyms and antonyms of the selected words with examples as necessary to show subtle differences in meaning especially when there is a very fine line between which word is more adequate. A good example of this is the word \\"narrow\\". In Spanish you will find \\"estrecho\\" and \\"angosto\\" however, with very subtle differences not to be used interchangeably. Most dictionaries don't make the distinction. This one does and this concept is very important when using the language at a high level. Another great example is the word \\"beautiful\\" in Spanish there are many equivalents such as \\"hermoso\\", \\"bello\\", \\"lindo\\" etc. but all with very specific nuances, which need to be taken into consideration when using the words. Since having purchased this dictionary three years ago, I find it to be a valuable resource. If you are an advanced student or a Spanish professional this dictionary will prove to be beneficial.	2003-01-26

It does give reference to figurative and familiar usage and where possible countries where the particular word or words are used. The dictionary does not give examples of usage in sentence, which is vital to ensure that the reader understands how to use the word in the proper context. I would recommend this dictionary to strong intermediate students, advanced students, Spanish professionals and those who are pursuing independent study in Spanish.

It could be because the theme does not allow for much variety but just an honest recount of the truth. The book gives the reader a realistic view of daily Colombian life, a country that has struggled with guerrilla warfare and drug trafficking for the past forty years and more. The protagonists of the book are the victims of the kidnappers and throughout the book we learn about the cruel reality of these people who have changed the life of many Colombians by use of violence and cruel killings without mercy. I think the book was well written with revealing details of how the victims feel (mentally and physically) and how their families suffer when they are forced to negotiate with the drug dealers etc. for the safe return of their family members. Also, we clearly see the role that the government plays in the rescue process. The style used by the author is very journalistic, thus making the book and story very dry in comparison to his other literary works. However, perhaps this style was chosen simply because this is the reality of Colombias daily crisis. The book is excellent, has much eye-opening information and is a wonderful read if you wish to learn more about the socio-economic problems of this great South American country. Arriba Colombia.	2003-01-21

They force one to reflect upon life and the world in general. Although the book is directed toward the black race I am really opposed to that aspect. I think it should be directed toward the \\"human race\\". One's religion, race and beliefs have no bearing when it comes to \\"Actos de fe\\". The book has affirmations and spiritual messages that will uplift anyone in the pursuit of successfully managing a crisis and day-to-day ups and downs of life. Moreover, it's a guide to managing and facing crisis on a personal level. The passages in the book are convincing and are the perfect remedy for a destroyed soul, for a person who is feeling down, for those who are ill and hope to recuperate their health and simply for those who need a little uplifting so that they can survive and face life. It's a great motivational tool that is appropriate for any human being. This book is available in Spanish and English.	2003-01-19

They fall in love, commit to the relationship however, in a false sense because none of them marry her (Tatiana) nor take her out of Cuba, which is her dream, to get of the misery in which she lives. <br />Although each man is different, each means the same to Tatiana the protagonist. In other words, \\"an opportunity\\" and \\"a possible dream about to come true\\". However, Tatiana has the same luck that most Cubans share who have risked their life in search of a better one.<br />The book is very enlightening, well written and paints a real picture of Cuba which has two faces- one for tourists (foreigners) and another for the Cuban people. I recommend this book to those who like to read a variety of different types of literature.	2003-01-18

I used this book when I was teaching elementary school Spanish, grades 1-5 to Hispanic and non-hispanic children and the short stories, practice exercises, crossword puzzles and additional vocabulary really enhanced the students comprehension of the language without overburdening them with grammar and other language technicalities that are more suitable for advanced learners. You will gain a good base in Spanish and have some competent communications skills if you study the book sequentially without jumping ahead because the verbs are taught in a logical pattern which is the most important concept to grasp when learning any language not only Spanish. The book covers the present tense and the simple past tense of &quot;ar&quot;, &quot;er&quot;, &quot;ir&quot; and irregular verbs that must be learnt immediately to be able to converse even at the most basic level. The rest of the book covers grammar topics appropriate for beginners along with the formation of short but correct grammatical phrases. Another bonus is that an answer key is provided at the back of the book which will enable to check your answers as you progress through the lessons. The two downfalls of this workbook include: 1)  it does not include cassette tapes and if you are a beginner and embarking upon self taught study correct pronunciation and phonetics will be challenge so it would be best use this book as a complement to classroom instruction 2) it could have been organized more logically because the current format is not easy for a beginner to follow. However, this is truly a good starter workbook in Spanish. Just be patient with yourself since language learning is a challenge and most of all enjoy the lessons and the short stories as they are quite entertaining. All the best!	2002-12-19

Not only was I pleased with the content and the grammar topics covered in the book but I was particularly impressed with the cultural awareness themes in every chapter, the thorough explanation of the grammar concepts and the opportunity to prepare and discuss controversial themes in Spanish thus allowing to student to develop his/her vocabulary and speaking skills. This edition of Conexiones is a complete course for intermediate to advanced Spanish students and if studied thoroughly, to completion with a competent instructor, the student will have and above average foundation in Spanish which would be beneficial to his/her future studies in the Spanish language.

I find this dictionary to be a good reference and simply can be used to learn new words and expressions. Also because of its size it can be read as book while increasing your vocabulary at your own individual pace. In general Langenscheidt dictionaries are very thorough and complete.

I thought to myself \\"how handy this is the first of its kind\\". This Spanish reference will definitely give you the finishing touches to your Spanish in terms of authenticity and helping your day to day Spanish sound natural and on the level of a native speaker. <br />I bought the book to find out the greatest challenges that students who are studying Spanish face outside of grammatical, pronunciation and phonetic issues. Although the title of the book is: Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish, the topics covered and the information offered is definitely beneficial to the advanced student and to those who have travelled around Latin America or Spain. Chances are these students will have heard the numerous verbs, phrases and expressions used and have had difficulty understanding the meaning, nuance and how to use the verb or expression correctly in everyday speech. <br />The book's intent is to clarify traditional errors that non-native Spanish speakers make and to offer an explanation and the logic behind the usage in Spanish. The book covers a broad range of topics such as: tricksters (also known as false cognates which are words that look similar to an English word but have a completely different meaning),verb usage and key exceptions, tips for correct usage of the subjunctive which always proves to be problematic for non-natives, a special look at sixty-four verbs with a complete analysis of proper usage, key phrases typically used by native speakers, making the right choice of words and anglicisms.<br />The book answers questions that grammar books and dictionaries don't offer. As an educator of the Spanish language I am familiar with and have read numerous reference material in English and Spanish and this is the first of it kind. Finally, a book that focuses on problematic concepts in Spanish that need to be addressed in order to speak correctly, avoid blunders, to know when you have been insulted, increase cultural awareness and to sound as authentic as possible when speaking Spanish. <br />The book is definitely beneficial to those who have advanced knowledge of Spanish and a solid command of its grammar, those who have travelled to several Latin American countries and those who have specific queries about an idiom, verbs, \\"must know\\" vocabulary and terms. I suggest reading the book thoroughly for understanding of the its objective and then re-reading the book with a focus on your own queries that need clarification. I think the book is great and true to its objective, unfortunately I have yet to use the concepts with my students because of their level but it has been put to good use thus far as I enjoy reading it from time to time because it has such a wealth of information beneficial to all. I strongly recommend this purchase to all students and those who have an interest in Spanish. This was a carefully compiled reference material.	2002-08-22

This book cannot be used to learn Spanish however, I would say it serves as a reference for advanced students and teachers. It does not cover all grammar topics and definitely not any complex structures but can definitely act as a handy resource if you are looking to clarify a doubt or if you are in the middle of writing a composition or an essay in Spanish thus not having to consult a text book and search through several chapters and grammar points to hopefully address the one or few queries that you have. As an educator of the Spanish language, I did find it handy because whenever I had a query that can be researched in Buscalo I was able to find what I was looking for within seconds. Some examples of the grammar concepts that the book covers are: verb conjugations, moods- indicative, imperative, subjunctive and their usage, prepositions- por, para, a, de , en etc. , the usage of \\"hay\\", \\"hubo\\", numbers, pronouns of all kinds (subject, prepositional, reflexive), verbs-reflexive vs. non-reflexive, the usage of \\"gustar\\" and like verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. The purpose of the book is to clarify key grammar concepts and the most problematic ones without going into depth on the subject matter. If you are an advanced student, be it high-school or university level, a native speaker or an educator of Spanish, \\"Buscalo\\" will prove beneficial to you for quick, hands on clarifications.

The book is a reflection of the Puerto Rican society in the time when Esmeralda Santiago was a young girl. Therefore, it is true reflection of how many Puerto Ricans lived and struggled to ascertain life's most basic needs. I like the fact that Esmeralda did not leave a pillow unturned while describing family situations, how the father left the family to survive with very little income and lastly their move to NYC in search of better opportunities.<br />The reader can identify with Puerto Rican culture and what it means to be Puerto Rican because of the way Esmeralda describes her life in a language that's very adecuate, full of descriptions and expressions of her deepest sentiments. The beauty and simplicity of her vocabulary facilitates one's understanding of the book, the themes and situations presented. Overall, it is an exemplary memoir that paints a very real description of the ups and downs of the Puerto Rican society in the fifties. I recommend this book to all those who are fond of literature of any kind.<BR>-------<br />Leí este libro hace tres años y  quedé muy impresionada con el tema que ha sido muy bien desarrollado por Esmeraldo Santiago. El libro realmente es un reflejo de la sociedad puertorriqueña en aquella época cuando Esmeralda Santigao era niña. Por lo tanto, es un retrato real de como muchos puertorriqueños vivían y luchaban para tener las cosas más básicas de la vida. Me gustó mucho el hecho de que Esmeralda no escatimó en los detalles al describir los episodios de su familia, de como su papá dejó a la familia para sobrevivir con pocos recursos y finalmente de la mudanza a Nueva York en busca de nuevas oportunidades.<br />La manera en que Esmeralda describe su vida en un lenguaje adecuado, lleno de descripciones y de expresión de sus más profundos sentimientos hace que el lector se identifique con &quot;la cultura puertorriqueña&quot; y lo que significa ser parte de esa cultura siendo puertorriqueño/a o no. La belleza y sencillez de su léxico facilita la comprensión del libro y el entendimiento de los varios temas y asuntos que se presentan. Por lo general, es un libro ejemplar que pinta una descripción muy verdadera de los avatares de la sociedad puertorriqueña en los años cincuenta. Recomiendo este libro a los amantes de la buena lectura.	2002-06-30

It's also key to note that it provides basic vocabulary and phrases in the business scenarios however, if you are looking for more extensive vocabulary another reference should be consulted.

Here are some examples of the range of idioms that are outlined in the book:<br />1) de hecho = in fact (cannot be translated literally)<BR>2) sin embargo = however (cannot be translated literally)<BR>3) a primera vista= at first sight (common, everyday expression. Easy to understand)<BR>4) dar la lata = to make a nuisance of oneself ( cannot be translated word for word, common expression)<BR>5) tener mala pata= to have bad luck (common everyday expression)<br />This book not only contains idioms but everyday short frases that sometimes are hard to express correctly if one has not learned the correct way or has not heard it used prior. An example of this would be #1 and #2 above. These types of short frases are important because they are of everyday usage and the more one knows the more authentic the Spanish will sound. If you are looking to enrich your Spanish regardless of your current level, this book will definitely be of great help and will broaden your overall knowledge and understanding of the language.	2002-05-15

This book is a fascinating journey through the history of the Dominican Republic from the time of recorded discovery by Christopher Columbus in 1492 to present day historical events. &quot;Quisqueya la Bella&quot; is an enlightening historical book that vividly describes the history and culture of a caribbean nation that is usually overshadowed by most historians but whose history, if known and understood, definitely answers the many questions about Dominicans, dominican culture, the Caribbean and caribbean people in general.<br />As a person of caribbean heritage, I consider the study and understanding of any caribbean country of vital importance since all have many elements in common. After my first visit to the DR in 1997 and many thereafter, I realized the immediate need to understand as much as possible about the history and culture of this diverse caribbean nation. <br />Alan Cambeira's book is an eye-opener and definitely answered many questions that I had. It also provided historical and cultural details that were foreign to my knowledege. The book will give you insight to the the mixture of the three cultures that compose the demographic make up of Dominicnas- the Indigenous, the African and the European Spanish, racial issues- which still need to be dealt with today by Dominican themselves, the relationship between the Dominican Republic and Haiti-very controversial, the many years of dictatorship under Trujillo and the present day situation of the country. <br />An added feature of this book was explanation of the &quot;dominicanismos&quot;, language particular to Dominicans that is heard in everyday speech, written in newspapers and magazines and most commonly heard in songs whose meaning is not always understood if you are not a native or have not previously been exposed to dominican culture. <br />Overall the book was well written and is not laden with irrevelant historical dates and details but rather factual, true and educational. Definitely a must read for anyone who plans to visit the DR or has already visited, is of caribbean heritage, Dominicans themselves or simply anyone who would like to learn more about &quot;Quisqueya la Bella&quot;. A wonderful documentation!	2002-04-03

La familia de Lorenzo es tradicional y muy española mientras que la de Marguita es pobre, humilde y vive en Luyanó, el barrio más pobre de la Habana.
