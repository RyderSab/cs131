US	52438999	R20APFAQIOEX58	0374270325	101241499	A Man in Full	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Fantastic	A real social panorama of America, both high and low. This is a much better novel than BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES in my opinion. The characters in A MAN IN FULL have more dimension. This is like a great social novel of the  1800's, a la Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackery. I hate  super-long novels, too, but, except for a couple of brief slow patches, I  found this one to be riveting from the first page to the last.	1998-11-11

Warhol has a sense of humor that makes this fun to read. One thing I think a lot of  readers will wonder about in this book is, Why did Warhol and his  successful friends put up with Halston's side-kick Victor Hugo? Victor Hugo  was merely a male prostitute that Halston used, then befriended and lived  with. And Hugo became part of this fashionable group, but all he ever does  is sponge off Halston, insult people and be rude and destructive...But  still no one kicks him out of the group? Why did Warhol and his friends put  up with this jerk?	1998-11-10

There is not really much new here, but you do get a first hand account of John's beating Cynthia in his violent days, and of her coming upon John and Yoko as their  affair was starting. Interestingly, Cynthia says she noticed something  click between John and Yoko before their affair started, so that she says  SHE (Cynthia) suggested to John that perhaps Yoko was the one for him, even  before John himself seemed to consider it. John told Cynthia what she was  saying was ridiculous...but then of course Cynthia was right...John and  Yoko ended up together. John sued Cynthia over this book, but Cynthia said  he didn't read it, that he didn't know there was little that was offensive  to him in here. And she's right, there is little that would have been  offensive to John in this book..which is...honestly...one of the book's  disappointments! I wanted more dirt!! But it is an engaging read  nonetheless for the die-hard Beatle fan.	1998-11-04

And Martin is so full of himself, John Lennon was right when he complained that those who worked WITH the Beatles thought they WERE the  Beatles. And Martin basically makes that claim when he says, &quot;John and  Paul were the big talents in the Beatles. George, Ringo and I were  also-rans.&quot; To include himself as being as important as George and  Ringo in the Beatles' success shows nauseating conceit. LET IT BE is a  great Beatles album, and Martin had NOTHING to do with its production. The  Beatles might have been successful without George or Ringo, but I doubt  they would have been enduring phenomenons. But I can still see them having  been phenomenons without Martin.	1998-11-02

But this was a very  readable, lucidly written, entertaining and even--toward the end, when  Branson is battling British Air--suspenseful book! His stories of how he just missed going  bankrupt a number of times are both frightening (that such a successful  company came so close to failure so many times) as well as inspiring (that  he managed to escape the financial noose around his neck). This is a book  worth reading.	1998-10-29

And that is one of the things that is wrong with this book. It has a bunch of poems about the Beatles, a bunch of short stories about the Beatles (actually,  the Beatles are only peripherally a part of most of the fiction), so there  is too much that is dryly academic in this book. And then the first-person  pieces are mostly fans' memoirs, that any Beatles fan could write.  Having  said that, I gave the book three stars instead of one or two, mainly  because of a fascinating piece &quot;The Beatles in Tonypandy.&quot; That  what happens in this piece seems rather improbable, is what makes it so  entertaining. The Beatles in the mid-sixties went and stayed with a pigeon  expert in the South of Wales for about six days. This town of Tonypandy was  so remote, no one recognized the Beatles, and they could go about as they  wanted. I don't want to tell the rather odd things that happened during  these six days, because I think it will spoil it for you. But it is a  fascinating piece. Whether it's worth the price of the book, I don't know,  because I checked mine out of the library. But it is great piece to read  for any Beatles fan. The other piece that is interesting in parts is  &quot;Sod Manila!&quot; which includes the article's author witnessing a  conversation between the Beatles in their hotel room in the Phillipines,  when the country was ready to tear them apart for snubbing the Marcoses.  The other pieces (except for a few so-so ones) are ones a flipped quickly  through. So, except for the two gems, this is a dry affair.	1998-10-29

Schaumburg relates entertaining Beatles-related (and  non-Beatles related) incidents he experienced growing up, as well as the  frustrations most kids endure in school and out. One thing I didn't like  about it, though, is that the author is so critical about much of the  Beatles music. He purports to be a big Beatles fan, but says he strongly  dislikes STRAWBERRY FIELDS (that is THE song that made me a Beatles fan. I  can recall the EXACT moment I became a Beatles fan, in fact). He dislikes  BABY YOUR A RICH MAN, another song I love. And it seems that there are not  that many Beatles songs he thinks are great! But the ones he does love, he  is so enthusiastic about, you can enjoy his enthusiam for those songs  fully. This book is an entertaining, readable tome, that also scores points  for being highly original.	1998-10-28

But he really hates America  because America: <br />1)Didn't make him President. <br />2)Didn't give him the  literary reputation of being America's Tolstoy.<br />3)Didn't make him a  legendary movie star.<br />Vidal has pursued all these goals, and fell short  in all of them. Vidal has one of the hugest egos I've ever witnessed (read  Martin Amis' profile of him in Amis' collection THE MORONIC INFERNO). His  egomania comes close to sociopathy. In one of his novels (I forget which)  the hero is named &quot;Eugene&quot; who Vidal describes as something like  &quot;the greatest savior the world had been waiting for.&quot; Vidal's  real first name is Eugene (he changed it to Gore). He was writing about  what he thought of himself. And shame on America for not thinking as  grandly of him as he thinks of himself! THAT is why he knocks America and  exaggerates its foibles to the level of paranoia. Which I don't believe is  real paranoia. I don't think HE thinks America is headed for such ruin. He  just wants to insult the country that he thinks betrayed him by not  worshipping him. Pathetic.	1998-10-27

The man stole a senatorial  election. And how he did it is here in great and gripping detail. This book  illustrates better than almost anything that the TYPE of person who WANTS  to be President is the LAST type of person who SHOULD be president. As U.S.  Grant said, &quot;The best man for the job does not go after the job. He  waits to be called.&quot; Johnson didn't wait to be called to be senator.  He went after it so ruthlessly, he ended up stealing the victory from the  rightful winner. This is absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.  And I've read a boat load of books.	1998-10-22

If you still believe that a conspiracy existed after reading  this book, then you desperately, desperately, desperately WANT a conspiracy  to have existed. I used to believe a conspiracy existed. But then I used to  wonder, how did the cops know to look for Oswald right after the  assassination? I mean, did it just pop into their heads that for SOME  reason a person who looked like Oswald was the assassin? The conspiracy  theorists never addressed this point. I had to read CASE CLOSED to find out  that the reason the cops looked for Oswald is that there was an eye-witness  (visible in photos of Dealy Plaza that day) who SAW Oswald in the window of  the book depository firing away!!! He immediately went to the police and  told them Oswald's description. The conspiracy theorists willfully ignore  this eye-witness, because he utterly blows holes in their theories. (And,  yes, he didn't pick Oswald out of a line-up later. But he  was--ironically--afraid that Oswald was part of conspiracy and that he  would be killed if he picked him. But later he admitted that Oswald was the  one he saw firing the shots.) And there were OTHER eye-witnesses that saw  Oswald in the window, and who saw, too, the gun fired from that window. If  you are a logical, clear-thinker who wants to know how JFK was killed, then  read this book. If you believe there was a conspiracy after reading this  book, then God help you. I don't envy your paranoid, illogical, low IQ  head. In fact, I would bet a million dollars that the average IQ of those  who believe the conclusions in this book is higher than those who don't.  Because I know I would end up a million dollars richer. READ THIS BOOK.	1998-10-22

Sanchez left very nervous. BUT, Keith  has been known to fabricate stories of his own life (like saying his mother  took him for a walk in his pram during WW II, and when they returned to  their house, it was bombed flat by the Germans. ACTUALLY, a piece of brick  from a bombing flew through Keith's window, and landed on his bed. The  house itself wasn't harmed.) So, when you are faced with two fabricators,  who to believe? I don't know myself.

It's a slight  book, but that also is why it is so highly readable, as though a smart and  funny buddy were telling you some anecdotes over some beers. It gives  inside insight into the machinations of the L.A./Show Biz world. It is  funny. And you can feel in the subtext that the writer is DESPERATE that he  have a success soon, or, God forbid, he's going to have to go work for an  advertising agency.

And Salinger at least produced some memorable fiction, and his  books sell year after year, and are taught in schools. Lebowitz's stuff is  basically humour pieces. And she has produced in her multi-decade career  what Dave Berry produces in six months. She does not warrant the acclaim  she has recieved. She admits she finds it very difficult to write. She  said, &quot;When I sit down to write, I get stage fright like people would  get on a TV show. When I'm on TV, I'm as calm as can be.&quot; And she said  if it was as easy to write as it was to talk, she'd have written tons. But  in my opinion, her interviews I've read have been far wittier than the  pieces she's written. So my advice to Fran would be to hang up the pen, and  just dictate everything into a tape machine. You'd produce more, and with  better results. (Her recent &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; &quot;articles&quot;  are really just interviews, and they're great, so that's a start).  Nonetheless, if your expectations aren't too high, there are some amusing  pieces to be found in this book.	1998-09-28

But I was  offended--as a fan of all 4 Doors--at how much Manzarek puts down John  Densmore in it. Every chance Ray has, he gets in a dig against Densmore.  And I was suspect about how much was true about Densmore's being a jerk  (according to Ray), simply because at one point, Ray bascially says that  Densmore was unhappy during the Doors; then later he says, more or less,  &quot;In the last ten years, John hasn't been happy like he was during the  Doors.&quot; Which is it, Ray? Was John happy or unhappy during the Doors??  Or are you just using another chance to knock him? You certainly knock him  a lot in this book.<br />And for Ray to say that Jim Morrison was a kind,  charming, witty person 100% of the time, until he met a friend who was a  bad influence in L.A. who contaminated him, is naive on his part about  Morrison's life before he reached L.A. Morrison displayed the dark, cruel,  substance-abusing side of his personality long before he transferred to  U.C.L.A. Morrison had a good side, and a bad side...his whole life.<br />And  saying we still don't know the details of Morrison's death, belies what  Albert Goldman's PENTHOUSE article a few years ago revealed, all based on  offical Parisian municipal records that heretofore had not been  discovered.<br />And Ray often annoys the reader with his flowery,  pretentious, new-age, earth-child, hippy dippy way of writing/talking that  he has displayed in his interviews. <br />Nonetheless, there is plenty of  interest to the Doors fan in this book.	1998-09-27

The culinary aspects of her unique thrillers are better than ever here, and  she keeps you turning the pages, in the best thriller since Craig Furnas's  THE SHAPE, at the same time that she made me curse the diet I'm on, since  she makes food sound so delectible!	1998-09-23
US	52438999	R2MXKVNS4CT6Q8	0671523082	778118920	Flash	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Excellent	This a perfect thriller for our times about stocks and corporations,  considering the stock market fever that has recently infected our  country...and if you took a hit during the recent stock market crumble,  you'll be able to relate to the anxiety the fight for company stock creates  in this book! It's a page-turner as good as Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE, or  Michael Crichton's DISCLOSURE, and to be highly recommended.	1998-09-17
