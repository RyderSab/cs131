This is not a book about religioun, mercifully, or a book with the ancillary purpose of converting  readers.  Once he begins honestly addressing his gayness, the narrator's  search for the stern, narrow God in his mind becomes a discovery of  something bigger and truer than he imagined.  He might name what he finds  &quot;a state of grace&quot;; other phrases that would apply would be  &quot;self-actualization,&quot; &quot;Nirvana,&quot; or &quot;the meaning  of life.&quot;  I hope this review doesn't turn off anti-religion readers  -- this book itself is rather anti-religion while focusing on universal  truths.	2000-06-22

I usually think that a book suffers by becoming a movie, but this would not -- I too kept thinking that it would make a  better movie than novel due to Mr. Lord-Wolff's extensive reliance on plot  and things visual.  But the book has no sense of humor or irony about it at  all, and has no ending.  Open -ended non-endings work well in fiction that  relies more on character development, but in a story like this, where plot  is the entire impetus of the book, unresolved questions and ending in the  middle of things don't succeed.	2000-03-09

The problems I had were:  A few times I felt his prose turned a little purple, especially with some of the internal ramblings of Grace; I wondered about Henry's motives in how  he related to Martin at the end of the story; and I stumbled over Martin's  reaction to the news that his mother killed his father.  I didn't find  enough background, or motive, or psychological basis for his extreme  behavior.  But the main character, Grace, was well-wrought enough to carry  the story as a whole, and it is clear that Mr. Ridgway is a perceptive and  sensitive writer.  I will definitely keep my eye out for his next work.	2000-01-28

In this age of really intelligent ghost stories (Sixth Sense, Blair Witch, e.g.), _Something Dangerous_  seemed weak in comparison.  But _SD_ was not a ghost story!  Or was it?   Even that's not terribly clear.  Jonathan, Richard, Nicholas et al seemed  very stock.  Where I personally wanted to story to go was into the real  evil behind the ouija board (the ghost of Richard's mother?) and into the  minds of the 2 main characters.  For instance, Richard's personality  problem (and subsequent power?) gets explained away much too glibly for my  taste.	1999-11-30

In _Dream Boy_ his prose was RIGHT ON and often wobbled on the line between lush sensuality and histrionics.  In _My Drowning_ every phrase and  sentence and anaolgy was RIGHT ON.  In _Comfort and Joy_ -- I dunno.  The  novel was laced with schmaltzy moves and over-the-top similes.  I still  enjoyed it, ultimately, because of that engaging seductiveness, but I was  continuously jerked out of my suspended disbelief into a sort of  'disbelief' that really read something as corny as what I just read.  I  would suggest this book to anybody who had a tolerance of periodic  preciousness:  with that caveat, though.	1999-11-09

I didn't find the characters particularly engaging or deep and the most interesting thing about the plot  was the fact that this nelly little queen-to-be gets dropped into the lives  of a gay male couple.  Then, almost as a fun extra, Mr. Downing gets to  explore the meaning of family, gay and non-gay, and he does so without ever  seeming pedantic.  Another interesting tributary was a lambent treatment of  how two &quot;masculine&quot; gay men deal with Scot's unabashed,  unrestrainable effeminacy.  Maybe not deep and thorough, but just enough to  fit the story he told:  it opened up quickly and unobtrusively toward the  end of the novel when Scot observed that he might not be gay and that his  effeminacy might be an acting out of other issues.  That was a very good  move on Mr. Downing's part.	1999-11-08

Everybody but Scot seemed a bit two  dimensional, but the book was still fun and Mr. D did try to approach some  serious issues:  homophobia among gay people, stereotypes among supposedly  liberal enlightened people, the need to define for ourselves what  constitutes a &quot;family,&quot; the different ways people grieve loss.   And I thought he succeeded.  I tend to like books that shake my foundations  and _Breakfast with Scot_ did not, in particular, do that.  But it was  interesting and readable and recommendable.	1999-11-04

Mr. Mendelsohn sure does have an ambitious idea in this book, but it didn't succeed for me.  If all the ideas he put forth were as deeply explored as his treatment of classical literature motifs at the beginning  of the book, I would have loved it.  It also would have been 3 times  longer.

Entertainment AND pertinence -- I wish more American  writers could fuse the 2 half as masterfully as DFW.   _BI_ is structurally  amazing, too:  nobody else could construct DFW's lengthy sentences and  always, consistently, remain crystal clear.

Mr. Swanson's simple, engaging style made the actual reading easy, and the need to find out what is going on in Christian's life was so great, I could only zip  through the story without the brakes.  The present tense/past tense  alternating flashbacks and present narrative has been done quite enough,  IMHO, but it certainly didn't detract anything from this novel.  I went  through it a 2nd time just to pick up some of the details I whizzed by the  first time and that was definitely worth the effort.  Although this is a  short book, it isn't too short or lacking structure, development, or  detail.  Mr. Swanson has told a complete story in just the right amount of  time and space.	1999-08-26

This collection of short stories I loved almost as much.  Mr. H can,  technically, set up sentences that are complicated and still lucid.   Artistically, he can designate a character with an amazing minimum of  details;  it's like he knows just the right characteristics to show you to  make his characters stand out.  None of his characters are perfect, and  most are struggling with growing older and being lonely, but I cared about  all of them.  Joshua, in &quot;Blorts,&quot; for example, was hilarious.   Morgan, in &quot;Petunias,&quot; was self-absorbed and afraid, but  struggling to rise above it all and even though the story is tragic, it  still ends on a mystifyingly hopeful sentence.  Mr. Holleran might not  churn out novels every year, but when he does put one out, I'm always  deeply affected by it.  I wonder, though, why no author's picture on book  jackets?	1999-05-26

US	51760392	R2C0BSN384SYWR	0670883565	555286470	The Spell	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Okay...	There are just some writers whom I know are excellent craftsmen, whom I just can't stand to read.  I've come to the conclusion that Hollinghurst is one.  When _Swimming Pool_ came out, all my friends adored it and I  struggled to get through it, figuring I was missing something.  Now, I had  the same struggle to force myself to complete _The Spell_.<br />I don't  exactly know what it is:  his odd jumps in time and perspective (I loved it  when DFW did this in _Infinite Jest_), or his muddled point of view.  It is  a sort of wavering omniscient point of view, and it really jarred me to  suddenly find myself hearing the thoughts of a character that until now was  merely shown and allowed to speak.  Or maybe it was the characters  themselves.  I found very little about any of these people to like.  Alex,  arguably the main character, is likeable enough in his one or two facets --  he is observed to be &quot;nice&quot; and to lack a swollen ego.  Danny  starts off very affable and interesting and proceeds to become a fairly  insufferable little egomaniac.  There was nothing I liked about either  Robin or Justin, and plenty that irritated me.  People have criticized old  Ethan Mordden for seeming to say that only incredibly attractive, fit men  are interesting or engaging enough to write about.  At least in Mordden's  stories his characters ARE interesting and engaging.  Can't say that about  these guys in _The Spell_.<br />Nobody could say, though, that Holinghurst  doesn't manipulate the language like a master.  The book if full of gems.   One that stands out in my mind is when both Alex and Robin are admiring  Justin from the back and the author puts it:  &quot;It was love's clear  thrilled focus on its object in a blurred irrelevant field.&quot; [p. 59]    In context that sentence is both hilarious and devastating, but to tell  more would be to give away too much of the plot.	1999-05-10

I guess they mean the self-tortured protagonists  of Holleran and White and Picano and Peck and Monette.  I offered this book  as a remedy for their pique.<br />There is some description of the torture of  growing up gay (and it is exquisite), but, in this book, I promise that you  would have felt gypped without experiencing that aspect of the narrator's  life.  But there is also, for example, &quot;The Fine Art of Sighing&quot;  and &quot;Train of Thought,&quot; two short pieces that have nothing to do  with gayness or angst or turmoil; &quot;Train of Thought&quot; made me  weepy without a tragic incident anywhere in sight:  the sheer beauty of the  language moved me so much.<br />It's not hard to believe that Cooper spends  hours and hours over one sentence.

Liam's struggle is to grieve the loss of his lover without knowing how.  The invention of Bike Boy and all his subsequent activities to me  were painfully obvious attempts at keeping grief at bay: all of it seems  designed to keep moving, keep talking, keep diverted, do anything except  authentically mourn his loss.<br />I thought Hartnett wrote a strong, moving  novel about struggling, confused people.

There is  much more to this story.<br />First of all, it's good clean fun.  There is  sex, and it's pertinent and romantic.  There is melodrama and predictable  plot moves, but they're somehow superceded by Jensen's energetic use of  detail and the sheer speed of this book.  And there are subtle strokes and  delineations throughout that almost get by you:  without giving anything of  the plot away, I could say it's remarkable how Jensen makes clear the deep  need for love and companionship which motivates the person who turns out to  be the villain of the story.  The story moves easily from the savage to the  subtle and the author's skill with both is deft.<br />Appropriate to his  topic, Mr. Jensen comes off as an folk-tale-type story teller, weaving  narrative for the pure enjoyment of it. I had the same experience of the  reader directly below me:  once I picked up _Frontiers_, I was 3/4 of the  way finished in no time.  The author's writing style is as smooth and  readable as anybody since David Leavitt.  Great, great fun.	1999-04-14

Like his mother before him, he has a doppelganger that often carries on a  life apart from him.  At first the eerie poem incantations from his old  Irish aunt is his only apotropiac.  Later in the book some mysterious  characters called &quot;sojourners&quot; appear that never quite get  explained, but are spookier for their vagueness.  The best part of this  idea was that it was only together that Kevin and the double form a  &quot;whole human being.&quot;  The narrative then sets off in the  direction of their union (one thinks).<br />If this were all the story, I  would have liked it much better.  But to this, the author tries to add less  supernatural dimensions to the doppelganger theme with a alcohol and drug  addiction subplot.  And, admittedly, a writer would have to delve far and  deeply into the psychology of addiction to write anything eye-popping on  that topic after David Foster Wallace's phenomenal _Infinite Jest_.<br />But  Mr. Bowes is a good writer.  I just thought there were two or three  distinct books here, much more disjointed than Kevin person and Fred the  doppelganger.	1999-04-12

I now know more about Venice than I ever wanted.<br />__Night Letters__ reads far  too much like a travelogue for my taste.  Dessaix sets up a narrative  triangle between a) extended, poetic, ornate detail of Venice and his other  travel spots; b) some heart-wrenching  expressions of his own struggle with  newly realized mortality; and c) fun old-world type tales of love, betrayal  and histrionics.  I am tempted to think that he wanted the actual  travelogue/architecture/geography aspect to be indespensible to the rest of  the story (Broadkey did this very successfully in__Profane Friendship__),  but for me, in__Night Letters__, it was gratuitous and destracting.  Think  about it:  pondering your impending corporeal collapse in delapidated old  Venice -- maybe a little obvious?<br />If you find yourself with this book,  linger on the personal and historical narrative and skim the rest.	1999-04-01

That was brought home to me in a new way with  Halluncinating Foucalt.  At first I assumed I was reading, basic,  contempory, post-modernist fiction.  But within the first 50 pages or so I  began to realize that Patricia Duncker's characters and plot were  deliberately singular.  The anonymous narrator; his hysterically funny,  intense paramour (equally anonymous, known only because of her study of  Schiller, as &quot;The Germanist&quot;); the insane author Paul Michel,  whose life long obsession with Foucault is ostensibly the novel's key: are  all very subtly drawn symbols of certain types of people, i.e., readers and  writers of fiction or philosophy.  As the narrative progresses with  inevitability and predictability, the charactors become symbols of those  genres of writing themselves.  Once I realized this, called myself a  hopelessly bourgeois pig-man and looked at it again, many things that had  begun to annoy me about the book fell into place -- specifically, the  narrator's one-dimensionality and some rather heavy-handed plot moves.   (The Germanist's history and ultimate role in the plot to liberate the  instutionalized Michel, even still, was a strain on the suspension of  disbelief.)<br />Still, once I could look at the novel as deliberately  sidestepping many typical narrative mechanisms, I enjoyed it a great deal.   Ms. Duncker has written a mystifying book, no matter how you approach it.   Its questions about devotion and loyalty and passion and sanity will, as  another reader put it, stayed with me long after I put it down and went on  to other, more conventional fiction.	1999-03-31

But when I'd closed the  book at the last page, I had the feeling I'd just watched a marathon run of  a daytime soap opera.  In fact, except for the homosexuality of the central  character, Theo, and his spouse, Sam, the whole thing could have easily  been a plot for The Guiding Light.  And the characters themselves, with the  exception of Susan Zack, Theo's daughter's mother, seemed rather stock to  me:  especially Theo, whose central conflict between a noble career and a  home life, offered nothing new on the subject.<br />All in all, I think our  fiction ought to do more (or at least different) things from our sit-coms  and soap operas.	1999-03-08

In between, House really sets up  an interesting story of unwanted people (strays?) more desperate for love  than they realize.  He touches on AIDS, but doesn't dwell on it which was  perfect for this story.  The title hints at the subtle (Harris) and  horrendous (Adrian) ways men abuse each other when all they really want is  affection.
