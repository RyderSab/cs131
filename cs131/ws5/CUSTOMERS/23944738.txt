Quinones Miller's fourth novel, &quot;Ida B.&quot; regales readers with the lives of several long-term occupants of a high-rise subsidized tenement known as the Ida B. Barrett Wells Tower located in Harlem, New York. Home to its residents, Brenda, Sharif, Rosa, and several others, for over two decades; these tenants have created an unbreakable bond closer than that of most biological families as each has faced judgment, personal failure, and ridicule from a cast of neighborhood peers. <br />  <br /> Brenda Carver, a twenty-five year old, single mother of four is currently receiving assistance from the government to make ends meet. Her four illegitimate children, four &quot;baby daddies&quot;, and lack of support is the least of her problems. Brenda's biggest set back lies in her highly dependent nature and her habitual indecisiveness. Her dream of becoming an author is constantly being railroaded, not due to her intelligence, but to her lack of follow through. Everything Brenda tries to accomplish get derailed, including a concrete storyline for her dream novel. As Brenda faces her personal struggles, she must also keep an eye on the future of her oldest son Bootsy, who has witnessed a crime that may cost him his life. With her comfort zone becoming increasingly tattered, Brenda's reality may have to be dealt with sooner, rather than later. <br />  <br /> Known as the neighborhood saint, Sharif Goldsby is a man who will stand up and fight for the downtrodden. His labor of love towards others range from creating petitions, organizing marches, and even making personal phone calls to those in decision-making capacities. Sharif is usually the first one notified when trouble occurs. His life has been devoted to making Ida B. a better living community for all, even when faced with horrible accusations regarding his sexual preference. Ultimately Sharif is placed in a position where his personal judgment becomes unsettling causing hurtful situations to resurface and a severe life altering choice to be made. <br />  <br /> Karen E. Quinones Miller has transported readers into a small community unbeknownst by many, but respected by all who come in contact. Filled with comedy, drama, heartfelt scenes, and realism, &quot;Ida B.&quot; is truly an enjoyable, self-relating, and most of all a unforgettable novel. <br />  <br /> -Monique Baldwin-Worrell, founder of Flavah Reviewers	2004-07-23

The truth of the matter is - He really does.  <br />&quot;Forged In The Fire - Shaped By The Master&quot; speaks to the issue of heart matters by bringing readers face to face with reality - we are ordinary people who can be used by God.  How and to what degree depends upon the condition of the heart.<br />Author, Tim Burns has presented a study that invites its participants to the table of choice and self examination.  Throughout this twelve week course the lives of four men chosen by God to lead Israel are examined.  It is the presentation of the lives of King David, Joseph, King Saul and King Hezekiah that we come to see a little, (if not a lot) of ourselves.  <br />Many today are hard pressed to see how biblical circumstances can be applied to their stressful conditions.  &quot;Forged In The Fire - Shaped By The Master&quot;, through practical application, skillfully speaks to those concerns.  <br />As with the aforementioned rulers, we too have choices.  Examining circumstances and choices made by the biblical leaders shows the consistency of human nature and the faithfulness of God.   David and Joseph sought to serve God with pure hearts.  Saul and Hezekiah deviated from righteousness causing other to suffer the consequence of their choices.  God's response to each upheld the righteousness of His eternal word.  As it was then, it is now.  <br />Regardless of your station in life and level in your spiritual walk, &quot;Forged In The Fire - Shaped By The Master&quot; clearly shows that God has chosen you and wants you to chose a right relationship with Him.<br />-Dr. Linda F.

Even before enrolling into Edwin Carver Science and Technology University, Eva had her sights set on becoming a member of Beta Gamma Psi, an elite sorority where only the best need apply. With stars in her eyes, and the desire to sport Greek paraphernalia in her heart, Eva can't shake the thought of following family tradition of shouting the Beta call and enjoying the benefits of being a fellow sister.

Everything if your name is Creola Pittman Colon.  &quot;Born With A Broken Heart&quot; is a work that could only be brought forth from the depths of the type of loving not often demonstrated in today's world.   <br />Ms. Colon's type of love is one that moves beyond the borders of self-preservation.  It is one that reaches out to touch lives of persons she will never meet.  From inception, &quot;Born With A Broken Heart&quot; plunges the reader into the hardship of sharecropping life.  A life hard yet not recognized by the youth until `quiet whispers' and age brings them face to face with reality.  Reality for the Pittman family is that they are `cuhs-ed' (cursed).  Recollections as far back as the 1940s tell of the bad blood passed on to a majority of the male children of the Pittman family.   <br />With great detail Creola Colon takes us on a journey that begins with her exceptional memories at age five in Mossy Island, Mississippi, to present day.  Through hardship entwined with brief periods of joy Ms. Colon's candid portrayal of a hard-lived life is one of encouragement.   Hers is a life plagued with ongoing loss of male family members, taking on the rearing of siblings, loss of her several of her children, a bad marriage and career disappointment.  Ms. Colon places her trust in God to help her through.  This trust in God brings about miracles into the lives of suffering children.  It is through her faith she comes to realize that God is in control. <br />Relayed details of her daily dance with survival will cause readers to shake off cloaks of self-pity to see the tenacity of a woman on a mission.  Ms. Colon's resolve to put an end to the demon stalking her family creates an insatiable drive for truth.  Instinct tells her the answer lies within elders whose silence tells more than their tight lips.  Despite opposition we see her gathering decades of information to compile for research as well as willingly airing family secrets with medical professionals in hopes of ending illness claiming the male seed of her family.   <br />&quot;Born With A Broken Heart&quot; is not just a book that gives us a look at the devastation of a heart condition known as heterotaxy.  It is a tale that shows the beauty and strength of a bonded family.  The Pittman women are ones to be admired and uplifted for the courage to face the births of children who may be Born With A Broken Heart.<br />-Dr. Linda F.

How many times as women have we met a man that we thought was &quot;the one&quot;, only to be left behind with the nagging question of &quot;what in the hell just happened here&quot;?<br />Mitchell Stone, a financial analyst, and Nikki Coleman, an associate director in promotions, are both seeking solace in the dating game. Mitchell is looking for more than just a one night stand, he's looking for a committed relationship, while Nikki is comfortable with her nocturnal &quot;stress&quot; relievers. Even though she and Mitchell have been seeing each other for a few months, he is jut too &quot;nice&quot; for her. For that reason Nikki has never considered the two of them ever being more than just friends.  Once confronted by Mitchell about their lukewarm friendship Nikki shuts him down without giving it a second thought, maybe losing out on the best thing that has ever happened to her.<br />Tired of being rejected and placed in the &quot;can I lean on you for advice&quot; category when seeking a meaningful relationship that lasts longer than a few hours, Mitchell decides to trade in his &quot;Nice Guy&quot; qualities for the ultimate unwritten guide on how to be the best dog that you can be. Searching for the best professional help with his decision, Mitchell decides to put together a &quot;Playa's Ball&quot; consisting of males who are known to possess the skills to enhance his next move. The only problem with this is all that glitters isn't gold, finding out what true playas really go through may not be as easy and rewarding as it seems.<br />When I first read the synopsis was I hoping that the author would be able to shed some light on the issue of what triggers a man to become a dog without harping on which gender is to blame. C. Kelly Robinson has thoroughly enhanced &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; with personal perspectives from both the female and the male mind. The best part came when each character found themselves in positions where they reaped what they sowed. Positive or negative the finalities were on point and had me questioning my own contributions in previous relationships, reminding me that regardless of gender &quot;every dog has its day&quot;.<br />-Monique Baldwin-Worrell, founder of Flavah Reviewers	2004-04-27

Candace Turner is a successful, independent business owner who is quickly approaching thirty, but can't seem to find love, no matter how hard she searches for it. Life has lost its luster and often causes the caterer to find solace in junk food, television, and her dog Lady's companionship. The big and beautiful Spelman graduate makes it clear that a mate to her liking would be someone she could take pleasure in showing of in society circles. In fact, that's what leads her to reject Jeff White, an intriguing UPS driver who makes his interest in Candace known, despite her firing off an arsenal of insults to scare him off, at every opportunity she can manage. After awhile, Candace admits to herself that Jeff possesses many of the qualities other suitors don't, but faults him for not being ambitious enough and settling to deliver packages for a living. After ruling Jeff out, her adventures in dating are typically nightmares that leave her sipping her favorite liquor, chewing out the person who fixed her up on a blind date, and ultimately puts her in the frame of mind to be willing to settle for Mr. Right Now. The only appeal Mr. Right Now has is financial stability, and never anything more. In time, conflict ensues and settling becomes a daunting task. Candace may be too feisty to keep her mouth shut and \\"behave\\" for too long. Agreeing to play a role that someone else has scripted for her won't work in her world, or will it?<br />Candace's rocky love life is just one of her many problems. Her eccentric mother is capable of irritating Candace at every turn. Add Biranda-one of her best friend's with a secret that ultimately destroys her, to the mix, and a dash of Dorothy-her other best friend who turns up engaged to a white man- and you've got a recipe for constant cat fights. No one can get along in Candace's life and everyone has issues. Peace is something that Candace craves but can't manage to possess, so she finds herself fantasizing about things she would say or do, to escape the never-ending circle of confusion.<br />By the tenth chapter, Ms. Usher grabs the reader and won't let go. Time spent admonishing Candace for her shallow beliefs evolves into time spent admiring the best parts of her character. We ultimately discover Candace is deeper than she initially appears and is fighting to come to terms with issues that have weighed her down for too long. A host of surprising events turn this novel into a page-turner that has all of the elements of a good daytime soap opera. By the time the episode is over, Candace finds her way out of the maze of unfound love and her drama-filled life calms to a lull.

Gregory Bernard Banks blends introspective poetry with short stories to tell a range of tales from various points of view. The theme of this collection is tied to crossroads in life in which people are presented with quandaries, weaknesses, hurts, and a host of vulnerabilities. The reader is left to discern reality from fantasy as each tale unfolds and abruptly ends with a conclusion that implies a point, but is typically not clearly defined.<br />In many tales, the story begins with a character who is consumed by a troubled mind, but ends with an unexpected resolution that the reader could never anticipate. The end of each tale often takes on a quality that is mixed with science fiction, fantasy, or some place outside of the realm the real world. The book begins with Jacob- a boy who found himself making a decision whether or not to commit murder, and ends with Warren- a ninety-three-year-old man who routinely rocks in a rocking chair, until his death. Here, we see the author conjuring thoughts of life being a full-circle in which a beginning of our existence ultimately comes to an unavoidable end. Mr. Banks has indeed created a niche for himself and also uses detailed descriptions to do so. His ninety-one-page book is a mystifying read that has components of the X Files and is dashed with a flavor that proves to be in a category of its own. In fact, words can't quite describe it. Experiencing the journey is the only way to grasp each crossroad, through the author's dark, haunting literary eye.<br />Andrea Blackstone, author of &quot;$chemin': Confessions of a Gold Digger&quot;<BR>Flavah Reviewer	2004-04-23

Carter, Robert Armstrong, a college professor, is confronted with that very question; when the love of his life Rose dies shortly after giving birth to the sustenance of her completion.  Robert and Rose had tried unsuccessfully to become pregnant and carry full term with no success.  Each attempt was not without risk.  For Robert, there was no decision to be made; Rose was all he needed to sustain his life.  But for Rose, life would never be complete without the sound of a child's crying or laughing resounding in their home. There was nothing Robert wouldn't do for his Rose.  For Rose, there was nothing she wouldn't give for the sake of fulfilling her longing for motherhood; even if it meant death.  They were as close as any husband and wife could be and there were no secrets between them.  Or, were there?   <br />In the wake of Rose's death, a new chapter of life emerges:  Rosetta Love or, Seta as she was later christened.  Her life would symbolize the beginning and the end of many things destined to unfold.  Rose had a secret she never intended to share with Robert but all things reveal themselves in time.

In that instant, Robert's obsessive love of the only living memory left of his beloved Rose, would soon become the object of his hatred and contempt.  <br />In this spellbinding book of love, loss, rejection, and salvation, the characters take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions all demonstrating the various sacrifices surrounding a single soul who would never fully know the impact she made on many lives.  &quot;Sacrifice the One&quot; provides its readers with great suspense and intrigue; revealing shocking family secrets.

In the book &quot;A Matter of Attention&quot;, by Torrance Stephens, the dialogue between friends takes place in an intellectually semi-hood fashion.  This book is not for the easily offended.  Stephen's tantalizing word choice spans a broad spectrum of street rawness to scholarly linguistics that will have some reaching for a dictionary or thesaurus at best.  Stephen's vivid imagery ensnares the essence of risqué dialogue standing on the edge of a cliff and destined to soar with reflections on everything from stolen motherland philosophies to Nietzsche. <br />The main character is Gash, a prolific writer who takes you on a mental mission rather than a trip.  Through his mental stream of consciousness, the reader is given a firsthand account of a man filled with expression only lacking love.  Hanging out with his boys Willie, Fontain, and Monroe, Gash meets an intriguing woman that manages to rattle his chain in a manner he thought impossible.  Through his encounters with the lovely Margarita, Gash gets caught in a web of love entangling self, Margarita, and another man whose been watching their affair unfold in disdain.  <br />&quot;A Matter of Attention&quot; is definitely not one to sleep on.  Torrance Stephens has much to say and certainly not lacking the words to say it. His bold style of storytelling provides the reader with a conscious awareness worthy of recognition.

The author stimulates the reader's intellect and reason by dissecting what power is, how one arrives at owning it, and explains how it should be properly handled. Her expertise as a registered nurse and dynamic speaker reveals itself as her lesson in how to empower yourself unfolds in seven chapters that leads toward light, healing, and self-discovery.  Ms. Jones often incorporates poetry and quotes to set the stage for what will follow in a given chapter. This prepares the reader to refocus and think on a new topic that spans from a discussion of personal effectiveness to financial fitness. The author addresses key issues which many people struggle with at some point in life. In fact, her style is akin to a counselor who is educating a client on how to gain an improved perspective on relating to others effectively while retaining their identity.  <br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is need of a private pep talk. The author organizes her work in a manner that does not allow for a reader to speed through the pages, but rather consider her reminders and take heed. Ms. Jones challenges the reader by leaving him or her to ponder something critical that dovetails with owning peace or healing. Occasionally, a single line or lesson jumps out to the reader, while other times it creeps up and settles in slowly. During these times, I felt the need to retrace the author's words, assess my own feelings, and then mark the given passage for future reference. If you need a reminder regarding how much power you truly own, read this author's book to refresh your memory.

Untouched by progress, Sugartree is no stranger to the invisible caste system that separates the arrogance of the wealthy from its hapless victims who are forced to do their bidding.  <br />Enter the Beauvilles, four sons of an eccentric millionaire whose controlling nature reaches beyond the grave to direct a future that he cannot attend. The terms of Pierre Beauville's will can be construed as the machinations of a sick, twisted, demented mind,  depending on your point of view, but it is also ironclad and legally binding. <br />In order to secure their thirty million dollar inheritance each son must marry a woman whose name is on the list one month after the youngest son's twenty first birthday. In addition the marriage must last a minimum of three years to fulfill Pierre's bizarre contractual stipulations. <br />The promise of such a bounty is not the only reason for acquiescing to Pierre's indomitable will. For Shell Davis, it is her ticket to legitimacy as an unwed soon-to-be-mother. Backwoods Tammy Duyden will earn the respectability that her teaching profession cannot give her.

What starts out as crazy eventually leads John into realizing that here lies a human being who is incapable of rescuing himself from the mire of his many different personalities. <br />Often eccentric, but totally without apology, Junebug's bizarre behaviour strikes a resonant chord within John who sets out to become Junebug's savior. Upon Junebug's release, and with John's outside connections firmly in place, Junebug is finally on target to get his life back in order. <br />But life on the outside doesn't come without its challenges.

With pressures steadily rising and the re-emergence of his many different personalities, one wonders if the power of friendship and love can help Junebug overcome his mental disorder once and for all. <br />Delores Thornton's &quot;Anybody Seen Junebug?&quot; stresses the age-old cliche that no man is an island.

But unlike his mother, Melissa, Cordell has never had any reason to believe in the God that she serves. That is, until trouble on the streets finds Cordell hitching a ride on the church bus. In a temporary effort to seek sanctuary from the mean streets and a chap named Ivan, Cordell's life is about to be dramatically altered.   <br />    <BR>A stutterer all of his life, Cordell's chance visit to church turns into a life-changing experience.

When reading an individual fiction or non-fiction novel, we rarely come across several characters that are forever seared like a hot brand into the deep recesses of our minds. Characters that refuse to be ignored, neglected, or easily forgotten.  The Honey Well, by Gloria Mallette, has boasted such characters, giving elaborate meaning to the words misguided, selfish, demented, and just outright triflin'.<br />Pledging to take down anyone that gets in her way, Esther Rayford is a woman regarded by many as the &quot;queen&quot;. &quot;Queen Esther&quot; claims to have a heart, but it is a cold, voided, useless organ when it comes to her and her money. Abuse stemming from her childhood to the nightmare involving her husband enables Esther to become the woman she is today. Starting out 16 years ago with continued persistence and seven rules, number one and seven being &quot;Don't **** with my money&quot;, Esther is now the proud owner of &quot;The Honey Well&quot;. &quot;The Honey Well&quot; is a brothel known for it's classy demeanor and top class clients. Her most treasured, senior employee is Arnell, her daughter, whom she turned out at the young age of sixteen.<br />Arnell is caught in the all too frequent dysfunctional realm, one that her mother has created and refuses to release her from.  Whether it be prostitution, black mail, or revenge, Arnell can not seem to pull away from her mother's destructive claws.  Vowing to rid herself of her mothers troubled life, Arnell manages to obtain her bachelor's degree and start a freelance editing company while stuck in the never-ending abyss of hell, the one the &quot;Queen&quot; has carved out for her. Hoping to get away from her past and never look back, Arnell has met James, her soon-to-be husband. James is unaware of Arnell's double life, something &quot;Queen Esther&quot; uses to her advantage.<br />James, a politician in the making, has chosen Arnell to be his wife.  With a love that is sincere and strong, much like his personality, James is ready to marry Arnell and to live happily ever after. Realizing a little too late, that his soon-to be mother-in-law is as ruthless as Arnell has frequently told him, James gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar, but not until Esther has reached out and tainted his life too...<br />Trena, a promiscuous sixteen year old who has no reality of life's engulfing adversities, is currently being raised by her sister, Cheryl, due to her mother's demanding job schedule.  Trena has had all that she is going to take and decides to runaway after an upsetting incident involving her sister and her mother, Maxine. Unaware that she is falling into a life that should not be subjected to a young girl, Trena runs right into the arms of &quot;The Honey Well&quot;.  Only to find out the hard way, a child should stay in a child's place.<br />The Honey Well, by Gloria Mallette is definitely an entertaining read. A true page turning experience due to the combination of such characters as Esther, the &quot;Queen Bee&quot;, Arnell, the misguided daughter, James, a typical man surrounded by temptation, and Trena, a lost child caught in this warped circle.  Gloria Mallette starts out with a bang in her prologue all the way to the last page, leaving readers open to find out what will happen to every last one of her characters. As we all know, no empire is untouchable, but who will be the chosen one to take the &quot;Queen&quot; down..<br />Monique Baldwin, Founder<BR>Flavah Reviewers	2004-01-21

Rare as it is, Ms. Leonard-Conger as successfully stated her point of view while probably ruffling the feathers of many who do not subscribe to her brand of candor.  At times her views, though founded in truth, rings of systemic rhetoric used to demean rather than educate. <br />Don't Call Me African American is one woman's journey through life many will call odd.  Shared memories and relayed recollections contradict such notions.  Moreover, it slaps the definition of Prima Facie (presumed to be) left and right.

When a friendship becomes filled with envy; when greed and lust overpower Godly senses, allowing flesh to take hold of the spirit within; and when you find yourself entangled in a web of malice, you have been breached.  Meet Grace and Jana, two women - one-time best friends, whose only compatibility has become the history they shared. Like fire and ice, Grace and Jana are completely opposites, and these differences are what drew them close, ultimately, tearing them apart. <br />Rosalind Stormer, author of Healing the Breach does an excellent job exploring the complexities of a friendship plagued with jealousy and selfishness.  The books' characters take you on a journey to a place many of us dare not seek truth for fear of what we may find...our souls.  <br />Caught up in the spirits of jealousy and selfishness, Jana is moving fast on her path to self-destruction while Grace continues to move forward in her quest for a deeper relationship with God. Unable to understand the countless misfortunes arising in her life, Jana secretly despises Grace for her good fortune and continued blessings. Jana defends her ill treatment of Grace during her high and low points and in spite of it all, Grace continues to excuse Jana's shoddy behavior until finally, she can take no more. After years of encouraging Jana to give God a try, Grace has decided it's time to walk away. What happens when a now defunct friendship of nearly 30 years is forced to face the painful truths surrounding malevolent deeds? Can years of bitterness and anger be overcome? Can forgiveness bring closure to the pain so that two spirits can begin to heal the breach? Only the defining moment of accountability will decide.  <br />Healing the Breach is a wonderfully written Christian fiction novel that brings a heightened awareness of self to the forefront. Within us all is the spirit of God's light. Without it, we are destined to a world of darkness. Rosalind Stormer presents Christian fiction on a profound level full of insight.  Anyone who has ever been the victim or culprit in a web of destructive envy will definitely walk away from this book with a new outlook on the ties that bind us to one another in our circle of friends.
