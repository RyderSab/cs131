The love angle was thankfully downplayed because it wasn't very believable anyway.  There wasn't enough time for the characters to form any kind of relationship.  In general, the story just seems dated (it is the early 70's I suppose)... I can hardly believe that some intrepid police inspector failed to notice key evidence that night putting the true murderess behind bars.  Or surely forensic science would have solved the case preventing the mother from going to a mental institution.<br /><br />Readers would be better off reading something with a little more backbone... Agatha  Christie or P.D. James.	2004-09-28

We own the movie starring Judy Garland... my 8 and 5  year old both enjoy that movie and are meserized by the whole tornado event and what happens thereafter.  So, when I stumbled upon the hardcover edition at the library book sale, I bought it, and they couldn't wait to read it!  The story kept them riveted!  The funnest part was seeing what was different in the novel than was depicted on screen in the Hollywood version.  I also bought some of the sequels, and the kids are begging to continue!  L. Frank Baum sure knew his audience!	2004-04-27

I came across this book at the public library, and I brought it home because the bread recipes looked wholesome and delicious... and because I was intrigued by the casserole bread chapter.  I never saw so many recipes using that method!  I tried a casserole rye/potato bread and we all thought it was delicious, and I esp. appreciated the lack of kneading it really saves on time.<br />This book is now in my wish list for Christmas....

I was pulled right into the drama of this one man's life... and death.  This is a short insightful little gem of a book.  It is real.  This could be about my own uncle or grandfather.  I loved it and especially enjoyed how Albom depicts heaven as a place where the meaning of your life is explained to you... that even when you feel you have wasted your time on Earth... you really haven't because you inadvertently have affected the lives of everyone you ever come in contact with.<br />I am passing this book on to my mom, and a few more friends after that.  It is well worth your time to read this book!	2003-10-28

I had a great time reading the sequal to Bridget Jones' Diary.  There were a few passages where I found myself laughing out loud (but perhaps fewer than the first novel) and that is always a pleasure! This novel explores Bridget's slow evolution into a more mature, &quot;grownup&quot;.  Some loose ties concerning previous characters are resolved and all for the best. This is a feel good book!<br />Perhaps what I enjoyed the most were the mere hints of romance in this book, i.e the looks on Mark Darcy's face that Bridget remarks upon but doesn't seem to realize the full context of,...really worked for me. I was involved in the love story, not just in the zaniness of the Bridget's day-to-day life.<br />I recommend this book and its predecessor for women of all ages, for both singles and &quot;smug-marrieds&quot; often question the validity and sincerity of their relationships, as does Bridget.	2001-11-05

From the very first chapter,  I was hooked on the descriptions of Seattle (which I have never seen) and its surrounding countryside. And now I've got the itch to vacation there and see the &quot;view&quot; for myself.  Ferber has a gift for writing prose that is gripping without tawdry thrills or made-for-movie themes.  The present day is 1941 on the verge of Pearl Harbor-- Older Americans are still apathetic about the war in Europe and don't have the desire to become involved.  Japan seems to weigh little on the consciousness of people even on the west coast.  But despite the undertones of impending involvement, this actually is a novel that explores the personalities and mettle of the men and women of different generations. Of what it takes to be a pioneer and what effects wealth and circumstance have on future generations.  The characters each had a distinctness about them, some likeable others irritating or just plain pitiable.  Strenght of character sometimes skips a generation. I would recommend this book to Ferber and Cather and perhaps even Maugham fans.  I plan on reading more of Ferber in the future.	2001-07-02

The story would become too laden with facts about Hermes Trismegistus or Cromwell that my eyelids would droop. Alethea was never fully fleshed out to me and even Inchbold, I am not sure, if I were in his shoes, if I would have even become involved.  What did he see in her anyway?  She seemed kind of like a lunatic or at least eccentric.  And the ending-- anyone ever read The Fall of the House of Usher... just too fantastic!	2001-05-29

I haven't had the chance to see the movie but I bet it plays a good courtroom drama.  This novel is interesting especially coming from the viewpoint of the 14 yr. old daughter of the accused midwife, but I had to struggle with it sometimes.  It didn't call to me to pick up and read shirking all my other duties like a 5 star book would.  It was the ending as the trial neared completion that got me back on track and picking up my reading pace.  An ending that stayed with  me all that night and affected my dreams. A pleasurable reading experience.	2001-04-23

The book was loosely strung together to say the least and not terribly interesting until you get about half way through.  At that point the book drastically diverges from the movie's take on Gump's experiences.  Gump  becomes involved with NASA (against his will) and then some Cannibals followed by a stint as a studio wrestler and a champian chess player.  He even gets a chance to meet Raquel Welch!  This divergence lends a sense of the surreal that becomes much more interesting for us to read than the plausible but boring &quot;idiot&quot; trouble Forrest gets into earlier in the book.	2001-04-03

The glimpse of romance in the air in the last novel coupled with all the suspense and life-threatening action really  made for a great read.  Bloodlure, on the other hand, had Anna away from her home park on assignment to learn about DNA testing for wildlife.  In Glacier national park she meets up with some excitement (in the form of a bear attack at night) and murder.<br />I was a tad disappointed with the storyline in this mystery.  Unless I am just getting really good at picking out clues... I very nearly had the whole story figured out by the half way point.  I kind of felt the author just needed to take a break awhile before coming up with the answers to how she was going to continue to flesh out Anna's private life in Mississippi so wrote this little vacation story just to fulfill her contract.  And that is ok!  I still enjoyed Anna and the escapades that surrounded her on this trip.  I just know that I have been enthralled an unable to put to the book down for other of Barr's novels, and not so much for this one.	2001-03-31

Raised a Christian, I am ashamed to say that I avoided this book since I thought I knew all about the story of Easter.  Perhaps, we all have a general knowledge of the days preceeding the crucifixtion of Christ.  Douglas has the gift of telling a well known story from a completely different stand point.  Indeed, this novel is so well told that it oftened moved me to tears as the main characters dealt with their own guilt and humanity.<br />We catch a glimps of Jesus on the eve of the passover through the eyes of a young Roman tribune, Marcellus and his faithful slave, Demetrius.  Each man begins with good strong foundations for morality but are ignorant concerning cultures other than their own.  They soon find themselves embroiled in the crucifixtion and each man is changed forever afterward.<br />This novel gives us a great insight into the life and times of the Roman Empire just before the fall.  It is not a preachy tale designed to convert the reader, but instead offers up the mysteries surrounding Christ as what they are: mysteries to be trusted in by faith.  Not everyone who hears of Christ in this book becomes a Christian. And not every Christian becomes better than his neighbor.  There is simply a longing for a better world.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Roman times and of course to any Christian reader.  The book read before the Easter season, only helped me attain a better and deeper understanding of my beliefs.	2001-03-31

I felt the characters were believable as was their dialogue.  Taylor and Denise's personal pain, their desire, their struggles to live decent balanced lives all seemed pertinent to me, an average U.S. citizen, even though I am not raising a child with strong learning deficiencies, nor am I courageous, melancholy volunteer fireman. The dynamics of their interpersonal relationship was real, it could have been me and my husband talking when first we started dating.  And finally, a happy ending makes for high ratings in and of itself!  I recommend this for fast and satisfying, light romantic reading.	2001-02-27

Using Will Shakepeare as a character was refreshing and I would love to see future attempts to incorporate historical, literary figures in contemporary fiction.  There were moments however when it seemed the content was repetitive.  I found myself speed reading over passages that seemed to be saying the same thing over and over again as if for filler to make the book long enough to publish. As for the promoters: from the very moment Smythe and Shakespeare arrive at the theatre, I could sense, or visualize the movie Shakespeare in Love.  The scene was similar as is the introduction of a discontented young woman who is being forced to marry against her will.... You probably remember the movie.  A Brother Cadfael Tuck Smythe is not.<br />This was an interesting attempt and I wouldn't hesitate to try a follow up story.  With experience comes improvement. Right?	2001-02-20
US	52781297	R2MJ4NM8CILLL	0140185232	579488546	The Razor's Edge	Books	5	23	25	N	N	You must have something in common with someone in this book.	I discovered Maugham last year reading Of Human Bondage for the first time.  Instantly, I became a fan.  Having finished The Razor's Edge, I am on a quest to read everything I can by this wonderous, insightful and witty author. Maugham himself appears in this book and takes quite an actively passive role with his cast of characters.  The lines between reality and fiction are blurred and I agree with another reviewer when you begin to question what is story and what is memoir.<br />I walked away from this book, for the most part, admiring Larry who deliberately chose to follow a different path than his peers.. a path leading towards spritual enlightenment.  Due to an unfortunate encounter with the loss of a comrade during the War, Larry decides that he needs to find out the meaning of life-- much to the dismay of his betrothed.  Isabel just wants to live the &quot;normal&quot; life that every girl of her station (upperclass) has the opportunity to take advantage of. They choose to go their separate ways and the book follows their choices (as well as others in their circle) over the next couple of decades through the roaring 20's and the Great Depression.  While no character actually seems by the end of the novel to be truly happy (except Larry) each achieves exactly what they set out to achieve.  Maugham points this out in the end, and it is a comment that still leaves me questioning. What amazed me most about this novel was that I could recognize people in my own life as fitting some of the roles depicted in it.  The people we learn of are REAL people...their actions, sufferings, and idiosyncracies are recognizable in ourselves and others.  A morality play of sorts, the Razor's Edge offers a look at how individuals choose to fulfill their time here on Earth.. it is both a comment on society and its mores as well as a discourse on personal freedom and spirituality.	2001-02-20

I was snared by the story early on and found it hard to put down.  Dolores Price could have been the girl next door to me growing up.  Her childhood wasn't much out of the ordinary.  What was unfortunate was her subjection to her parent's rocky marriage (but many children deal with that and grow up &quot;normal&quot;)and her mother's nervous breakdown-- but that was small potatoes compared to what happened when Dolores turned 13.<br />There were episodes in this book that were so completely disheartening and unsavory that I wanted to stop reading.  But then Lamb would give Dolores a gift (an unusual friendship or insight into another person's pain), and that gift would give Dolores and me (the reader) the strength to go on.<br />I still have mixed feelings about this book.  It has been 2 days since I finished and I am still refering to it my mind.. still mulling it over.  That typcially means for me that this had the makings of a great read.  So, although the story becomes vulgar and graphic at times, I have to rate the book high... because something important is being said about never giving up on yourself and finding peace and meaning in your life.	2001-01-24

It seemed obvious through Watson's accounts who the murderer was, though perhaps the motive was hidden until Holmes discovers the portrait resemblance.  I was entertained but not enthralled.

At one point during the last quarter, I began to question the sanity of the main character, Christopher Banks.  I had read one of the author's previous novels, The Unconsoled, which is based completely in a surreal realm... one never truly knows or understands what is going on in that story.  In this novel, however, the moment I was most impressed with was during Christopher's search for his parents in a war zone.  Everything seemed like a nightmare...and as I was reading I found myself feeling anxious everytime he took a wrong turn or was diverted in some way-- A dreamscape from which he finally wakes up and realizes how he has been misleading himself.  This sense of the nightmarish  I felt was pulled off quite well.  The story ends satisfactorily and with a surprise.	2000-12-21

That is what brought me to it.  I would find myself liking passages at one moment and then not liking the book further along...only to have the cycle repeat itself.  The prose, wasn't particularly poignant or poetic...two characteristics that for me make a book truly great and memorable.  The storyline is what kept me reading... it was refreshing and for the time period in which the book was published, decidedly relevant.  Three characters were given a voice beginning and ending with Abigail.  Abigail always seemed like a vague child and an even vaguer woman... I was glad to see the novel end the way it did.  Though perhaps it was a bit over the top... at least it would have been in &quot;real&quot; life.  I am leaving the book wishing there had been a little more depth to the characters, but also eager to discuss the myriad details that held the book together and struck me as the most interesting.	2000-12-08

I wouldn't say I was disappointed with the stories but saddened for the women featured.  The second story in particular, I felt to be clever and intriguing (I kept imagining something truly dastardly to take place.)  There was just the right amount of suspense.  The first, of which the book gets its title) was monotonous... and I am still puzzling over the heroine's reaction at the very end.  Indeed I am still wondering why there were so many lunches involved?  This does not detract from my admiration of M. Grimes and I can't wait to read her next endeavor.	2000-11-14

Half the time I was stressed out about how Phillip was being treated by the people he chose to have around him.  His fascination with Mildred was as close to talk show trash  as anything could get in the early 1900's!  What I enjoyed the most was how  relevant this story seemed to me even as a woman.  I see Phillip Carey as  Everyman.  Basicly a good and decent guy but riddled with self doubt and  loathing over his deformity and sensitive nature.  Certainly human in his  more wicked thoughts and desires.  It was slow going for the first half of  this long novel but I fairly sailed through the last 200 pages!  I would  definitely recommend this book to serious literature fans.	2000-01-09

As with all of the Conway novels I have read... there is an overabundance of interesting scenes and truly clever dialogue--enough to satiate my inner  appetite for tangible, gripping fiction.  I fell in love with one character  in particular, Jordan Elliot, and sympathized with nearly every other  character depicted.  This is a story about lost and renewed love,  friendship and family.  Being given a peek at the personal histories of  many of the characters enriched this book.  The end neatly wrapped  everyone's story together... though the stage scene at the local theater  was a little hokey. I liked this book and would recommend Conroy anytime!	1998-11-16

There is a connection here between the written word and one's senses that is rarely found these days and when one does find it one desires to cherish the moment.  Reading Cather makes me wistful for the past.  I want to see the rock of Quebec.  I want to live in a town that is flanked by wilderness where the only connection to &quot;civilized&quot; Europe is by the arrival and departure of massive sailing ships.  I also want to believe as the people in the novel believe, in the mystic wonders of a religion that extols the virtues of deceased missionaries and cloistered hermitess'.  In short Cather has convinced me to travel-- back in time if I could-- to see what Cecile and Auclair see or even what Cather herself saw that so moved her to write such a beautiful history. I only wish I could read more.  Each character she introduces could be the protagonist of their own novel.  A wonderful, simple, novel that makes you want to get up off your seat and go!	1998-04-17

This reader read eagerly and sometimes  impatiently for the outcome of the love &quot;quadrangle&quot; of sorts that occured between R.H. Ash, LaMotte, Miss Glover and Ellen Ash. The ending was supremely satisfying both in regards to the Victorian Era story and in the parallel investigation taking place in the modern day England of the 1980's.  What sometimes hampered the story were the intersperal of large tracts of poetry and correspondence laden with mundane philosopical discourses on whatever interested the poets of the Victorian age.  Perhaps on a historical level this would have been fun and interesting to read... but to someone who was interesting in &quot;getting on with it&quot; , this reader often felt irritated at the prospect of reading yet more obstacles hindering the eagerly awaited  reward at the end.	1998-03-31
