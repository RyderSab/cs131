Smacked square in the midst of the \\"Titan\\" relaunch and partially bridging the crew's emotional gap left by \\"Nemesis,\\" Friedman was charged with one goal in writing \\"Winter\\": finally finish the ongoing tension between Crusher and Picard.<br /><br />And Friedman does just that. Wonderfully.<br /><br />The Romulans have gotten much print over the past few years, and they are a welcome villain.  \\"Winter\\" explores much of the cloak-and-dagger politics plaguing Romulus after the Shinzon affair, with Tal'aura still struggling to cement her foothold as praetor--before the arrival of \\"Titan\\" and the events therein.  Likewise, we are shown \\"The Hundred,\\" a collection of the wealthiest, most influential Romulan families.  This particular family is charged with weapons manufacture, and one of their own, a man named Eborion, has the praetor's ear--and designs of his own.  Add to that Manathas, a Romulan spy, and the always intriguing Commander Sela, and there are enough pointy-eared manipulators to fill three volumes.<br /><br />And then there are the good guys.<br /><br />Carter Greyhorse, the attempted murderer last seen in \\"Reunion\\" (temporally speaking) is released from the penal colony in New Zealand to help create a cure for the Kevrata, travelling with his former comrades Picard and \\"Pug\\" Joseph.  There are a few scenes from Greyhorse's point of view, and we never get the overall feeling that this is a man who has successfully overcome his demons.  And yet he does his job.<br /><br />Picard wrestles with his conscience; he has finally come to realize that he is in love with the good Doctor Crusher.  Who may or may not be dead.  But certainly she's being held prisoner.  By Sela.  Picard doesn't know, and while his chief mission is to ensure the Kevrata are cured, he needs to find Crusher, whom he believes (and we know) to be alive.<br /><br />Joseph is no longer an alcoholic.<br /><br />Worf and LaForge are the only two from the \\"E\\" we see, and they want to charge off into Romulan space and rescue their comrades.

I have found a majority of TOS books to be rather droll, the exceptions being what's come down the pipeline of late (the Khan trilogy a definite achievement).  Furthermore, the idea of getting introduced to a handful of new, recurring characters in their own little corner of the universe whilst surrounded by familiar faces, is usually iffy.  Diane Carey's \\"Challenger\\" tried and failed whereas Peter David succeeded (though to be fair, there were some established faces there as well).  The DS9 relaunch has again done well.<br /><br />I think it was my slight bias against TOS that made me fear this book.<br /><br />Naturally, my instinct was wrong.  I tore through \\"Vanguard\\" quite quickly, and afterward, I found myself thinking \\"I have to wait another year for the sequel?  Damnation.\\"  I found myself identifying with the various characters and really into the plot, such as it was.  The appearance of a freshly minted Kirk and his crew far from overshadowed the stars of \\"Vanguard,\\" such as Reyes and T'Prynn.<br /><br />The Taurus Reach might be a region of mystery, the Tholians might be a bit bipolar and on the precipice of war, the Klingons might be murderous and mustachioed, but it is the characterization that stands out; to me, this is always the most important aspect of a novel, and David Mack (whom I'm thinking of as the literary equivalent of Quentin Tarantino in that this is only \\"The Third Book By David Mack\\" yet is a damned great piece of work.  Unlike Tarantino, though, I actually enjoy Mack's work and find him to be a talented writer) pulls off these new characers with panache and style.<br /><br />\\"Vanguard\\" is full of a rich assortment of men, women, aliens, and various malcontents, each with their own stories and histories, each with their own secrets and lies.  DS9 established that not every Starfleeter is a saint in paradise, and Vanguard shows us this early on.  T'Prynn is a manipulative, yet loyal, Vulcan to whom everyday life is a constant battle of wills against a vengeful katra.  Reyes is an older man wracked wtih guilt over a dying mother and in a potentially incendiary relationship.  Rana Desai is a JAG officer romantically involved with Commodore Reyes, whose loyalty to Starfleet takes precedence over her feelings.  And there is Lieutenant Xion, whose youthful idealism and dream of a peaceful, unified galaxy is at odds with the militaristic arm of the Federation.<br /><br />Then, of course, there is my personal favorite, Tim Pennington, a journalist on the frontier whose affair with a married woman ends in not only the destruction of his marriage, but his career as well.<br /><br />Granted, there's a lot more at play in \\"Vanguard\\" than the people.  You could talk about the mysterious planet of Ravanar and the destruction of a starship, or perhaps the wonderful treatment of the Tholians and the double-agent amongst the diplomatic corps.<br /><br />\\"Vanguard\\" is not merely a springboard novel or \\"first in a series;\\" no, it is a standout achievement that any true \\"Trek\\" fan will enjoy, regardless of your favorite series, as I have learned.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.t in paradise, and Vanguard shows us this early on.

While those of us who read \\"Trek\\" novels on a regular basis know this not to be true, it is still an unfortunate label.<br /><br />If only these critics were to read \\"Articles of the Federation.\\"  Concerned not with any particular starship or crew, \\"Articles\\" touches on an oft-ignored aspect of the \\"Star Trek\\" universe, that of Federation politics, more specifically the Office of the President of the United Federation of Planets, Nan Bacco.  Picking up where the events of the \\"A Time to...\\" series, \\"Nemesis,\\" and \\"Titan\\" last left us, \\"Articles\\" deals with the first year in the life of Bacco's administration.<br /><br />And that lone year certainly has a significant amount of ground to cover.<br /><br />Yet DeCandido makes one year fly by quickly, his writing style flourishing, fast-moving, and very, very literary.  The author has stated that this was an attempt at bringing \\"The West Wing\\" to the \\"Trek\\" universe, and \\"Articles\\" is all that and more.  Full of political machinations--the Bacco administration does not find itself treading water, it must struggle to stay afload--potential conflicts between Klingons, Remans, Romulans, and the Federation, there is not a dull line in the entire novel.<br /><br />Simply put, this first year is a combination of Bacco finding her place and voice as leader of a vast interstellar organization and the struggle to lay to rest the demons of the previous president, one Min Zife.  Indeed, this struggle culminates in the surprise (yes, I will admit to being fully floored by this next, even though I understand the reasoning for it) resignation of a decorated Starfleet officer and advisor.  Visible in \\"Articles\\" is Praetor Tal'Aura's continuing efforts to solidify her power base (she should have taken lessons from Martok's tale in \\"The Left Hand of Destiny\\"), a reporter's quest to find the truth behind the Tezwa affair, one doctor's prejudice against the Tzenketh that could spark an interstellar war, and Bacco's first attempt at welcoming a new race into the Federation--the Trinni/ek.  Packed to the gills with plenty of references to \\"Treks\\" past and future, \\"Articles\\" is a stunning novel that deserves to be considered not only one of the finest \\"Star Trek\\" novels written, but also a significant literary achievement for Keith R.A.

I was expecting a Kirk/Picard narrative, and I was grateful when my expectations were quickly proven wrong.  DeWeese has written a thought-provoking, temporal-shifting, character-driven novel that builds upon the notion of the Borg in first contact; that they are indeed a force to be reckoned with, not some laughable nuiscance pillaging the Delta Quadrant.<br /><br />At the heart of the story are Guinan, Scotty, and Sarek; it was these three characters with whom I thought DeWeese developed extremely well.  Guinan must wrestle with the knowledge that repairing the timeline will restore the Federation (and Earth)--but cost her her homeworld of El Auria, which was overlooked by the Borg on their conquest of Earth.  It was a rare treat to see two Guinans in one universe, and even though some of Guinan's mystique is explained in the epilogue, it did more to further develop her character and raise many more questions<br /><br />Scotty was a bit broken at the beginning (it was, though, nice to meet Ensign Frankling) but he did come to the fore and live up to his title of miracle worker.  \\"Engines...\\" sets the stage for Scotty to head up the SCE and make an even greater difference to Starfleet.<br /><br />Sarek and the Romulans were, in my opinion, not in the novel as much as they could have been; I would have loved to have seen more of Koval and the always tragic Commander Tal.<br /><br />The crew of \\"Enterprise\\" was not terribly drawn-out in terms of characterization and we saw only a few of them briefly, but this was a strength of the novel; we know plenty about these characters, and as such can see their reactions and actions in our minds, not needing it spelled out.<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Engines of Destiny\\" was a novel about coming to terms with the past and mistakes, and, ultimately, what it takes to be human.rms with the past and mistakes, and, ultimately, what it takes to be human.	2005-03-10

Those that complained the previous volume, &quot;A Time to Love,&quot; lacked action and fast pacing, will certainly be sated by the latest entry in the &quot;A Time to...&quot; saga.  Greenberger will undoubtedly make up for what others seemed to perceive as a lack of action in &quot;...Love.&quot;  Regardless, &quot;...Hate&quot; builds off of the plot elegantly constructed in the previous entry, starting off with a manhunt and ending on an ominous note.<br />The theme of the novel, of course, is the resolution of a planetwide catastrophe--something that sits well against the backdrop of the Riker familial conflict.  Will faces his personal demons, as does Kyle; both men are well-developed and we do begin to feel something towards the both of them, a kind of sympathy and understanding that Greenberger achieves with seemingly little effort.  The reunion and the recovery spans continents and riots, father and son coming to terms with their own assumptions about one another while facing death at every turn.  Indeed, Kyle speaks of some guilt regarding the crisis on Sigma IV, going so far to say it is &quot;his fault&quot; that the situation on the planet is as it is.  The chase for El Bison El is the Rikers' mission, and the man they discover is not at all whom the reader expects.<br />The situation onboard &quot;Enterprise&quot; may seem a bit contrived, but it is important.  The fact that the quartermaster is unable (or, perhaps, unwilling) to provide La Forge with the parts he needs speaks volumes of how far the &quot;Enterprise&quot; has slipped image-wise in the minds of many, from the admiralty to ensigns aboard other vessels.  While it is repetitive to hear the constant reminder that the reputation of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is tarnished, this goes a long way towards explaining the shakeup seen in &quot;Nemesis.&quot;<br />Face time in the novel goes to Picard, Riker, and Vale; these three are seen the most.  &quot;...Hate&quot; shines the spotlight on not only an established character like Riker, but on the lesser-known security officer Vale, whose character growth is both well-deserved and enjoyable.  Her scene with Troi towards novel's end is great; in fact, I imagine it is going to be pivitol in books to come. Picard discovers Beverly's pondering of the Starfleet Medical position, albeit not from the doctor herself, something that is both humorous and sad all at once.<br />The Bader and the Dorset, having been drugged by the plant life, and now &quot;cured&quot; of this pacifism by Starfleet's carelessness (Bison's escape) are reduced to rioting lunatics, carving up members of the opposite race and the harried and thinned-out security officers from &quot;Enterprise.&quot;  While the virus plot seems to be rather insiginificant, it is anything but; the final scene of the novel between Upton and Azernal proves this, and it is here that we see a lead-in to the final three novels in the series.<br />Overall, this was a thrilling and enjoyable read.  Greenberger was tasked with providing insight into three key situations that are seen in &quot;Nemesis,&quot; all of them involving Riker; the proposal was inevitable and hinted at in &quot;...Love,&quot; and here we witness it.  The captaincy is finally offered, and we do find some answers about the wedding itself.  Picard faces off with Upton, whom I've despised for two novels now, and am looking rather forward to seeing if he'll get his comeuppance.<br />For fans of Riker, this will be your favorite novel in the 9-book saga; for the rest of us who came looking for a good yarn, a thrilling story, and excellent character development, there is no disappointment to be had.only an established character like Riker, but on the lesser-known security officer Vale, whose character growth is both well-deserved and enjoyable.

Riker is made acting captain, Data has his emotion chip removed--voluntarily--and everyone else is left to deal with the reprecussions of Rashanar.  It is key to remember that there will be a grand total of nine books in the &quot;A Time to...&quot; cycle, and not all answers can be--nor are they expected to be--revealed in the first two novels.<br />Vornholt has given the reader a taste of the changes--such as Data's loss of his emotion chip--and set the stage for what will surely be a poignant, bittersweet exit for the crew and family of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; prior to Nemesis; these characters are not archtypes, and by making them simply do the expected would not be conducive to good storytelling.  For example, the admiralty; Ross has always been a good guy, but his dealings with Section 31 as seen in &quot;Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges&quot; and his firm desire to keep the Ontailians as allies in the time of rebuilding merely add to his character.<br />Nechayev has always been somewhat standoffish, but she is one of Vornholt's favorite guest characters, and again, this is character building; I believe Peter David gave a throwaway line about how she had newfound respect for Picard because of his familiarity with Spock.<br />Onto the plot; yes, it is fairly obvious what will happen.  The &quot;Enterprise&quot; travels back to Rashanar; Wesley reveals himself to the skeleton crew of the ship, worried about interfering with the outcome of the fate of Rashanar and being kicked out of Traveler society; and, of course, Colleen Cabot, new supporting character and Crusher's love interest and the one thing that helps return his humanity, is killed.  Again, obvious, but with the inclusion of the seedy denizens of the Jem'Hadar battle cruiser (Orions, Kreel, and Androssi--oh my) Vornhold keeps the reader's interest.<br />Vale and Perim are further developed as well, and considering this is a Picard/Crusher story, they are handled expertly and the reader truly empathizes with Wesley's plight; losing Cabot and fearing exile from Traveler society is quite a load on the former ensign.  Yes, the Rashanar plot is concluded, but there is still more story to tell--seven books left, and it is only then will we have a complete piece of the puzzle that lead to the breaking of the &quot;Enterpise&quot; family.  Keep this in mind as you read each novel in the cycle; no one book will have all the answers, and if &quot;Born&quot; and &quot;Die&quot; are any indication, each novel will be amongst the finest &quot;Next Generation&quot; stories ever told..<br />Vale and Perim are further developed as well, and considering this is a Picard/Crusher story, they are handled expertly and the reader truly empathizes with Wesley's plight; losing Cabot and fearing exile from Traveler society is quite a load on the former ensign.

With that out of the way, on to the review.<br />Simply put, if this is what the &quot;A Time to...&quot; series is going to be like, then we are certainly in for a treat.  Vornholt probes deeply into the psyches of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew, giving even the little-used (but known) characters of Perim and Vale face time.  Empathy is key in &quot;Born,&quot; as we see in the opening chapters when the Traveler (Wesley Crusher, completing his training) comforts the old woman.  We see the possibility of &quot;Enterprise&quot; self-destructing, alone in space, and feel the horror, pain, and shock Wesley feels watching his home explode.  He feels helpless and decides to go against his Traveler training to help his former comrades.<br />And then the action begins.  &quot;Enterprise&quot; is sent to assist with the recovery efforts in the Rashanar sector, working in tandem with &quot;Juno&quot; and the Ontailians, a superstitious race whose fear of Rashanar borders on devotional.  Quickly we learn the politics and dangers of Rashanar; Picard, Data, and LaForge are ambushed on the hulk of a dead starship, and the result is the theft of the captain's yacht, &quot;Calypso&quot; (really, there is no luck with these captain's yachts).  The Androssi are the culprits (for those who have not read the S.C.E. e-books, where we have the first mention of this pirate/foraging race, there is background information, so all is not totally new) and become the catalyst for the novel.<br />Something is haunting Rashanar, a sort of vampiric ship that feeds of antimatter, causing chaos, confusion, and conflict; it is Starfleet Captain versus Starfleet Captain in a battle of wills and wits.  All is not what it seems in Rashanar, and Vornholt pulls off the destruction of the &quot;Juno&quot; and her crew so quickly, efficiently, and shockingly that the reprecussions resonate well after completing the novel.<br />After &quot;Juno's&quot; destruction, action returns to Earth, where Picard is forced to face a tribunal (Admirals Ross, Nakamuru, and Paris) defended by Vornholt's favorite admiral, Necheyev.  With her is an indistinct, unnoticable ensign named Brewster, a young man with years of experience and a hidden agenda.  Picard is railroaded, Riker is put in command, and Rashanar is still a bloodbath.  With Picard under the ministrations of Starfleet Mental Health and Counsellor Colleen Cabot, Vornholt leaves the reader desiring the answers to the biggest question of them all: what is the secret of Rashanar?<br />In all, this was a great read and a welcome return to focus of the Next Generation crew.  It is somewhat sobering to realize that this is what will set them on the road to their ultimate fate, but in the end, this is a great first step, and one that answers a few questions...but raises more.it seems in Rashanar, and Vornholt pulls off the destruction of the &quot;Juno&quot; and her crew so quickly, efficiently, and shockingly that the reprecussions resonate well after completing the novel.<br />After &quot;Juno's&quot; destruction, action returns to Earth, where Picard is forced to face a tribunal (Admirals Ross, Nakamuru, and Paris) defended by Vornholt's favorite admiral, Necheyev.

Margaret Wander Bonanno's presence has been sorely missed, and this proved to be well worth the wait.  &quot;Catalyst&quot; is one of the few Trek novels that binds together the disparate elements of every series from TOS to the New Frontier novels (excluding, of course, &quot;Enterprise&quot;).  This was a common enough theme in The Lost Era cycle, but Bonanno pulls off a great finale, writing an engaging medical thriller that serves as both adventure and character builder, which is what truly defines a &quot;great&quot; Star Trek novel; we are able to glimpse additional facets to our favorite characters' personalities.<br />The plot itself seems convoluted, but it is not so; at the core is a group of Starfleet officers and a Romulan psuedo-defector attempting to seek out the source of a deadly virus, known to the Romulans as the Gnawing.  There is a lot of medical terminology tossed about, but with the inclusion of the all too human Uhura, this is easily explained in laymans terms (quite an effictive literary tool; it not only allows the layreader among us to not feel ignorant, but it also shows us that Admiral Uhura does not know everything).  There are fascinating glimpses into the construction of the virus and its devastating effects.<br />There are frequent point-of-view shifts and these occur sometimes two or three times in a section; one moment we will be in McCoy's head, the next Uhura's, the next Selar's, but the transitions are seamless and easy to follow.  This is not an easy read by any means, but this is fortunate; it serves to drive the plot and score the importance of the task at hand.  Indeed, it is a true master of the craft that can manage such a task with ease.<br />As for the characters themselves, we are given a glimpse into the past lives of Drs. Crusher and Selar, Tuvok, and a young engineer named Benjamin Sisko.  Along for the journey are Admiral Tal of the Romulan Empire, best known for his stint in &quot;Vulcan's Heart&quot; and the Original Series episode &quot;The Enterprise Incident,&quot; and Curzon Dax, making yet another appearance in &quot;The Lost Era.&quot;  Sisko is a brash lieutenant concerned with phase coils and his new family while Crusher is a dedicated young physician raising a son by herself.  Zetha, the Romulan girl sent by Senator Cretak, is herself something of an anamoly; whose agenda is she working towards, and what is her parentage?  This is the most telling question of the novel, and Bonanno skillfully manipulates the readers' emotions and makes us truly care about this new character.  Her innocent, freckled personage is perhaps the most intriguing character in the book.<br />While this is not the easiest novel to read by any means--it did take me a couple of weeks to finish; in parts, it was somewhat plodding--it is a worthwhile read, and fans of Bonanno's earlier Trek novels &quot;Dwellers in the Crucible&quot; and &quot;Strangers From the Sky&quot; will thoroughly enjoy this book, as will loyal fans looking to fill in lost pieces of the vast tapestry that is Star Trek.Benjamin Sisko.

Her innocent, freckled personage is perhaps the most intriguing character in the book.<br />While this is not the easiest novel to read by any means--it did take me a couple of weeks to finish; in parts, it was somewhat plodding--it is a worthwhile read, and fans of Bonanno's earlier Trek novels &quot;Dwellers in the Crucible&quot; and &quot;Strangers From the Sky&quot; will thoroughly enjoy this book, as will loyal fans looking to fill in lost pieces of the vast tapestry that is Star Trek.	2004-02-28

Zahn does a magnificient job of explaining innuendo that has been building since Outbound Flight was mentioned in \\"Heir to the Empire,\\" and this effort does not disappoint.  For those that have shied away from the Star Wars novels the past four years due to the New Jedi Order, this is a wonderful \\"welcome back\\" gift.  There are no Vong, just 340 pages of Luke and Mara and a gallery of the usual rogues.<br />While this is a traditional page turner from Zahn, \\"Survivor's Quest\\" is not exactly a brain-twister; assuming you know the formula, it will be quite simple to plot the strategy Zahn employs.  The majority of the action occurs towards the latter half, with the beginning doing a significant amount of character and suspense building.  Those expecting a novel with the cadre of familiar heroes will be disappointed; this is entirely a Skywalker affair.  There is no Chewie, no Leia, no Jedi twins, no Ackbar.  In short, this is the ultimate successor to the Thrawn Trilogy and Duology.<br />The plot is straightforward: Outbound flight has been found in Chiss space and the Nine Families have decided to make a gift to the New Republic by allowing the Jedi to reclaim the old husk.  The invitation comes from Voss Parck and General Fel and the so-called \\"Empire of the Hand,\\" but is intercepted.  And thus begins a chase for answers and hidden saboteurs.  A lot happnens on different levels--another Zahn trademark--and it would do to read this in one sitting, possibly with a notebook.  No one is who they seem to be, from the Chiss to Commander Fel to Bearsh to Jinzler, but all is revealed in due course by an author skilled in the craft of fiction.<br />While one may know what to expect, the trip is half the fun.  This is a most welcome return to grace by the master of Star Wars fiction, and it certainly serves as a welcome precursor to the NJO saga.  Yet there are a few flaws; Pressor's casual comment that records of the battle that crippled Outbound Flight were destroyed and the unexplained corpses serve as warning signs, but these will undoubtedly feed into Zahn's upcoming Clone Wars-era novel detailing the exit of Outbound Flight.  Similarly, I felt the casual mention of another Thrawn clone (mere supposition tossed out by Luke and Mara at the end) to be somewhat of a stretch, but it is eminently possible given the ever-changing face of the Star Wars literary universe.  And the occasional references to droidekas, the Clone Wars, and the Trade Federation seem forced as well, but this does serve to bridge the two eras.<br />\\"Survivor's Quest\\" is for the loyal fan, as it details the politics and internal structure of the Chiss and is centered around a casual reference to an extragalactic ship whose goal was to seek out life beyond the galaxy proper.  And I'm certain we can expect a sequel to this as well, possibly tying up some of the NJO loose ends--after all, there's something a little too Vong-esque about the Vaagari.<br />Pick this up.  You will not be disappointed.  Indeed, it is nothing short of a gift to those of us who appreciate a good story set in the galaxy far, far away.there are a few flaws; Pressor's casual comment that records of the battle that crippled Outbound Flight were destroyed and the unexplained corpses serve as warning signs, but these will undoubtedly feed into Zahn's upcoming Clone Wars-era novel detailing the exit of Outbound Flight.

This is not about courtroom theatrics or terrible murders or greedy, corrupt lawyers seeking justice that will benefit their pocketbooks.  No, \\"The Last Juror\\" is much, much different than your typical Grisham fare.<br />It is a story of humanity.  John Grisham has entered a new field while treading on familiar territory.  He has written something that touches the pulse of the 1970's in Ford County.  This is the story of Willie Traynor, newspaper editor, and his friendship with Callie Ruffin, a black woman and mother of eight, and a fledgling newspaper founded on obituaries.  Danny Padgitt's actions are known fairly early on, and there truly is no question as to his guilt.<br />There are some courtroom theatrics here, but they are secondary to the relationship between Willie and Miss Callie; indeed, the courtroom scenes are secondary to the character development and onset of desegregation that the denizens of Ford County are faced with.  If anything, \\"The Last Juror\\" is the sort of novel one would expect to read in a 20th Century literature class.  There is a fair amount of suspense, and there is some criticism of the legal system (70's and current) and of course a bit of preaching, but it all works.<br />Grisham has crafted one of his best novels and given us a slew of memorable characters; the Ruffin family will stay with you long after completing the novel.  As will Willie and the eclectic bunch of \\"old folks\\" who dominate the town.  Social criticism is also a bit heavy, with the arrival of Bargain City and the Padgitt clan's unsavory vocations.  I would hesitate to compare this to such literary giants as \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" the major theme in \\"The Last Juror\\" is similar to that found in both the aforementioned novels, that of racial tolerance and the transendance of boundaries.<br />But, when the jurors start to fall, you will believe that Danny Padgitt is indeed guilty of fulfilling his promise...but then Grisham wants you to believe it, which makes the ending all the more impactful.<br />Be wary, diehards and casual fans--this is not your typical John Grisham.  It's something better.ance of boundaries.<br />But, when the jurors start to fall, you will believe that Danny Padgitt is indeed guilty of fulfilling his promise...but then Grisham wants you to believe it, which makes the ending all the more impactful.<br />Be wary, diehards and casual fans--this is not your typical John Grisham.

The second entry into the \\"Lost Era\\" saga, \\"Serpents Among the Ruins\\" brings to life the infamous Tomed Incident of, naturally, 2311.  At the heart of the story is Captain John Jason Harriman Jr. and the crew of the \\"Enterprise-B.\\"  Along for the ride are Elias Vaughn, best known for his current posting as Commander of \\"Defiant,\\" Admiral John \\"Blackjack\\" Harriman, Azetbur, Demora Sulu, and Aventeer Vokar, a Romulan Admiral and commander of the Star Empire's flagship \\"Tomed.\\"<br />The story begins with the Romulan annexation of a planet along the Neutral zone, leading to a run-in between Vokar's \\"Tomed\\" and Harriman's \\"Enterprise.\\"  From there, we are taken on a whirlwind journey through Federation Space and interstellar politics.  The Federation and Starfleet feel that a war between the Romulans is inevitable, and relations with the Klingons are tenuous at best; Azetbur's power base is crumbling, and there are many Klingons who feel the Federation has weakened their once-glorious Empire.  In order to appease the Klingons and avoid war, the Federation has opened negotiations in the Algeron sector, the ultimate goal a lasting treaty.<br />However, there is more at play than simple negotiations; the Federation is attempting to develop a new warp drive in secret--Hyperwarp--on the newly commissioned \\"Universe.\\"  The test ends in disaster, with \\"Tomed\\" witnessing what they believe is a new Federation weapon.  The \\"Universe\\" is destroyed (a rather tongue-in-cheek metaphor for the outcome if the three major powers do not come to an accord) and the \\"Ad Astra\\" is damaged, sending \\"Blackjack\\" Harriman nearly to his death.<br />After this, \\"Enterprise\\" is brought to Algeron, escorted by \\"Tomed,\\" and brings two new Federation delegates to the conference, one being Vaughn.  What follows is an attempt to keep the peace at whatever cost--Romulan, Federation, or otherwise.  Harriman, Vaughn, and his associate undertake a covert mission on the \\"Tomed,\\" and this will change the lives of two of Starfleet's finest.<br />Not to be forgotten, Sulu and the \\"Enterprise\\" are left to discover who amongst them is a Romulan spy, and together with an Alonis Admiral, they will uncover a plot that is far more insidious than anything the Tal Shiar, Section 31, or any other covert organization could devise.  Starfleet has undertaken a mission so disastrous that failure would mean a war between the Federation--and a Klingon/Romulan alliance.<br />This is truly a \\"page-turner,\\" and one will not want to put it down.  Filled with believable, all to realistic characterization and a plot that moves at breakneck speed, \\"Serpents Among the Ruins\\" belongs at the top of anyone's Trek reading list, regardless of which series one considers to be their \\"favorite;\\" this novel trascends the series'.  David R. George III has undertaken the most speculated event in Trek history and turned it into a masterpiece on all levels--there is tech, romance, suspense, and a healthy dose of believable, human condition.  Who would have imagined that Harriman is friends with a Romulan ambassador or that Vaughn wasn't always battle-hardened?<br />Clearly, there is room for a spinoff series with \\"Enterprise-B,\\" but only time will tell if this will actually occur.  And yes, Harriman is no longer \\"the man who killed Kirk\\" but a legend in his own time.  That alone makes this a standout.of two of Starfleet's finest.<br />Not to be forgotten, Sulu and the \\"Enterprise\\" are left to discover who amongst them is a Romulan spy, and together with an Alonis Admiral, they will uncover a plot that is far more insidious than anything the Tal Shiar, Section 31, or any other covert organization could devise.

As such, fans of the relaunch have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of &quot;Unity,&quot; which promises to deliver many of the answers fans have been waiting for.  Indeed, it proves to wrap up old plot lines and create more, making for an extremely fast read (three hours); however, fans of Perry's previous work in the Trek universe already know of her fast-paced, well-written prose and deft characterization.  One can almost hear the actors delivering their lines with customary inflection; from O'Brien to Kira to Opaka, the characters come alive on every page.  If anything, the 330 or so pages are barely enough to contain the energy, development, and anticipation that build up through the entire novel.<br />At the center of &quot;Unity&quot; is, of course, the parasite crisis; Bajor and DS9 are under seige and the Bajoran sector is under lockdown.  Cardassian warships surround both planet and station, a communications blackout in effect.  Gul Macet, previously seen clawing at his throat when a parasite launches itself at the Dukat-esque Cardassian, is in charge of the Cardassian contingent.  This is the scene that Vaughn and the crew of the &quot;Defiant&quot; find themselves entering.<br />Without revealing anything too much, &quot;Unity&quot; gives us more of the inner turmoil Vaughn finds himself facing after shooting the Borg-Ruriko in sickbay, the anger Prynn holds for Vaughn, the deep-seeded Trill desire for privacy in all matters internal, and, of course, Kira's Attainder.<br />Ro and Quark are given a lot of face time, and not just towards their romance; each have their own demons to face: if Bajor joins the Federation, Ro fears she will be turned over to Starfleet for prosecution and Quark fears he will be forced to leave DS9 for more profitable pastures.  Taran'atar bonds with Wex, the stowaway whom Jake Sisko encountered when fulfilling his part of the Avatar prophecy.  While not everyone is who they appear, one person holds true to her nature; the former Kai, Opaka Sulan.<br />It is she who finds a Bajor in spiritual crisis, telling Vedek Yevir it is not the texts Kira uploaded that have caused the split in faith; it is the Attainder the Vedek Assembly placed upon the colonel that has lead to Bajor fractured.  The former Kai does not step up to retake her mantle, instead opting to allow spiritual politics to play out as they will, acting instead as a spirtiual counselor to the lost Elias Vaughn.  She exposes him to the Orb of Unity, allowing for Vaughn to come face to face with the man he first encountered in the Badlands after opening the Orb of Memory.  His role is significant to the novel, and while he is not completely healed at the conclusion of &quot;Unity,&quot; the centenarian commander is well on his way, thanks to the Prophets.<br />Ultimately, we discover the fate of Sisko and Kasidy, see the true face of evil (read: parasite), and relish the return of the O'Brien's to the fore.  We leave the novel with an Andor in a peril of its own creation and an Andorian alone, a Bajor redefined and a faith still fractured, a son coming to terms with his father's place in the universe, and, as the cover shows, a former Bajoran freedom-fighter trying out a new uniform.  Sometimes frightening, sometimes funny, sometimes bittersweet, and always breathtaking, &quot;Unity&quot; establishes Perry as the chancellor of the relaunch, leaving the reader satisfied yet wanting more.<br />Oh, I almost forgot; &quot;somewhere on Bajor...a child long awaited is born.&quot;ncountered when fulfilling his part of the Avatar prophecy.

While the series had its ups and downs, the finale does not disappoint.  Luceno had an arduous task in front of him, threading all the plotlines that were left by the previous authors (which, of course, was anticipated).  The book is deftly written, with a swiftness unseen in the NJO for quite some time; it is a gripping page-turner not merely because one wants to see how it ends, but also because one is enraptured by Luceno's mastery of prose.  The 529 pages fly by, and upon finishing, it will leave one feeling content and satisfied at having made it this far.<br />The synopsis about Mon Calamari being under seige with a lone station defending it, about the giant sacrifice--not really the point of the novel.  The latter is finished rather quickly, and the former is nonexistent; Mon Cal is never under siege.  However, that is not to say the Yuuzhan Vong have relented; no, they are preparing for a final assault on Mon Cal but are met wtih equal force by Galactic Alliance forces.  The tide of the war turns with the long-awaited arrival of Zonama Sekot into the night sky of Coruscant.  The entry, as seen through the eyes of Nom Anor, is fascinating; the consequences of entry are far more impactful than anyone imagined.<br />It is refreshing to see Luke fight again, but that is not the highlight; this arrives when Jacen Solo comes to experience the vision he had years ago on Duro, before his meeting with Tsavong Lah.  Jacen comes to terms with the Unifying Force on Sekot, as do the other Jedi; Mara, Tahiri, Luke, and Corran all begin to question light and dark.  Harrar assists in this new view as well; he is alive and well after Nom Anor's failed treachery.  As are Judder Page and Pash Cracken, both of whom were presumed dead after the Bilbringi (this is another early revelation).<br />Things happen quickly in this novel; the Vong are hesitant to advance on Sekot once it reverts to known space, and the Alliance ships on-station in the Coruscant area are also hesitant to act.  However, the military has good reason not to be terribly concerned; Han, Leia, and Kyp witness firsthand the effects of Alpha Red on Vonglife.  As feared, Shimrra finds a way to use the virus against the Alliance forces, but in a most unexpected way.<br />There is one very important death that occurs in the novel, though we only hear of it from Tycho during a briefing; Admiral Ackbar passes away quietly into the night.  The Smuggler's Alliance also makes an appearance--Talon Karrde, Booster Terrik, Crev Bombassa, Lando and Tendra Calrissian--as does a group of individuals donned in Mandalorian armor whom we are lead to believe is headed up by none another than Boba Fett (at least, this is Han's inference).<br />In the end, it is the new Jedi who come to shine; Jacen and Jaina play the major roles with Traest Kre'fey occupying that spotlight, and for the Vong we have the long-awaited revelation regarding Shimrra and Onimi, whom I have always suspected was more than he let on (a fact that wasn't too well concealed by several other authors in the NJO saga).  Nas Choka, Nom Anor, and Shimrra are the main Vong we hear from in the novel; Choka comes to term with some buried questions (he was instrumental in assisting Shimrra in overthrowing Quoreal, the previous Supreme Commander) and Nom Anor's role as The Prophet has reprecussions for Shamed Ones, Elites, and the Alliance itself (ever the opportunist, though he does receive his commeupance), and the conclusion is both stunning and expected.  There are no new mysteries, but the old ones are concluded, and there is indeed room for a follow up sequel or two.  The prophecy of the twins does not play up as it could have (thought to a small extent it shows in the Force) nor do any of the possible romantic relationships hinted at earlier in the novels.<br />This is a fitting conclusion to the long-running, sometimes tedious saga, and it does not disappoint.  Even if you haven't followed the NJO saga faithfully, read this novel; it illuminates characters new and old in breathtaking fashion.  Well worth the cover price, this is by far one of the better novels to come out of the Star Wars genre in quite some time.s saga, and it does not disappoint.

We waited two years for the conclusion of the Beings saga, and we were all very relieved not to have to wait so long to see the resolution of Gleau's murder.  I'll get the prose praise out of the way; David writes with a flourish, an edge-of-your seat pace that is somewhat rare in this selective genre.  His character development is second-to-none, and it is easy to believe that he cares for each one of them.  There are a few tongue-in-cheek references peppered throughout the book; I had to laugh when Picard comments that he would never be able to run a school for gifted youngsters.<br />The focus here is on Calhoun, Shelby, Janos, and Kebron; at least, in the present.  It is fascinating to see the new (and, in my opinion, improved) Kebron handle the investigation; he draws upon hard-boiled detectives of &quot;old&quot; and adamantly refused to believe that Janos was responsible for the murder of the manipulative, unlamented Gleau.  His search takes him in new directions, and it is here where Calhoun ponders his past at Starfleet academy.<br />Calhoun recalls his savage days, his first meeting with Shelby, his roommate experience.  We also see a rather laid-back Jellico (sort of) and finally have a lot of innuendo exposed.  This reflection leads to a point when Calhoun finally comes to head with his savage side...and the ultimate reconciliation of savage and civilized soldier.  We see a Calhoun who was so certain of himself, yet at the same time vulnerable.  The progression of feelings he has for Shelby drives this point across quite well.  As does his recollection of meeting Janos for the first time; one has certain expectations of meeting a white-furred creature after coming out of a fight for survival.  The first encounter is both humorous and bittersweet; Calhoun and Shelby are still cadets, and they both realize that they have encoutered new life and it is their duty to ensure his survival.<br />Those hoping for a resolution or a glimpse of the Tholian/Danteri negotiations will be disappointed; the only time we glimpse Spock is when he melds with Janos.  Si Cwan and Kalinda are likewise out of the picture, and for the last section of the novel, so is the &quot;Trident.&quot;  But that is understood and even appreciated; this is meant to be a focus on Calhoun and Janos.  Yes, the murder happened on the &quot;Trident,&quot; but when Calhoun absconds with Janos, it quickly becomes a Starfleet matter.  The Selevians have petitioned the Federation to have Janos extradited in order to execute him.<br />This conflict leads to the action; &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives on-scene to force Calhoun's hand, but he is convinced the Selevians are manipulating the Federation, and both ships face-off with a Selevian warship waiting in the wings, all vying for one thing: Ensign Janos.<br />Thankfully, &quot;Stone and Anvil&quot; does not end with a cliffhanger, but it will still leave you wanting more.

Demmix has important information on the Ubarrak, a race that threatens the Federation and the Cardassians--basically, everyone is threatening everyone else and the potential for interstellar war exists unless this information is obtained by the Federation. And, of course, the Cardassians want Demmix as well, but that is to be expected.  I mean, you can't have an easy time of picking up your charge.  A bomb goes off in a crowded bazaar, security men arrest Picard, and Demmix runs because that is what he does (he and Picard ran a marathon against one another, and that contrived bit of past is how they've become such &quot;good&quot; friends).<br />So Guinan springs him, they dye their skin, change their hair, and go off in search of Demmix.  Also after them is the chief of Oblivion security and Enabran Tain, who seems to be out of continuity as a Glinn.<br />A merry chase ensues, and it's hard to stay for the plot.  It's better to see the interplay between a stricken Guinan and a blossoming Picard, and here is the true payoff: she knows they will become friends, he does not, and yet Guinan cannot believe this is the man who will become the captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her good friend.  Interesting bit of characterization here, and, as I said, the only real reason to read &quot;Oblivion.&quot;<br />On &quot;Stargazer,&quot; Nikolas is upset about losing Gerda Idun so he lashes out at a few people and knocks out a Bolian (twice) and feels sorry for himself.  Yeah.  Not really caring about his attitude, just wondering how he became so childish; this isn't the Nikolas we've seen over the past few novels.<br />However, the Paris/Jiterica relationship is excellent; they are both confused after a moment of unintentional intimacy, and what develops between these two as the novel progresses is simultaneously bittersweet and poignant.<br />Oh, and we're still in the dark about Ulelo at the end, so don't get your hopes up.<br />Let's hope the follow-up gets here soon, because these loose ends and pseudo-cliffhangers are maddening.<br />Don't pick this up unless you are absolutely dedicated to the &quot;Stargazer&quot; series or want to know how Guinan and Picard &quot;first&quot; met.intimacy, and what develops between these two as the novel progresses is simultaneously bittersweet and poignant.<br />Oh, and we're still in the dark about Ulelo at the end, so don't get your hopes up.<br />Let's hope the follow-up gets here soon, because these loose ends and pseudo-cliffhangers are maddening.<br />Don't pick this up unless you are absolutely dedicated to the &quot;Stargazer&quot; series or want to know how Guinan and Picard &quot;first&quot; met.	2003-10-30

Robinson's &quot;The Calling,&quot; which furthers Garak's character and has to be the best story of the bunch.  I mean, this IS Garak, and as &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot; proved, no one knows the character better than the man behind the mask.  I always chuckled at the dark humor behind Garak's oblique statements and rather droll yet bold declarations, and it's like you have an audio loop of Robinson delivering every line.<br />However, his is not the only story of note.  The highlights of this anthology are Terri Osborne's tale of Jake and Ziyal's blossoming friendship during the Dominion's takeover of DS9; Keith R. A. DeCandido's &quot;Broken Oaths&quot; which finally ties the thread of &quot;how and why did O'Brien and Bashir kiss and make up after 'Hippocratic Oath,'&quot; a story that proves DeCandido is one of the best Trek authors to come down the pipeline in a very, very long time; Heather Jarman's &quot;The Devil you Know&quot; which allows us to catch up with T'Rul and empathize with her character, something we never had the opportunity to do in the series; and, finally, Andy Mangels and Michael Martin's tale of Kai Winn and Nog teaming up, the much-hyped story that pays off in the end, a story that explains why Nog had a desire to do something as...altruistic...as join Starfleet.<br />&quot;Prophecy and Change&quot; works because it gives us a chance to revisit the characters from new standpoints, almost always at pinnacles of their development.  The stories are set before, after, and during the series, and all are worth a read.<br />Excellent anthology.

The first time I rushed through it just to find out who was the \\"victim.\\"  Yeah.  Wasn't really surprised about that.  I'm sure a few people are thinking it was a serious mistake to off our lamented victim, but honestly, I wasn't really enthused at having to slog through this book.<br />I understand that this is covering the adolescent years of young Mr. Potter, but the whole teenage angst thing came out of nowhere.  There should've been some hints as far back as \\"Chamber\\" but instead, we have four years of pent-up hormones come flooding out of the page.  It is overwhelming at times, a feeling made worse when you realize that there wasn't a big plot; if anything, this was written partially for contract, partially to continue the story (I, personally, could have lived without the whole Hagrid/Grawp subplot, not to mention 50% of Dolores Umbridge, who herself is part pun, part metaphor, yet neither part really does anything but make one groan).<br />But one thing to be said, there is growing tension and suspense in the book, which is written and intended--if we remember for a moment and think (perhaps somewhat naively)--for young adults and not those of us with seasoned palates.  This is why the book deserves a high rating; to me--and to many individuals over the age of, say, 16--this isn't a great novel.  But it is an excellent novel for the young adult crowd and anyone who wants a mystery/fantasy/pseudo-thriller with characters who are reaching the genesis of their development.  We may not like the person Harry becomes or the browbeating attitude of Umbridge or Ron's jealousy rearing its head at odd turns, but it is a realistic portrayal of adolescent confusion and angst, of the tendency for some individuals in today's society to repress information and punish anyone who tries to resist the \\"system.\\"<br />Yes, this is a heavy-handed statement, but this book is a metaphor as much as it is a fantasy.  Remember, the Harry Potter series is desgined as an arc, so we naturally have to have the stage set for the final two books in the saga.<br />Hardcore Potter fans will enjoy this.  Anyone expecting a great epic, however, will be disappointed because of their misconceptions.<br />But, if you shelve your misconceptions as I was able to, you will come away from \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" with a greater appreciation for Rowling's ability to tell a story and keep her readers on the edges of their seats, biting their nails and asking themselves \\"could this be who dies?\\"<br />Until Book Six, I suppose we'll have to read this again.  Hopefully then we'll see who Harry decides to become involved with in a more intimate level.d as an arc, so we naturally have to have the stage set for the final two books in the saga.<br />Hardcore Potter fans will enjoy this.

Indeed, I was curious as to what, exactly, the stories would be; as David says in the introduction, it was a tough decision to decide where the stories should take place, and ultimately they are all in the various characters' pasts, which makes for an interesting read.<br />The results of &quot;No Limits&quot; are wonderful, illuminating the established characters with new details, explanations, and purpose.  Every story adds something new to the characters, whether it is Calhoun's loyalty to Picard (the opener, &quot;Loose Ends&quot;), Kebron's love for fish (the aptly titled &quot;Waiting for G'Doh&quot;), Morgan's quest to end her existence (&quot;Alice, on the Edge of Night&quot;), or Burgoyne's life-altering experience with &quot;visions&quot; (&quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;).<br />The standouts in the anthology are David Mack's Kebron tale, which offers great insight into his psyche and gives new meaning to &quot;stoicism;&quot; both of the Soleta stories, one which shows us of her fateful first meeting with Rajari, the second which gives us Spock; Josepha Sherman's &quot;Turning Point&quot; which finds Si Cwan as an adolescent coming to the realization that the Royal Court of Thallon does not sit well with his conflicting opinions of high and low castes; and, of course, Peter David's tale of Shelby and Calhoun's ill-fated honeymoon.  Oh, and we finally get to meet Morgan Korsmo and see that oft-referred to incident, Wolf-359, and the battle waged on the &quot;Excalibur.&quot;<br />This is a great addition to any &quot;New Frontier&quot; fan's library, or any Trek fan's for that matter.  This also works as an adequate introduction into the hearts and minds of the characters that have been changing since 1997.  Pick it up.  It's one of the best Trek anthologies out there, and it's great to see some new voices add their talents to the ever-expanding crews of the &quot;Excalibur&quot; and the &quot;Trident.&quot;ere, and it's great to see some new voices add their talents to the ever-expanding crews of the &quot;Excalibur&quot; and the &quot;Trident.&quot;	2003-10-29

It carries a hefty price tag, but this should not be an issue for a true Larson fan; the price of admission pales in comparison to the endless amount of humor and satisfaction that one will get time and time again.  The Far Side never gets old, and it's like having a long-lost friend come back.<br />The pages are thick and glossy and extremely well-bound; it's like an encyclopedia, only with a lot more relevant information and more interesting pictures.  Organized chronologically and with a two-page cartoon introducing the year, the Complete Far Side shows the progression of Larson's humor and the transformation of the public reaction to his cartoons (this is done with various letters from editors and such, though not in a way that mimics The Pre-History of the Far Side).  Some of the strips are presented in color, something that will perhaps be seen as a disappointment to some, but to the majority it is nothing short of a bonus; most of these that are in color have been previously anthologized in black and white.<br />I personally find Steve Martin's introduction to be a brilliant homage to Gary Larson, and the comments from Larson's editor prove to be tongue-in-cheek moments where one who truly &quot;gets&quot; The Far Side can laugh at the ignorant masses.<br />This is the centerpiece of my library now, and while it is somewhat bulky, when it's in your lap or on the table, the ten pounds per book seems irrelevant when you realize the sheer scope of what you have in your hands.<br />And if you ever visit the Midvale School for the Gifted...pull, don't push.	2003-10-28
US	48648796	RVB0LNHX8ZM3K	0156628708	179043206	Mrs. Dalloway	Books	4	9	12	N	N	A Literary Masterpiece	I read this book several years ago on a whim.  Now, a junior in college, I've just finished reading it for a Virginia Woolf seminar course.  It's much better the second time around; the deft characterization and swiftly moving prose transport one into the different mindsets presented throughout.  This is almost &quot;Ulysses&quot; light; Woolf's stream-of-consciousness in a day is much more palatable than Joyce's monstrosity.  Which is not to say that &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; is simplistic; it is one of the more challenging--and worthwhile--novels I've read in some time.<br />Woolf's use of Septimus as her alter ego is a very bold literary move; most would assume that Clarissa is, in fact, a representation of Woolf.  Instead, it is the shellshocked, suicidal, conflicted Septimus, a victim of World War I, who spends a good portion of his page time seeing his dead friend Evans.  Septimus shoulders the blame for Evans' death, and Septimus imagines that he is on trial, oftentimes muttering about his &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;guilt.&quot;  His only escape is suicide.  He is the only character whom Clarissa does not meet; this furthers the story and will perhaps muddle the novel for some.<br />Clarissa herself goes through her day in the life preparing for a party, running into old friends and remembering old ghosts.  The fact that she is an unhappy housewife questioning her choices makes the novel and the ultimate resolution all that more emotional and impactful.<br />This is one of the most overlooked books in America today; it is a work of genius from an author whose talent is terribly underrated.  This is the American, feminine, and more realistic &quot;Ulysses;&quot; a treasure that has gone unnoticed for too long.  This is literature, but it is enjoyable literature, not merely for high school seniors forced to endure another &quot;dusty classic,&quot; but for anyone who wishes to read a true classic worthy of that honorific.	2003-10-16

The writing is fast-paced and the dialogue brilliant--although sometimes Tahiri comes off as a bit too stuffy and Nom Anor (the erstwhile Prophet of the Shamed) appears comedic in his reverence.<br />The plot is rather simple, tying up the final thread in the Heretic trilogy, that being the arrival of the Tahiri to Sekot.  She is joined by Corran Horn, Nom Anor in his guise as Yu'shaa, the high priest Harrar, and the Master Shaper Nen Yim.  These latter two are affected by the planet (or so it is alluded) and begin to get chummy with Horn and Tahiri, respectively.<br />The Bilbringi plot seems forced, though it indirectly gives us some additional insight into Pellaeon's character.  The parallels to Zahn's final confrontation with Thrawn in &quot;The Last Command&quot; are blatantly obvious and what little gallows humor emerges from Wedge is not really worth of a man of Keyes' talent.  Further, the new bioweapon is alluded to and only in the epilogue do we discover what it is, and even then it is hazy.<br />However, this novel was a chance for the New Jedi to shine; Tahiri and Corran take up the bulk of the novel while the Solo and Skywalker clans are along to serve only for the Bilbringi conflict and the final showdown on Sekot.  We have a rather heavy body count; no real big shakers in the death department, but I was disheartened to see Pash and Page leave the literary Star Wars universe.  With Harrar and Nen Yim (presumably) out of the picture, the level-headed Vong are all but gone.<br />And speaking of level-headed Vong, Onimi pops up again, and I keep thinking that in the conclusion we'll see the malformed jester as something else entirely; we learn that Shimmra possibly ascended the throne via dishonorable means and that there is a sect of Vong who still whisper the name of the former Supreme Overlord--Quoreal--with respect.<br />And, yes, what everyone has suspected since &quot;Rogue Planet&quot; was released is true: Sekot and the Vong are somehow linked.<br />Finally, an NJO paperback that is worth the price of admission.the former Supreme Overlord--Quoreal--with respect.<br />And, yes, what everyone has suspected since &quot;Rogue Planet&quot; was released is true: Sekot and the Vong are somehow linked.<br />Finally, an NJO paperback that is worth the price of admission.	2003-10-08

McHenry is in limbo, visible to only one person on the ship--an individual whose origins are finally revealed, an individual whom the very fate of the \\"Excalibur\\" rests upon.  Morgan's body is jettisoned into space, her memory all that is left.<br />Si Cwan and Kalinda are adrift, their only hope a great bird; it seems the Being on Danter didn't like the Thallonian royals' attitudes.<br />Calhoun is nursing a massive chip, and it is here where Starfleet Captain must confront Xenexian Warlord in the ultimate contest of internal wills; Calhoun lusts for revenge, and he will have it.<br />The truth behind Kebron's change is revealed, and it is a rather startling one, which means it's pulled off in typical Peter David fashion.  We also see Soleta at her most vulnerable and potentially her most dangerous.<br />Gleau finally irritates someone enough that he winds up in a rather interesting predicament at novel's end.  Plus, the identity of the one-eyed man and his ravens is revealed, and after you've completed the novel, it is gratifying to know that you don't have to wait two years until the sequel.<br />David has done a masterful job with the New Frontier series, and with this entry he proves that he is still one of the best writers in the Star Trek pantheon.<br />Highly recommended, even for those of you who aren't regular New Frontier readers.	2003-09-30

I've watched the NJO novels go from good to great to...this.  &quot;Reunion&quot; is not the worst novel in the NJO series--that distinction belongs to &quot;Refugee,&quot; the preceding novel--but it comes really close.  It's taken three books--three long, exhaustive, mind-numbing books--for Luke and the rest to finally make it to Zonama Sekot.  But before they can form any sort of alliance with the planet, it orchestrates the kidnapping of Danni and the alleged appearance of a coralskipper in the strange region of space Zonama Sekot is sheltered in.<br />And then you have the Han, Leia, Jaina, Jag, and Imperial Fleet plot in which they encounter strange life forms and battle with Tahiri's current state of unconsciousness; the one saving grace is that the shoeless Jedi spends most of her time in the novel trapped in her own mind, so we really don't have to listen to her mutterings.  Just internal monologues and Riina/Tahiri battling it out.  The symbolism of unity between Vong and Jedi is so obvious it's ineffective.<br />And the Nom Anor plot is so cookie cutter it's laughable; all it does is give us insight into Shimmra's arrogance, deteriorating mind, and venemous hatred for all things heretical (am I the only one who thinks Onimi is the true power behind the throne and the grotesque appearance is only a masquer?).<br />I stand firm by saying the strongest entry into NJO was &quot;Star by Star;&quot; the rest has been lukewarm at best, &quot;Reunion&quot; at worst.<br />After this mess, there are only two books left, so I suppose that's good news; I'll be glad to see the resolution.  Hopefully, we'll have another &quot;shocking&quot; death to close out the series; perhaps Mara or Han or Jaina will join Chewbacca, Anakin Solo, Borsk Fey'lya, and the other cannon fodder in the Star Wars literary trash heap; it couldn't be worse than what is sure to follow the bizarre NJO arc.	2003-09-29

Then, it was a dry, dull tale of a Puritan woman who had a penchant for a minister's black veil.<br />Now, though, a few years later, it is clear that Hawthorne's seminal novel is more than just a tragic love story.  It is yet another \\"defining\\" piece of literature, this time centering on Puritanism and its eventual decline, a decline clearly evidenced when the women first see Hester leave her jail cell, Pearl clutched close to her chest.  The older women condemn her, but the youngest of them seems indifferent, an air of what could be understanding about her.<br />Hawthorne's use of metaphor, symoblism, and the intriguing characterization of Hester, Chillingworth, and Dimmesdale as well as Pearl--who herself is a symbol of change and hope--serve to turn the mundane plot and two-hundred years of dust into an excellent work of art.<br />We know who Pearl's father is, and the ultimate moment in the novel is not when Dimmesdale exposes his breast and reveals his own scarlet letter; it instead occurs during the juxtaposition of night and day, of Dimmesdale's refusal to admit his guilt, of Chillingworth's insidious insertion into Dimmesdale's trust.<br />\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is not the best novel in existence, but it is worth the price of admission, and its overtones have an impact even today, addressing many social issues and resolving them in ways that echo biases and solutions of today.	2003-09-27

Told in first-person through the young, middle-class metaphor Nick Carraway, the story has one of the most overarching themes I have ever encountered.  On one level a tragic love triangle between Daisy Buchanan, Tom Miller, and Jay Gatsby.  On another, it tells the story of New York's middle- and upper-classes, and the aftereffects of a lavish lifestyle on both societies.<br />The narrative unfolds in a straightforward manner, and the language is beautiful, the prose intricately crafted with the care of a master gardener.<br />The novel also touches briefly on the theme of war as well; Gatsby returns to find his idea of feminine perfection, Daisy, has married the bellicose Tom Buchanan.  Gatsby becomes infatuated with the acquisition of wealth, material possessions and appearances the centerpoint of his existence.  Which makes his ending all the more powerful; in the end, Gatsby is undone by his greed and egocentrism.<br />There is much, much more to the book--including the character of Jordan Baker, the significance of Gatsby's surname, and Meyer Wolfsheim--but there is not nearly enough space to discuss this masterpiece of American Literature.<br />Yes, it has been the hallmark of high school English classes, but that should not be it's grave; indeed, it is the foundation of modern literature and the defining moment for an entire generation.	2003-09-27

Now, everything changes.&quot;  With that paraphrase, Walter Jon Williams sets the stage for the final quarter of the New Jedi Order Saga.  Reeling from Anakin's death and the assumed death of Jacen, the New Republic faces one of its greatest challenges: rebuilding the fractured alliance of planets that opposed a dark empire and was crushed by an invisible enemy.<br />The Galactic Alliance (nee New Republic) relocates its base to Mon Calamari, and to rebuild the galaxy they need a Chief of State.  And this is where the novel misses its mark; there is far too much political manuevering, and the overall tone is somewhat deadened by the far-reaching politics.  We know from the beginning who will win the election between Fyor Rodan and Cal Omas; there really is no suspense.  This is what we see Luke and Mara due through the course of the novel: shady backroom dealings to orchestrate desired election results.<br />Han and Leia attempt to reopen ties with the Remnant but are rebuffed; we learn a bit here, such as Pellaeon's penchant for gardening and overindulging in food, but in all honesty, it's really not worth the ink.<br />Jacen returns with Vergere a little worse for wear; she presents an idea of the Force that conflicts with Luke's, and it can be summed up rather simply: &quot;Either the Vong are a terrible evil that live outside the Force, or your perception of the Force is skewed.&quot;<br />And it goes on.  Jaina is named Sword of the Jedi, Jacen manages to begin his destiny but at a price, the Vong suffer a couple of setbacks, and the whole series of incidents with the aftereffects of the Well of the World Brain are highly amusing.  Any planet that passes gas is worth a cheap laugh.<br />Tahiri also returns as a conflicted, delusional young woman who imagines Anakin is after her; Jaina rescues her and is thrust into an even greater mystery, one that will return in the Force Heretic Trilogy.<br />When all is said and done, Williams is a talented author, even if he changes characters' eye colors on occasion.  The novel is a bridge and is necessary if you plan on finishing the cycle; a lot happens here, but it is often rushed and underplayed; this should have been a book on the scope of &quot;Star by Star,&quot; but instead we were treated to a slimmer text that leaves more questions than answers.<br />As always is the case in the Star Wars Universe.Williams is a talented author, even if he changes characters' eye colors on occasion.

Indeed, the only redeeming quality about the novel is that we get additional insights into Ensign Nikolas and his unrequited love for Idun.  Heartbreaking but emotionless, the ending resonates--for a few seconds.<br />The other story with Vigo is flat; a new phaser design (hence the rather unattractive cover) means a Pandrilite raid on the planet Wayland and the capture of Starfleet forces.  Ironic that a planet full of security officers is rendered ineffective by a lowly group of marauders.  I laughed at the very idea.<br />In short, you need to read &quot;Three&quot; if you plan on continuing the storyline.  If you're just buying it for a quick read, eh, go either way.

Unlike the right-wing media plastered on the TV screens in the background, Franken (along with the aptly named &quot;Team Franken&quot;) did his research, meticulously plotting the weak spots in the arguments of Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, and Sean Hannity (to name a few) and then strategically striking the weak spots, causing the rightist arguments to crumble on their faulty reasoning.<br />Politics aside--well, actually, you can't put the politics aside for this book.  Bottom line, if you're on the left you'll definitely like it, if you're on the right you'll burn it, and if you're on the fence you'll be, at best, ambivalent.  The truth is, Franken is one of America's greatest satirists, blending fact with humor, bias with verbosity.  While the book could have been called &quot;Bill O'Reilly is a Splotchy, Contradictory, Slightly-overweight Hypocrite&quot; it is not; the title merely reflects what you will find between the covers: an exposure of right-wing fallacies.<br />Like I said, your politics will determine the purchase; however, if you can set aside prejudices, read the book.  It is an interesting look at how Fox News and other Right-leaning news organizations color the facts for their own gain--which is not to say that liberals are any less guilty of the crime, though evidence of this is nonexistent in &quot;Lies...&quot;--and how the distortion can make or break a person's public image.<br />That, and he really sticks it to O'Reilly.

For those of you keeping track, this is the fourteenth book in the Prey series, and Sandford continues the tradition of mounting suspense, brilliant characterizations, and plot twists that on occasion require five different colors of magic markers and scores of boxes and arrows pointing to the list of suspects.  As the book jacket says, Davenport is now employed by the governor's office, and as a result the spotlight here is focused upon Davenport and Del Capslock; the second-stringers are all local cops, a few \\"feds,\\" and, of course, the well-written Letty West.<br />  West is the young girl who discovers the corpses of Deon Cash and Jane Warr hanging from a tree. Immediately, the word \\"lynching\\" is tossed out, creating a stir of old racial prejudices.  However, there is more at play than drug dealing and small-town prejudice; in the small town of Broderick, there is a web spreading from Minnesota to Kansas City, a web with something nasty lurking at the center, a cold-blooded killer who will stop at nothing to protect their skin.<br />  The characterization is taut, we see Lucas's eyes wander a couple of times, and we also get to see Lucas meet his caustic match in the twelve year-old Letty.  Weather, Rose Marie, and the Big New House are all tossed into the story with exquisite precision, and the novel lives up to the editorial and critical praise that always seems premature: it truly is the best Prey novel to date, and the only thing worse than realizing that the novel is over so quickly is the realization that we have another year to wait before Davenport returns.	2003-05-15

It is the end of the New Republic and the beginning of a journey that will return the likes of Han, Leia, Wedge, Luke, and the rest to what they once were: Rebels.<br />\\"Star by Star\\" is a dark novel, but it is also the most well-written piece of Star Wars fiction to come down the pipe since Timothy Zahn introduced Thrawn.  By reintroducing characters like Garm Bel Iblis and Vergere, the stage is set for some interesting bits of characterization.  We begin to see the stirrings of the Dark Side in Jaina, Jacen starts to understand the role he may play in the future, and Anakin...well, Anakin certainly saves the day for the Jedi, if not the galaxy.<br />The characterization is wonderful, and the plot moves at a quickened pace.  For a book this size, it is surprisingly easy to finish.<br />I enjoyed seeing Lando and his new army of droids and their ironic appearance and style as well as (finally) the unveiling of Viqi Shesh as the traitor she is (that is, the characters finally learn she's a collaborator, though the signs haven't exactly been subtle).  The voxyn were also a unique creation, and I expect we'll see a few more pop up here and there--maybe.<br />With all the talk about the \\"big death\\" and the subsequent complaints, one thing readers are overlooking is Borsk Fey'lya's final sacrifice. Having denounced the Jedi in the past, he dies a hero, taking out a sizeable portion of Coruscant and Yuuzhan Vong as well.<br />Don't let all the negative reviews turn you away from \\"Star by Star;\\" if anything, the \\"big death\\" gives incentive to the major characters to finally go on the offensive instead of cooling their heels and letting the galaxy be chipped away from them due to galaxywide collaboration.<br />Yes, it was dark.  Yes, there is another \\"tragic\\" death, but it serves a point: no one, not even the Jedi, can escape the darkness the Yuuzhan Vong have brought to their galaxy.

US	48648796	R32PU7QWV9FTBJ	074343112X	20110081	Gateways Book Seven  What Lay Beyond (Star Trek)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Adequate conclusion to the Gateways Saga	I was skeptical of this crossover from the beginning. Six Trek franchises and one building point, with each stand-alone tossing their respective captains (or colonel) into unknown dangers. Kirk's conclusion was probably the worst; yes, we learned a little about the Petraw, but who really cares?<br />Diane Carey's Challenger conclusion was alright; with the release of the next Challenger novel, we'll see some aftershocks of Keller's final decision.<br />Colonel Kira's story was much better; we learn something about Bajor's past (we're talking ancient past here) and Kira grows in her role as DS9's commanding officer. Plus, we first meet the Iconians in this story.<br />Then comes Janeway. From the you-know-it-was-going-to-happen department, she meets Q. Long story short, Hirogen get the murderer and prepare to torture him, ships get sent home, and Q snaps No Man's Land into nothing.<br />New Frontier: Xenexian Valhalla. Add Shelby &amp; Calhoun. Sprinkle the usual Peter David flair and you have the stand-out story.<br />Next Generation: Picard meets the Iconians; he's the Federation's expert, so no surprise here.  What is a surprise, however, is how the Gateways are shut down and who is responsible.<br />It was good, not great, but if you need to know what happens, pick it up.	2001-10-30

In this novel, Han and Leia (seem to) patch things up and the death of Chewbacca is now a quiet ache in both their lives.  Anakin explores his relationship with Tahiri, and takes Corran Horn, who went into hiding after the Ithor disaster, along for the ride.  Jacen comes to grips with his views on the Force, seeing just how arrogant he was, fighting alongside his mother and father in their own war against the Peace Brigade, the galaxy's most vengeful collaborators.  On the Vong side, Nen Yim, disgraced shaper adept, has been exiled to a ship of disgraced Yuuzhan Vong, a ship that is now dying.  However, she receives a visit from a Master Shaper who is more than he seems, leading Nen Yim further on the path towards murder and greater heresy.  Also, Vergere returns...but not to the New Republic.  She boards the Sunulok to meet with Warmaster Lah in an attempt to capture Jacen Solo aboard the Millenium Falcon.  And not to be outdone, Mara comes to term with her pregnancy (literally) and with the birth will either be a new hope, or a greater darkness than the Jedi currently face.  Nonstop action, coupled with Keyes' elegant prose, makes Rebirth the standout novel of NJO so far.  Highly recommended to the fans of The New Jedi Order and those who just like things the way they were.	2001-07-31

Here, Bashir must confort his darkest desires that intertwine with his brightest hopes, a utopian galaxy where none need fear reprisal or war.  One catch--the &quot;savior&quot; is a genetically enhanced human who has taken over a Jem'Hadar hatchery, making the engineered killers loyal only to him.<br />Stranded on a planet in the Badlands, Bashir and Ezri are taken to Dr. Locken's--our antagonist--fortress. Ro and Taran'atar are themselves stranded in the wilderness, turning to an arboreal species for help.  Naturally, the four are reunited... ...And to say more will give far too much away. On the station, however, DS9 is brought back to normal operating capacity, Prynn Tenmei's contempt for Vaughn is again brought to light, Kira is still grappling with her Attainment and being treated as if she were a pariah, the last of which begins to take its strain on Kira as well as her ex-lover, Shakaar. And Section 31 goes on, like some small but integral cog in the grand machine of the galaxy, grinding those it needs to dust, but prevailing in the name of greatness, no matter the cost. Enjoy.	2001-06-28
US	48648796	R8FUSM8Q1RHFG	0345428579	706445147	Balance Point (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 6)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	An integral part of the NJO series	Kathy Tyers has picked up the torch passed on by James Luceno, adapting the old Star Wars characters into the new galaxy these authors are creating.  Granted, there are some holes in the story, but that is to be expected from a continuing series; the reprecussions of what happened here will undoubtedly be explained further into the series (as book six in the series, the conclusion is hardly close at hand). While the Han and Leia reunion could've been longer, do we really need to see them reunited yet again?  Like they haven't been separated before.  Tyers has chosen to focus on the Solo children as well as Luke &amp; Mara and their as yet unborn child.  It's called the New Jedi Order, and as such must be expected to follow the Jedi, who are blamed for the Yuuzhan Vong incursion into their galaxy.  So it's only natural to follow their plight. Tyers delivers with her trademark plot, and things heat up at the end, with Jacen Solo left to make a choice, one that could irrevocably put him on the path towards the Dark Side.  He must find his balance, or risk losing the way of life his parents fought so hard for. I highly recommend this book, especially if you plan on finishing the series.	2001-06-24

As Warmaster Tsavong Lah's demand of all the Jedi--young and old, human and alien--settles upon the worlds of the Republic, the Peace Brigade, the galaxy's biggest collaborators, have settled in wait in the Yavin system in a search for the Jedi praxeum. Acting against orders, Anakin Solo takes his X-wing to Yavin to rescue his friend Tahiri after he experiences a vision of her on Coruscant. After a few chapters, the Yuuzhan Vong transform the jungle moon of Yavin Four into their own bio-organic image, complete with Shaper compounds.  Here we have an important introduction of not only a group of characters heretofor unknown, but also the first seeds of dissent in the minds of the Yuuzhan Vong.  The Shamed Ones seek retribution, and one encounters Anakin, eventually allying himself with the Jedi, whom he sees as a chance for redemption. Mezhan Kwaad, a Master Shaper, snares Tahiri, seeking to transform her into a Dark side-wielding Yuuzhan Vong warrior to which she will present to Overlord Shimmra.  Her plan almost succeeds, but in the end Anakin prevails, professes a love for Tahiri (at a young age, but this is fiction) and together they blast out of the Shaper compound for freedom. An important book in the series, Edge of Victory shows us the shapers, the maturing of Anakin in both his Force abilities and own personal tragedies, and introduces heresy into the mix, along with the Shamed Ones' murmurs that the \\"Jeedai\\" can get them closer to the gods.  Is this then a precursor of what to expect, a civil war among the Yuuzhan Vong, soldiers versus the shamed, scientists verses priests?  Only time will tell.	2001-06-24
US	48648796	RQUW7S7ER32H8	0345442989	164434464	Star Wars: Cloak of Deception	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Definitely makes Episode I easier to swallow.	Yes, it's mainly a novel of politics and intrigue, but it offers a much needed explanation of why things happened the way they did.  Luceno's return to the Star Wars universe is welcome; after the well-written Agents of Chaos duology, it's nice to see him tackle the so-called &quot;early years.&quot; Granted, there is not as much overt action, but a good book doesn't require a space battle or cooridor shootout every other chapter.  It's not for everybody, however; those of you who feed off of the...explosiveness of the X-wing series and others probably won't have an easy time with this one, so I'd recommend either checking it out at the library or waiting for the paperback. There is a level of maturity in the book in that it's not written for the younger fans.  Most would have a hard time grasping the political aspect of things.  All in all, I'd buy it, if only for the appearances of some familiar names and a taste of what to expect in the next film.	2001-06-02

With the introduction of several new characters from the Bolian Jast (whose time in the series is rather short) to the Andorian Shar to former Starfleet Lieutenant Ro Laren, the first book offers a little for everyone, with a Dominion assault that could mean the harbinger of another war, the Enterprise crew finding an artifact that could change the entire Bajoran culture, this new springboard series is excellent. When a Bajoran monk is murdered on the station, an investigation into her murder begins, but shortly after the Dominion attacks, killing hundreds, destroying a starship and damaging DS9.  The new and old officers are left, once again, as protectors of the Alpha Quadrant.  But just why has the Dominion launched an assault, and what do Picard and the Enterprise find?  I guess that's why they make &quot;Part two's.&quot;	2001-05-01
US	48648796	RCHO95RTIR2W2	0671047493	267669472	Maximum Warp Book One:  Dead Zone (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 62)	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Another Foray Into Galactic Catastrophies	This two book series is set against the backdrop of the Alpha Quadrant three or so months after the conclusion of the Dominion War.  The Federation and Romulan Empire are both straining under the fragile peace that the War brought upon them, but find themselves in a staring contest as a series of &quot;Dead Zones&quot; crop up across the quadrants; these Zones somehow render a drastic change in substance, rendering everything from communications to warp drive to even the seemingly infallible Data useless.<br />The Enterprise is sent on a covert mission to the Neutral Zone, carrying with them one Ambassador Spock.  Together, with their reluctant Romulan allies, they must discover the true nature of the Subspace Deserts, and it may cost them their lives, or perhaps signal the end of the civilization that they have fought so hard for.<br />It is only fair to say that the &quot;End of The Universe&quot; storylines have been overused, but, like the Genesis Wave duology, Maximum Warp offers up a fresh spin on the tired old tale.  Brodeur and Galanter (who always does the bulk of the work) follow the plot well, and the characterization is as I've come to expect from this team of writers.<br />The idea is original and begs the question: what would happen to the universe of the 24th Century if everything they'd come to depend on would serve them no more, and to what extreme measures would they go? These questions are answered, and aside from the occasional hopping around (especially early on; but it does drive the plot forward) and somewhat obvious plot twists, the books reads well and is worth buying.<br />The end will leave you hanging, and the desire to start (and finish) book two will probably overtake you. All in all, an excellent work that gives us a rare glimpse in a little-seen race from the television series', the Romulans. Well written, well-plotted, well-characterized, but a little choppy.  Final verdict: Four stars.	2001-03-01
