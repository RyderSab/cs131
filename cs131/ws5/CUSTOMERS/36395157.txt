I bought this for something new and exciting, she is homeschooled and almost 6 years old learning Kindergarten. I couldn't believe this book, come on counting by 10's, making change by 10's? Learning to circle all Fridays in a month? Young children have a hard time understanding time, years, days, months etc, now circle all the Fridays? I believe if your child is gifted, buy this. If not go to Borders or Walmart and pick up some school books in the book area. Don't waste our money on this. Why push a Kindergarteners little brain to make change by 10's? They don't even have money. How are they going to use this concept.  Unreal.	2004-05-05

I love to read this book for a pick me up, when things get me down. Also, I love this narration philosophy. My daughter is not co-ordinated enough to write yet, but very intelligent.

I didn't know where to start with a boy and I thought I did everything wrong with my daughter. I read this book and realized I did do things right by trying and then stopping for a couple of months, with her, if things were not progressing. This book has  true bathroom stories and advice that makes you feel  your not alone. It has some new tips. I like this womans style, not so high pressure, like the pediatric potty books. They are so agressive on age, pushing, etc. Hats off to Jan.	2003-08-02

If your like me and need fast projects because of small children, forget it. They use lots of beads and special threads. I think its great for your library. But these are very long and specialized, detailed graphs. I have to tell you I was happy that I bought it, but I will not be using it soon, some day when I have more time. There are some beautiful wedding samplers, pictures of flowers and no holiday special pictures, which I loved. If you like to work with beads and special threads go for it, if your a simple cross stitch lady like me with no time, wait until you have more time.	2003-02-20

There are really unusual floral designs. They want you to work them as a grouping. Sure, you have to use your imagination on the end result, but so what. I would rather have more graphs then pages of talk and pictures. Really unusual, classy, designs. Vases, realistic flowers, unusual animals and borders. I think some of these will be good for a man and his office. And we know how hard it is to find mens designs.	2003-01-28
