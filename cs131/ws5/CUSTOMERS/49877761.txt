She had eaten it without being aware of eating, her mind in a reverie.    \\"Did you like it?\\"    She looked up.  Somehow she wasn't surprised.  \\"What was it?\\" she asked.    \\"It doesn't have a name,\\" Bruno said. \\"It's just... it's just the food of love.\\"  [Page 255]    This romantic comedy, mainly set in Rome, is an enjoyable tale of two Italian men who romance an American student with food.  Although a very different story, a part of the theme is reminiscent of \\"Cyrano de Bergerac.\\"      Reading THE FOOD OF LOVE will leave you dreaming about a visit to Italy, a fine Italian meal, perhaps preparing a meal of your own, and the sentiments of romance.    I enjoyed every single page of the story. From the moment I picked up the book, if I wasn't chuckling, I had a smile on my face.      The vivid description of characters, neighborhood, and locales reminded me of my time in Italy as study-abroad student.  Each character was engaging and authentic - from the protagonists to the secondary characters.      I loved the restaurant/kitchen scenes; the descriptions of Bruno shopping and cooking; and the scenes of the small Italian town where he found some solace.    I got a kick out of the Italian sayings and their translations:  Parla comme t'ha fatto mammeta.  Translation:  Speak as your mother showed you - i.e., Cut the [bull].  [Page 36].  Applied in appropriate segments, they were funny and added to the make up of the characters that used them.  I could envision Tomasso and Bruno talking like that.      Along with a happy ending, the story finishes with a few simple recipes.  Normally, I don't cook, but I was inspired to try making some of the dishes.  I'm happy to write that my cooking endeavors were a success.    Cleverly written, THE FOOD OF LOVE is a recommended read.    Fafa Demasio	2005-03-09

He wants to marry her but she refuses because she has issues about marriage and doesn't think that either one of them is marriage material. <br /> <br />The story takes place in a small town where everyone knows everyone else's business and talk about the going ons in the town spread as fast as a fire.  Molly gets her share of unsolicited advice from folks not afraid to give it.   <br /> <br />The characters are all different and fun to follow. Probably my favorite character is Molly's grandmother, Granny Dusty, described as the \\"man-hatingest woman in Throckleford County.\\" Her antics and comments are just too funny! <br /> <br />The main characters Molly O'Dare and Tate Bravo fit each other so well.  It is satisfying to read about how they gradually come to terms with their issues and feelings for each other.  The story of their journey to the altar is an appealing read.  Like the townspeople, you'll want to witness the part where Molly finally says, \\"I do.\\"   <br /> <br />By the end of the book, you'll be glad that you didn't miss Molly and Tate's story. <br /> <br />Fafa Demasio <br /> <br />	2004-12-05

He describes his life in America and his relationship with the people that he meets.   It starts with his first job, first place to stay and the people that he meets.   Early on, everyone warns him to \\"stay with his own kind\\" (Irish people) only.  McCourt ignores that advice and meets some very colorful people.<br />McCourt joins the army and serves abroad.  He returns to Ireland for a visit.  Later McCourt is able to attend New York University although he never graduated from high school.  He starts a teaching career and gets his first job in a Staten Island high school.  McCourt describes the challenges he encounters with his students - youngsters and grown-ups alike.  <br />McCourt also describes his relationship with his parents as an adult.  He cares for his mother, although she exasperates him sometimes.  He is disappointed with his father's care of the family but still tries to reach out to his father on several occasions.  He also mentions his brothers.<br />I enjoyed this memoir because after reading \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" I wanted to know what happened to McCourt as an adult.  `TIS answered all the questions that I had - What happened when he left for America?

He has vivid memories that start as early as the age of four or five.<br />McCourt is born in Brooklyn, New York.  His father is an alcoholic and can't hold a job or support his family. They return to live in Ireland where his father eventually abandons the family.  Some of McCourt's siblings die.  He faces hunger, illness, death and homelessness.  The family is so poor that they live without the basic necessities that many people take for granted. Yet, they are always kind to others (humans and animals) less fortunate.  When McCourt is 19, he returns to New York City.<br />McCourt describes a lot of touching scenes, like the time his little brother, Michael, brings home a blind greyhound.  Michael sacrifices his supper (bread) to the dog and lets it sleep in the bed that all the children share.  Later they find the dog dead.  His brother is so upset that their mother allows them to stay home from school so that they can have a funeral.<br />Chapter Four is my favorite chapter, where the author describes his experiences in an Irish school - the strict teachers, learning the catechism, his first communion, his first confession, his confirmation, giving his first collection, and watching movies starring James Cagney.<br />McCourt tells his remarkable story, many times with humor. <br />ANGELA'S ASHES is a reminder of the many children in this world who have to grow up in poverty.  Some of those children survive and others don't.  I'm glad that McCourt survived and has shared his touching story with us.<br />Fafa Demasio	2003-06-28

Ramotswe, how fortunate I am in this life; at every moment, but especially now, sitting on the verandah of my house in Zebra Drive, and looking up at the high sky of Botswana, so empty that the blue is almost white.  Here she was then, Precious Ramotswe, owner of Botswana's only detective agency, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency-an agency which by and large had lived up to its initial promise to provide satisfaction for its clients, although some of them, it must be said, could never be satisfied.  And here she was too, somewhere in her late thirties, which as far as she was concerned was the very finest age to be; here she was with the house in Zebra Drive and two orphan children, a boy and a girl, bringing life and chatter into the home.  These were blessings with which anybody should be content.  With these things in one's life, one might well say that nothing more was needed.\\" (Page 1)<br />So begins Alexander McCall Smith's latest book, THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN.  He has a wonderful African storytelling voice.  Parts of the book are funny, sad, educational, and touching.<br />Mma. Ramotswe deals with real and moral problems. Although the troubles take place in Africa, they are universal and range from searching for people from the past, cheating spouses, looking for love, raising children, trying to improve one's financial status, trying to right a wrong, to dealing with competition, and more.<br />I enjoy the way Mma. Ramotswe solves her clients' problems as well as her own. There are no guns or high-speed chases.  There is no fighting, cursing, or the likes. An element of danger and adventure exists in Mma. Ramotswe's work but the detective uses her wits and manners when dealing with others.  The plot is always refreshing.<br />I love the way THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN transports me to Mma. Ramotswe's world.  I feel like I'm a part of the detective agency.  I feel like I'm riding with Mma. Ramotswe in her little white van along the Botswana plains.

By today's standards, it may be described as quaint but still very enjoyable.  The writing is lyrical, descriptive, and charming; the love storyline is ageless.  <br />The story revolves around Jane Champion and Garth Dalmain.  Jane is talented, smart, good-natured and independent.  However she is a unique heroine because unlike the female protagonists in many romance stories, Jane is described as homely-looking.  She is also older than the hero, Garth - a vibrant, energetic, gifted, and extraordinarily handsome man.    <br />The title refers to a popular song written in 1898 by composers Ethelbert Nevin and Robert Cameron Rogers.  Garth realizes that he is in love with Jane after hearing her sing the song at a public performance.  When he declares his love to Jane and wants to marry her, she turns him down, although she also loves him; Jane doesn't believe that Garth will be truly happy living with a plain-looking woman for the rest of his life.  Broken-hearted, the two part ways but reunite, later, under sad and unexpected circumstances.  <br />How do Jane and Garth finally accept each other?  Writer Florence Barclay writes a story that makes you want to keep reading till you find out how the lovers reunite.<br />I first heard about THE ROSARY, a few years ago, on a T.V. program that reported a true story of a woman who always mentioned the book.  A relative of hers decided to search for the then out-of-print book and give it to her as a surprise gift.  Through what could only be described as a miracle, the relative eventually found the book.  Fascinated with the story of the woman's attachment to the book, I decided to look for it.  I couldn't find the book anywhere.  Years later, I happened to mentioned THE ROSARY to a friend.  Guess where she found it?  On Amazon.com!  I think it's great that anyone can find the book (and many other things) here!   <br />If you like stories like Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, and Sense and Sensibility, you'll enjoy this tale.

Weldon's novel, MOONGATE, takes place on two settings - the earth and moon.  The year is 2017.  Scott Andrews, U.S. Representative and Chairman of the House Space Committee, heads a special mission to the moon.  The group consists of an international (Russia, Israel, Australia, Japan and Russia) team of scientist-astronauts that will set up a nuclear fusion plant to resolve the earth's energy crises.  On the moon, the scientists create a wormhole and mysteriously receive powerful information from an unknown source.  It is information that advances human knowledge ten-fold on how to eradicate illnesses, prolong life and enhance genetic engineering. This is a wonderful discovery except that this data in the wrong hands would cause more harm than help.  The entire human race could change with unknown consequences.  The main characters have to make a decision about what to do with the information.  Meanwhile, on earth, several covert activities affecting the moon venture take place.  Certain country leaders have a deeper agenda than that of the special energy project and particular people want Andrews out of the way.  Colleen Barker, the congressman's chief of staff and Michael James (one of the main characters from Proctor's earlier novel, THE LAST STAR) help investigate. <br />MOONGATE is a dynamic science fiction, political thriller with Christian themes that add an extra special quality to the book.  Each chapter is full of surprises.  The storyline gradually unfolds so that all the characters and their actions are believable and hold your attention.  The suspense is laid out so well that you can't wait to get to the next chapter.  If you choose to read MOONGATE before bedtime, like I did, you may find it hard to get some sleep.  You'll be sorely tempted to stay up all night to finish the book.  I kept saying to myself, &quot;Just one more chapter, then I'll put the book down.  Just one more chapter.&quot;   I always enjoy reading Proctor's books because they are not only entertaining but also educational.  <br />Publishers Weekly comments that Proctor &quot;shows promise of becoming the Christian Tom Clancy.&quot;  That's no lie.  I look forward to reading more of his books like MOONGATE.  <br />Fafa Demasio	2002-10-01

THE STONE BOUDOIR is a collection of stories about author Theresa Maggio's experience in the unnoticed mountain towns of Sicily.  It's about the people she meets, their customs, stories and the island's rich and fascinating history (involving the Greeks, Romans, Arabs and the Normans).<br />At the start of the 20th century, Maggio's grandparents immigrated to America from Santa Margherita Belice, a small Sicilian mountain town.  In 1973, Maggio makes her way to Sicily for her first visit.  She finds the island so alluring that she returns for many more visits.<br />Not only does Maggio visit her grandparents' hometown, she goes further to explore other Sicilian towns.  The writer describes them as, \\"Tiny jewels, remote and isolated, these are places tourists seldom see.  But they are the island's hidden treasure and the secret spring of Sicilian endurance.\\"  After reading THE STONE BOUDOIR, I have to agree - what riches these places and people have to offer, indeed!<br />Maggio's descriptions of these villages are priceless - like her first visit to Polizzi Generosa, a town on the peak of the Madonie Mountain in north-central Sicily or sleeping in a cave home in Sperlinga, an ancient mountain town in Sicily's center.  But it is the natives and their stories that make up the most pleasurable part of the book.  My top three favorite stories are of Signora Maria, a 71-year-old woman with an amazing childhood who liked to memorize and could still recite folk poems by heart; Enza Dolce who has accomplished many firsts as a single woman in Sicily despite adversity and Nunzio Putrino, an old Sicilian bagpiper who met and wooed his wife over his music-playing without saying a word.  <br />There's an excellent chapter on the 1968 earthquake that affected many of the towns.  Margherita Cacioppo, who was nine when the earthquake occurred, shares her account.  The images of what happened during the earthquake and what her family did to survive are very vivid.  <br />There are many more fantastic stories, each one is unique but all contain the similar characteristic trait of a resilient people.  <br />There are no photos in the book but you can find a nice collection highlighted on the writer's web site...Some of my favorites are:  Maletto Bagpipes, A Sperlinga Cave dweller, Love on a Plate, The Stone Boudoir, Sheep Sleep in Palaces, Locati Wash on Line and many more.  The photos are exactly the way I imagined them from Maggio's narrations. But is it definitely nice to see the real thing.<br />Reading THE STONE BOUDOIR is like having a cup of coffee/cappuccino/espresso/ tea (insert your beverage of choice) with a friend as she shares, with you, stories about her visit to a special place.  What a wonderful look at Sicily and its people. You won't regret reading this book.<br />Fafa Demasio	2002-09-03

I loved passages like this one found on page 55 (Chapter Six - A Dry Place):<br />&quot;Then there was Mr. Mandela.  Everybody knew about Mr. Mandela and how he had forgiven those who had imprisoned him.  They had taken away years and years of his life simply because he wanted justice.  They had set him to work in a quarry and his eyes had been permanently damaged by the rock dust.  But at last, when he had walked out of the prison on that breathless, luminous day, he had said nothing about revenge or even retribution.  He had said that there were more important things to do than to complain about the past, and in time he had shown that he meant this by hundreds of acts of kindness towards those who had treated him so badly.  That was the real African way, the tradition that was closest to the heart of Africa.  We are all children of Africa, and none of us is better or more important than the other.  This is what Africa could say to the world:  it could remind it what it is to be human.&quot;<BR>     <BR>I'm tickled by some of the story details, such as the names of the businesses in the book  -- Mothobani Bookkeeping Services:  Tell the Taxman to Go Away; Make Me Beautiful Salon; Honest Deal Butchery; Judgment-day Jewellers.  Of course, let's not forget The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency!  Love those names.  <br />TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE is full of special narrative touches that are unexpected, humorous, serious, enlightening, mysterious and moving like &quot;The Boy with an African Heart,&quot; a missing American boy.  The solutions to some of the problems are fitting.  <br />Fafa Demasio	2002-08-21

Ramotswe, owner of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana, Africa!  I love this strong African woman who is proud of who and what she is and where she is from and I'm highly entertained by the clients and other characters that she comes across.  <br />\\"We help people with the problems in their lives.  We are not here to solve crimes,\\" Mma. Ramotswe tells one client.  Not your average detective, she and her staff of one (Mma. Makutsi, her secretary turned-assistant detective) help people from different backgrounds with varied problems.  Mma. Ramotswe even has a personal problem to resolve when her fiancée (Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors) starts acting in a strange manner without warning or reasoning.<br />I like the way the author brings out the close relationship between Mma. Ramotswe and Mr. Matekoni.  The couple chooses to address each other formally but it is done in the context of respect, affection and love. The mannerisms and dialog between the other characters show the reader some of the cultural nuances in that part of the world.  <br />The issue of morality -- how people treat each other, forgiveness, helping others -- comes up as the detectives work.

A Song Flung Up To Heaven is a continuation of the experiences of Maya Angelou.  If you've read any of her previous memoirs, you will know that Dr. Angelou has lead and continues to led a rich and full life - something that cannot be covered in one or two books.  <br />This sixth memoir starts with Dr. Angelou's return to the U.S. from Ghana, West Africa.  It ends with the time she was about to write her first memoir, I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings. In between, the book is filled with her encounters with various people and her experience during some disturbing times in American history - the murder of Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther King, and the Watts riots in California.<br />I most enjoyed reading about my favorite personalities from Dr. Angelou's past memoirs - Vus Make, her handsome, intelligent, charismatic African husband; Bailey Johnson, her older, caring big brother; Guy Johnson, her intelligent, independent son and Vivian Baxter, her smart mother.  <br />Reading Dr. Angelou's continued memoir is like sitting with an old, trusted and respected friend; there's a treasured feeling as you listen to her stories as they come one after the other.  <br />Fafa Demasio	2002-04-28

Ramotswe.<br />We read about Mma. Ramotswe life growing up and that of her father who worked as a miner and later became a prosperous cattle owner.  When her father passes away, being the only child, Mma. Ramostswe becomes the recipient of a sizable amount of money.  She decides to use the funds to establish what will become the first detective agency in Botswana (in the southern part of Africa).  This decision will make her &quot;the first and only lady private detective in the whole of Botswana...&quot; When others scoff at or try to dissuade her about the idea of female detective, Mma. Ramotswe deftly points to the well-known mystery writer, Agatha Christie who solved many mysteries through popular characters such as Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple.  <br />This portly, intelligent and amusing woman is an unlikely character, in an unlikely setting - Africa. But why not?  There are mysteries to be solved everywhere and by anyone.<br />Mma. Ramotswe's cases are amusing - they range from imposters, missing husbands, lost children, to stolen property and more.  What is interesting is the way the premier lady detective solves her cases and handles herself in particular situations and with others.<br />Author Alexander Mc Call Smith, who is also a law professor, was born in Zimbabwe (southern part of Africa) and educated in that country as well as in Scotland.  He successfully captures the true essence, mannerisms, greetings and culture of Africa and its characters that are proud to come from that continent.  <br />In addition to Botswana and South Africa, other countries such as Ghana, Nigeria (countries in West Africa), Lesotho, Mozambique, and Malawi (countries in the southern part of Africa, not to be confused with South Africa) are mentioned as well.  If you are unaware of these countries, it is a nice learning experience.  <br />After reading &quot;The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,&quot; you'll feel as if you've been to Botswana and solved a few cases, yourself!    Read it, you'll enjoy it!<br />Fafa Demasio	2002-04-01

When a fortuneteller warns seasoned journalist Tiziano Terzani that he should avoid any kind of air flight travel for one whole year, it is not the kind of thing one wants to hear as a traveler in this modern day and age.  It is less of a warning that a traveling journalist wants to take notice of.<br />Should he scoff at the divination or should he take it seriously?<br />Terzani decides to follow the advice the way many people in that Chinese culture would do.  Instead of taking the advice in a negative manner, the writer decides to turn the warning around for his own good.  His decision makes a life changing turn for the better. <br />Terzani rediscovers the pleasures of traveling the &quot;old fashioned&quot; way - by trains, foot, bus, cars, across mountains and oversea.  The reporter meets interesting people he would never otherwise have met at an airport or on an airplane.<br />During his travels through Asia that year, the writer makes a few observations along the way - The effects of modernity are changing the culture and mindset of the countries he visited.  This is something about which the writer laments frequently.<br />Terzani's travelogue and partial memoir gives the reader a different and interesting view of South East Asia that many don't consider.  Instead of the glossy tourist package, the reader gets a view that one rarely knows or thinks about.<br />Terzani also takes the reader into the world of the fortune-tellers.  All very interesting characters - some are on the mark, a number are half wrong, others totally erroneous.  A few are very serious sounding, others comical... (Like one teller who insisted that Terzani had a mark on his foot, when there wasn't one, and started looking for it.)  They all gave interesting advice.<br />Do I want my fortune read for me?  I'm not certain?  But one thing's for sure, I enjoyed reading &quot;A Fortune Teller Told Me&quot; and living vicariously through Terzani's experience.  The book may inspire you to find other modes of travel apart from air flight.<br />Fafa Demasio	2002-02-18

Alice Jones and Leonard Kip Rhinelander meet and fall in love.  Alice comes from a modest family originally from England and Leonard comes from a wealthy New York family.  After a quiet three-year courtship, Alice, age 23 and Leonard, age 22 finally marry.     <br />It looks like this youthful couple has a promising life together ahead of them.  That should be the end of their seemingly innocent love story.  The couple lives happily ever after.  Right?  Wrong.<br />A few days after the wedding, it is discovered that Alice is from a mixed race background.  Her mother is white and father of West Indian descent.  <br />Upon the revelation of this news, Leonard quickly files for an annulment.  He claims that he was unaware of his wife's racial background (a daughter of a black man) and that she tricked him into marrying her.   Conversely, Alice maintains that her husband knew everything about her and she did not defraud her.<br />The year is 1924.  What happens next is a fascinating and sensational trial.  Known as the &quot;Rhinelander case,&quot; it brings up several attention-grabbing issues that include how race is viewed in the U.S., especially at that time period - the 1920s.  <br />I would have liked to read a little more about the Alice and Leonard.  However, I understand that the book is not a biography on the couple but instead focuses on the trial.  In the authors' notes, the reader is told that the families did not grant interviews and expressed no interest in the book. I also found the numerous footnotes within the book a little distracting.  It sometimes felt as if I was reading a dissertation instead of a book.<br />Despite these minor complaints, the subject of &quot;Love on Trial&quot; is of interest.  Authors, Lewis and Aridzzone have done an excellent job retracing the events of the case and reconstructing what occurred in the courtroom - this includes the interaction between the two strong-headed opposing lawyers, the examination of Leonard and a point where Alice has to partially disrobe for the jury.  Photos are interspersed among the chapters, showing the litigants, crowded courtroom, judge and lawyers to envision the story better.<br />&quot;Love on Trial&quot; is well researched and detailed with the happenings in the case - from the trial, appellate and New York Supreme Court findings.  It also includes the newspaper coverage and public reactions during and after the court case.<br />If you enjoy reading about trials, watching T.V. programs on court cases or lawyers shows, this is the book for you.<br />Fafa Demasio	2001-12-19

Author Edward Ball has done it again by successfully writing the history of another American family originating from the south - the Harleston family. <br />&quot;The Sweet Hell Inside&quot; starts with story of the relationship between white slave owner, William Harleston and his black slave Kate Wilson. They had eight children. <br />The narrative spans from the mid-1800s to the year 2000 and describes the lives of the family members during different times in America's history. This includes the time, which the author accurately describes as &quot;America's cruelest years&quot; -- a time when black and interracial Americans struggled to survive when laws were established to deny them basic human rights.<br />The Harleston family was able to survive those hard times to become what Ball describes as &quot;American cultural pioneers&quot; because of their professions and achievements - some in the area of art, photography and music.<br />Ball uses Harleston family papers, interviews and other documentation, much of which was given to him by Edwina Harleston Whitlock, a relative, direct descendant of the Harleston family and archivist of the family papers. <br />Like Ball's first book, a genealogy chart is provided to help follow the family characters. In addition, an abundance of photos, which alone tell an enticing story, is provided. <br />&quot;The Sweet Hell Inside&quot; is appealing not only because of the special family characters but because of the historical context (such as the revolutionary war, civil war, the Reconstruction, the rise of Jim Crow and more) in which their biographies fall. The author provides interesting tidbits about the times and other historical figures, adding to the interest subject of the book.<br />Fafa Demasio	2001-11-27

Here, Veciana-Suarez writes of her experience when her first husband unexpectedly passed away at the age of 37, leaving her and their five children.  Anyone, especially someone who has lost a loved one, can appreciate this chapter.  The author, truly, writes from the heart and experience.  <br />I was happy to read that the author was able to find love again.<br />Other chapters deal with baseball, parenthood, sisters, a mother-in-law, a household of different religious backgrounds (Catholic and Jewish), and much more.<br />Once you start reading the first chapter, you will look forward to reading the following chapters to see what Veciana-Suarez has to write about on other varying topics.
