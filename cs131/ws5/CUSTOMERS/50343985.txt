Ann is certainly a capable writer and the book flows along on an even if somewhat predictable and superficial keel, like a seamless dinner conversation with someone intent on subtly pushing their vacuous politically correct message points:  we were authentic - we developed real friendships with the locals!  we do care about the environment - we felt bad about tossing that old fishing net garbage back into the sea!  it did seem like a shame to develop the old man's veggie patch into a resort!  we did meet all the icons of the carribean:  herb the weatherman & the minister of rum.  we gave alms to the poor islanders!  we went back to visit!  we were sad when it was over, really!  So if you're a serious armchair sailor, this book may not be so compelling, the author's progress over two years from ICW to `not being scared of an overnight passage' is child's play.  For very light vacation reading of the carribean, or if you're a domestic, tag-along spouse, perhaps sitting on a cruiseboat wondering what life on a sailboat is like, `EoM' may be just the ticket.  It is certainly pleasant, light reading -- and the recipes at the end of each chapter do look fantastic.book may not be so compelling, the author's progress over two years from ICW to `not being scared of an overnight passage' is child's play.

Neely was a \\"greatest generation\\" WWII US Marine in the Pacific, and this self-written, self-published account of his voyage about the pacific around 1970 with family is straight-shooting, frank, nearly stream-of-conscious and poorly edited.  Like tania aebi's `maiden voyage' and john caldwell's `desperate voyage', ETTBR fits squarely in what i call the `lucky nincompoops of the sea' genre, sailors whose great achievements are especially remarkable for setting sail almost completely unknowledgeable of sailing and basically totally incompetent.  ETTBR, as another reviewer politely wrote of `desperate voyage', \\"lacks any literary pretensions,\\" which is to say, your highschool composition teacher might have marked this book with enough red ink to fill a sea. nonetheless neeley is a guy who bulldozes inelegantly forward and gets things done, and this book, reflecting his voyage, is truer to form for it.  like wabi-sabi, masters may appreciate this book even more for the home-made imperfections that render it perfect.  and neeley definitely has a knack for capturing the pain and emotional turbulence of sailing!<br /><br />like the other great nincompoops, it is fun and (especially if you have any knowledge of sailing) harrowing to watch the neeley's grow and learn, and anyone with even an iota of sailing knowledge can read this book with a sort of smugness that if they could stumble through it, so could i!  but don't miss their genius: a bullheaded strong determination and confidence.  still, in my opinion, most armchair sailor novices should probably start with books a little more polished and accessible, classics like tania aebi's \\"maiden voyage\\" and robin graham's classic \\"dove\\". my hat's off to mr. neeley and his charming and ultimately extremely competent entire family for safely completing a great voyage and knocking out a book for the rest of us that fits it just right.ting a great voyage and knocking out a book for the rest of us that fits it just right.	2005-02-27

Davidson is a great writer in the tradition of witty, frugal, understated WWII-era brits.  her single handed adventure, following the death of her husband, falls squarely into the pantheon of sailors whose lack of experience or technical ability is inspirationally surpassed in guts, perserverance, faith, determination, and common sense.  this is certainly a book that deserves a lot more attention, and is a pleasure to read.  Her earlier book 'Last Voyage' is even harder to find, but well worth it, and makes a very excellent companion to this book, though about half of it concerns WWII life in england -- though for sailors the fraction dealing with sailling still makes the book worth reading.

In the small but rich genre of dinghy cruising (which in the spirit modernity, i hereby rename &quot;microcruising&quot;), this is a must read. adding to the charm is frank's occasional mention of his girlfriend Margaret, who he later married, and who many years later wrote the bible of microcruising, the hugely instructional 'Dinghy Cruising'.

In his travels the monk sees that in Chinese monasteries the monks take kitchen duty much more seriously than in Japan, and he sets forth to describe to his Japanese brethren the superior zen-like manner of the Chinese.<br />If you are on the path to learn or be zen in some sort of mindful and awake way, this book should most likely be pretty far downslope on your list of must-reads.  The translation of the letter seems superior, even the footnotes are instructively excellent, but at the end of the day you can get most of this book by reading this sentence carefully:  \\"Kitchen duty for the Chinese, the Japanese and for you, and even the most boring vegetables and tasks associated with it, is not to be despised or delegated, rather one must approach it with the same hands-on equanimity of spirit, mindful attitude, exactness, and joie de vivre as every other moment in the well-lived life.  And it is not an excuse to stop meditating!'<br />Uchiyama's commentary, the majority of the book, is, ummm, more challenging, and my opinion disagrees with most of the other reviewers, who I hope will atleast consider not voting me off the page!  While the commentary occasionally sparkles with insight, it emits atleast as much curmudgeonly whining about modern life in the 1950's:  Bureaucrats, Over-Anxious Mothers, Lazy College Teachers, Profit-Oriented Architects, the lazy priesthood, and even nutritionists all fall pray to uchiyama's withering and basically insubstantial rants.  The best parts of his commentary are just the direct quotes from the original letter. The ravings of an old crank liberal monk in 1956 Japan has its place, but its relevance to learning zen seems marginal to me, unless one were a particularly advanced practitioner of many years with some narrow historical interest.<br />Bottom line:  Read suzuki's `zen mind beginners mind' atleast 3 times, Kapleau's '3 pillars', and everything by Sekida, and even some of the Tibetan stuff, before you get to working on this one...<br />use the force wisely!rs with some narrow historical interest.<br />Bottom line:  Read suzuki's `zen mind beginners mind' atleast 3 times, Kapleau's '3 pillars', and everything by Sekida, and even some of the Tibetan stuff, before you get to working on this one...<br />use the force wisely!	2002-03-04

The Power of Slogans!  From `Have a Coke and a Smile' to \\"Be all that you can Be\\", the brain loves a good saying.  This book is Trungpa's translation of the 59 slogans used to instruct Tibetan Buddhists, with his commentary on each.  Trungpa is unassailable as an instructor: the 11th generation of a line of chosen Tibetan Trungpas, he went to oxford on a scholarship and then moved to the US in the 1970's where he founded what remain as among the foremost Buddhist/meditative institutions in the country.  I tend to believe Buddhism gained a little more than it lost en route to japan, so I prefer the zen stuff, but this book has a lot to offer anyone.  Some nitpicking:  For a guy who dedicated his life to bringing jargonless Buddhism to the west, the book is a little full of `mystical-sounding foreign words' though thankfully the glossary is very fine.  And plenty of important Buddha concepts don't shine through (cause and effect, and the big mirror concepts don't get too much play here) so just make sure this isn't the only book you read on the topic.  And some of the slogans are simply not too memorable and consequently lose their force; `always be grateful' is dandy, though `the mahayana instruction for ejection of consciousness at death is the five strengths' seems like an important one that alas probably won't be dancing off too many tongues at the critical moment.  Still this is a fine book, a great book for beginners or advanced alike, coming from any tradition whatsoever.  & the small format fits well, making it a great book for commutes or travels.  Enjoy!

Diamond sets out to understand why it was Europeans who became the dominant force in human history, and makes a thrilling case for a sort of geographical/biological determinism based on the superior mutability of grains and livestock available to them.  My 16 years of social studies and geography classes was suddenly converted into pale, false, useless colors; it all could have been captured better by just reading this book.  'GGS' is definitely repititive, overly long, and will certainly cause endless arguments among the philosopher kings about this and that, how it is racist, nationalist, blah blah.  At the end of the day debates about this book are the modern equivalent of earlier popular debates: does geology exist? does evolution exist? is women's suffrage the right thing to do?  hmmmm... not so hard to answer those in retrospect, nor mr diamonds excellent points in GGS.	2002-03-03

The various characters are well developed and all bring very different perspectives to life in the family and the politics of Africa; Kingsolver weaves them together well and is admirably non-judgmental in letting the story tell itself.  In my straw polls of friends &amp; family I've noticed a polarity between those who love her earlier book `animal dreams', vs those who love `the bean trees' (..and nobody likes `pigs in heaven'...); 'Poisonwood' is a more ambitious and complex story then the earlier works, however it is also not quite so compellingly and beautifully composed. And I note the same people tend to polarize again in preferring either the first half or the second half of `Poisonwood'.  Bottom line:  worth the read, but unless you're pulled by the african setting you might start liking kingsolver better with 'animal dreams' or 'bean trees'.	2002-03-02

The bicycle trip is spiced with enough memories of the fall of Saigon, escaping Vietnam, and dysfunctional immigrant family life starting over in America to keep us non-bikers entertained.  his descriptions of bicycling, being an asian American, and a `foreign-vietnamese' are thoughtful and well-done.  It's not the great american novel, but it's a well told story worth a read.	2002-02-21

Bell lived a compelling life: an uppercrust Victorian debutante too prickly to land a boy, one of the earliest woman graduates of oxford, and a self-starting desert archaeologist, linguist, diplomat, and political officer. If you enjoy other desert stories, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, The English Patient, etc., this will likely hit home, though I unfortunately must agree with other reviewers: it's tedious in the details, and Ms. Wallach is a bit hagiographic: rather than simply letting the story tell itself she seems defensive or eager to 'sell' the reader on how cool old Gertie really was. If you have a thirst for the desert or the mideast you're better off reading the classic \\"From Beirut To Jerusalem\\" or the other two mentioned above before you get around to this one. But if you've got an itch you just can't scratch for 'Victorian Women who Broke Cultural Molds to Influence the Formation of Iraq', get ready for a real belly-scratcher.	2002-01-22

May the lord have mercy on Weyerhaeuser for their misguided economic support of this book, which should stand forever as an object lesson in what happens when corporations start actually acting on their own airy-fairy mission statements.  This book ought more accurately be titled `a brief AND UNBEARABLE history of fire' --  Pyne apparently fashions himself to be the dylan thomas of fire history, inundating us page after page with rompous and ridiculous artistic alliterations, with ceaseless inversions poetic, and anthropomorphisms that would be hilarious if not so awful. Can we possibly believe that fire is `unique to earth' (p. xv), where the `biotic broth broiled over' (p.3) and `humanity's restless hand and roving mind' (p. 7) is `the keeper of the vital flame'? Can we speak sensibly of fire when it appears like a ludicrous singles advert, `fickle if powerful', ignited by lightening... excuse me, I meant to say ignited by a force `relentlessly restoring electrical equilibrium'? Pyne, are you losing your mind? Fire deserves much better treatment than this goofiness.  Use this book for kindling!!!	2001-12-26

Finishing this book is like having a nice discussion with a friend who, at the end of the hour, tells you he's dosed your tea with LSD.  Is he serious?  Why would he possibly do such a thing?  This writing is nicely crafted and subtle, the narrative shifts easily between London and flashbacks to postwar Nagasaki, and beautifully skates along the rim of cultural chasm.  But the `surprise twist ending' is silly, amateurish; like mixing coca cola and Bordeaux, the climactic melange of genre falls on its face.  For a beautiful cross cultural novel that carries itself through from beginning to end, skip \\"pale view' and go straight to `the samarai's garden'.	2001-01-12

US	50343985	R14Y3RVYL5L8BR	0345422317	866931563	The Genesis Code	Books	2	2	3	N	N	run away!	What a spectacularly mediocre book.  For a plot that dabbles across fields as interesting as international private corporate investigation, papal politics, and genetic manipulation, popping to fro between italy, DC and Switzerland, it nonetheless falls on its face.  The Boys from Brazil plot is transparent from the beginning yet tortuously dragged out as our moronic protoganist (and possibly the author as well?) is dumbfounded by any scientific term more complicated than DNA.  The descriptions and revelations of spycraft, travel, and gene play are generally superficial; only if you were living under a rock for 30 years would they have the cutting-edge, revealing quality that the plot requires.  Like many other reviewers, i kept flipping the pages all the way to the end:  case does have the sentence-to-sentece storytelling that kept me hoping against hope that this book might redeem itself... but it doesn't.  skip it.	2000-12-26
US	50343985	R6P6JEZLUH0YI	0965802892	712891562	Surviving the Storm: Coastal and Offshore Tactics	Books	5	26	26	N	N	Great to learn from others	An encyclopaedic covering of various tactics for surviving storms at sea, the dashews succinct writing and cogent organisation drives this hefty book forward.  while powerboats are nominally covered, this book is more squarely aimed at the community of ocean going sailboats.  Anyone sailing into deep blue water should read this book.  A few notes: 1. the conclusions are mature:  there is no single right answer, but the best strategy is to experiment with all the tactics in moderately heavy seas before you eventually get caught out in the big one. 2. active strategies (beating in and running off) shine a little brighter under the dashews' light than heaving to or sea anchors/drogues; fair enough.  3. consequently there is a nice treatment of heavy weather sails 4. the book is full of instructive black &amp; white photos that make one sufficiently happy to be drinking tea at home. 5. numerous interviews with salty sailors make for instructive case studies, though several times key details (size of boat, location, crew experience, etc.) are left out. 6. the only weakness is that its numerous interviews and articles largely focus on experienced sailors who have been doing everything right for so long that it's difficult to get them to remember the episodes that taught them.  The book is quite thin on disaster stories -which are frequently the most instructive -- and instead spends a lot of time interviewing 100,000 milers who can't remember the last time they were scared.  Thus `surviving the storm' tells you merely how to do everything right, not how to avoid doing the wrong things... for those many of us who find the fear of failing (or drowning) particularly motivating from an instructional standpoint, this is a lacuna in an otherwise fine book.  Two other sailing books, \\"MayDay!\\" and Coote's \\"Total Loss\\" admirably fill this gap, but if the dashew's had hit this final nail on the head I'd petition amazon for a 6-star review. At the end of the day, it's a must-read.

Murry Taylor, a veteran  Alaska jumper, has \\"lived the dream\\" as the jumpers say, lived more of it  than anyone else, and now is the first to capture it in perfect, clear,  honest writing.  Smokejumping comes alive in this book; and even 500 pages  wasn't enough - this book is hard to put down, and harder still to see end.  A seminal book on the smokejumping experience has been missing for a long  time, but Murry Taylor &amp; Kati Steele have done it.

'Tabloid' would be too condemning, yet in this popular account of the 1996 wildfirefighter fatalities the underlying provocative and accusational tone is certainly annoying; the careless writing unfortunate. Following in the footsteps of his father's rambling bestseller 'young men and fire', i fear that perhaps the literature of this heroic profession and its instructive tragedies is predestined to be simultaneously popularized and mistreated by generations of macleans? But as his father's featured pinpoint detail, john's book has its strengths: he very squarely captures the spirit of modern wildfirefighting: a battle often not against nature as much as organizing to defeat the complexity of large bureaucracies and the chaos they spawn. This account traces the tragic consequences when people communicate poorly, engage in petty organizational squabbles, flaunt fundamental rules, and fail to act on their instincts. 'fire on the mountain' embodies the spirit of sloppiness that created such a tragedy; too bad it doesn't get us to higher ground.<br />If you're interested in the wildfirefighters' life, or smokejumping, skip the goofy maclean attempts and go straight to Murray Taylor's excellent \\"Jumping Fire\\".	2000-02-07
