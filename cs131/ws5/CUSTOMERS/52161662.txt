At times while reading this book I had to stop and figure out where  we were in the past or present.

I live in the Inland Empire where most of this story  took place, and it was so funny to sit there reading the book and at the  same time saying to myself, I know where this place or that place is.  Keep  up the great work EJD.  When is the next one coming out??  Peace!!	1999-07-07

When I purchased A Do Right Man little did I know I was wasting my time and money.  The characters were unimaginative  and boring.  I don't know any men like Bobby Dallas. What a wimp! I hope  that Mr. Tyree's next book Single Mom is better, however I have learned my  lesson with this book and I'll wait for the paperback to come out.	1998-11-28
