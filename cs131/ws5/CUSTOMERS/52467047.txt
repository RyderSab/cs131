It is more like a memoir of the author's year and how she had planned to read certain books and, like most of us, ended up reading things she hadn't planned on. <br /> <br />The Author can be a bit snobbish, looking down on anyone who has different taste in books than she does.  (For instance, anyone who enjoyed \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" falls into this looked down upon category) and there were a few times I seriously questioned her taste (she didn't like \\"The Hours\\"!).  However, I didn't hold it against her and I am thankful that I found a few books that I probably wouldn't have come across or bothered to read on my own - like \\"Slammerkin\\" (it is now on my must read list after reading many great reviews on amazon and reading the first page in a local bookstore.)   <br /> <br />Also there are several books that I had put at the bottom of my neverending list but are now moving back up to the Must Read Pile.. \\"Crimson Petal...\\", \\"The Spirit Catces You and You Fall Down\\" and \\"Bird by Bird\\" (I love A. LaMott!) <br /> <br />If you are looking for more of a reference book, I recommend \\"Book Lust\\" -- \\"So Many Books...So Little Time\\" is a fun, easy read which will hopefully lead you to a few good ones.. <br />	2005-02-22

Unfortunately for me, I got very bored with it and had to force myself to finish.  It is a bit too cutesy for me at this point but I probably would have enjoyed it immensely when I was in middle school and would recommend it to girls of that age (11-14).	2004-01-09

The story was obviously made up to try to sell books and make a buck and hopefully get the author a cheesy tv-movie deal.  The only personal facts about Mairead Farrell are facts you can find in any article about her in a paper or on the internet - there is nothing personal that a person who actually knew her would be able to tell. The author probably likes the sound of his own voice a bit too much as he brags incessantly.  If he reads this, please heed my advice and stop writing immediately! Drop your pen or turn off your computer and find a new job because you have no writing talent.  Please don't kill any more trees for this drivel.	2003-11-25

His owner is an old man living in Italy.  He is very lonely and searching for companionship. When a young man comes to stay with him he does not want to lose him despite the fact that Timolean Vieta hates the man and the man hates Timoleon Vieta.  Without giving away too much, the dog ends up on a long journey and while on this trip he encounters many different people and the author intertwines their stories into this novel about the old man and the dog.  Quite interesting, sad and occasionally uplifting.  I do recommend it.	2003-10-29

DUH ... the main character is doing exactly that! He is speaking from the couch in his doctor's (shrink's) office.  Even if some do not like the content there is no mistaking that Roth is a writer of great caliber and as far as I'm concerned this book is funny, interesting and extremely well written.  I highly recommend.	2003-05-30

On a warm sunny afternoon, just pack up a French picnic of fruit, French bread, croissants, cheese and wine -- sit down with this book and it's just as good as being there (well, almost).<br />A British couple (author and his wife) decided to move to Provence permanently, so they bought a house.  He takes us through their first year in monthly installments.  You'll meet some of his new neighbors, listen to mouth-watering descriptions of meals he has enjoyed and hear about the trials and tribulations of home improvements and weather in the south of France.<br />Quite enjoyable :o)	2001-04-30

This book is a series of essays about Dave's different jobs, his childhood, his family and -- the absolute best -- his stories about moving to France and trying to learn French.  Maybe because I also took French and visited France with a very small grasp of the language did I find those chapters in particular quite hysterical. Also I live in NY and his stories about NY and the tourists (especially around Christmas) are quite true and very funny to me personally. This is my first Sedaris book and I fear I may run out and buy all of his books and try to read them all too quickly -- better to space them out over a few months and make them last.  There are some short chapters so if you're not sure if you want to buy this read a few chapters in the bookstore and then come back and buy it on amazon for cheaper if you liked it.  I read the first couple pages and decided I would like this book and I was correct.    I had to leave the library today because I was the only one laughing and I looked just a teeny bit insane.  Better to read in the privacy of your own home!	2001-04-17
US	52467047	R357K3BLL7QSP8	0679746048	92211220	Girl, Interrupted	Books	4	0	1	N	Y	pretty cool	Susanna Kaysen at age 18 was sent to a mental hospital to 'rest' and stayed there for almost 2 years.  In short chapters she describes other patients, doctors and strange oddities of living in a mental institution (Like ice cream trips).  One of the more interesting facts of this particular institution are the famous patients who stayed there before her. This is a very quick read.. couple of hours is all you need.  The movie is also very good and very much like the book.	2001-03-15

I must say that the cover and subject of the book did not attact me, but the good reviews I kept reading and hearing convinced me to read it.  I was surprised at how quickly I became immersed in this story.  <br />It is a bible story told from the perspective of the woman, Dinah.  The characters come alive as she describes her life growing up in the house of Jacob with Rachel, Leah and all her other 'mothers' and brothers. <br />It is a wonderful piece of historical fiction.  Highly enjoyable and easy reading -- not as heavy as it may sound!	2001-03-08

I thought it would drag on and on and take me forever to finish.  My reality was exactly the opposite :)   I read this book in about 3.5 days - on the way to work, at lunchtime, on the way home, instead of watching tv, etc. etc.   <br />I don't think it was a difficult read intellectually but emotionally - the fact that it was very sad and may have you remembering how your family used to be when you were young and how things have changed.  Plus the author is so descriptive in portraying each comlex personality in the family that you really feel like this family exists somewhere.<br />I plan on reading more of her books in the future.

The local priest is quite nuts and sees her as a disruption to his devout congregation.  There are lovely descriptions of chocolates and some surprising turns in this story.  A pleasant read, nothing too complicated. Don't read if you love chocolate and are on a diet.	2001-02-26

I usually hate cheesy romance novels but I had this in the house and decided to read it in honor of St. Valentine's Day.  I ended up finishing it 3 days earlier than I had planned (planned on finishing it on V-day).  Ok, so it's a romance novel but at least it has a twist which is what I like about this author (I also read &quot;The Notebook&quot;). It doesn't have the same old storybook ending as every other sappy romance novel does.  So, from someone who pretty much hates cheesy novels like D. Steel etc. I thought this was OK if you are in the mood for a very easy read with romance.  It's a very quick and easy to get through.<br />I am going to write about the beginning of the book now so if you want to go in totally fresh, don't read the rest but I don't give the ending away  - just the first couple of chapters of how the book starts....<br />This book is about Theresa, who while on vacation finds a bottle on the beach with a rather sad letter inside.  She is a newspaper columnist and after much debate decides to print the letter in her column since she found it so touching.  Someone reads her column and calls her b/c they found a similar letter years before.  Later, a third letter turns up.  Theresa and her friend put all the info they get from the letters together to try to find the person who wrote them.  They find out where he lives and Theresa decides to go look for him.... the rest you will have to read for yourself so I don't give anything away...	2001-02-12

This is more a pleasure read than a book to use as a travel reference as he covers so much ground that he has to fly by places and misses quite a bit. <br />He is, as usual, quite funny and very fussy!!  He likes to complain so don't take it personally if he happens to rag on your little town.   I have been to a few of the places he ragged on and actually found them quite pleasant.  Mostly I think he is just looking for humor in places and also for perfection.<br />It is a good book for outsiders considering a trip to the US who can't decide which section of the country to visit.  He covers the East coast, the south, the midwest, the wild west and some of the north.  He drives through, I believe, about 38 states.  He does not visit Texas, Alaska or Hawaii and I think he also skips Florida but I don't really remember. He does hit most major cities and several National Parks.  If you do decide to come, do more research than Bill b/c since he covered so much ground in such a short time he had to miss quite a bit... like if he only saw Times Square and 5th Avenue in NY he missed A LOT(and no wonder he was frightened! heehee).<br />This book was quite useful b/c there are now many new places on my long list of places I want to go!  You will get some good ideas for long weekend road trips if you live in the US or Canada.<br />I only gave this book 3 stars because I gave his other book &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;  5 stars and to be fair to that book which I think is even better than this one I could only give this one 3.  But I highly recommend it especially if you are already a Bryson fan.  Bravo Bryson!!	2001-02-08

I actually wasn't sure exactly what had happened on Everest in 1996 other than it was not good.  It is really quite a sad story since most of the people who perished seemed to be such nice people and some died simply because they didn't want to leave others behind. I am looking forward to reading Boukreev's account and others.  I personally didn't think he came across too badly in this book, especially when he risked his life to try to rescue others.  He actually seemed to use more sense than most of the others that day which is why he was strong enough to go searching for people.  I feel so bad for the families of those who died.  Mr. Krakauer brings them to life and makes them seem very down to earth and just regular people who loved to climb mountains.  I really don't have any interest in mountain climbing but this is more a human interest story.  Along with the heroic acts of some of the climbers and the IMAX crew, there were also some things that seem unbelievable.. like climbers passing by other dying climbers in need of help and not stopping to talk to them, give them water, or help them in any way just because they didn't want to hurt their own chances of reaching the summit.  Also, Poor Beck, that's all I have to say!  This guy is amazing!  I haven't yet seen the IMAX movie but luckily for me it is still playing here in NY and I plan to see it this weekend.  The selflessness of the IMAX team and just the fact that they were actually on the mountain when this happened has peaked my interest in seeing the movie a great deal.  This is a fantastic read because it really happened.   We really can't judge these people because we weren't there, I just wish it had a happier ending.	2001-01-22

I finished it in the airport before ever getting on the plane.  I just couldn't stop reading. It was great.  There is a LOT of sex in this book but it is NOT a romance novel.  Some may even be a bit shocked so I would say read the first paragraph in the bookstore because the sex starts basically from the first pages, this way if its not your cup of tea you can put it back on the shelf.

I am not interested in hiking in the least, but I read this book in about 2 days -- I couldn't put it down!  Bill Bryson is a wonderful writer.  He really gets  the humor of ordinary day to day events and is able to communicate it  brillantly through his writing. The book is very funny but he also focuses  on his love of nature and the dangers of not taking care of the planet and  what we will lose because of it. He is only the second author who inspired  me to go out and buy all of their other books before even finishing the  first (the other was Helene Hanff). I can't wait to read all of them -  especially his books on England and Europe since I am planning a trip there  soon.  One last thing.. I lent this book to my mother and it caused several  scenes of her almost choking from laughter. GET IT!	2000-04-26

This is the story of Frank McCourt as a grown man in a new country - America - trying to deal w/ work, school and love life so obviously it is not going to be the same or  as heart renching as Angela's Ashes which is about Frank as a child growing  up in Ireland.

It is a very sad story - but this may be lost on you b/c the  writing can be very confusing if you are not totally focused on the book  (like if you're reading on a train or bus, etc) so you may have to re-read  a page or two if you find yourself thinking 'what is she talking about?'.   Also, the way the older characters spoke seemed to be more Irish than  Irish-American and this was annoying for me because I had to keep trying to  imagine them without accents and I just couldn't. I don't think it deserved  an award, but despite all this I liked it anyway.	1999-04-23

It is one of my all-time favorites.  Dolores was not a very nice person at times and not very likable but still I felt sorry for her because in the  beginning of the book we saw her as a child and I liked her then and knew  what events caused her to act the way she did as a teen and a young adult.   This book is not about a fairy tale where people just get over things  instantly. Dolores is far from perfect and struggles to overcome some  horrific events that took place in her childhood but that is what makes her  real.	1999-02-23

The topic of a family with a handicapped child sounded  interesting to me and I have enjoyed many other &quot;Oprah&quot; books.  I am almost finished and I can't wait to be done  with it because the story is just dragging on and on.  Maybe this is  because I do not like the main character, Jewel, at all and, therefore,  feel no sympathy or compassion for her or her family.  I am sick of her  repeated use of the &quot;N&quot; word even if it is authentic to the time  period.  The southern speech is becoming very irritating and so is their  continuing astonishment with California.  The story is going no where at  this point and there are not many pages left for something even remotely  exciting to happen.  I don't like this book!!!!
