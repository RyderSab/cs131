It throws together the Dominican and new American experience from the POV of youth . This book is not just Dominican book, but a book of youth. It is hard to look back in that place called youth and Diaz does so with what appears to the reader, with ease.<br />The stories range from Jersey project living to San Juan slum living. And the life from each facet explodes in a vibrance of pure phosphorescence. At times the stories are heartbreaking with their relentless truth, like in &quot;Negocios&quot;. At other times stories are funny, like the government cheese bit in &quot;How To Date A Browngirl...&quot;. But underlying everything is the sadness of the reality of poverty. <br />We are dealing with real people in these stories. They are so real they come off the page and talk to you. Diaz has created characters so real that we actually empathize and eventually care for them. Therein lies Diaz's strongest gift in the field of writing. <br />All of the stories are top notch, but the one that stands out the most is &quot;Negocios&quot;. <br />If the narrative voice of Raymond Carver were the guy sitting on the bar stool next to you, the voice of Junot Diaz is that of illegitamite latino brother you are meeting for the first time, you and your brother both having had a life of poverty. Both authors write smooth as an oral storyteller. Each in a friendly, enticing, inviting voice. <br />Check this book out.	2002-08-02
US	50784422	R1FH0SFFMKQNTT	0802117171	65240666	Twelve	Books	2	1	1	N	N	An easy formula	This book has as much to do with \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" as it does with a cook book(except for the stolen idea of dead mother). So chill with the comparisons. This McConnel in no way has McInerney's talent for the Manhattan description.<br />What I will compare this work to is Bret Ellis. It is as if the kid beefed up Ellis' prose slightly, stole the whole format of Mr. Ellis' first novel (the rich, drug/sex addled kids with even more debaucherous parents, the dead family member, the past tense written in italics etc.) and mixed in a little of that violence and hyperrealism-running-concurrently-with-ennui of Ellis' \\"Glamorama\\".<br />I mean McConnel can describe pop culture white boys and girls, but with the monotany and accesability of popular culture MTV, it's not so hard. <br />So you take \\"SPY NOTES ON.....and all those other hip urban 80's novels\\" and you use its Novel-o-Matic to form your story, emphasizing the very early work of Ellis and the very latest. You change the pop culture references of the 80's with those of the new millenium and you have this novel.<br />Other than the plot and format being borderline cribbed, this book was pretty cool. It's my kind of book.	2002-07-26

Woody Allen did &quot;Celebrity&quot;. Jay McInerney did &quot;Model Behavior&quot;. Bret Easton Ellis did &quot;Glamorama&quot;. Now Chuck Palahniuk explores the new age worship of beauty and glamour in &quot;Invisible Monsters&quot;.<br />The recent popularity of the view of celebrity worship has been done many times in the past few years, but this is by far the most twisted, dark, and almost violent (Glamorama) exploration of this theme. <br />The narrator is an ex-fashion model who is disfigured and incapable of speech after a freeway &quot;accident.&quot; She goes from being a fashion model to a case photo in a medical book. <br />The narrative is explained in the first few pages after the patented Palahniuk begginning at the end story structure. The narrative is self explanatory though. Jump forward. Jump back. Flash. In his other novels he follows the timeline of End, Beginning, back to the end of the end. In this novel the story is a collage of twisted life experiences that &quot;jump&quot; out sporadically everywhere and going in every direction but ultimately working to build an impression of who the narrator is. It tells us what is going on in our times. It touches on our obsession with beauty from an angle never taken before. There is the better or worse self mechanism embodied by the character Brandy Alexander, the better or worse self that philosophizes about life and how to lead it.<br />The rants are very reminiscent of &quot;Fight Club&quot;. The small pieces of strange information that is reminiscent of all Palahniuk's work is also present.<br />What this story has is satire and funny situations that are hilarious to a point that none of his other novels reach. The humor is so John Waters &quot;Pink Flamingo&quot;. It is disgusting and disturbing to the faint of heart, and darkly hilarious to the post post modern art enthusiast.<br />The exploration of the human spirit in reference to love is all here. We all say I love you but do we really mean it? This book takes the stance that those three words are truly one of the three greatest lies. <br />The device of the narrator not being able to speak pounds that theme perfectly. Without those words what is love? And the narrator, not having those words finds out what love is in actions and feelings. <br />The narrator finds out what love is through the examination of her life and road trip of a lifetime. In a world devout of love and a person who society can't love, we find an ultimate product that at first seems idealistic but when the reader &quot;Jumps back&quot; and takes note that the narrator is not a fly on the wall, her conditions, her perdicament,   that the idealism becomes as socially deviant as the main characters of this novel. <br />This is a take on modern beauty worship, the true meaning of love, identity, and the most morbid road trip novel ever written.	2001-03-21

This is a brilliant work that many categorize in the &quot;male coming of age&quot; genre. It is correctly placed there and is on par with, if not better than, &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; This novel  shows the zest of a young writer already in greatness on his way to perfection. The radical structure of this novel shows the creativity and non-conformity that Fitzgerald set as the mode for the modern day contemporary novel. His incorporation of poetry, music, and, and then sudden shift to play-writing, in his prose, to get his point across are brilliant in his execution of &quot;showing rather than telling.&quot;<br />Amory (wordplay on amorous) is looking for truth and sense in his life. He seeks it in intellectual pursuits, riotous living, and love. Love is what makes him most vulnerable. <br />His general liking for the arts rather than the sciences mirror the ambitions of so many young males, males who would be reading this novel.   He can't dwell in what is known or scientifically documented, his heart lies in the arts and history: the former a place an outlet to seek truth and the latter a point of reference by which he categorizes himself. He believes love to be something tangible like the music he hears, the poetry he reads and writes, but love is chaos. He makes lists to categorize and make sense of elements of the social world around him, but life (especially in the shift from adolesence to young-adulthood) and people are so incongruent that none of it is able to be categorized. The use of the shift to play-writing is not used gratuitously. Amory believes that life and love fall into place once one is done with school and sets out for the world. He is acting/living out a love story in the real world, but nothing in life is structured like the story line to a dramatic romance. <br />Fitzgerald's narrative is a lyrical, yet chaotic whirlwind, it perfectly coincides with the life of a person coming into adulthood during a time of drastic social change andthe disillusionment from the atrocities of The Great War.<br />The last quarter of the novel shows the roots of what would grow to Fitzgerald's literary perfection. Reading the ending to this book keeps the reader in a state of awe. <br />There is a beautiful array of one-liners gracing the pages during Amory's conversation with the Goggled Man and his partner. Everyone I discuss this novel with has a favorite line or two from this section. The words that have been turning over in my mind ever since the first time I read this novel are:<br />&quot;'I'm restless. My whole generation is restless. I'm sick of a system where the richest man gets the most beautiful girl if he wants her, where the artist without an income has to sell his talents to a button manufacturer.'&quot;<br />The last line of the book is a lesson in itself. Fitzgerald entertains the reader from the soft and subtle beginning, to the chaotic yet, settling end: <br />&quot;I know myself,&quot; he cried, &quot;but that is all.&quot; <br />After all the people he had come in contact with during his journey for truth and love, and all the low and high points that Amory has had, he feels his efforts were worthwhile, but doesn't know why. <br />Mapping life is a futile effort. Mapping and knowing yourself is an amazing feat in and of itself that few achieve. And knowing yourself is &quot;all,&quot; everything that you would ever need to know in life... <br />This novel is a must read for all young men. ENTER THE LABYRINTH.	2000-12-19
US	50784422	R36D8UDMIUSNX6	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Literary Greatness	This novel is more than just a novel--it is the English language used in the greatest essence of perfection. Fitzgerald has written out prose that intertwine so many elements, the heirarchy of American society, love, aspiration to the American Dream, the sign of the times in the Roaring Twenties, friendship, paradise, and paradise lost, yet it is all woven together so clearly, so vividly, so beautifully...<br />Fitzgerald's prose is lyrical, sharp and intense. It is the height of the use of the English language. The devices used to keep the reader interested are borrowed, yet brought to a level of perfection, a level that the originators of these devices could never fathom.<br />Comparing Fitzgerald's work to the work of more modern novelists, I see what the latter aspire to. I was supposed to read this in high school but neglected to. I wish this was the novel to have sparked my interest in the art of prose.<br />In the Esquire article &quot;Monologue to the Maestro: A High Seas Letter&quot; by Ernest Hemingway, Hemingway talks about what makes a great writer. He says that reading the classics is something a writer should do &quot;...so he knows what he has to beat.&quot; He goes on to list classics that he feels are essential for a writer to read. In a modern times, &quot;Gatsby&quot; is a novel a writer should read &quot;so he knows what he has to beat.&quot;<br />The Great Gatsby is not only a benchmark for writers, but a novel for anyone to read for its beautiful use of the English language, gripping story, and story structure. As I wish I could read Russian to fully understand the essence of classics like &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, I can imagine serious readers who cannot read English feeling the same way about a book like &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;<br />I recommend this book to anyone who is into fine art, for this is fine art of storytelling and the English language of the twentieth century. Furthermore, I suggest,in order for this novel to be fully enjoyed, that it be read in one sitting.ully enjoyed, that it be read in one sitting.	2000-11-30

Vonnegut writes the book with the question that &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; plays with on a different level, all the while throwing in philosophies, wit, and things to ponder on and about during the COLD WAR. <br />The narrator (first-person incompetent) is somewhat vacant, and being so, maneuvers the story the best way possible. <br />The narrator is writing a book on the atomic bomb and he travels about meeting strange people who know the creators of the bomb. The characters he meets are funny and strange (You would have to be an oddball to be toying with doomsday.). In his journey he finds the sons and daughter of the inventor of the A-bomb. He finds that these three are an eccentric and foolish trio. The daughter and sons hold with them ice-nine, a weapon that makes the a-bomb seem infantile. Ice-nine was an attempt by their father to make battlefields (mud) solidify, making battle easier on soldiers. It winds up making any moisture it touches solid and blue, but its one flaw is, once put into the atmosphere it regenerates without stopping, freezing everything in its path(including human beings).<br />Vonnegut throws in the element of Bokononism, a quirky, weird religion spawned by an eccentric, self-made prophet named Bokonon. This angle plays in the mind of the reader as it debases the relevancy of all religions, thus, for example, making Catholicism or Islam just as strange as Bokononism. Bokononists chant about man being born of the &quot;mud.&quot;<br />Symbolically the three children holding ice-nine, a single flake of which will end mankind as we know it, stand for three world superpowers. It shows that anyone, no matter how high in power, can be foolish, and should have no access to such an element of destruction. The ice-nine is just a symbol of the end of mankind through the folly of science, for the ice-nine turns things bluish white, like ice--putting man in another ice-age, destroying all &quot;mud&quot;. The island of San Lorenzo is like Cuba--through its history no one really cared about anyone else ceasing it, but since there is an odd belief there(Bokononism/Communism),people poke around there now. It shows how such a small place, like Cuba, in the Cold War, could be ground-zero for the end of humanity, and warns against intervention there.<br />Being that the Cold War is over, this is an era piece that some may think is stagnate. Yet the tools to end civilization are still out there, so this book is relevant as long as science and government have and look for a greater means of destruction.<br />Though this book is funny and eccentric on surface, it is ultimately found to be a political warning. This humorous look at what could be the end, parallels Orwell's &quot;Nineteen-Eighty-Four&quot; in the field of political writing for the sake of warning (Orwell warns about the threat of Totalitarianism, Vonnegut warns about man's acute closeness to his own demise). This book is not as hard-nosed as &quot;Nineteen-Eighty-Four.&quot; It is funny, but this is done to show the folly and incompetence that mankind's demise is handled with: Vonnegut's use of juxtaposition is without flaw.  <br />Bokonon adds a religious facet to this novel. He ultimately shows folly and incompetence in the creation of something other than doomsday devices--religion. After the reader drops the hypocrisy of thinking their religion is &quot;the one,&quot; Vonnegut brings up the question: Were people like Jesus or Mohammed just fools out spreading nonsense for the sake of an ego-trip?<br />This book touches on so many intense questions. It puts forth a vehicle for such deep introspection, yet it is hilarious. I only wish I were to have read this in the mind set of the world in the early sixties, when this book was first published. Vonnegut was way ahead of his time with this one. His writing, when dissected, makes me think he is one of the great thinkers of the twentieth-century into the twenty-first...	2000-11-21

In the first part of this review I would like to stress that this collection of short stories has only three new short stories by Jay McInerney. Seven of the ten can be found in the American hardcover edition of &quot;Model Behavior.&quot;<br /> Jay McInerney is known to write great one liners and there are  quite a few in this collection of stories. His wit is shown,but not as greatly executed as in his novels for he does not have the space to juxtapose  human tragedy in, there still are the great one-liners he has been known for that will make you both laugh and, in one instance, become politically conscious. Jay McInerney's mentor was Raymond Carver; the master of the short story, yet the short story is not McInerney's niche. I must admit though, there is much delight in &quot;The Business,&quot; yet there is not much to be learned from it.<br />McInerney's true talent comes forth in the form of the novel. If you are a first time McInerney reader I would suggest : &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; or the novella &quot;Model Behavior&quot; though I believe all of his work in the field of the American Novel is superb.<br />Mr. McInerney is a master of weaving comedy and human tragedy (a talent that is not achieved by very many). If you are to read his work I would strongly suggest you try his novels before delving into his short stories.	2000-11-13

Mr. Vonnegut has put forth a great piece of literature that binds together the worlds of poverty and gross wealth in a study on what makes human beings worthwhile or worthless and the make up of the architect of man. <br />This novel is a collage of introspection and lessons. Using religious allegory, Vonnegut shows that human beings are only human-- whether poor or rich. His god figurine, when all sculpted by the end of the book, shows the reader a view on the creator of man: entropic on the surface, yet acutely set in his ways of good, even after the denouncment of him by his people. Take this view however you wish. <br />Vonnegut's god is all of us: rich, poor, filthy, crazy... the list goes on. And Vonnegut raises the strange question: Was God crazy for producing mankind?<br />This novel is thought provoking, entertaining, and enlightening. Take my view however you wish.	2000-11-12

What people  think over what you know. Worth. <br />The fish which leads Santiago is  allegorical to faith in God. Santiago has faith but in the end, as in life,  we do not always get what we want--yet we endure and become stronger  because of our faith even in the event of loss. <br />I need not even say this  but--this truly is a timeless masterpiece.	2000-07-20

This work deviates from all of his other efforts. It is not as comical as past works. Not too pretensious. <br />What I like the most about  this novel though, is the contrevorsy it stirs over, the Martin Luther King  Jr. assassination as well as other historical events which took place  during the 30 year span of this novel. It seems there is a little hint at  hidden &quot;facts&quot; in this work of &quot;fiction&quot;. <br />  A must  read for sociologists and contrevorsy theorists, and oh yeah the disciples  of McInerney. Be forewarned disciples, this is not the usual Jay.	2000-03-23

If you are familiar with Jay McInerney's celebrity status you may read this book and think it is a self serving, female bashing rag. I read this book and was going to dismiss it as just that. On the contrary, this is a  strong book supporting feminism. Notice the name association of the  protagonist to the the classic female traditionalist: Elizabeth  &quot;Poole&quot; Sanford- Alison &quot;Poole&quot;. Where does the  lifestyle of traditionalism get Alison Poole? Read the book. A must read  for feminists. It is an illustration of the evils of female traditionalism.	2000-03-22

This work is pure art. Some call this book a guiltly pleasure but  I beg to differ. The wit and irony in this book are paralelled by few  authors such as Flannery O' Connor. The book is art. The symbolism is  subtle and not shoved down the reader' throat. It is one of the greatest  novels of our time. It is soon to be one of the books that high school  students learn in English class if there are not teachers who do it  already. People not from New York seem to be anti-BLBC but this book could  have taken place anywhere. A must read for it's style, wit, and,realism.  This book not only teaches, but entertains.	2000-03-14

I guess I,like the many others who are flocking to this book just wanted to takea look at the newest bloody traffic accident on the side of the highway. Yes, this is a portrait of an obsessive compulsive disorder afflicted murderer. It carries the same theme over from &quot;Less Than Zero.&quot; (&quot;As things fall apart, nobody pays attention.&quot;) Except now we are not Clay, the onlooker, we are the perpatrator.  Ellis takes a few blows at McInerney that the well versed 80's brat-pack reader can pick up on.  Why did I buy this book? The same reason I rented &quot;Banned From TV&quot; from the video store.  I give this book 2 stars: 1) because it gives me the names of fashion designers to drop when in the company of elitists, and 2) the anticipation it brought about, waiting to see the creative way in which the next murder was to be pulled off.  If you like shock-u-dramas like Faces of Death, I higly recommend this book. If you are just the average, avid reader you won't be missing anything if you don't read the latest book &quot;everybody is talking about.&quot;	2000-03-14

There is not much to be learned from his newest work but McInerney once again succeeds in making  the reader laugh from his keen sense of humor. Although this book does not  fit Aristotle's definition of art, it is still an extremely funny read. I  hate to drudge it up, but Bright Lights, Big City did fit Aristotle's  definition of art. Although there is nothing to be learned from this novel  the wit which McInerney executes is worthy of giving this book four stars.  The dissociative narritive disorder which ails this book also makes it  interesting in a way. Some of his work may be self serving, but the bottom  line is that his execution of wit is unparallelled by any of the other  contemporary authors. Did I say self-serving? Theres a great deal of  celebrity bashing within this book. I'll give the readers of this review a  hint as to one of the celebrities: Chip Ralston= Leonardo DiCaprio.	2000-02-16
