Perhaps there was also too much expectation that this book be like the other books.<br />The way I see it, each one of the books has its own \\"theme\\" or flavour.  Book 1, was of DISCOVERY - we were finding out and learning a lot along with Ayla.  Book 2 was of INDEPENDENCE where Ayla learnt to rely on herself, and was very innovative and discovered things that were later to become her greatest achievements (eg befriending animals, fire stones, not to mention Pleasures *lol*). Book 3 was about SOCIALISING - Ayla learns about the Others, represented by the lovable Mamutoi, and there's the fun along with confusions and misunderstandings.  Book 4 was about JOURNEYING - Ayla goes from place to place, and learns heaps about how others do things.<br />However, Book 5 is about SETTLING IN - Ayla has reached \\"home\\" and is just trying to settle in, she meets her in-laws (as Auel herself puts it!), gets mated and has another baby.  If you compare this theme, it is definately not as high-powered or interesting as the other books' themes, but is a valid theme in itself.  Sure, I agree there was more repetition than was totally palatable (the endless introductions, the fire-making three times, the Mother song in great detail twice) but in a way it really sets the pace for \\"home\\" - home is not a place for massive bouts of discovery or difficulties; some petty in-fighting yes, and Ayla's motherly side is evinced in greater detail, but nothing really earth-shattering.  Another reviewer said in a earlier review that this book was not so \\"tense\\" to read, and I think that is certainly true, there is an almost relaxing homely quality to reading it.  That's one thing I had noticed about Auel's books, they set what I see as the themes off very well.  For example, when I read Book 4 about journeying, I felt really tired by the end ofit!  In fact that's the one book in the series I would not casually pick up to read just like that; like Jondalar, it's going to be sometime before I want to make another long Journey again!  Likewise, Book 1 had me feeling very curious and enjoying discovery; Book 2 was highly sexed; and Book Three was full of complex human relations - and it all brought me into the themes on a viceral level.  Therefore, I wasn't too put off that Book Five was kinda a Comfortable read!<br />The other reason why Book 5 might be not as satisfactory is that unlike the other 4 books, it is not self contained - there are a lot of loose ends to be tied up in Book 6.  In Book 1 there was closure as Ayla left the Clan; in Book 2 there was closure when Ayla's solitude ended; in Book 3 there was closure when she left the Mamutoi; in Book 4 there was closure when she ended her Journey.  In Book 5 though, nothing's been resolved with her enemies, and Ayla has just struggled to accept that she is going to be One who Serves, but she hasn't embarked on anything yet.  Therefore, IMHO Book 5 and Book 6 in a way will form \\"one book\\".  There will be closure of the issues brought up in Book 5 in Book 6, the theme of which I tentatively predict will be SPIRITUALITY.  Afterall, Auel herself drafted Book 6 at the same time as Book 5.<br />So cheer up everyone, I'm sure we will all enjoy Book 6 tremendously - it's when Ayla will fulfil ther great potential.  In a way, she is almost like an incarnation of the Mother herself, with her Lumi-like Jondalar by her side!	2002-05-10
US	51258765	R3WP1ON57XOFN	0553285653	26251333	Grass	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Good characters, great suspense	I was very impressed by the intense suspense created in me while I was reading this book.  Like Marjorie and her family, I truly felt like I was on an alien planet, in an alien culture - I felt frustratingly confused by the dribbles of information (masterfully imparted by Tepper) and was made insatiably curious.  However, I wasn't too impressed by the 'evolution' theory behind it all, but I'm going to give credit where it is due - the journey to that revealtion makes up for it.  The characters and the interactions within this dysfunctional family are wonderfully portrayed, and gives an added dimension that most science/fiction fantasy books are lacking.  Marjorie is an unlikely and unconventional heroine (not the normal romanticised figure - just a mother who cannot relate to her husband and daughter, but is innately competent) yet she is intensely appealing.  Not only was I led to appreciate a new 'culture', but I also learnt to appreciate a new kind of character, one I don't often meet up with in fiction.	2001-02-08

While I have to admit the author presented history in a palatable form (despite battle after battle, I was kept fascinated) I was rather skeptical about some of the speculations on the thoughts and possible conversations held by the historical figures.  I felt that the character motivations were sometimes a wee bit too altruistic (Stephan for example) and Penman was trying to push a view forward (eg. that Stephan's only motivation was to 'save' England from a woman, no mention how much he WANTED to be king?), or in the case of Maude, too single-mindedly stupid and stuck in the martyr mind-set.  I felt it was politically too simplistic.  I was also a little leery about the way the love story was built up between Maude's son Henry and Elenor of Acquitane - it seemed a bit too laboured, too obviously a way to make the story more interesting, possibly at the expense of the perspective we take on history.<br />But, I am complaining about what makes this book 'palatable', and in balance I am glad that the author did it this way - only I think it requires the reader to be vigilant of the assumptions he or she is led to hold by the perspective the author tries to push forward.  It could somewhat cloud the 'education' we are getting by enjoying this book.	2001-02-08

The whole series was intriguing.<br />What really struck me was how unconventional these books are - firstly the setting, Victorian England is really well depicted. Pullman obviously knows his history: the opium trade and the British government's involvement in it is told frankly in this book for example.  I must admit I liked the first book best - partially because it was such a shock to come across such a fresh writing style - the characters really speak - their accents, their interactions and very human reactions.  And while Sally develops to be more 'real' in the following two books, the strangely light, almost careless way of telling the story lent a surreal feeling of freedom to the first book.  It almost didn't matter what the plot was, or how Sally's adventure would turn out - I was just so mesmerised by the way one fact after another was presented, to create an incongruous (rubies, babies, bohemians, photographers, lawyers, opium, accountancy, pistols) and therefore fascinating montage of information.  Most books seem to work the reader towards a point - either a climax, or a moral: 'this is what you are supposed to get from the book', but the first book of the series feels free of it, even when Mrs Holland finally catches up with Sally, as does Ah Ling.  I came out feeling like I had been given permission to go on a holiday.<br />Book 3, which is about the persecution of Jews is more diadactic (and I think a lot of the political arguements may be lost on a younger audience), and book 2 is more 'plotted'.  The author also handles legal jargon, and business concepts to especial effectiveness, giving the series a gritty feeling of reality, of being grounded in the dreary details of life, which are so often absent from 'mysteries' or 'suspense thrillers' (a Penny Dreadful it ain't!)  I really loved that!<br />All in all, it is worth giving this series a try.  I liked it far better than 'The Golden Compass'.	2001-01-24
US	51258765	RO3TZY626FHX5	0439139597	667539744	Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire (Book 4)	Books	4	4	9	N	N	Really enjoyed it	I hadn't planned to read the latest publishing sensation, but I read Harry Potter's adventures over Christmas, and while I cannot say that it has won a place in my heart as a favourite, I enjoyed myself hugely while reading it.<br />It is not as though Rowling's idea is terribly original, although she has revitialised the old 'wizard's school' story with elements like Quidditch, and details like the choosing of a wand (or a wand choosing a wizard/witch) and of course great charaters like Hagrid and Hermione really make the stories fascinating, even for reader familiar with the genre.  What really stands out is her deft touch of humour; her intensely involved plots (of which this book 4 is a stellar example, it is amazing to compare it with the preceding 3 books - it is so much more controlled and water-tight, no loose-ends, considering how complex it was); and her effective way of evoking emotion at crucial points of her story eg. Harry's longing for his parents is a constant theme, and concepts such as love, loyalty and friendship are explored.<br />All the criticism regarding witch-craft surrounding the Rowling mystique are quite laughable.  Magic is the subject-matter of the book - to complain against the Harry Potter books is to complain against the a large proportion of the whole genre or fantasy as a whole.  Are we to be deprived of such imagination and fiction on the basis of religious intolerance?<br />I was struck by the level of &quot;darkness&quot; in the books, but it tends to be gross (descriptions of Voldemort are pretty grim) and not violent for violence sake.  In fact the death of Cedric Diggory was dealt with in one of the more humane ways I have seen death dealt with in recent examples of media.  It is not taken lightly in the book.<br />All in all, I am left anticipating, with millions of other readers, Book 5!  Keep up the good work, Ms. Rowling.	2001-01-14

The plot is very thin - about one layer of discovery, after which  there does not seem much left that is interesting.  Characters are almost characterless.  Deals with concepts such as prejudice and ignorance, but in a rather didactic and idealised manner.  Not worth the effort.	2001-01-14

It is best suited for someone who is beginner to intermediate -although I think even the expert will appreciate having this fantasticreference to all the major (over 4000) flowering plants, shrubs andtrees, climbers, and fruit.  <br /> Advantages of this book over thecompetition:<br />1) There is a picture for every plant that ismentioned.  It is amazing that not all gardening books have picturesand the description is just another plant name.  Pictures also meanthat if you see a beautiful flowering bush as you are driving, you cancome home, check its name, and go to your local nursery to ask for it,rather that say &quot;Uh, I think its got pink flowers, and greenleaves.&quot; Save your nurseryman from a headache and yourself fromembarassment!  Oh and the photos are stunning as well, if you like toenjoy reading your garden books for pleasure.<br />2) There are a few'encyclopedic' reference books around that give very detailedinformation about the plant, up to the history of its development -but no tips.  Not so here.  Each plant come with a short descriptionof the plant, useful hints for growing, and recommendations ofvarieties.<br />3) There is a section on gardening techniques - coveringall the essential steps: planning (beautifully illustrated plans forthe garden to suit your needs eg. garden for family with children, forthe elderly or disabled, how to make a square garden look less angularetc. I love this section, it is so creative and the author has goodideas); there are also buying tips (how to choose); constructiontechniques (yes!  actually teaches the easier methods of building aflower beds, fences, paving, steps, rock gardens and also coversthings like drainage, watering etc); propagation techniques; improvingsoil quality; maintainence and more.<br />4) The author has thoughtfullyand very usefully compiled all the information in quick referencetables at the end, tabulating soil requirements, aspect/hardiness,foliage, flowering season, problems, etc.  Basically everything youneed to know when planning which plants to put with what, what to growso you have flowers all year round, how to get plats to flowersimultaneously.  It's amazing how many gardening books fail to dothis.<br />5) ...  I couldn't believe it.  It's one third of the nextbest 'encyclopedia'-type book.  You get so much out of it, consideringyou can buy a book just on planning and designing for that price.<br />...	2000-10-29

Did no one else find it repulsive?  And then all his greasy friends touching her and saying overtly sexual things like you're a pretty one ... creepy.  <br />Secondly, the degree of violence in the book is very high.  The part where Klaus is hit right across the face, till his face is marked, is a bit strong.  Someone else I spoke to said that they felt that the author actually enjoyed showing the violent parts, including hanging a baby out from a tower.  I can't say with regards to that, but I do admit finding it disturbing that this is a &quot;children's book&quot;.<br />&quot;Unfortunate events&quot; are one thing, everyone knows that the premise of a good story is unfortunate events happening to the hero and heroine, but events bordering on the sadistic are another.  Perhaps the children of today can take it (I have seen a couple of kids' reviews that have liked it) but I think mothers might like to read through the book first, and decide whether they want their kids to read it.<br />I gave it 2 stars because I was entertained by the story to some extent.	2000-10-10

I must confess at the start that this is not a totally objective review as  this book will always be special to me in that it was the first book I have  even managed to get my mother to enjoy!  I cannot express how happy that  makes me because my mother never reads, and as reading has always been my  largest pleasure in life, there has always been that gap between us.  But  imagine my delight (and her delight) when she actually read a story that  fascinated her, the first story in Eleven, about the man who kept snails as  pets.  In my mother's words, she enjoyed the story because the author was  very good at writing about emotions and how people react in situations.   That is exactly what I love about Highsmith's books. She makes the  intricate emotional linkages that are usualy unanalysed and obscured very  clear.  In a way she is also pointing out to us how WE act, and feel, and  making that clear - reading her books always makes me feel as though I was  reminded of an emotion.  Anyway, mum's just finished the fourth story about  the terrapin (which is an award winning story) and joyfully telling me  about each story as she goes along.  Hope you enjoy it as much as she does.	2000-08-25

This is the best book I have read all year, and I have read about 70-odd  so far!  It is impossible to believe that the characters could be real live  people, but if there is a real Lady Chablis, I suspect the others caould  exist as well.<br />What I love is the WAY the characters are shown to us.  For the most part they just talk - they talk about themselves, and they  talk about others in ways that reveal alot about themselves.  They talk to  the narrator who is a Yankee from New York come to write a book about  Savannah.  It is amazing how his presence heightens the humour of the  confessions and gossip of the people of Savannah, although he doesn't  really do very much except be there to be talked to and patronised.<br />The  writing is full of incredible energy - the first chapter could possibly be  the best first chapter of a book I have ever read in my life - it gripped  me by the gills and I was left gasping (reminds me about the story of the  flourescent goldfish, wait till you read about that!)	2000-08-25

Common sense told me  it was observation - but I still wanted to find out from the horse's mouth  so to speak.<br />While I found it interesting to read about Highsmith looking  back at the circumstances under which she wrote, I felt that Highsmith  herself was not whole-heartedly interested, or confident about writing  about her particular process of writing.  It was mildly irritating that she  apologised several times (usually at the beginning of a chapter) for having  the audacity to presume to write about how to write.  Fair enough: it is  wise not to assume you speak for everyone or be totally pompous about it  (like Sol Stein, ugh) but still, by the time a reader picks up a book like  this, they really WANT to know how that particular author writes.  I also  felt that there was a fair amount of distance between the time she analysed  her process, and the time she actually wrote her stories, so the book lacks  the intricacy that one gets from reading a more immediate  record.<br />However, there were some useful and interesting bits, especially  Highsmith's opinions on thickening the plot, and the use of coincidence.   It would help very much to have read her work widely as she quotes from  some of them and uses the Glass Cell as a case study.	2000-08-25

Montgomery wrote at the time when journalists were clamouring for details of the life of the author of the bestselling 'Anne of Green Gables', that she would give them no really personal information about  herself - that was only to be found in her private journals.<br />It is very  interesting for a lover of the 'Anne' books to read of L.M. Montgomery's  life in that one sees flashes of incidents or a turn of expression that  reveals her to be the creator of Anne.  <br />This first part of her journals  traverses L.M. Montgomery's young girlhood, in which she goes to a school  which is like the school Anne goes to, and to college where she takes First  Class, as Anne does, teaches as Anne eventually does as well.  It is also  interesting that L.M. Montgomery herself faced the prospect of marrying the  wrong man, as her first engagement was a disaster - Anne later reels back  from commiting herself to the wrong person.  <br />But the journals are far  more complex than that - L.M. Montgomery's deeper passions and even sexual  desires are alluded at - and this has no place in the 'Anne' books.  She is  also unhappy for a lot of the time.  She herself said it was a wonder that  the difficulties in her own life did not come through in her writing - but  she was happy as she wanted to give only optimism and joy through her  books.<br />The journals give an insight to the conflicts within L.M.  Montgomery because of her conservative, pragmatic pride warring with her  shockingly powerful passions and emotions.	2000-07-09

And the answer was - PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  That would be a compliment to the author I think, that she managed to convey some of the  sexual tension that Austen so masterfully created in P&amp;P.  <br />But -  perhaps it is not terribly fair to compare Sherwood Smith to Jane Austen -  Austen did it better.  The 'world' created by Sherwood Smith is not as  organically intergrated with the plot as the world Austen observed so  keenly - and the rules of that world and society are not as tightly woven  into Meliara's attitudes.  Also, the stakes were higher in P&amp;P - Darcy  was actually proud, whereas Shevraeth was faultless - his snobbery was  pretense in Crown Dual and non-existent in Court Duel.  Also, in P&amp;P  there was a real sense of panic created when Elizabeth Bennet had actually  refused Darcy's proposal once, and there seemed really a possibility that  their differences would never be resolved.  In Court Duel I was twiddling  my thumbs going, Ok, OK, so when is Mel going to fall into Shev's arms ...  it was just a little too easy.  Still, thanks to Sherwood Smith for a very  enjoyable read.	2000-07-05

The book moves rather slowly compared to contemporary children's books. However, it does cover themes like learning, imagination, co-operation vs.  rivalry, and how you can go beyond the limitations you have set yourself in  your mind.  What really impressed me was that unlike contemporary  children's books, childhood nastiness, feelings of hatred, dislike, envy,  guilt and shame are incorporated into the story in quite a bitter form.

As a reader who fell drastically inlovewith Ella Enchanted, this seemed like a half-baked effort, not fulfilling the author's potential.  I was very drawn to the premise of the story, which is an exploration into what often is the single most consuming thing of our existence in society - and this is not just for kids - Popularity.  But I felt the theme wasn't explored quite deeply enough.  I felt that there were many parts of the stories which copped out - avoided a satisfactory exploration, completion.  It leaves me going, so what?  Judy Blume dealt with these gut-wrenching problems way better - maybe Carson Levine should stick to fairytales.	2000-06-23

I don't care if this book won both the Caldecott and Newbery - it was a bland and insipid personal view of the poetry and spirit one of the gratest poets alive.  I cannot imagine giving this to a child to read when they  could be given the REAL Blake, which children are fully capable of enjoying  (as the author herself did).  The author tries to incorporate some of the  original rhythm in Blake's poetry, but that's about all I recognised, aside  from the name dropping of some of Blake's most memorable images.  Fine, if  you don't really care about exposing your children to Blake.  The 2 points  are for the pretty illustrations.	2000-06-23

I read it on the high recommendations I read on this site, but now having read the book, and re-reading the reviews, I realise that the pleasure if Magic enthusiasts at  seeing their subject-matter in print probably eclisped the awfulness of the  book! OK, it was entertaining enough (hence 2 stars) - the writer keeps you  in suspense for half the book - bravo, good showmanship.  But, the PRESTIGE  of his book, the big revelation, was the biggest let-down, cop-out and what  I consider more dangerous, abuse of Science and insult to the Art of  Illusion.  Its reads like a third rate &quot;Beam me up Scotty&quot; copy.   It seems the author is one of those who fell for the illusion of magic and  actually believes it CAN happen, like for real.

Yes, think about it - it keeps looping back and more is revealed about one  thread of story each time.  If you took the trouble of tracing the paths of  the maze diagrams in the book, you would see that.<br />Now why didn't I see  that?<br />The writing is very good prose, and the descriptions often very  rich and sensual - especially of the Harris tweed jacket (I own one) which  I read three times, before reading the rest of the book.  However, the tale  lacks an emotional centre ... its like a well-written story about ... what?   Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of &quot;about what?&quot;/slice of  life stories which sizzle - but this just wasn't one of them.  I felt  exactly like ... completing a maze and finding an ugly stone fountain at  the end.  Exactly.  Unfortunately.	2000-06-14

Actually, its a pleasure knowing that since I have bought this illustrated book, it has been passed on to friends of friends of friends!  I havn't even seen it for a month.  No one can resist this book, which is an  affectionate yet honest look by the author/illustrator Raymond Briggs, who  tells the story of the courtship and life of his mother Ethel and father  Ernest, set squarely in a historical period of Britian.  The historical  detail is amazing - from the comic antagonism of the political attitudes  displayed by his mother and father, to the harsh reality of facing World  War II on families.  But the story is told with such humour and insight,  and with such a powerful undercurrent of sadness and love, that it is  uplifting rather than depressing.<br />I noticed another reviewer said this  book was hard to catergorise - and that is so.  It is not a story with a  particular point - the point, if any, is about life.	2000-06-14

I absolutely love the portrayal of Ethel and Ernest by  their son, the author: affectionate, yet honestly observant and  unsentimental.  Their characters come through so clearly.  For a son to  write something like this must have taken many tears, laughing  rememberances and open-mouthed moments of imagination.  The historical and  social detail is truly amazing - the War (complete with Churchill's  speech), VE Day, the advent of television, the Labour/Tory division (even  between man and wife), the man on the moon - and it never slows down the  story, it just illuminates the relationship between this man and wife, full  of love and the tiny conflicts of married life.  I cried at so many parts.   This is so touching, all the more that it is about two extraordinary  &quot;ordinary&quot; people.	2000-05-24

The book and the film have sort of the same feel about it; only in the book, the mood is broken  sometimes with a quirky jar of humour - like, did you know that the  romantic Byronic figure of Prince Lear in the beautifully illustrated film  used to be fat?  Yes, I didn't really want to know that, or that he lost  weight slaying dragons!<br />Great imaginative ensemble of characters - people  who role-play might recognise a touch of it in that aspect.  The characters  though are possibly embodiments of philosophical points of view.  Some  speculation on my part:  Is the butterfly a satire of the educated man?   &quot;Butterflies only know songs and poetry and anything else they hear  ...&quot;  He knows much, but cannot answer the Unicorn's question.  And  what of Schmenderick, the misfit magician?  His unspoken wish which the  unicorn cannot fulfil &quot;I cannot make you a true magician&quot; reminds  us that there is no unicorn or magic strong enough to make us into what we  are not - only we can fulfil our own dreams. And who hasn't been side  tracked from a dream, eliciting the unicorn's scorn &quot;He is no magician  now, but the King's court clown.&quot;  Then there is the greedy witch's  &quot;Illusions, deceptions, mirages.  Your Mommy Fortuna cannot truly  change things.&quot;  And what of King Haggard who only gets happiness by  keeping happiness from the world.  What is Beagle thinking about our  society?  Or how about the burly robber baron with his band of merry men,  who declares, &quot;Robin Hood is a myth.  We are the reality.&quot;  This,  from a story book character!  And of course the big question is &quot;What  is the Red Bull?&quot; - everyone has a personal Red Bull, even a Unicorn.   And what of love and immortality; why &quot;I will not love you when I am a  unicorn.&quot;  <br />It seems simplistic when it is written out like that,  but those themes and so many others are so intricately woven into the  story, to engage us in our own wonderings.  Like all best stories it is  part myth and fantastic narrative.	2000-05-17

The meaning of the Semi-colon is explained in the play, it becomes  a symbol of intellectual rigour, and an attutude of professionalism, either  in coping with cancer, or studying English literature.  <br />What is also  insightful is the portrayal of everyone else around her, how they help, or  do not help, either through ignorance and insensitivity, or self-interest.   I think for people in academic situations, or in any profession where  status is so important, it will show that perhaps admiration is not better  compassion when you are on the death bed.	2000-05-15

From my own experience, this book  somehow manages to interest and sooth, when a person is in need.  That is  the only way I can explain its popularity.  Objectively, no, its not a  riveting plot, nor are the ideas world-changing, and I can understand  people who are not in a vulnerable state scorning it as &quot;new-age  mumbo-jumbo&quot;; but I think they should realise - and respect - that  others may find it useful.	2000-05-15

If you lose your temper, it is attributed to the yang side of your nature; if you don't get along with your mum, it is because your signs  conflict; if you succeed in school, it is because you are born under an  intelligent sign, and so on.  Under Theodora Lau's guidance, feel free to  delegate all responsibility for your actions - she provides a very good  summary of the &quot;basic&quot; attributes of each sign as it is  understood by the (Chinese) person on the street, and also combines it with  the western signs, for added interest and familiarity with Western  audiences (and perhaps also explains why people born in the same year are  not clones of each other!)  She also touches on how the hour of your birth  will result in more refined differences.  <br />The main charm of this book is  the sprightly manner in which she deals with the subject, amusing and  readable in turns.  One can almost believe it is a mirror she is holding up  ... how very flattering ... one wonders if she has the wily pen of a  Monkey, or the charm of a Snake ...	2000-05-15

Also some of the  stories are too improbable for suspension of disbelief, ie. the story of  the gambling nun.  'The Jury' is like something out of 'Tales of the  Unexpected' or 'Tales from the Dark side', and bears some resemblence to  Somerset Maugham's darker tales of Malaya.  Also some of the world-weary  author comes through in the stories, which means the wry and humourous  'voice' of ten year old Durell, created so beautifully in 'My Family and  Other Animals' is merely imitated. The only place it fully succeeds is in  Antoine's little speech in 'Marrying Off Mother' - which is worth reading  the whole book for!<br />Perhaps I am being grossly unfair in expecting  something like 'My Family and Other Animals' - each book and story should  stand on its own.  It is worth reading just to get a taste of what other  things interested Durell.  Some of the stories do not actually have animals  in them!	2000-03-09

I enjoy all of Herge's Tintin stories, for the excellent artwork, good research and brisk story-lines, but the Catafiore Emerald stands out from the other Tintins in that it is not situated in foreign lands but at Marlinspike Hall, the home-estate where Tintin and Captain Haddock live.  I  think it is a mark of a story teller at the peak of his story telling  abilities when he can tell a story so amusingly and entertainingly without  even leaving the back-yard, so to speak.  While it is not necessary to have  read all the other Tintin adventures to appreciate this, I think knowing  the characters fairly well (and their idiocyncrasies) makes the sometimes  subtle pokes and jokes sparkle.	2000-02-23

This is not the sort of book to read if you just want to know what happens next - it is a lovely, long, engrossing read.  For example, the author lingers on the kind  M. Bienvenu for chapters and chapters ... but by the end of it, there is no  man so good, so kind, so well-regarded.  We have the EXPERIENCE of a life  of good (actually, think of it, it is probably too short!) not just  &quot;he was a good man&quot; in two paragraphs.  I am actually reading the  novel to someone, and we have just finished Bienvenu's section, and enjoyed  it very much.<br />A very involved plot, many of the characters who would be  familiar to the musical-going audience.<br />It could be that the almost  simplistic symbolism of the characters (ie. Beinvenu=compasionately good,  Javert=inflexibly moral, Valjean=redeemed, Fantain=innocence lost,  Cossette=love triumphant) is what makes such a complex story easily  rendered on the stage.	2000-02-23

Kudos to Richard Curtis!  It is amazing how much he manages to get into a scene - everything  WORKS, to tug at the heart strings or strike the funny bone.  <br />The script  reveals a few of the artistic choices that had to be made in the process of  creating the script and the movie; however, this is a very polished end  product - definately a last draft (with a few choice bits of scenes that  did not make the cut at the end) and perfectly co-ordinated with film  stills and photographs, all on luxurious glossy paper.<br />However, it is  amazing how, having watched the film and knowing the charactrers, it is  possible to visualise scenes in your head while reading the script - an  especial plus for the left out scenes.

It truely 'burns bright' with emotion, clear and confused,  painful yet tender, loving yet savage.<br />Without giving the story away, the  three act structure is incredibly important to the theme of the story/play  - Steinbeck is perhaps one of the most intelligent writers in thinking a  theme right through, and crafting his work to reflect the theme on more  than one level.	2000-02-23

(Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters)<br />This novel,  together with Burning Bright, is my favourite of Steinbeck books.  <br />It  runs in two parallel story lines - one of the Trasks where the Cain and  Abel fable is replicated in two generations; and that of the Hamiltons,  Steinbeck's own maternal family - the telling is fun and full of affection  and great tenderness, especially the portrayal of Samuel, Steinbeck's  grandfather. The effect of the parallel stories, which cross only very  tenuously gives the effect of a very great scope of the novel, a full sweep  of history, and place and time immortal.<br />I could give a very bland  description of what happens - but I won't because it is a poor copy of what  Steinbeck does a thousand times better.  What I can write about is that  reading this story (and I have read it many times) always gives me a full,  satisfied feeling.  I think it is because it covers the great extremes of  many themes, and all in between.  Great good, and monstrous evil; love and  hate ... all mixed up in a complex soup, which is perhaps as simple as any  experience of life.<br />Ironically, my favourite characters are the very very  good Samuel, and the very very bad Cathy.	2000-02-20

Indeed it is fascinating to get a peek into another culture, and yes, I learnt something about geisha culture, although I am careful to remember it is not first-hand.<br />But the story isn't great.  The fumbling Sayuri seems  to lack intelligence or insight - while some may see it as simply a  reaction to the constraints of her situation (plenty as they are) the  protagonist does not kindle my sympathies.<br />She also seems to only  understand the world through similies (there are at least a hundred in the  book).  I find it funny how the similies are so 'exotisised' somehow (and  I'm not referring just to the 'eel' one which everyone is so enamoured of!)   Is this how a Western author might think Asians think to themselves ...?   As an Asian I just find it a little artificial, and I hope not everyone  thinks geisha think that way (that is a danger of such 'cultural'  books).<br />Character motivations could have been elucidated.<br />However, the  book had some entertainment value (much of it in the politics surrounding  sex and the lush detailed descriptions of kimonos - an old trick of romance  novels to focus on clothing) and the research makes it interesting.   Bestseller material, not necessarily classic - no where near Jane Austen!	2000-01-02

For several reasons:  Although both novels showcase the author's fabulous viceral WRITING style, SR is a  better STORY.  Firstly, it is obvious, a lot more work went into sculpting  SR: a tight plot with no superfluous information (ie. info that added to  the story, unlike TBP which covers EVERYTHING the author has any interest  in *personally*.)  Also, the a-b-a-c structure pattern (yes, I took the  trouble of checking through the whole book) that artfully introduces info  from the past, present and distant past is very carefully crafted, and  maintains a great pace.  The ending, often critisised for being too abrupt  is IMHO brilliant and brave.  The story is OVER.  Nicola Griffith does not  waste time telling more, when there is nothing left to be said.  Also,  perhaps quite importantly - and this is where TBP fails - it is a good  example of its genre.  While not quite the typical Nebula winner (which are  supposed to be un-typical, anyway!) it blends the science in quite well.   <br />Parting shot: A very atmospheric read, one of what I call  &quot;beautiful&quot; novels (TBP is &quot;beautiful&quot; in the same way,  but the story detracts from it and makes it beautiful but empty.)  SR has  more substance.	1999-08-09

However, The Blue Pace did not live up to my expectations.  Not that the writing is bad - I still admire the author's visceral style - but  the story is poor.  In the end I felt like the focus was really on Aud's  growing attraction to Julia.  If I wanted a romance, I'd read Mills and  Boons!  The handling of the 'thriller' aspect was not satisfying - there  was little suspense, or build-up.  Instead of who-dunit, it was a  when-will-they-do-it.  I felt the author tried to get too much in.   Gardening, carpentry, martial arts, art, theorising on the Norwegian  mind-set and fairytelling while all interesting in their own right, it did  not really add to the story.  In Slow River, though there were diverse  aspects to the character, it added to the story - here it got in the way of  it.  Likewise, the landscape descriptions overwhelmed the story.  It seemed  like Norway in 2 weeks, rather than a setting for a story.  Furthurmore, I  have a problem with the comic book represetation of Aud.  Most of us grow  out of imagining killing people at every introduction once we are past a  certain age.  Rather than gritty and brave and alert, Aud just seems a  little delusional.  I guess I might seem very harsh in this review, but it  is because I expected so much of Nicola Griffith, and know she is capable  of so much more.  I would be interested to hear what other fans think of my  observations.	1999-08-08

The aching loving  relationship between parents and children, and the pain of making choices  that come against that (called 'growing up') is beautifully brought out in  this brilliant tale, set against a landscape of a forest with dark stands  of trees, populated by beasts of the earth, and harpies and dwarves, and a  lighting-riven castle.

The whole setting is assumed, and requires unqualified acceptance.  However, once a reader accepts space teleportation (with help from gestalt) and the blazing mind power of Talents, it is very  absorbing.  The characters are very attractive - The young Rowan herself,  with her mane of silver hair and Afra Lyon the humourous if methody green  Cappellan, play the major roles in the book.  The romance between the Rowan  and Jeff Raven is almost a convention.  In this and the other books in this  series, it is possible to respond quite emotionally towards the characters,  as we are privy to thier innermost thoughts, while they telepath, broadcast  to thier hearts' content!  If nothing else I admire McCaffery for her  splendid characterisation.<br />PS.  I LOVE the book, but am trying to be   objective here!<br />PPS.

However, DAMIA should be  understood as not so much hard-core sci-fi, but panders to a totally  different market niche.  It is very feel-good, and very enjoyable  feel-good, by the way.  It focuses very much on relationships, family,  power and privilage.  The FT&amp;T universe is fun, even if improbable at  this point in time (and I mean imprabable in the sci-fi sense - that is,  mind power is not within the 'probable' spectrum that serious sci-fi  writers pick from). Depending on what you are looking for though, DAMIA,  and the other books in this series can be very enjoyable.	1999-07-27

Once you accept that the narrator  has chosen this form of flowing narration (and for good reasons, realism  being one) it is possible to enjoy the novel.  The beautifully evoked  settings and concentration on day to day non-events, and detailed  description of a cohort of insignificant-yet-significant characters,  reminds me of the experience one gets from a Steinbeck novel.  The main  difference is that My Antonia is far more idealistic and optimistic in tone  than say, The Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden, although there is suicide  and illness, death and decline.  It is very bouyant, and written with a  loving eye and expressive pen.	1999-07-21
