It contains the text of Persius' (A.D. 34-62) and Juvenal's (circa A.D. 127) satires.  The update is really well done.  The introduction provides an excellent introduction to the genre and a background on the transmission of the text.<br /><br />The translation is well done.  It is a prose translation of the Latin poems.  Generally the translation is accurate with \\"idiom-for-idiom\\" translation, using equivalent contemporary American expressions for ancient slang.  The translation has extensive footnotes to explain historical, mythological, literary, and geographic references.  This is very handy for a reader without a mastery of classical literature.	2005-09-19

I knew part of the plot from references to backstory in Brimstone.  The genre of Relic is the standard \\"Monster in the Closet,\\" not unlike the movie Alien.<br /><br />Exploring the Amazon, an expedition from the Museum of Natural History in New York City, come across a hut with a ritual figurine of a creature - presumed to be a totem of a lost tribe.  It is sent back to NY.  The Expedition is killed.  The figurine sits in the vaults of the MNH for decades.  It gets opened in preparation for a new exhibit, and people start being killed.<br /><br />Enter FBI Agent Extraordinaire Pendergast....<br /><br />There are some interesting Jurassic Park-like elements and a twist in the epilogue to set up a later book.<br /><br />The book is spare and fast paced.  The action sequences are excellent and their descriptions of the MNH are creepy with good atmospherics.  Pendergast comes off as a superhero who seems a little wooden with some of the more eccentric characters in the museum having more personality.  Pendergast could be more human and less like a comic book hero.	2005-08-29

That Earth suffers from overpopulation due to retirees returning from off-world colonies, basically the planet Earth becomes the state of Florida.  That due to population pressure, religious extremists create a movement to ban all animals from Earth because only man is created in God's image.  A group of animal lovers run an underground railroad for pets.<br /><br />Throw into the mix a strange planet where the whole planet is intelligent.  (The tired Gaia theme.)  The means of communication is? Smells.<br /><br />All this is great.  But unfortunately, the story decends into absurdity.  Throw in an ancient alien race of environmentalists and another nearly extinct race of super-shapeshifting aliens bent on destruction (and responsible for the creation of humanity), who take the form of dogs - they actually think that dogs enslaved humans rather than humans domesticating dogs - and you get a complex mess of polemics.  Is it intended as satire?  Or is it bad writing?  It is hard to tell.  Without giving the ending away, Tepper relies on a deus ex machina to extricate the heroine from the crisis at the end of the book.	2005-01-23

I picked this book up after seeing the Honor Harrington series well reviewed. Weber writes naval military thrillers set in space. The character Honor Harrington, who is introduced in this first volume of the series is a really engaging character. She is intelligent, aggressive, and a born leader. The story is character driven unlike most military thrillers. However Weber does write really engaging action scenes that keep you rapidly turning paged. Two snaps up.	2004-08-12

It may not be his best, but it is an engaging and entertaining read decades after it was first published.  The book, an adventure, set during the years between WW2 and the founding of the State of Israel.  The book opens with a daring escape from a Displaced Persons camp on Cyprus.  The British authorities, after the war, curtailed immigration to Palestine so as to not inflame the Arab populace.  Jewish refugees fleeing Europe were put into DP camps since nobody wanted the refugees.  From there we dive into the personal histories of the main characters.  The story of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is absolutely gripping.  The horrors of the Holocaust are laid bare.  This had to have been truly shocking to your average middle class American when the book came out.  The characters, other than Dov Landau and Karen Hansen, are somewhat wooden and stereotypical.  It is as if the historical circumstances are dramatic enough and the characters are there to propel the story along.	2004-07-30

The essays span about 20 years. They are mostly about the creative process. He provides inspirational advice on how to care for and feed your Muse. He discusses the methods that work for him. He tells us stories about how he came to write some of his more famous short stories and novels - e.g. how he was driven to tears, writing his first great short story &quot;The Lake&quot;.<br /><br /> The book is probably most valuable for accomplished writers, because he assumes that the reader has already mastered the mechanics of writing and story structure. There is no discussion of plotting, character development, how to sell your work.<br /><br /> If the book has a fault it is that Bradbury is too talented. In the book, he tells the story of writing the first draft of Fahrenheit 451. He wrote it over a few days at a pay typewriter, a dime at a time, in a UCLA library! What works for a genius such as himself, may not work for other writers. He can sit down at a typewriter, commence a prose poem on a noun and miraculously have a story appear on the page. Most other writers do not have the natural command of storytelling. They need to work in a much more structured fashion.	2004-07-30

He says the brain is the only organ of the body that doesn't wear out with use.<br /><br />The lessons, as another reviewer has said, are for the most part motherhood and apple pie.

The primary problem with the book is that it is not psychoanalysis at all. You cannot do post-mortem psychoanalysis from literary biographies. It is not there. The book would carry more weight if it were composed of actual analyses. But then, of course, it loses it cache of turning the same psychoanalytical arguments, used by atheists to debunk religion, against those very same atheists.<br /><br /> For a believer, needing rhetorical ammunition in a debate of theism vs. atheism, the book may have some utility. Otherwise, it is merely an academic exercise in sophistry.	2004-07-28

The primary explanation, according to Kagan, is the arms gap. That is, nations attempt to exercise what power they have. The US is the lone power in the world with the ability to conduct expeditionary warfare on multiple fronts across the glob. As was demonstrated in the Balkans in the 1990's the Europeans are unable to project a credible military force even within Europe. Therefore the Europeans resort to the only thing they have for managing international conflicts, international institutions like the UN and ICCJ.<br />The success of European integration and solving the &quot;German problem&quot; has led Europeans to believe that they live in a Kantian paradise where multilateral supranational institutions can effectively banish war. Americans, given different historical realities, view the world as a Hobbesian jungle where hard power rules. The difference really comes down to how the two view the proximity of threats. Outside of the Middle East, where the Europeans have a stake in maintaining order, the European sphere of influence is small. The US's sphere includes practically the whole globe now with the expansion into Central Asia since 2001. The only continent outside the US sphere of influence is Africa.<br />The European Kantian paradise, could only have come into being with a Hobbesian American military presence to calm the fears about a Germany that might re-arm. Without the American nuclear shield protecting Europe from Soviet expansion, which in turn obviated the need to actually rebuild a German military, European integration may never have been possible, and we would still have Anglo, French, and German arms races today.<br />Kagan offers no real solutions to the fracturing of the Atlantic Alliance. Instead, he basically says that both parties need to get used to double-standards as it applies to the non-Western world, ex-Japan. That Europe needs to understand without the American &quot;sheriff&quot; in town, their Kantian paradise of laws and compromise, is not secure. And that the US needs to get used to criticism from the weaker nations.<br />Thankfully, the book is not a partisan political screed that is full of apocalyptic prognostications about what will happen after the 2004 elections. This is all too common in books on this subject. The partisanship is limited two a couple of minor attacks on the Bush diplomatic team (although praise is given to them for averting a Pakistan-India war), and a revisionist history of Madeleleine Albright's term as Secretary of State.n.

The book argues that the US needs to get out of the UN because the UN functions solely to constrain US power, and that the UN lacks any moral authority because it is dominated by Third World authoritarian regimes voting as a bloc.<br />The US and other Western Democracies need to form a &quot;new UN&quot; whose membership is exclusively nations that respect individual rights.  That is the only way to have an international decisionmaking body with any moral authority.<br />The last half of the book is essentially a tirade on the decadence of the French and other continental European nations.  That is easily skipped, if you have read Robert Kagan's Of Paradise and Power.  There is no need to read the last half of the book, except for the chapter on reforming NATO.  Babbin wants NATO preserved (not a common opinion on right-wing talk radio).  But he does want to reform it, so that only nations that can maintain a military readiness technologically compatible with the US should be able to participate in NATO planning, joint exercises, etc.  This is because only the British and French have maintained their military expenditures at a level to maintain any level of readiness.  The French though have not been a part of NATO command structure since the 1960s, so they don't participate in a meaningful way right now.<br />Kagan is certainly more scholarly than Babbin in his delivery.  Babbin's book has the pacing and hyperbole of a speech being given to a company of Army Rangers.	2004-07-17

The central thesis of the book is that in the 1980s and 1990s there has been a cross-pollination of ideas between right wing extremist groups of the secular and Christian varieties and the ufologists.  He traces the history of the main themes in current conspiracy theories - e.g. the world is run by a secret cabal, variously, the Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderburgers, Masons, Jesuits, Jewish bankers, etc.<br />The negative reviews on Amazon are obviously conspiracists who spend their nights with Art Bell and George Noory.  There is a certain amount of &quot;Just because I am paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get me.&quot;  This stuff is pretty far fetched.  As Barkun says, the &quot;evidence&quot; is mostly sources cross-citing each other.<br />There are two problems in Barkun's book: 1. he is blind to the conspiracy theories that have been adopted from the right-wing, through the New Age movements, into the vestiges of the hard left-wing.  I don't know his political leanings, but most academics are socialists or Greens, which may explain the omission.  2. for all his subtle ridicule of right-wing apocalypses, he finishes the book with an over-the-top apocalyptic warning - that because conspiracy theories have passed into popular culture, it makes it more likely that it will lead to violence and social upheaval.	2004-03-29

This book introduces an additional element from the first book - what he calls the &quot;confrontation&quot;. It divides the second act into two halves.<br />Syd Field recommends using 3x5 cards with a sentence describing what happens - one card for each 2 pages of screenplay. It is a method that some people find limiting, others may find it liberating. It allows you to &quot;edit&quot; your movie by shuffling cards before you ever put a word of dialog onto paper.<br />The book is structured around writing each act in succession. The weakness is that he does not address in enough detail the editing process. This is probably because Syd Field writes from the perspective of a consumer of writing - that is, a reader of screenplays for a studio.<br />Editing is something that some successful writers know almost nothing about. Examples are Stephen King and Ray Bradbury. They have the genius to write in one draft.<br />Syd Field gets a lot of bad reviews on Amazon, because he focuses on the three act structure, turning on two plot points. Many would-be writers want to break the mold. Few movies that get made break with the structure (Pulp Fiction being everyone's favorite example of a movie not structured in three acts). Most movies are in three acts.	2004-03-06

Syd Field writes from the perspective of a reader who makes decisions to recommend movies to be made.  It would be foolish to totally dismiss his advice on structure just because a few movies were successful (e.g. Pulp Fiction) in flouting the 3 act structure turning on 2 plot points.  Read your Aristotle.  It is a tested formula for a dramatic structure that will help keep an audience's interest.<br />The difficulty that most people will have with Syd Field's writing is that he is not writing from the perspective of a writer, but of a consumer of writing.  He is not going to give you advice on how to invent your story - to express your soul - so to speak.  There are other texts you can use to help you put your thoughts on the page.<br />After reading this book, I would recommend reading his Screenwriter's Workbook.  It will flesh out the three act structure even further.<br />Note: You will need a style guide to help actually format your document correctly.	2004-03-06

I can recommend this book to almost all levels of student other than people who are really deconditioned and would not be able to do a Pilates routine safely. For those students, I would recommend a book of pre-Pilates exercises like \\"Body Control: Using Techniques Developed by Joseph H. Pilates\\" by Lynne Robinson.<br />The style of Pilates is NY. All exercises when supine are demonstrated with an imprinted spine. Within the Pilates world, there is debate about whether it is really necessary to do all supine work when the legs are in the air with an imprinted spine like Joe did. There have been some electro-myographic studies done which indicate that you take the proper coordination of the multifidous, psoas, and transversus abdominus out of the equation with an imprinted spine. It may be better in some exercises to get strong enough to do them safely with a neutral spine. This is a nit for instructors to pick, so don't let it get in the way of getting fit with Pilates.	2003-07-24

I can't say enough good things about the Pimsleur system in general.  It is all audio, so it is useful for commuters.  The repetition of the vocabulary is good.  The introduction of grammatical concepts is good, particularly for an all audio system.  The speakers are clear, although occasionally, I had to consult a book for spelling.  Only present, imperative, and infinitive verb forms are used in level I.  The focus is on 1st and 2nd person like all the Pimsleur tapes.<br />The problems I have found are: 1.  Hebrew is only available at Level I, so you will not learn enough to be functional even as a tourist.  2.  The course is good for learning syntax and grammar, but does not provide enough vocabulary.  Also, in the Hebrew course, some nif'al and hif'il forms are introduced as imperatives or infinitives, and it would have been nice to introduce the present (active participle) as well.  3.  The extensive use of imperatives, although grammatically correct, is not so colloquial in Israel, as I discovered living there.  Imperfect and infinitives are more common with the exception of a few verbs that are commonly used in the imperative form.  This course could give you the wrong impression about the use of the imperative.<br />Finally, Pimsleur costs too much!	2003-07-17

The 10 lessons are well structured.  They are divided into 2 parts which use a conversation to introduce new vocabulary and grammatical concepts.  There are group exercises to practice conversations and written exercises which test comprehension and develop grammar.<br />The grammar includes basic subjects like the nominal sentence, agreement in number and gender between noun and adjective, construct state, pronominal suffixes, key particles (yesh, `eyn, hineh, etc.), interrogatives, personal and demonstrative pronouns, use of the active participle for expressing present tense.  Level 1 finishes with the introduction to past tense with the qal perfect of a few verbs.  The system of Hebrew verbs is more fully developed in Level 2.  Level 3 is geared toward the written more than the spoken word.<br />The vocabulary of the text is practical for a school setting.  The vocabulary is not the typical vocabulary geared towards tourists or diplomats.  One feature I really appreciate is the inclusion of occasional loan words from English that are in use in current colloquial Hebrew.  The language is not so colloquial  that the paradigms in 2nd person plural have been leveled as is common in actual conversation.<br />The text is ktiv male except in the vocabulary lists and the paradigms.  By being written without vowel points and diacritics, it avoids the student becoming dependent on them.  Also, on the subject of the writing system, the text is one of the few that addresses one of my pet peaves with Hebrew textbooks.  It actually teaches how to write cursive!<br />Were I teaching a class in Modern Hebrew I would select this textbook.<br />This is a textbook for a young-adult or adult class, however, it can be used for self-study as long as the associated audio tapes are also purchased.	2003-04-10

S.R. Driver synthesized the available 19th century scholarship on Biblical Hebrew, most of it in German, and produced a clear, well organized exposition on the way tenses are expressed in Biblical Hebrew.<br />The primary focus is on the perfect, imperfect, and waw-consecutives, but also other issues of syntax are covered.  W. Randall Garr's lengthy introduction is an excellent tribute to S.R. Driver and updates the Treatise for more recent developments in the study of Biblical Hebrew grammar.<br />Disclaimer:  Randall Garr was my professor of Hebrew and Aramaic in college.	2003-04-02

Rather than elaborating on the issues already reviewed (lack of pu'al for example).  I have two big complaints that impact the usefulness of the book.<br />1.  A lay-flat binding!<br />2.  Ordering the pages following Hebrew convention (right to left) particularly in the index would be an improvement.<br />Other than these minor annoyances the book is a great resource for mastering the binyanim of the common forms.  One feature I do really like is that it gives the governing preposition of the verb.	2003-03-17

The book delivers exactly what is promised - a guide to the siddur.  It is by an orthodox rabbi and therefore does not conform necessarily to practices in other liberal movements in Judaism.  The translations, as noted by other reviewers, are excellent.<br />Other reviewers have commented on the minutae that bog down the book.  There is not necessarily a way to simplify such a complex subject.  I think the organization of the book is practical.	2003-03-17

It bridges the gap between a student grammar like Lambdin's Introduction to Biblical Hebrew and a reference grammar like Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (GKC).  The introductory material is very useful.  The introductory material includes a brief introduction to semitic languages in general, the history of the Hebrew language, the transmission of the canonical text and the masoretic tradition.<br />Linguistic jargon that will be encountered is well explained.  This is very useful for students of O.T. studies who are not usually schooled in linguistics.<br />The book is also well footnoted.  The footnotes may be used to get started on deeper research into particular features of grammar.<br />Overall, study of this book will help get the student of B.H. and O.T. over that hump from being competent to read and translate the basic narrative materials (Pentateuch, Joshua-2Kings, Ruth, Jonah) to tackling some of the more difficult translation issues in the canon.	2003-03-07

It makes a persuasive argument in favor of the superiority of militias organized from democratic societies.<br /><br />Hanson argues that the moral power of the three armies led by Epaminondas, a Theban, Sherman, a Union general in the American Civil War, and Patton, commanding the 3rd Army in Europe in WWII, was decisive in their ability to vanquish three slave states - Sparta, the Confederacy, and Nazi Germany.  The democratic militias were ideological warriors fighting for a cause.<br /><br />One of the particularly interesting features of Hanson's analysis was the fact that the democratic militias were able to demobilize so quickly.  Their generals were not leading armies of conquest with imperial designs.<br /><br />One problem with the book is that the sources Hanson used were narrow.  The works cited are small in number.<br /><br />The book is well written in a prose that is easy to read.  It does suffer from a couple of glaring mistakes that should have been caught by an editor.  But overall it is a very engaging book.	2003-01-30

This grammar is better organized, however it is very challenging for students, because the paradigms come fast and furious.  It also introduces a smaller vocabulary that is only relevant in translating narrative text.<br />A warning to those doing self-study: this is not useful for self study.  Not enough explanation is given for certain grammatical features in BH.	2003-01-30

The explanations are clear.  The use of watchpoints (common mistakes) in the text are good.  What it lacks are some of the core Pilates  exercises, and there are some exercises that are not Joe Pilates originals.  All the exercises in this book have value though.  They will prepare you for the full versions of more challenging exercises you will encounter in a class.<br />A book or video is no substitute for working with a certified instructor.  I have been practicing Pilates for more than  2 years and I have to say that it is the greatest exercise program ever invented.  However, you need to be taught the  correct movement by an instructor.  If not done correctly, there is a risk of injury in some exercises,and you will not  get the benefit from the exercise.	2001-03-30

After reading the meticulously footnooted book by Picknett and Prince, I am really disappointed by the lack of scholarship demonstrated by The Hiram Key.  I am certainly not a domain expert in the Egyptology, New Testament, Gnosticism, Early Christianity, nor Hermeticism, but I can tell when someone is blowing smoke and the lack of documentation for Knight and Lomas' hypotheses makes me very suspicious of their conclusions.<br />On the other hand, the book is a fun read, like supermarket tabloids.  The pacing is good and the conclusions they come to make you think.  I agree with another reviewer that the value of the book may be as a springboard for some more serious academic research.	2001-02-01

One of my favorite features is that words are sounded out back to front, which helps get past the swallowed endings that you get in natural speech.<br />The positive stuff said, the problem with this is that it is just a teaser for the full-blown Pimsleur courses that are really expensive.  At least Russian is available in levels 1-3.  By level 3 you are almost functional in the spoken language, able to express basic wants and desires, basic narrative, etc. Level 1 does not get you even to basic functionality as a tourist, so how is an abridged course going to do it?	2000-06-09

This book tries to get beyond the medical dissection model of anatomy and really get at the way the core postural muscles are supposed to coordinate movement.  The chapter on the psoas is worth the price of the book.<br />This IS NOT a  how-to on Rolfing nor does it get into the transformative powers of Rolfing  from the perspective of someone who is undergoing processing.  It is more a  book of anatomy and kinesiology.	2000-03-20
