His honest assessment of his life parallels with America's open wound- its treatment of African American men. Datcher begins his story the day he receives his birth certificate. He finds his father's information not present on the record, which becomes a strong metaphor for the way in which he chooses to live his life thereafter. He makes huge mistakes, isn't afraid to piss his readers off, and inevitably earns their respect. He discusses his position on unprotected sex, gang life, and abortion to name a few with a fresh and unabashed honesty.   As I turn the first pages of the book I root for him to win at something, anything.  Not only does he wins, but he wins big. He enrolls in UCLA, obtains his Ma sters Degree, and pens this National Bestseller.  <br /> <br />Usually I'm skeptical about  book club selections.  But I am so wrong in this case. This book is good to the last drop. It is concise and focused. It is a quick read and a good one. Datcher's use of dialogue seals its authenticity. I want to read more of his work. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to every women raising sons, every woman in a relationship with not only black men, but men of all nations, and I recommend this to authors who want to tell their life stories.  <br /> <br />Dee Y.

Haitian American sculptor, Ka creates a piece in honor of her father and what he endured during Dictator Franois Duvalier's torturous reign over Haiti. What she doesn't know is that her father was not a victim, but in fact a dew breaker-a Haitian torturer who because they usually came before dawn, \\"as the dew was settling on the leaves\\" to snatch their victims away from their homes in the name of Duvalier.  <br /> <br />One encounter after the other, Ka's father identity begins to unravel around him. Can he continue his new person as a Brooklyn barbershop owner or will the neighborhood find him out? Will his family forgive him? Can he forgive himself? <br /> <br />This book is so great, because it tells a chilling tale of physical and mental torture. We learn more about Haiti and the lives of Haitian immigrants in America. And their struggle to assimilate to a new culture and forget their past no matter how horrific it was.  <br /> <br />However, the novel was set   up more like a series of short stories instead of the traditional novel structure, which would have made the story greater as we felt a continuous peak and valley moving us to the most horrible moment of Ka's father's life.   I wanted to drop with him--experience his greatest fears come to pass in front of his eyes, watch each encounter rip away at him until he is at his worst. Simply put I wanted to ride this rollercoaster of fear with him and that didn't happen because Danticat made Ka the narrator of the story, which keeps you from understanding the inner struggle of her father.    Moreover, the pacing slowed the story down in places where it didn't need to be. <br /> <br />Dee Stewart <br />R.E.A.L. Reviewer <br />	2005-08-22

He fell in love quickly, married quickly and divorce quickly.  Nick was a lover of women and money.  Nick had the perfect plan to get his hands on lots of money to start his own practice.  Unfortunately, Willie paid the price for Nick's greed.  Once Willie got out of jail, Nick had the `perfect' plan to keep them both in money for a long time. <br /> <br />When I started reading this book, the first couple of chapters disturbed me.  I thought to myself, \\"This can not be a Christian fiction book.\\"   As I continued reading, I saw where the author was taking the book.  I still don't think I would have labeled this Christian fiction, but you be the judge. <br /> <br />Read how Nick and Willie deal with sexual perversion, greed, jealousy and death in this thought provoking, drama filled story.  Many may not see Author Rolyat vision as this being a Christian book, but there are many lessons learned and messages in the book.

Tanya Black abhors her husband Curtis.  Everything he now stands for disgusts her. Regardless of Curtis' very powerful position as the head pastor of a prominent black Chicago church, Tanya can't stand the sight of him and starts to think about not only ending their relationship, but also Curtis' tenure as senior pastor, since Curtis had to maintain his marriage in order to keep his position at the church. <br /> <br />This novel begins promising, but lets down by the end of the first chapter. Her character's actions are unbelievable from page one. The notion that any church would confine marriage to a job requirement is prosperous.  Casting the First Stone not only throws stones at organized black religion, but at Christ's purpose for marriage. <br /> <br />Moreover, Roby's writing style is bland and contrived and never address the real questions she presents.  Why in the world does Tanya Black continue to live in this dead marriage never comes to full view. If there is a Christian message it is clouded by clich plot points and clich characters. It's just once escapade after another the story cheapens into a tawdry soap opera with a church setting.  <br /> <br />For those whose guilty pleasure is reading super dramas; then this book is for you. But if you're looking for a book that will help you understand how your romantic relationship relates to your spiritual relationship with God, pass.  <br /> <br />Dee Stewart <br />R.E.A.L.

Many people often misquote this particular bible verse,\\" the love of money is the root of evil\\" by saying instead that money is the root of all evil. In \\"A Dollar\\", the authors allow the readers a peek into the chaos that greed and love of money create using three different short stories with diverse scenarios. <br /> <br />I thought the first short-story \\"Easy Street\\" was farfetched. Nevertheless, I did finish it but I have read better. In this story, Katrice is trying to hold on to the apartment house left to her by her father. However, she has a \\"do-wrong\\" man who loses money gambling on a regular basis. Fortunately, one of the residents, Paul, hits the lotto. But will he be willing to help out Katrice? More importantly, neither Paul nor Katrice expected the other residents to decide that Paul doesn't deserve the money. And one last twist, did Paul actually win the lotto or is he scamming? <br /> <br />In the second story, the main character in \\"Ghetto Fabulous\\" is just taking it one day at a time. She is real and tells her story with brutal honesty. She makes you sympathetic to how life just sometimes \\"happens\\". When she hits the lotto, the folks come out of the woodwork. Funny how your friends increase when you have money. And suddenly no one cares that yesterday you were a single mother trying to survive in the ghetto. <br /> <br />Finally, in \\"One Night, Six Dreams\\", again the storyline pushed the limit on realism. One person was designated to purchase the tickets for the $180 million jackpot. However, when their numbers fall, the celebration is a little premature because brother man decides to take the money all for him self. So begins a tale of how greed can make people do things they would never have dreamt: like murder.  <br /> <br />Altogether \\"A Dollar and a Dream\\" was a quick, enjoyable read. The title is a good analogy for the mantra of the main characters. <br /> <br />Leanna <br />R.E.A.L. Reviewer <br />	2005-08-22

Jalisha, who turned her first trick at the tender age of 11, appeared to be headed in her family's destructive path until love and grace stepped in her path.  With her man by her side and a new career looming before her, Jalisha must make some choices. Will she live the \\"right\\" way (i.e., make money in a legitimate fashion)? Can love conquer all, or are we all doomed to be cursed down to the 4th and 5th generation for our ancestors' faults?<br /><br />Tilles wrote this story with the loving care of an author concerned about the African American community. Without beating on the reader's head, she drives home her message of redemption. I gave the book the above rating for its simplicity.  The ending was wrapped up just a little too easily.

Maia Ransom, a Michigan nurse, travels to St. Croix  to await her eventual death, and to learn more about her grandfather's people.  When she arrives she finds her grandfather's estate, Wisdom, in shambles and occupied by Severin \\"Seven\\" Johanssen, the ill and alcoholic son of the last owner. Instead of taking care of herself, however, she becomes Seven's nursemaid despite the fact that he resents her presence on the island. But Seven isn't the only one out to sabotage Maia--most of the town wants her kind off their island.  Yet, she unexpectedly falls for Attorney Noah Langston, who gives her reason to continue her soul's journey.   <br /> <br />I wanted to give Neff a higher rating for this book, because she creates this wonderful dreamy atmosphere that is conveyed through the entire novel. It's beyond romantic. It's captivating. The way she personifies St. Croix's landscape and Wisdom draws her readers not only into the plot of the story, but into the undertones, metaphors, and themes that rides under the surface of the novel. She whispers her message of self-discovery and self worth in every scene, then brings it to the forefront in the novels last lines. The book reminds me of  EVE'S BAYOU and THE SCARLETT LETTER because of its delicate poetic prose.  <br /> <br />However, she falls short of making WISDOM the classic that it aspires to be.  There are too many characters, which makes it hard to fully develop. I can't understand why Maia so easily accepts her diagnosis when she is a nurse in the first place. At the climax of the novel, the slow pace keeps the story from rising to its highest peak. Moreover, the violent scene between Noah, Severin, Juan, Carlos and Noah's near the conclusion of the novel is unclear and hard to visualize.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone who love far away places, is interested in Caribbean culture and has a poetic vibe. WISDOM is a fascinating read. <br /> <br />Dee Stewart <br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers <br /> <br />	2005-08-22

The story begins with an investigation into a horrific attack on a science team in Rio de Janeiro. This scene prepares you for the wild ride filled with hot scenes, battles between good and evil and deals made with the forces of Heaven and Earth. <br />  <br />In the third installment of the Vampire Huntress series Damali Richards returns from her battle in hell, in despair over the lost of her soul mate and Vampire love Carlos Rivera. Her Neturu senses(the special powers that make Damali the ultimate Vampire Huntress)are weak and her heart is breaking. Unknown to Damali,Carlos survives and is brought back to life by the forces of good represented by Knights of Templar, a group of holy soldiers of various faith that have been chosen to devote their life to the ultimate fight against good and evil. Their passion for each other is flared almost immediately taking both lovers on a erotic ride neither of them can resist. Their love and lust is intense but there is a price. Damali is forced to see the reality of Carlos's world. Their love is pure, but the reality of the Darkness that comes with Carlos, a power master Vampire, hits Damali where it hurts the most, her heart.  The reality that their love may not be enough to fight the darkness and draw of the Vampire lifestyle is a hard one for Damali to swallow. <br />  <br />While Dealing with the realities of love and darkness, Damali and Carlos must also face a new villain. This time around, they encounter a strong female with a scent that drives Carlos crazy anda history that connects her to Damali and her team. Their newest foe is determined to hunt and destroy Damali and claim Carlos for her own. The final battle occurs in Rio, the location of the massacre that captures you at the beginning of the book. <br />  <br />The Hunted will not disappoint those that have been following the Vampire Huntress series. Though not as erotic as The Awakening,the second book in the series, you are still provided with more than enough intensely hot moments to get the juices flowing and the blood boiling. Banks continues to develop Damali & Carlos' characters. As they mature in age their super-natural powers increases, the decisions they make become harder and the stakes become higher. We can all relate to their struggle as age and knowledge force them to make the hard decisions that will affect their lives forever. They both struggle to find their place in a world filled with forces that only want to bring them down. <br />   <br />I personally have enjoyed the entire Vampire Huntress Series.  These books are fast pace reads filled with characters we can all relate to. Damali, Carlos, and the Guardians (Damali's team of vampire hunters whose ultimate goal is to protect the) are real people that were taken from their normal lives and put into extraordinary circumstances by forces beyond their control. They feel like real every day people that you could meet on the street. The Hunted feels like a natural progression in a story of ordinary people living extraordinary lives.  Though this book can stand alone I do suggest that anyone interested in the Vampire Huntress experience start at the beginning. You need to read the entire story to completely understand and relate to these characters and the drive that keeps them going throughout this book. <br />   <br />Dee-Dee <br />R.E.A.L.

Michael was never really taught the meaning of true love.  As a child, her only source of true unconditional love was her father Sergio.  Colleen, Michael's mother was a self-absorbed woman who in polite circles would be considered eccentric and a bit crazy.  She spent most of her marriage and Michael's childhood seeking constant attention from her husband and perfection that can only be found on a movie screen.  Colleen's constant nagging and need for perfection eventually drove her husband away from the entire family leaving Michael alone to seek the love she craved but could never find in a dysfunctional household.   <br /> <br />Michael is introduced to sex at a young age by a scene she secretly witnessed between her babysitter and the babysitter's boyfriend.  She carries away from this event the belief that you can give sexy and receive love in return.  It is this belief that takes her through puberty, straight to an adulthood filled promiscuity, shaky friendships, and bad decisions.  Michael's pattern of bad decision-making eventually leads her to Eddie, the first man to seemingly know and understand her.  It is in her relationship with Eddie that we see how far Michael is willing to go in her search for the love she craves. <br /> <br />Crave is the tragic but classic story of a woman seeking love in all the wrong places.  However, Darnella Ford has made her version of this classic story stand out from the rest.  Ford's writing flows like poetry, drawing you into the story from page one.  She takes you into the inner thoughts of our heroine, making Michael real by allowing her to tell this story in her own unique fashion.  Ford also creates a strong cast of supporting characters but keeps them in line with the story by allowing Michael to explain their importance in the story of her life. <br /> <br />I could not put Crave down.  Michael and her search for a love and acceptance captured me from the very beginning.  I understood her loneliness for in my own way I have been there.  I felt her pain and confusion because I could relate it to my own experiences.  I recommend this book to anyone seeking quality writing and a story that touches emotional strings. <br /> <br />Dee-Dee <br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers <br />	2004-11-07

Banks' second novel in her Vampire Huntress series, the Awakening seems more like a hodgepodge of current vampire flicks than an original piece of work.  <br /> <br />Carlos Rivera, the master vampire awakens in the sixth realm of Hell, to find himself before the Vampire Council. While there the council assigns him the task to bring Damali, the vampire slayer, to the underworld and impregnate her on her twenty-first birthday. After all, she is the millennium Neteru who apparently has supernatural powers that involves her ability to produce day-walkers, vampires that can live in sunlight. If these forms of vampires are born into the world, then they can ultimately destroy the human race. Fallon Nuit, another more evil vampire desires Damali for himself, because he sees Damali's genetic abilities as a means to further his rank among the council. However, both Fallon and Carlos forget to realize that Damali and Carlos relationship is far from over and that Damali has a team of angels on her side. Her band- the Guardians, sole purpose is to slay vampires and the Blue Knights Templars were created to defend and protect Damali. With all these forces on Damali's side, will it be enough to keep her away from Carlos' lure? Will Carlos break his allegiance to his soul's proprietors to save the woman who is lord over his heart? Will the world be saved?  <br /> <br />The first time I read a book from this series, I applauded it. I thought the subject was fresh and anticipated a sequel, as I am a big fan of Anne Rice and Brams Stoker. However, after reading all three novels in the series and after much reflection my view of this author's work has changed. Although Banks has a talented writing ability her characters, plot, theme and conflict are trite and unoriginal. Damali's character is a black \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" with the genetic makeup of the Underworld's Selena, the death dealer. Carlos's predestined love match resembles that of Angel and the vulnerabilityof Michael's (both characters of which were love interests to the vampire heroines in \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Underworld\\", respectively). Banks also rips off chunks of \\"Blade,\\" \\"Aliens,\\" \\"the Matrix,\\" Queen of the Damned and Interview with a Vampire to name a few. I really wanted Banks to do something that these books lacked not just throw black characters in the mix and rewrite Romeo and Juliet. I would like to know more about the relationship between Puerto Rican and other Latino immigrants and Vampires that she has presented in this series, to discuss why vampires are sensual creatures and how it affects their outcomes and how it advances the plot. <br /> <br />I think this story is good for paranormal romance beginners, because the activities that go on are trendy and familiar. But for underworld and horror enthusiasts, stick with Anne Rice and Stephen King until Banks fourth novel, The Bitten comes out. Hopefully, her next book will have more of Bank's signature to it, whatever that is.  <br /> <br />Dee Stewart <br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers <br />	2004-11-07

Aisha Ford's Christian fiction novel, FLIPPIN' THE SCRIPT, chronicles the exploits of a young woman who does just that-she makes a resolution that could ruin her life. Sabrina Bradley, production assistant for the Daily Dose, the Midwest's hottest daytime talk show needs a well do makeover. Her boss-Daily Dose host, Darci Oliver has changed Sabrina's job responsibilities from supporting the producers to running personal errands for her. If Sabrina didn't have to pick up Darci's laundry, call Darci's caterer, rake the leaves out of Darci's yard and give Darci better show ideas, then Sabrina could make her much needed hair appointments, attend bible study, hock her engagement ring and do her real job. <br /> <br />She doesn't have the time to do any of it, not even time to build a new relationship with the Daily Dose producer, Avery Benjamin. But Sabrina shouldn't get her hopes up for Avery anyway, since Darci is his ex-girlfriend.  <br /> <br />Then a window of opportunity opens for Sabrina. Darci and the producers of the show ask her to join their normally closed production meeting. When she's asked to produce a segment on whether people keep their New Year's resolutions, she jumps at the chance. There's only one hitch. To win her promotion, she has to keep all her resolutions---one of which is not falling in love. If she doesn't comply, not only will she lose the promotion; she will lose her job.   <br /> <br />Sabrina needs her faith more than ever to make the right decision and stay focused. Yet, Avery's friendship grows stronger every day. His commitment to God, his job and to Sabrina makes him more irresistible and worth the sacrifice. Will she keep all her resolutions?  Will she miss God's message for her life in the process? <br /> <br />Aisha builds a compelling novel that exposes us to the life of contemporary single and married Christians. We see how they must juggle their faith with theirown personal and professional aspirations. We also see what God has to say about true romance and faith.

Out of a thirst for love Seta stumbles down a few wrong turns that may cost her a future she has worked hard to obtain. <br /> <br />I rate novels on a five point criteria: plot, character, resolution, style, and conflict. Plot- .5 points. There was a beginning, middle, and end, but this book didn't really begin until Chapter Sixteen. The first chapters were character background and should have been left out and put in throughout the book in a more subtle way. Character-.5 points. All the characters were underdeveloped. Resolution-.5 points. The only thing I liked about this book was that Seta had to fix her own mess. Kudos to Carter for that! Conclusion-.5 points. Epilogues are indicators that the author didn't really work through plotting. Everything should have wrapped up in the conclusion. Style- 0 points. Too much showing; not enough telling. The book read like a synopsis not a novel. Overall 2 pens. <br /> <br />I commend Carter at trying to tackle paternity neglect as an issue. However, I hope that she takes the time to build a solid story that will make the reader think about this issue longer instead of glossing over it or not reading the book at all. <br />Dee Stewart <br />R.E.A.L.

She wears her hair natural, as most of Mr. Dickey's characters, and she exercises and takes care of her body.  She knows what she wants in life and does not waste her time with ANY man that does not measure up.  However, Frankie is going through the desert as far as romance goes and is feeling pretty hard up and desperate.  No disrespect to the Internet lovers, she wants to meet someone special so bad that she sets up blind dates on the Internet.  Her descriptions and reactions to her dates are humorous to say the least. Some readers might say that Frankie is cold but, in reality, she just keeps it real.  Moreover, she speaks plainly with everyone, including her two younger sisters: Livvy and Tommy. <br />  <br />Livvy is the middle sister.  She is not the typical middle child.  You know the one that feels left out and the black sheep of the family.  Nonetheless, she is the only one that is married but she has discovered that her husband is cheating.  Livvy's story centers on how she handles her hurt and decides the fate of her marriage.  Livvy confides in Tommy, the youngest sister, much more than Frankie.  As I said, Frankie keeps it real.  I have to admit that Livvy's story reminded me of \\"The Other Woman.\\"  You'll have to read this book to see if you would agree. <br />  <br />Tommy is the youngest sister.  Although the reader finds out later that she is not actually related by blood to Livvy and Frankie, they treat her no different.  Tommy lives in one of Frankie's rental properties.  She is definitely the bohemian of the family.  She wears her hair in a big Afro and dresses like a bohemian.  Tommy is gorgeous but has not accepted her external and internal beauty.  Tommy is on the rebound from an abusive relationship that she hid from her family.  It has been more than a little while since Tommy last was involved with a man.  However, her neighbor is starting to look very good.  There is just one problem:  he is about 10 years older, divorced and raising a four-year old daughter.  What will Livvy and Frankie think of him? <br />   <br />I enjoyed this book immensely.  The characters are strong, black women who are living and learning day by day in beautiful L.A. In my humble opinion, this novel, \\"Naughty  or  Nice,\\" was definitely better than Mr. Dickey's last novel, \\"The Other Woman.\\"  Part of my reasoning is that in \\"Naughty,\\" the characters are more real and the plot is not so far-fetched.  Anyway, I really liked all of the characters in \\"Naughty.\\"  I enjoyed reading about sisters that are there for one another and not backbiting. <br />  <br />Leanna <br />R.E.A.L.

Harper is tries to keep his distance from Ava because old feelings are starting to surface. <br />  <br />Flossie was always known as the area matchmaker.  Could this be her last effort to get two people that are perfect for each other together? <br />  <br />Reon Laudat's story of love is funny, sexy and enjoyable.

It was a majestic house on a hill with twenty-one long steep steps leading up to its door. The `good house' was the only house left standing on Walnut Lane after a \\"river of mud\\" destroyed the others in June of 1929. Marie Toussaint was sole owner of the `good house' then. How did a voodoo priestess from Louisiana that came to Mr. Goode seeking work come to be the owner of his house? I'm not telling . . .but it's an interesting story indeed. Marie had attended a training school for nursing in Florida. She had also nursed animals back to health after the mudslide; perhaps this is what lead to three men bringing Maddie, a sick teenage girl, to her door on July 4, 1929. BUT . . . there was much more to this girl than the appearance of an epileptic seizure. Marie could tell from the stench, which seems only she could smell. Trouble . . . evil in the form of flesh was now inside her home. <br />  <br />Many years later, Angela (Marie's granddaughter) and her son Cory have come to Sacajawea to spend yet another summer in Gramma Marie's house. However, Cory's dad, Tariq had shown up two weeks ago and Angela decided to give their marriage one last chance. Now on July 4, 2001 has this same evil that Marie once had to deal with come to vex Angela Toussaint? Angela experiences a terrible tragedy and a great loss on this day. <br />  <br />Two years elapsed and Angela is considering selling the `good house.' Her client Naomi Price convinces her to return to her Sacajawea to the house one last time before she sells it. Naomi fears Angela may be making a mistake, by selling the house she once loved. Naomi even offers to go with her and to Angela's surprise, she does. Was this a good idea, returning to Sacajawea, to the `good house'? I'm not telling. Read it and find out, you just may be glad you did. <br />  <br/>The Good House by Tananarive Due is by far the best book I've read by this author. It starts off quite interesting. The Good House is an enthralling thriller. Toward the end, it even has a bit of \\"gotcha\\" for us horror fans. Due did a wonderful job of weaving this `tale,' answering the questions I had from previous chapters . . . In a way, you get a chance to see the story from two views. The story . . . is the `good house' bad, is Angela's family cursed or has someone awakened the evil Marie Toussaint once fought . . . is a good read. The end however, was a little disappointing for me. I prefer a solid end with closure. BUT I know you will get what the end hints . . . cause I did. I would definitely recommend The Good House for those that enjoy suspense, thrillers, horror or just a good story . . . as long as you're not `fearful.' ;o) <br /> <br />Felicia <br />R.E.A.L.

Appropriately labeled as \\"chick lit,\\" Lori Bryant-Woolridge's Hitts & Mrs. is a suspenseful romance of sorts spread out over nearly 400 pages of a grainy plot and inconsistencies. This is a topsy turvy story of Melanie Hitts coming to realize that love doesn't have to suffocate her budding career. Of course, the story wouldn't be complete without Melanie juggling two love interests; the man she is in love with and thinks is her soul-mate, Will Freedman, and the unconventional older man of a different hue whom teaches her how to love, John Carlson. John is married to Sharon Carlson, which makes for a tense situation in the book. Will Melanie and John get caught in their non-physical, but intimate affair? This question alone is what may keep readers struggling to the end of the book. <br />  <br />The true suspense and drama of the plot lies in Candace Bennett, Melanie's best friend and wild child/vixen of the novel. Woolridge's scenes depicting Candace's 'love scenes' with various men are Zane worthy when it comes to how graphic they are. Candace's rags to riches transformation to a hot shot lawyer are also intriguing when it ties into her views on relationships. <br />  <br />The main thing that kept me frustrated with this book was how Woolridge left things hanging when it came to Candace. The story of Melanie ultimately \\"coming to her senses\\" concerning her love of Will appeared to be stretched out with meaningless filler of the daily grind of Melanie's career as though Woolridge were trying to make a page quota. I'm not a lover of romance novels which may play a role in my feelings toward this story, but if you're a reader who loves tales of \\"enchanted love\\" with a little character development thrown in, you just might find yourself enjoying this book more than I did. <br />  <br />Anna <br />R.E.A.L.

If you are a  Christian woman and you want to find a good read that nurtures your soul, this book is for you. <br />  <br />So why did I give it a four rating? Although the story is sweet and the characters well thought out, there are some pacing problems in the book that slows the reader down. Bellamy has some basic style challenges: point of view shifts, time change, character generalizations and plot points that the normal reader wouldn't see. But would feel when he/she says,   \\"let me read that again\\" or \\"Did I read that right?\\" More than likely these minor glitches would be cleared by the time the book is re-released through BET Books this summer. <br />  <br />Nonetheless, Bellamy is an author to watch in the future with two more books following this one, and she promises to keep the good men coming. <br />  <br />Dee Y.

Mother and daughter, Miriam and Aya have a strained relationship. On one hand, Miriam tries to protect her daughter by refusing to discuss Aya's father to her, but on the other, by not discussing the love of her life, Miriam in effect withdrawals from Aya.

Colin Channer's Satisfy My Soul is the story of two <br />lovers, Carey McCollugh and Frances Carey, who just <br />can't seem to get it right. Told from the perspective <br />of Carey, this novel explores the intricate ways of <br />life, especially love and spirituality, for those of <br />African Caribbean descent. No tradition or food is <br />left out as the reader is given the tragic story of <br />Carey and Frances trying to find their path to love <br />via obstacles like religion, African heritage/roots, <br />and other minor personality clashes that come along <br />the way. <br />  <br />From their onset, Carey and Frances are anything but <br />simple characters. However, they are equals to each <br />other when it comes to the arena of \\"lovin' 'em and <br />leavin' 'em,\\" when it comes to how they've treated <br />their previous partners. Like many couples, the <br />subject of religion serves as a touchy issue for them, <br />but by the end of the novel, none of that matters. <br />Kwabena, Carey's best friend, proves to be a major part <br />of the climatic ending, which ironically, is the <br />source of Carey's introspective outlook throughout the <br />novel. <br />  <br />As a woman of African descent living in America, there <br />were various aspects of the book that I could relate <br />to. After all, love is suppose to be a universal <br />subject, but some of the Caribbean slang was difficult <br />for me to translate for a true understanding of some <br />of the \\"inside jokes\\" that were depicted on the pages. <br />I would recommend this work of fiction to any reader <br />looking for an in-depth, poetic novel on <br />Afro-Caribbean love. If you're a die hard romance <br />fanatic, this book will more than appease you due to <br />numerous graphic love scenes. <br />  <br />  <br />Anna <br />R.E.A.L.

Rashaun, a high powered defense attorney, is fighting one of the biggest cases of his career. He's also in the fight of his love life because his ex-girlfriend, Yvonne, is the prosecuting attorney in the major case and determined to win him back at all costs. Andria is trying her best to fight off a shady old lover, Paul, who is using every conceivable venue to gain back the love of the beautiful social worker. The whole idea and definition of \\"black funk\\" is something crucial to the storyline that the reader must discover for his or herself. Without giving away the plot, Rashaun is trying desperately to save his best friend from a long prison sentence for taking part in \\"black funk.\\" <br />  <br />Presley does a good job of differentiating between the numerous characters that make up \\"Black Funk.\\" The grammar errors were annoying at times, but Presley's socially conscious message at various points in the novel often overshadowed those glitches in the story, hence my rating.

Now pile on top of that the fact that Maren Emory and her brother, Ellison, lose their semi-famous, local talk show host mother on a tragic night. Before the kids have a chance to let their heads stop spinning, they must leave the only home they've ever known in bustling Chicago to live with their very distant father in friendly, but quaint Durham, North Carolina. The tables turn unexpectedly in the all important world of high school for the brother and sister. How the youngster's manage to \\"tough it out\\" in their new loveless home makes for thought provoking reading. <br />  <br />Though the ending is a bit predictable, this book has a way of keeping you just interested enough to see if your hypothesis is correct. If that doesn't get you, trying to keep up with the various changes back and forth from first to third person will keep you turning the pages; hence, my rating. I would recommend this book to any mature reader who enjoys novels focused on families. <br /> <br />Anna <br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers <br /> <br />	2004-10-23

Beemo gets into a situation that Lela tries to talk him through until it is evident that he just can't see the error of his ways. <br />  <br />Ms. Dulaney writes this book as if it is a diary.  I feel in some parts of the book you have to guess about what went on because there is such a lapse in dated time.  This book also seems loosely based on an R. Kelly experience.

I picked it up and put it back down several times before I made it to the end.  The opening of the book was offensive because I did not understand the author's purpose initially.  Mrs. Conger has essentially written a brief autobiography and I believe had I approached the book with this understanding that perhaps it would have been a more pleasurable reading. <br />  <br />Mrs. Conger tells about her search for identity, not just as a woman, or a black female, but as a black female American.  Unfortunately, at the beginning of her journey she reviews her upbringing in a condescending manner.  Although I believe she is telling her story by describing her childhood from her perspective and did not intend to offend, I found it insulting.  Nevertheless, after reading the book in its entirety, her biased perspective, I realized, was part of her journey and education about life in America.  Her parents were industrious, self-sufficient people who believed in working hard.  The author ate home - grown vegetables and meat, never processed, and wore homespun garments.  Her parents did not raise her to see color with good manners and grammar and consequently, according to her, other blacks ostracized her for not acting \\"black\\".  She, due to this mentality, found it easier to befriend whites and to accept their racist slurs versus trying to find acceptance among blacks.  Because, when she did try to befriend blacks, she found herself doing drugs, engaging in promiscuous sex and sacrificing education.  Again, I found this recollection disturbing, as I believed that she was stereotyping blacks.   As a side bar, the author also provides information on her struggles with marriage, love and general relationships that cause me, the reader, to again question the author's purpose. <br />  <br />Nevertheless, once Mrs. Conger completed the rite of passage to adulthood, self-acceptance and literal freedom from the oppression ofothers' opinions, I understood her.  Throughout the course of the plot, she interjects other persons reasoning for rejecting the label of African-American, which caused me to ask \\"what's your thought on this?\\"  By the end of the book, she finally gives her own reasoning and supports it with personal experiences.  Furthermore, in conclusion, she explains her purpose:  \\"this is one woman talking about her feelings without interruption\\".    Personally, I feel she attempted too much with this book: addressing a complicated topic and telling her story.  Each could easily support its own book. Nevertheless, if you are interested in autobiographies and journeys of self-discovery and acceptance, you may enjoy this book.  However, for me, two separate books would have better served the author's purpose. <br />  <br />  <br />Leanna <br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers <br /> <br />	2004-10-23

Our book opens with Demeter Pickens visiting her doctor for assistance with sorting out her fantasies and real life.  It all began when Demeter took a class to combat stress through lucid dreaming.  In a lucid dream, the fantasist is in control of the imaginings.  Demeter dreams up Marcellus Angelell; he is all she could hope for and more.  Marcellus is handsome, rich and considerate.  Marcellus is also a better lover than anyone could even conjure up in a dream.  They meet, marry and have two children; unfortunately, it is all too good to be true, right? <br />  <br />Conversely, what happens when Demeter begins to spend more time in her dream world than the real?  Each time she enters her fantasy she comes back to find that she has missed days, months and even years out of her real life.  How can she dream walk through life?  Moreover, she is beginning to feel pain, cold, and heat in her dreams and she is no longer in control.  Didi, Demeter's nickname, wants to stay to avoid her hum, drum, and stressful life. On the other hand, how can she just walk away from her sons, family and friends?  More importantly, is she losing her mind? <br />  <br />Imaginary Playmate is definitely sci-fi, which, in my humble opinion is a new genre for African-Americans writers.  However, maybe because I am not generally a sci-fi reader, I found the book confusing.  I spent a lot time trying to figure out what was happening; perhaps this was the author's intention.  Moreover, the book contained technical jargon (astronomy, Karma and physics) that I do not believe even avid readers will find familiar.  This book would also require an `R' rating for sexual content. I have to further warn, that the sexuality reads more like soft porn than romance, which some could find offensive.  Fortunately, Ms. Breaux offers a reader's companion at the end, which clarifies the plot.  Personally, I found this a hard book to finish, although a sci-fi buff may find Imaginary Playmate a winner. <br />  <br />Leanna <br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers <br />	2004-10-23

He saves Shanelle again when Alex's rookie cop falls in love with Shanelle and is willing to do anything and everything for her, even put her through school.

Secondly, it was not my intention to male bash in this review, despite the vernacular I may have utilized.  Finally, the views expressed in this writing do not necessary represent the opinions of R.E.A.L. Reviewers or any of their affiliates. Whew, that's done, let us get down to business.  <br />  <br />First, I read this book and inferred that a man had to write this novel.  The main character is a black American male that is discovering the \\"joys\\" of manhood and all the rights and responsibilities associated with this rite of passage.  Although the author never gives a thorough description of the main character, Davis Virginia, one can deduce, based on the story, he must be God's gift to humanity and women in general.  Essentially, the entire plot centers on Davis's freshman experiences at a Historically Black University (HBCU): Clark-Atlanta. <br />  <br />Surprisingly, given Davis's animal magnetism, he managed to make it through high school without one serious girlfriend and his virginity in tact; according to him, it is because sports and academics take most of his attention.  However, all that quickly changes when he arrives at the university.  He not only manages to attract the attention of three very beautiful, successful and intelligent women, with little effort, but also breaks their hearts and leads each of them through a personal crisis.  Each woman thanks Davis by the end of the book and forgives him of his philandering ways.  Davis also learns a valuable lesson:  do not engage in sex until after the love.  However, his journey to this \\"epiphany\\" is a bit much.  Oh yeah, I forgot one thing, his straight `A's his first year come easy to Davis. <br />  <br />I will admit that perhaps I am a cynic and a bit jaded but I do not believe that this in anyway influenced this review.  Willingly, I give props to the author for acknowledging the beauty and diversity of the black woman.  I will even go so far as to say that Davis could almost be a positive role model for some young men out there.  Likewise, a male audience would probably appreciate this novel; Davis is living a lot of men's dream, but sisters may find this character a bit hard to swallow.  Did I mention that despite being a virgin, he is able to rock the other women's world?  Okay, enough, just in case I failed miserably, this review was written a little tongue in cheek!  <br /> <br />Leanna <br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers <br /> <br />	2004-10-23

He almost has this love/hate relationship with Mookie where he resents and admires his talents.  It seems that J.C. is always living in Mookie's shadow.   <br />The premise of 47th Street back is worthy of a book. Mr. Ojikutu intersperses the history of the 1960's through out the plot.  It seems to me that the story could have been shorter and there were times that it was difficult to keep reading; the story-line did not hold my attention after a certain point. Also, sometimes the dialect makes it hard to follow. Perhaps this would be a more interesting read for men and/or women who enjoy reading about murder, drugs, chauvinism and the mafia.

Rhodes takes great detail to write a historical sketch on the lives of three generations of Voodoo Queens; Grandmere`, Maman, and finally Marie. All three women are named Marie, but the most revered of them is the last one born. The money hungry and foul tempered John and Marie's sweetheart of a husband, Jacque, serve as love interests to add an interesting twist to the storyline once Marie answers the call of Damballah, the ultimate god in the African spirit world who would only possess the body of a voodoo priestess. Characters like Ziti, Nattie, Bridgette, Louis and Ribauld add spice to the mix of the story line as the reader delves into Marie's life story from childhood to the end of her long &quot;career&quot; as a spiritual healer/vessel for African spirits.<BR> <BR>Though the book may appear daunting in length, once I opened up the book, Rhodes weaved a spell on me from start to finish by making me wonder where the history ended and where the fiction began in this book. There are so many mysteries surrounding Marie Laveau's life that I was pleased to have a few questions answered and simultaneously be schooled on some of the history of the religion brought over from the African American homeland. Was/is voodoo just a way for blacks to make money by praying on the hopes of those who believed in voodoo's &quot;dark powers&quot; during a time period when job opportunities were scarce for freed blacks in the late 19th century? Exactly how long did Marie live? These were just a few of the questions that I wanted answered when I picked up this book ... and in the true nature of this mysterious religion, I was given just enough information to whet my appetite as I flipped from page to page looking for more answers.<BR> <BR>I would recommend this book to anyone who is asenthralled as I am with the history of the city full of spirits, mysteries, and an American history that could rival the Egyptian hieroglyphics in its complexity. Looking for more than just a good book to read at the beach? Pick this one up. Faint of heart or a scaredy cat of this highly notorious religion? Read the book anyway. You just might be surprised at how much fear can be dispelled by learning what the &quot;unknown&quot; is all about.<BR> <BR>Anna<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-03-05

This is the most complex and compelling book I have ever read. Lolita Files introduces us to three generations of the Boten family. <BR>  <BR>Because of the complexity of this story, it is difficult to give a synopsis. This is like a modern day Hamlet. The issues addressed in the book are incest, homosexuality, suicide, drug addiction, voodoo and more! The Boten family is considered to be the &quot;crazy family&quot; and torment follows this family from Tennessee all the way to Detroit. The stories of Grace, Walter, Sukie, Ophelia, Polo, Coolie, and Lay, will keep you engrossed and turning the pages. <BR>  <BR>'Child of God' is nothing like her previous works. Lolita Files really shows her talent for the written word with this book. With so many main characters and their lives intertwining the way they do, Lolita did an amazing job with this one. I hope to see more of her talent come through like this in the future. <BR>  <BR>Tina <BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewer	2004-03-05

White Girl tells the story of Charlotte and Milo: their romance, love and downfall.  Charlotte and Milo meet up initially at a college on the East Coast. What is special about Charlotte and Milo, depending on how one looks at it, is that Charlotte is a &quot;white girl&quot; and Milo is an African-American male.<br />Milo has grown up in a &quot;white world&quot;.  He grows up in New Hampshire to parents that are highly educated and &quot;refined&quot; in every sense of the word.  Milo is a ski buff and goes on to win gold medals at two Olympics in skiing.  Milo has always been around predominately<BR>whites and was once told by an African-American woman that he wasn't &quot;black&quot; enough.<br />Charlotte is the antithesis to Milo.  She grew up in a family that was dysfunctional in every sense of the word.  While Milo has lived a charmed life, Charlotte has always struggled with having goals and being accepted.  Charlotte is a &quot;raving&quot; beauty that eventually finds her calling in modeling.<br />Eventually Charlotte and Milo meet up after college and fall in love.  They marry and have a daughter and appear to live a &quot;perfect&quot; life.  However, on top of the usual struggles inherent in any relationship, Charlotte and Milo have to deal with prejudices and paradigms that American society has created for not only African-Americans, but for beautiful, white blonds as well.<br />I found this book interesting.  My immediate question was about the ethnicity of the author.  Was she writing from personal experience as a Black woman or white?  Ms. Manning wrote from Charlotte's point of view a lot and didn't allow the reader to &quot;see&quot; a lot of Milo's thoughts and give him an opportunity to explain his actions.  The ending leaves the reader wondering how it all ends.  But still, the book did bring to surface a lot of issues that should be addressed in our society.<br />Leanna<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-03-05

She is working on her dissertation for her doctorate in Psychology. She worked her way through school as a dancer at The Inferno.

He thinks she is simply gorgeous until he finds out about The Inferno and automatically labels her in a not so positive way, but the strong attraction he feels towards her is driving him crazy. <BR>  <BR>Then there is Claudette who is married to Maurice. Claudette is the owner of a large company and is very rich. Everyone knows that Maurice is just a gold digger and has no love for Claudette, except Claudette.

That a child could be treated with such disregard and cruelty as Regina was.  <br />This is Regina Louise's story of her life from ages 10-15. In these years, Regina shifted from home to home, with a simple request that any child has - to belong and be loved by someone. As the story opens, Regina is living in Texas with a surrogate grandmother, Big Mama, whose house is full of other people's children. In this house, Regina was abused by her \\"siblings\\" and ignored by Big Mama. After one of the older children in the home beats Regina at about age 11, she is sent on a bus ride alone to North Carolina to live with her mother, Ruby. <br />Her time with Ruby seems hopeful, as Ruby is stable and working. But, as the story progresses, and Regina's sister, Doretha comes to live with them, things fall apart. Ruby's boyfriend, Mr. Benny begins making advances at the girls. Doretha fights back and ends up fighting Ruby and getting put out, while Regina sits quietly by, realizing that Ruby wouldn't believe her anyway, and desperately wanting her mother's love and approval.   <br />When Regina finally tells her mother of Mr. Benny's advances, Ruby sends Regina to live in California with her father and his  wife. Her time with her father is unsuccessful, and she ends up in foster care, where she becomes attached to one of the counselor's, Ms. Claire. To tell the details of what occurs while Regina is in foster care, would give away several important details and themes that emerge in this.  <br />It was easy to suspend reality and to act like this was merely a story, rather than a detailed account of a girl's life. The book is written in first person, simple narrative form with broken English, as though you are reading out of Regina's journal, or someone merely transcribed her words, spoken into a mini-tape recorder. I often found myself hearing her voice as I read her words. While I would recommend this book, it is not for the light-hearted reader, looking for an uplifting story.  Even as I finished this book, I was still not sure if the story was complete. I guess I was looking for a nice, tidy ending, where everything falls into place and all ends well. That satisfaction was not realized until I found her website, <BR>and read a little bit more about how she is now.  <br />Tameshia<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-03-01

Larks creatively mixes her heartfelt poetry and deeply personal thoughts, in the form of her journal affectionately named &quot;Di,&quot; to reflect the inner turmoil that results from a tumultuous relationship. Did I add that the relationship the book is based on is that of herself and a man living with another woman? <BR> <BR>The most interesting aspect of this compilation is how Larks manages to make the reader feel sympathy for all the people involved. Despite the fact that this relationship is more of a love triangle based on lies and deception, Larks' candid exploration into the way this man makes her feel is very good for a first time author. The reader follows Larks as she goes through the ferris wheel cycle of loving someone who loves someone else. Will Larks ever get off this ride?<BR> <BR>I recommend this book to any woman, or even man, who's leaving or ever left a &quot;Jerry Springer Show,&quot; worthy relationship. Readers who like to read true accounts of other people's lives may enjoy this book as well. Even with the numerous typos and grammar errors, this book has the power to reach any person who has a heart.<br />Anna<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-03-01

Told from the point of view of Tangy, who happens to be \\"The Darkest Child\\" in the family. This family truly follows the \\"blood is thicker than mud\\" motto. Not only do they share lineage they are all victims of their mother's cruelty. Unfortunately we also find that not all of them have the ability to survive. <br />Growing up a Quinn child is a terrible burden to bear. Tangy's siblings all have a little of their mother in them and it's frightening. Her sister Tarabelle carries her mother's hatred. Mushie, the eldest who has moved away carries a love for drinking and other womens' husbands. Her brother Harvey is determined to beat his wife into submission. Martha Jean carries her mother's jealous streak. Laura is a master thief. <br />Roselle, their mother, is undoubtedly the most complex character you will meet. She is an entanglement of hatred, bitterness, evilness, craziness and cruelty wrapped up in the package of a beautiful woman. She is determined to keep her children under her reign of terror. But they have other plans. A string of events will cause her children to fall away in a domino effect; and even \\"the little metal box under the floorboards\\" won't be able to keep them in her grasp. <br />Delores Phillips' debut novel, The Darkest Child is nothing short of a masterpiece. Her writing style puts you in the mind of Toni Morrison and J. California Cooper. The Darkest Child will force emotions from you that are indescribable. Just when you think you can't cry anymore or when you finally feel that there is hope you realize you were wrong. Dark yet enlightening. Cold yet touching. Never before has a novel been written that finishing is required and no longer a choice.<br />Angie Pickett-Henderson<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-02-29

Angelica is racing home, after she learns of his unexpected death. She is not yet 21 years old, was basically raised by her grandfather, Ben Chappee III, she lovingly calls &quot;Pop-pop.&quot; Angelica soon finds there's quite a bit she didn't know about her grandfather; one being he was a millionaire. <br />The next main character and subplot deal with Juan Delgado, a &quot;good Hispanic boy.&quot; Juan is in love with music and desires to do anything except what his father expects of him . . . To take over the family dry-cleaning business. Being the good boy that he is, he tries his best to please is father, while trying to find a way to break the news to him. Juan has a cousin named James who loves the family business. James also feels as if Pops, (Big Delgado) Juan's father is his own and would want nothing more than to run the business. Juan knows this and wish that could be the easy answer, but it's not. Therefore, James spends his time working hard in at the dry cleaner (against his mother's wishes) and trying to keep Juan focused on the business at hand. They have a big job to do in Baton Rouge and neither want to let Pops down.<br />Now we have two main characters, both with a conflict of interests (Angelica is unsure about what to do with Pop-Pop's business . . . she dreams of &quot;Dance&quot;) . . . will their paths cross? I'm thinking . . . You BET! Angelica's path also crosses with others as well. Money has a way of attracting people, and NOT necessarily people with her best interest in mind. Someone just may be willing to kill to get their hands on Angelica's money. Surprised? I was. Get Some Love was an interesting and easy read. I would definitely recommend this book.

This news comes after Mitchell spends three months and big bucks on a \\"sexless friendship.\\" So, he decided to make a change and called a meeting of the most notorious \\"dogs\\" (players) he knew ... looking for a tutor, as he contemplate on making some changes.<br />There are some other things going on in the story other than Mitch's transformation process.  Such as: Nikki's law suit for sexual harassment, which was a bit interesting and she has trouble finding the right lawyer. There is also the business with Nikki's absentee father, Gene Coleman and her trying to come to terms with him . . . now this is definitely a plus in the story. However, the main plot was predictable and very irritating for me, but that's a personal issue. As Mitch learns his set of \\"dog rules\\" and begins to play the \\"game,\\" guess whose eye he catches. He's living up to his new lifestyle, Nikki has a change of heart but . . . Mitch now has a secret he's trying to hide. <br />The book was not an easy read for me. I struggled to finish it. Nikki tells Mitch that a lot of girls would love to have a nice guy, but she just wasn't one of them. She prefers her lover Jomo whom she shares with him \\"loving\\" others. She knows this and accepts this. This book rings so true. I see it around me; women and even girls wanting \\"a thug\\" or \\"bad boy\\" who doesn't respect them lesser known are faithful to them . . . I guess that's why there's so many \\"baby daddies.\\" When Mitch's secret comes to light, it irked me that Nikki had the nerves to be upset . . . after all, she wanted a player. Me, I'll rather have a \\"nice guy.\\"  But Robinson did a great job in weaving in all the different aspects of the story. So, the only complaint with the writing was the predictability of the mainstory. I would recommend No More Mr. Nice guy to someone who enjoys \\"street fiction\\" and drama. <br />Felicia<BR>R.E.A.L.

Cassandra, a twenty-something, black co-ed who is trying to come to terms with her own adulthood, femininity and identity, finds herself caught in the mix when a neighborhood girl, Lavelle Jackson dissappears. In an attempt to help her guardians,Uncle Woody and Aunt Ivy find Lavelle Charlotte uncovers some truths about her friends, her uncle and the world at large. <br />I wanted so much for this book to leap off the page, because it was packed with so many themes - civil rights, loss, direction, security - but it never floated to the top for me. The clues were too vague to see and the twists were so few and far between that I became frustrated with the mystery.<br />The striking thing about this book is that Charlotte Carter can write wonderful prose. She uses words in a way that is reminiscent of the Harlem Renaissance:  <br />&quot;He had no wife, no children, no lovers, no friends that we knew of. So where did all the mourners come from? I guess black people just gravitate to funerals.&quot; <br />Wonderful character description! I wished the entire book could follow with the same spirit and truth as those words above.<br />Therefore, Jackson Park... receives 3 pens because it falls short of what it could become. If Charlotte Carter hadn't shown me that she could weave intrigue into text with such precision then I would've chalked her undeveloped plot up to being a novice writer. But she showed me that she's a master at writing, so it is hard for me to accept that this version of Jackson Park is the best that she could have produced. <br />This book is great for history buffs, mystery mavens, and young adults.<br />Dee Y.

One woman, Tammy Tilson, appears to be at the center of it all. Does she really know something; or is her family just in the wrong places at the wrong times? A family that has been blessed with foresight, finds that knowing is not always a good thing.<br />Memphis, Tennessee in 1936 is where Denise starts her story. Everybody knows everybody and their business, especially black folks' business. Tammy knows the law, and what can or cannot be done legally to her and her loved ones. She's strong and a fighter, but soon realizes that she can't be everything to everybody. She has to let her children live their lives, and marry whom they choose. Her mother told her on her deathbed, to not let evil into the bloodline or it'll be the ruin of the family. With that as her mantra, Tammy knows that the union between her son, David, and Margaret Armstrong will be of no good. Especially with Ramsey Armstrong as a father; he looks as if he's been snatched up by the clay people.<br />In the end, the mantra shows to be true. The journey of the discoveries found out a long the way gives hope that an innocent boy will not have to suffer the consequences of a silent man. Will the wrongs be righted? Can marriages be saved? Will little girls be able to sleep at night without the presence of dead ones?<br />Spiral is a great story about family and secrets living in a small town. I loved the history and the mystery behind getting to the truth. My only disappointment is that the ending didn't have as strong of a feeling as the rest of the book.

Talbert has done a stupendous job creating his characters. They are comical and the emotions of the characters draw you in.<br />Although I enjoyed this book, I became quite irritated with the repeating of words to emphasize the emotion. It wasn't so much as redundancy as it appears to be his style of writing. I thought there were far too many clichés as well as sentences that rhyme. It is definitely great stage writing, but for literary purposes, it was a bit much. However, I am not turned off by Mr. Talbert's work. I would surely pick up another novel written by him.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a little laughter as they wind down at the end of their day.

How We Got Over: Testimonies of Faith, Hope, and Courage is a collection of inspirational testimonies from a motley of Africans of the Diaspora, from as near as Atlanta, Georgia to as far as South Africa. Proceeds from the book support AIDS orphans in Southern Africa. The testimonials are broken down in four categories: faith, hope, courage and listening to our elders.<br />I gave this compilation a 4.0 rating mainly for lack of testimonial diversity. The book reads more like a devotional guide without a daily prayer and recommended reading section. McDonald has presented some nice testimonies that can encourage anyone seeking guidance.<br />Although I applaud the editors' effort in pulling these testimonials together, this book could have a greater use than what it has now. The editors could have made sure that each testimony was crisp and tight enough to be to the point. Sometimes I found myself speed-reading to get to the heart of the testimony. <br />My favorite excerpt from this book was written by Lorenzo Robertson, best selling author and co-executive director of Operation Hope, a nonprofit AIDS service organization in Tampa, FLA:<br />Hearing the doctor say, &quot;You've got AIDS,&quot; changed my life forever...I am not mad-I'm a miracle. <br />This book is great for gifts, light reading and church groups.

Dasha Kelley masterfully pieces together the lives of two women, Emorie and Denise, and then peels away at the secrets and madness that one possesses.  <br />Denise, is a charismatic, eclectic, single, radiology technician with a wild and uncontrollable side. Emorie is a middle-class wife and mother, with a loving marriage and predictable life. After the birth of her second son, she decides to quit her job and become a stay-at-home mother.  Bored with life in the suburbs, she welcomes Denise's <BR>quick and easy friendship. Denise and Emorie first meet at an art show that Emorie is volunteering at, and later run into each other at the hair salon, which both of them have been going to for several months. While browsing in a local boutique, Denise cunningly gives Emorie advice on decorating her bedroom; a room that as far Emorie is aware of, Denise has never set foot into. From there, madness ensues. <br />Much like Denise, this story spirals out of control to the point where you barely have the time to catch your breath before the next layer is peeled away. Where other novels would fall apart, this book is held together by the fragmented and disjointed way the story is pieced together to mirror the life of someone with an untreated mental illness. I highly recommend this book. It is a quick, short read that leaves you stunned and satisfied with the awesome ending.  <br />Tameshia<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewer	2004-02-27

After reading Glenville Lovell's Too Beautiful to Die I've fallen in love with it. At first I thought it was my penchant for bad guys gone good with harboring bad tendency issues that drew me into detective novels. You know the Axel Foley, Shaft, or Easy Rowlins kind of fellow. While reading this book for the second time, however, I found brilliance to Lovell's work and a greater respect for the genre. <br />Lovell builds a bombshell of a who-done-it, and at the same time enlightens the reader about Caribbean American Immigration History, a subject matter that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. <br />Blades Overstreet, a black ex-NYPD cop obligates himself to a gorgeous soap star, appropriately named Precious, as a favor to Jimmy Lucas, the man who had saved his life. Precious wants to know the identity of her father and someone is willing to tell her who he is for $50,000, so Blades offers his protective services to assist her with this transaction. When they both find their contact, who unbeknownst to them is an ex-FBI agent, dead in his apartment, Blades realizes that this small favor has turned into one huge mess. And if things couldn't get worse for Blades, Precious is found dead in his apartment. How will Blades clear his name? Who killed Precious and why? Most importantly, who was Precious' father?<br />This novel will have you up all night trying to get to the truth. You will not skip to the back of the book to find out, because each chapter is so interwoven into the end and so well written you will not want to miss a clue or a thought. Blades is the hero of the twenty-first century, and I hope they make this novel into a movie. Look what &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress: The Movie&quot; did for Walter Mosley's Easy Rowlins. <br />I recommend this book to my brother, my daddy, and any man, who shies from reading. I recommend this book to any woman wanting to know the intricacies of the African-American male psyche. I recommend this book to anyone who just wants a really good read. This book is off the chisel. <br />Too Beautiful... receives 5 pens because it is too wonderful for words. It is an instant classic. The way Lovell melts landscape into philosophy is superb. I must have this in hardback, so Lovell can get more cheddar. He deserves it. <br />Dee Y. Stewart<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-02-27

Dutch was deemed a cold blooded murderer at the age of 14 when he killed a thief that tried to rob the pizza shop where he worked.  By disposing of the body, the Italian Mafia took notice of him.  This put him in a good light with the Italian Mafia at a very early age.<br />Dutch and his best friend, Christopher \\"Craze\\" Shaw started working for the Mafia stealing high end cars and taking them to a chop shop.  Dutch got together a select few that he could trust and had the same interest.  There was One Eyed Roc, Qwan, Puerto Rican Angel, Zoom, Shock, and of course Craze.  This crew was a wild and crazy bunch.  They stick together through thick and then.  In a car heist gone bad, Dutch &amp; Qwan get caught and go to prison.  They did 18 months and were released and back on the streets to get right back into the life.  When Dutch came out he immediately got into the drug business;  getting his crew back together and setting his plan in motion.  This begins the rise of Dutch the Drug Kingpin.<br />Dutch is the first part of a trilogy by Teri Woods.  Some parts in the book, such as the courtroom scenes are a little slow, but the flashbacks do make up for these parts.  Also be aware that some parts can get quite graphic in description.  The author does a good job of leaving you wanting more as she should since this is part of a series.  <br />Tracey<BR>R.E.A.L Reviewers	2004-02-27

The author does not do a good job of creating the synopsis of the book until close to the end.  I'm not sure what the main focus of the book was, but if I had to guess I would say it was vaguely about honesty and trust in relationships.<br />The book opens with Andria catching her boyfriend Paul in bed with the neighbor, Florence. Andria yells and screams for them both to get out. Paul packs his stuff and leaves.<br />Now we have Rashun, a tall, dark chocolate brother that is a high powered attorney. He has given up on finding a good, faithful woman. He finds a video tape of his girlfriend with another man. This man is performing blackfunk on her.  Now in order to find out what blackfunk is, you have to read the book.<br />Rashaun and Andria meet at a club and they are both smitten with each other. They get to know each other over the months, and then it gets serious. They both have trials and tribulations that they go through with all the emotional baggage they bring to their relationship.<br />There is a part in the book about a priestess that is very entertaining that makes this book worth reading.

The premise was unique enough to garner my attention. However, it lost my interest after the third page.<br />Black Deception is a medical thriller set in a Miami, Florida medical center. Angela Butler has been offered a job as a physician's assistant in the world renowned Menorah Medical Center's surgery department. Dr. Kevin Diamond, the department head hires Angela to assist him in his genetic cloning therapy research institute. Once she is there, however, Angela's view of Dr. Diamond changes from medical pioneer to medical pirate. Patients experience dangerous medical, secretaries misplace patient records and Dr. Diamond takes patient's DNA specimens without the patient's consent. Angela believes that Dr. Diamond is creating human embryos from the stolen specimens through unauthorized genetic cloning, but she doesn't know how to prove it. At the same time she must prove to the Miami police that she is not an accomplice to an unsolved homicide. Apparently the same people that robbed her home used her identity to rent their runaway vehicle. The plot thickens when Angela's home invasions are tied to Dr. Diamond's business partners. <br />Payton's plot should produce quite a page-turner, but it falls short, because of her novice writing skills. The book is hard to follow and there are too many characters to keep up with. Although the story is packed with complicated medical jargon, the facts lose their power and authenticity. Payton overwrites her dialogues, does a poor job at fleshing out her characters and builds a weak climax. Her love story is underdeveloped and she does a poor job at subplotting. The book is inappropriately titled Black Deception. It should be titled Book Deception, because it reads more like a first draft than a completed piece. For someone who wants to delve into a good read, they will be disappointed.<br />Therefore, I have no choice, but to give the book two pens- one for effort and one for trying to bring something new to the table. Hopefully, Payton can pull it off in her second novel, Cloning or at least I hope she can.<br />Dee Y. Stewart<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-02-19

Singleton creates an epic story of the lives of two women, capturing their tumultuous childhood and adolescence and their remarkable lives as adults. <br />Throughout their childhood, Lillian and Myraleen believe that there is more to the world than what Nadir, Mississippi can offer. As Lillian says, &quot;...Mississippi was just the slow, painful way of spelling hell.&quot; Lillian's inquisitive spirit cannot soar to it's full potential with the limited<BR>opportunities that life in rural Mississippi offers. The customs and expectations of life in Nadir continually stifle Myraleen's feisty and headstrong nature. What Nadir lacks in opportunity, it is enriched with characters who shape Lillian and Myraleen's lives - Mudear and Mercy, Lillian and Myraleen's well-intentioned mothers; the Taylors, the only Black family in Nadir to own their own farm, and Kellner, a mysterious German POW, who works on the Taylor's farm. <br />At 26, Lillian and Myraleen act on the realization they have held since childhood, and head for Philadelphia. Here they find the hustle and bustle of city-living exciting, but still encounter the harsh realities of life in the North as Black women. When the opportunities in Philadelphia do not meet their expectations, they take another bold step, and join the Army, towards the end of World War II. Although they spent their time in the military away from the battlefield, the lessons learned in war leave an indelible impact in their lives.  At the end of the War, Lillian stays in Europe, going to school and searching for a lost love, while Myraleen returns to Philadelphia, regretting the marriage proposal her willful nature would not let her accept.  <br />Singleton is truly a gifted writer. The structure of this book held my attention and kept me turning the pages to findout what happens next. Her descriptions were so vivid that the heat of Mississippi, the confines of tenement living, the exhilaration of doing the jitterbug for the first time, the fear and exhilaration of falling in love, and the war-torn streets of London came to life as I read this book. In fact, I strongly believe that this book would make a wonderful television movie or miniseries. <br />Tameshia<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewer	2004-02-19

Fifteen bucks is too much for this book unless you want to frame the cover; Vincent M. Ward, the cover model, is quite the guy-candy. <br />Gary, Indiana native, Dollar, is a hustler in the making. He goes from petty theft to a twisted form of vigilante judge, whereby he steals from dope dealers and other hardened criminals. His Robin Hood antics lead him into a five- year stint in prison. Dollar does not rehabilitate himself back to living the honest life, but learns from prison how to become the worst thing since Scarface. What in the world will he do when he gets back on the streets?<br />Trust me. You don't want to know. The two-hundred-plus pages aren't worth the time investment. It is macabre, stereotypical, hopeless and just badly written. This story could've been so much more if the author could command English language to her advantage. There is fluidity to this language that makes it difficult to master, but beautiful to read, and I wished that for this book, because it would have so much more to say. However, I do applaud the mysterious Joy for putting something out there that services a readership that is underrepresented in the literary world - American street life. Many publicists are on the hunt for this genre, but unfortunately there aren't enough authors to deliver these stories with a sense of realism and honor like Martin Scorsese or Sista Souljah. <br />Therefore, this novel gets two pens: one for completion and one for its attempt at creating a voice for the Black underworld. This book is suitable for men, and those interested in gangsta crime fiction. <BR> <BR>Dee Y. Stewart<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-02-19

Mallory Baylor left Atlanta years ago to take a bite out of the Big Apple. She lands a staff writing position at Heat magazine, which is beneath her drive and talent. Her chance at a much coveted feature writer slot opens for her, but she has to interview someone from her past- multimedia mogul Saxton McKenzie, the love of her life and father of the son she gave up for adoption, in order to get it. When Saxton realizes that his old flame is his interviewer he makes a careless mistake.

Lynn Harris not Tracie Howard writing this. I see stereotypical characters morphed into sleeker camouflage. Nicki, Mallory's roommate is a vindictive she-devil reminiscent of EJD's antagonist, Jessica Lawrence in The Other Woman and Sheila Moore of Jacqueline Thomas' Prodigal Son. All of these women were dark skinned morally inept women ruled by ambition over common decency. Yet, the difference between those main characters is that the reader knew what was behind the mask, but Nicki was never unveiled. As a brown skinned woman I wonder about the implied results of such characters. Nonetheless, the main witch of the novel, Deena Ingram is a bonafide BAP who would \\"pass\\" any day of the week, if it meant an increase in her ratings or her father's rise to the Supreme Court. I found this labeling worrisome as well. What does this say about our society and about the African American woman's voice? <br /> <br />Dee Y. Stewart<br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-01-21

Well...Without giving the plot away, the author Patricia Haley weaves a story full of the intricacies of human emotion.<br />In Victoria Christopher Murray's story, The Best Of Everything, the biblical story of Hannah was used as a template. What would you do if your husband's ex-wife was always throwing their kids up in your face? Humm...Through Hannah's story we learn that when you release negative emotion over to God, then wonderful happiness will happen in your life. Be kind to your enemies and see what great things God will do in your life. <br />I highly recommend this book and it's stories packed with themes full of Godly wisdom. The book includes study questions with each story, and is an excellent book for secular and Christian book clubs. I eagerly look forward to the next installation of Christian stories from these authors.<br /> <br />Helen<br />R.E. A. L. Reviewers	2004-01-21

One surprising aspect of the story is that it's not set in the traditional NYC, Miami, or even the palm-tree laden jungles of Los Angeles, in terms of what a reader would expect when imagining a setting for drug trafficking. <br />The main character, Pamela Xavier, &quot;Carmen&quot; when she's in hustler mode, is making her ends meet in Columbus, Ohio. The complicated story of a &quot;good girl&quot; gone bad unfolds before your eyes. Forced out into the streets after a disagreement with the love of her life, Chino, she's forced to make a way for herself and her son. Chino relinquishes his paternity of the child after he has convinced himself that Pamela cheated on him while he was in jail, when she had not. She begins hustling by entering the \\"escort\\" business, but with her eye on the prize of more and more money, she ends up becoming a major drug dealer, caught up in a system she can't seem to get out of.<br />From what I understand, this is a novel based on a true story, but I wasn't 100% clear as to whether or not this was Stringer's personal story. It was extremely difficult for me to relate to Stringer's storyline of Pamela slowly but surely becoming Carmen. It was unbelievable for me as a reader to comprehend a college student going from a legal better life, to the lap of illegal luxury with her first lover, Chino, then to the streets, when he throws her out along with the child she had with him. The level of wealth she was accustomed to, thanks to Chino, fed into the never-ending feelings of greed that eventually brought her down.<br />That said, I have to give Stringer kudos for the strong messages of self-love and taking responsibility for one's actions that she brought across on the page. Aside from that positive aspect, the frequent grammar errors, constant use of profanity throughout the novel, and choppy, almost elementary telling of the story left much to be desired when itcomes to the quality of the novel. If you don't mind wading through imperfections to get to a story full of gritty street life, this may be a book of interest to you.<br /> <BR>Anna <BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-01-21

Of course, the male and female leads are<br />stunningly beautiful and the love - making is,<br />naturally, earth shattering.  I gave up Harlequin a<br />long time ago for this very reason: the plot was too<br />predictable.  Although \\"Serpent In My Corner\\" closely<br />mimics a Harlequin Romance, but I still found the<br />novel an attention-grabbing story.  A little fluff is<br />good now and then.

The Promised Land for &quot;Mosetta&quot; is the unaltered texture of natural black hair.  <br />Without being preachy, \\"Mosetta\\" provides readers with a booklet filled with informative segments, like stories on infamous \\"good hair\\" in the black community, a dictionary on nappy hair terms, and a helpful section full of quick come backs for nappy-headed people to use on others who ask silly questions about their decision to be sans chemicals. A perfect example of this would be the seven different choices of \\"snap backs\\" to the question of \\"What happened to your hair?\\" A sassy \\"snap back\\" of \\"It decided to stop pretending,\\" is one of many retorts one could use on people who ask questions that are really none of their business.<br />The light-hearted way with which \\"Mosetta\\" treats the subject matter allows the book to come off as non-judgmental. She even has a 12 step &quot;Permaholic&quot; program outlined for people who are beginning their natural journey through \\"transitioning\\" or going for \\"The Big Chop\\" (all terms listed or described in the book).

The 155 page book is centered on the troubled female character named Song Byrd, and the novel is put together in much the same lyrical and poetic way as the character's name. The chapters are short, metaphorically deep, snack-sized morsels that the reader is treated to as they read about Song's struggle to overcome the ghetto of Philadelphia that has made her who she is. <br /> <br />The title of the book comes into play when Song divulges to the reader that her mother, who birthed four children from four different men, used to lock Song into the roach infested bathroom of their apartment when her mother was unable to attain a babysitter. Song would look up to the sky as a symbol of hope and day dream to pass the time away. A tragic event occurs, which rattles Song's foundation and makes her decide to never look up ever again. <br /> <br />Fast forward many years later and Song is a graduate of Spelman College with a great job giving back to the community and a man who adores her, but she's still holding on desperately to her past. Despite her personal uplifting experience of no longer relaxing her hair and the education she has under her belt, there are many old issues of hope and self-esteem that she has to struggle through before she can truly move on with her life. <br /> <br />Works of fiction of this sort are great for those who are looking for a profound, triumphant story. This novel does not skimp on major issues like classism, race, intra-racism, and the power of the human spirit to overcome. This should be required reading for every woman of color before heading off for higher learning.<br /> <br />Anna <br /> <br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-01-21

David McKay becomes the sole heir to the McKay estate in Harlem's upper echelon Striver's Row neighborhood upon the untimely suicide death of one of his twin sisters, Lilian. This is uncharacteristic of Lilian as her devotedly Christian and demure personality doesn't \\"jive\\" with this type of action. True to her greedy, selfish nature, the other twin, Gem, wastes no time exiting New York for the safety of Europe immediately after Lilian's death. Or so it seems to the untrained eye.<br /> <br />David's return to Striver's Row from Philadelphia to attend Lilian's funeral is only the last straw in his façade of being the ideal upstanding black male of the Renaissance era. Two chapters into the novel, the reader is made aware of the fact that even he isn't what he appears to be. As I read further and began to get lost deeper and deeper in the dynamic characters of this work of fiction, I found myself propelled to figure out what caused the sudden change in Lilian's attitude during the last few months of her life and why did her husband treat her so unkindly in private? <br /> <br />One common element that seemed to run like a current through all of the characters was the flaw of secrecy. From Lilian's mysteriously dark and charismatic husband, Jameson Sweet, to the maid, Annie, and even on down to the people of \\"less consequence,\\" like Rachel, who lived in squalor less than a block away from the McKay's massive house, keeping secrets from one another throughout the course of many years has taken its toll on the close circle of family and friends. Will David be able to get to root of all of these lies by omission in order to give his conscience a rest? A tale of what he is sure is murder leads David on a trail to the truth.<br /> <br />If you're a reader looking for a true novel, with excellent character development, complete with a Renaissance mystery twist, this book will be a perfect addition to your personal library. Kudos to Walker for creating a story that vibrates with the jazz, issues of intra-racism, and black artistic development in all arenas during this explosive time period in American history. <br /> <br />Anna <br /> <br />R.E.A.L.

To read this book, one would think that hair and men are the two most valuable commodities in a Black woman's life.  <br />Nappily Ever After is the story of Venus Johnston, a professional black woman, who starts off the book with a faltering and relationship and a new haircut. Venus and her live-in boyfriend of 4 years, Clint have had a parting of ways.  After practically supporting Clint through medical school and his residency, Venus is ready to get married, and Clint will not pop the question. So, she throws him out of her beautiful home and goes and cuts all of her long relaxed hair off.  While enjoying a night out with the boys shortly after their break-up, Clint meets Kandi, an attractive teacher with long-flowing hair and flawless good looks. Kandi, is looking to marry a good, black man, and finds that Clint is the answer to her prayers. Kandi poses and preens and does whatever she can to catch and hold onto Clint.  <br />From there, the story unravels into an unbelievable mess.  There are several plot devices that seem very contrived, as though the author was trying to add drama to boring and predictable book.  In the end, the story comes together very neatly, with all the characters getting what they want and living happily ever after.  But, you just don't understand or believe how they got there.  What could have been a very uplifting and well-told story about a woman finding liberation and joy in her new natural self, is merely another story of how hair, a man, and a little bit of status are the central themes in a Black woman's life. <br />Tameshia<BR>R.E.A.L.

She leaves her hometown, her parents and her past bad relationships behind for Boston. Eric Warren of Warren & Peterson Property Management, her dashing new sweetheart lives there. . But this great catch is no Prince Charming. He's a devoted father and committed husband to a woman, who he has no intentions of divorcing, not even when Breck becomes pregnant with his son. Will Breck listen to her family and friends and let Eric go? Will Eric have second thoughts and leave his wife? Will his wife find out and throw a wrench in their plans, or will the two boys become saving graces for both families? <br />When I saw the title to this novel, As We Lay, I immediately thought of Shirley Murdock's classic hit song whose title has the same namesake. Both Breck and Eric live their lives with a let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may attitude. Although they both know what they are doing is wrong, they can't tear themselves away from each other long enough to make an ethical decision. Breck's independence and drive has always kept her from surrendering herself to a committed relationship. So, in the beginning of the relationship, she is quite cavalier about Eric's other life. It isn't a threat to her until she bares their son, Jordan. Eric is the best version of Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde that I've seen since the Robert Luis Stevenson classic. Both he and Breck epitomize the human condition, the ability to exist between heaven and hell.<br />Darlene Johnson is a master at presenting this love triangle in a way that keeps the reader questioning the validity of what happens to Breck and Eric, and the reality that it could happen to anyone of us. Johnson is such a great plot twister. I did not entirely agree with the resolution and ending. She has the writing capability to churn out a more controversial resolution, to haunt us at the end and leave us breathless. I wanted her to step out and floor me like she did in the first turning point and the climax. This ending cheapened all that she worked for in the beginning and the middle, which dropped the piece to something more average than exceptional.<br />This book is provocative, sexy and a surprise. You will like it and talk about it for months to come. Nice book for a reading club.<br />Dee Y. Stewart<br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2004-01-13

This memoir tells asha bandele's journey to find both love and, most importantly, herself.  <br />asha meets Rashid while doing poetry readings and workshops at the correctional facility where Rashid was serving time.  Instantly attracted to one another, they played it cool and easy like many of us do at clubs, when we see someone of interest.  What began as a friendship of mutual respect and admiration, grew into a love affair with that as the foundation. asha recounts her experience as a wife of a man in prison - the trips upstate to see him, their marriage ceremony in a corner of the visiting room, their conjugal visits.  While these details give us all a glimpse into a world that we will never see, the most incredible part of this love story is the journey she took to find herself. Through her relationship with Rashid, asha was able to free herself of the internal prison she had created to soothe the pain of sexual abuse she experienced as a teenager.  Although, a part of me wondered why she couldn't have experienced this growth on her own, I came to realize what freedom can come from a healthy and nourishing love. Often this kind of love gives us the courage to look at ourselves in an honest and unflinching way. The sections of the book where she recounts painful memories and truth-seeking were the most powerful for me.  The love story that developed couldn't have occurred without her growing into her own woman.<br />I highly recommend this beautifully written story to anyone looking for a glimpse at a world they would never see and for those looking to take a journey of love and self discovery.<br />Tameshia<BR>R.E.A.L Reviewers	2004-01-13

Camille, the family matriarch, is a widow with seven children.Whether it's the disappointed Yvette, angry Raymond, righteous Anthony, naive Louis, uppity Marc, drunken Joseph or confused Grace-all of Camille's children bear the scars of Watts.<br />As the story begins, it is 1984, nine years after the death of Camille's husband, T-Papa. Camille is fighting to maintain independence from her children and struggling with the poverty and crime she has watched engulf her neighborhood of over 30 years. Her children are busy living their lives of their own and<BR>have all moved away from Watts except her oldest, Yvette. Camille's grandson, Nicholas, is fresh from his stay in prison for a crime that still haunts his grandmother.<br />Camille is an excellent cook whose talents and desire to be financially secure lead her into various catering capers. She and her neighbor, Pep, a recovering alcoholic, hatch many schemes to sell Camille's home cooking.<br />Over the course of the novel, we watch Camille struggle with her past and move past it. We see her grow more accepting of her children and herself. In return, Camille's forgiveness allows her to find love in the most unexpected places.<br />Throughout the book, food remains a constant staple. Whether it's Camille's oyster po' boys, meat pies, red beans and rice, gumbo or pralines, by the end of the book, you will have worked up an appetite for some down home Louisianan cooking. The recipes sprinkled between chapters are an extra bonus!<br />All of the characters in Crawfish Dreams are well written. You will recognize at least one of your own family members in the book's colorful array of characters. Overall, Crawfish Dreams is a truthful examination of aging, family, acceptance and love.<br />Tiffany<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2003-12-01

He begins to love himself and his color, being very dark skinned, he begins to call himself \\"Night.\\" Night is a male prostitute who aspires to be the next big R&B recording artist; he wants to hear his voice in more than background music. In Night Work, you will meet Night's family: Nikki, his younger and sickly sister, who he views as his `opposite', and \\"Pops,\\" his father, a former activist now postman.  Night describes his father as a \\"difficult man.\\"  They have an estranged relationship, if they have one at all. Hopefully in his efforts to overcome all obstacles and lead a `better' life, the family will come to terms with each other.  Nikki desires to see what's left of their family come together.<br />There are some surprise twists and turns of events. Unfortunately a couple of the events land Night down in the police station. Detective Tyrone Williams would like nothing more than to see Night behind bars, especially after Night's female pimp, Raffaella, fingers him as the man she sent to the home of a now DEAD client. Now, along with everything else, Night is the number one suspect in a MURDER case, which definitely won't be good for his business. Night's dubbed as a \\"Black American Gigolo,\\" in the headlines. D of D's Security, Night's friend who has saved his life more than once, can hopefully do it again.<br />There is a history hinted at here between D and the Detective.  D refers to Detective Williams as \\"Fly Ty\\". The tension between them is almost palpable BUT once Night asks the `million dollar question' D replies, \\"That's a long story, Night. We don't have enough daylight left to tell it and I wouldn't talk about it after dark. You feel me?\\" Well, neither Night nor I understand what that meant. Which left me wondering, \\"What's the deal?!\\"  So, that's a loose end for me.<br />However, I would definitely recommend Night Work. It was a quick and easy read, capturing my attention from the very beginning and held it. You will get a glimpse into the life of a gigolo and a well-developed character. Night Work is more than Night's sexual escapades, dealing also with relationships between his family and friends. It's a suspenseful story of self-acceptance and HOPE with a little drama and a `whodunit'.<br />Felicia<br />R.E.A.L. Reviewersmeant.

The main character is Queenisha Renae Sutton (when her mother is upset with her) but she is referred to as Queenie.  She considers herself to be the \\"bomb,\\" standing six feet tall and wearing a size 16. Queenie's best friend is Poe (Poetta) and her total opposite, yet they are like sisters, even though Queenie questions certain habits of hers.  You will also meet Raymo, a co-worker of Queenie, who showers her with affection. Unfortunately for him, she can't stand the sight of him; however, ALL I will say is that Raymo is a persistent man. <BR>  <BR>Poe persuades Queenie to go to a charity benefit that she has volunteered for, with the promise of seeing Billy Dee Williams.  Queenie \\"loves hers some Billy Dee\\", but something catches her eye at the 'auction' and Queenie \\"buys\\" Zeke Washington. Having gone way over her preset limit of one hundred dollars, Queenie plans to get her money's worth out of him. Unfortunately, we don't always get what we pay for. <BR>  <BR>Now, once Zeke comes on the scene you will begin to see Queenie change.  She has it in her head that Zeke is \\"The One.\\" Here is where the high price of a good man comes in, just how much is Queenie willing to give for Zeke ... her life?  She seems to be determined to make Zeke HER man no matter what the cost.  Queenie fails to give real thought as to exactly what a \\"good man\\" is and we find her changing trying to please \\"her man.\\"  <BR>  <BR>Poetta has issues and problems of her own, yet she's trying to be a good friend and getting insulted for her efforts. There are some devastating incidents for Poe, Queenie and Marva (Poe's sister) but we will see if prayer, love and friendship will be enough to pull them through. <BR>  <BR>This book invoked some strong reactions; at times Queenie just irked me. While reading The High Price Of A Good Man, I got upset, I shed tears and I laughed out loud. Phillips allows you to hear someof Queenie's thoughts and some are hilarious because it's 'real.' I loved her attitude, her self-esteem. I would definitely recommend The High Price Of A Good Man. It's a GREAT read.  <BR>  <BR>Felicia<BR>R.E.A.L Reviewers	2003-12-01

The three main characters, Coco, Josephine and Danielle are all friends that form a group called the DaCrew.  All of the girls can sing and dance.  They all have the same dream of making it big in the business, so they can get out of the projects.  Just like with any group there is always one girl that stands out and inadvertently is pushed up front.  This girl is Coco.<br />Coco is tomboyish and sure of herself most of the time.  She lives in the projects with her mother, an alcoholic.  Coco finds solace and guidance in an elderly neighbor, who teaches her a lot about life and making decisions.  Coco is the most talented of the group, but is very humble.  She just wants to get a recording contract to live a better life.<br />Danielle James is the promiscuous member of the DaCrew.  She uses her body to get what she wants and what she wants is Cory.  Danielle is very jealous of Coco because people are just drawn to Coco with her laid back attitude.  She wants the type of local fame that Coco has, but does she have the finesse to get it.  Danielle's jealousy gets the best of her and things start to happen that are out of her control.<br />Josephine Murray wants to live a little on the wild side and just fit in.  She is the only member of DaCrew that did not grow up in the projects and lives with both her mother and father.  Josephine keeps the peace between Coco and Danielle.  She is the mother figure of the group.<br />Coco, Danielle and Josephine meet Deedee, whose uncle is a music producer.  DaCrew see this as an opportunity of a lifetime. While hanging out at a local club, DaCrew give Deedee a taste of what they can do so that hopefully she will tell her uncle about the group. While at the club some things go very wrong, and takes DaCrew through trials and tribulations that ends in deceit and murder.<br />The plot of this book is the same as any ghetto fabulous plot.  There is nothing that sets this book apart from the &quot;Gangsta&quot;, &quot;True to the Game&quot;, and &quot;B-More Careful&quot; kind of books.  The book is predictable; no surprise endings here.<br />Tracey<BR>R.E.A.L Reviewers	2003-12-01

Lyric Devaney, the around the way girl creeping on a come up, is the type of character readers love to hate. Amazingly, Winslow makes the reader care about Lyric's despicable life when a jaw-dropping event occurs, forcing the reader to re-evaluate the importance of the old adage, &quot;You can't take it with you.&quot;<br /> Portia Jones was a marginal character, but her straight from the Brooklyn projects demeanor allows the reader to see that there's more to this woman than she can imagine until she realizes this for herself at the end of the story. <br />Joshua Tune is essentially the male version of Lyric's conniving, evil self. He cheats repeatedly without remorse on his wife, Parker, who eventually must come to her own sense of self-love or risk being swallowed up in her husband's destructive behavior. Madison Michaels is arguably the most heart-wrenching character of them all. Losing her virginity to a complete con-artist could potentially be her downfall, unless she wakes up from the blinding coma of an unhealthy first love.<br />Reading this book made me push aside all of the material things people think of when they look for happiness. The millions Lyric accumulated - the clothes, the jewelry; all of that meant nothing in the blink of an eye. The things you can't put a dollar amount on are the things people should be looking to obtain when journeying toward true peace. Because of this well illustrated aspect of humanity in a slightly vulgar word filled text, I feel comfortable recommending Winslow's book to mature readers who love a book with some substance. This book will leave you thinking about the characters' lives long after you read the last page and put thebook down. More importantly, it'll leave you pondering what it is you should be reaching toward for complete happiness as an individual.<br />Anna<br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2003-11-29

In A Lova ` like No Otha `, Ms. Moore addresses two very real issues in today's society, especially for African-American (AA) women: love and marriage. If anyone follows the trends in marriage, it's my opinion, that no one would argue that the statistics are dismal for AA women, i.e., sisters have the highest rate of singleness out of all races of women. Moreover, more AA women are raising their children alone. As a result, many women believe they have to either \\"settle\\" for a man, even if he does not treat her well, or be alone which is the theme behind the novel.  <br />The novel centers on Zoe Clark, who on the surface has it all together. She has a strong prayer life, a good job, and at the beginning of the story, we find ourselves witnessing Zoe's \\"big day\\", her wedding. After four long years, Zoe is finally marrying Devyn Jackson, the man she has loved since she first set eyes on him. Zoe would classify herself as a very religious person with a strong prayer life; yet, she tends to communicate with God only when she feels turmoil. This fact is even more obvious when tragedy strikes and Zoe begins to realize that she does not truly walk with God. In an effort to overcome this test of faith or \\"storm\\", she is forced to do a lot of self-examination and through a series of painful experiences and poor choices; Zoe comes to a realization that forever changes her life and spiritual walk for the better. Fortunately, Zoe has a companion in her journey of self-discovery: Chase Farr. Chase Farr is Zoe's fiancé's best friend. Chase is a true man of God who refuses to allow anyone and anything to interfere or jeopardize his spiritual walk. Chase spends time in the word, he praises God, even when things are not going right, he is constantly seeking God's will in whatever he does. Unbeknownst to Zoe, Chase has loved her since they attended college together and always thought that Zoe deserved better than Devyn. <br />I like the premise of A Lova' Like No Otha': we must first love ourselves before we can in fact love another. Ms. Moore also wants women to realize that we must first get our hearts right with God before everything else. Still, I found the book excessively \\"preachy\\" for my taste. Ms. Moore really used this novel to espouse her personal beliefs, which is fine, but she went overboard. In addition, the novel was melodramatic; can you say \\"Soap Opera\\" drama? Finally, the plot was predictable and too pact for my taste. However, if you are someone that is going through a trial and you feel that you are all alone in the world and your faith is wavering then you just might find this book an encouragement.  <br />Leanna<br />R.E.A.L.

Second Sunday is all about the power that women have when we, as women, work together. The men folk of Gethsemane Missionary Baptist Church are trying to find a new preacher. Unfortunately, the last preacher died shortly before the church's historical centennial anniversary celebration. The deacons found that they had to bale the last pastor out of sticky situations on more than one occasion; let's just say, that the pastor took caring for the members to a whole new level. The women of the church resent the fact that the men are again keeping them out of the process after making such a bad choice with the last preacher. Therefore, they decide to be proactive and devise a plan to \\"test\\" each of the candidates, enter the \\"jaded\\" woman of the town.  <br />Sheba Cochran is a single mother of four, each by different men. She spends Saturday night at the local juke joint and very rarely graces the church doorstep on Sunday morning. Nettie and Viola, sisters and deaconesses of the church, are spiritual enough to still be her friend and not judge her or look down on her because of her past; they can see her for the beautiful person she truly is. It also helps that Nettie figures that Sheba knows men and is \\"an expert when it comes to sniffing out a man.\\" Katie Mae does not have fond things to say about Sheba, as Sheba is one of the women on her husband's, Cleavon, list of mistresses. The group overrules Katie Mae's objections, for the good of the church, and thus begins the search for a new pastor by the women of Gethsemane. <br />I did not have the pleasure of reading the first book in this series; consequently, I cannot make a comparison. The plot holds few surprises and might be described as \\"bland\\"; nevertheless, the book is entertaining and a light read.  <br />Leanna<br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2003-11-29

Philip, married for 30 years to Dorothy returned to New York to see if the flames of love could be rekindled.<br />Sylvia and Dorothy were best friends in high school until Philip came between them. Sylvia had been &quot;holding out&quot;, but Dorothy &quot;put out.&quot; Dorothy and Philip's tryst broke up her friendship with Sylvia.<br />For 30 years, Dorothy was the glue behind her marriage, telling Philip how to dress and what promotions to apply for. All of Dorothy's hard work paid off because Philip attained a nice solid middle class lifestyle with all the trappings and finery to go along with it, but something in the past still gnawed at his heart: Sylvia.<br />Sylvia was a stay at home mom dealing with teenage daughters. Aaron was rebellious and sneaking around to see boys; Monet was shy and bulimic. <br />When Sylvia caught Aaron in a compromising position with her boyfriend J'Qaun and Aaron discovered that the &quot;stranger&quot; Philip was her mom's long- lost teenage love, they made a pact not to divulge each other's secret. A pact Aaron broke the fateful day she told her father, Emery that Sylvia, his wife had kissed Philip. <br />In A Journey to Here, their lives were put together with bits of glue and dabs of spit. Philip's appearance back in Sylvia's life caused her to confront issues that she had locked away for thirty years in an airtight vault. Will the marriage of Emery and Sylvia survive? Will Monet overcome her bulimia? <br />This is a book about family and the compromises one makes to resolve past issues, a story that will keep the reader entranced in the power of love and forgiveness. Margaret Johnson Hodge's characters are fully developed with all the human idiosyncrasies.

Ms. Shivers' had an interesting premise for the story line but the characters were not \\"real\\". In addition, the dialogue was contrived and forced at times. Although I did enjoy the premise, by the end of the novel, my thoughts were that the story was too far-fetched for my taste. <br />Cara Fleming loves her husband despite his many flaws and philandering and is trying to save the marriage. In turn, her husband comes home, accuses her of an affair without giving her any explanation and subsequently kicks her out. An alderman anonymously sets up a job for Cara just because but later we discover that he is her brother-in-law! He was kid-napped as a five-year-old and he and Cara happen to meet up in a chat room for people searching for biological parents. What is more, this is just a tiny hint of the drama that happens in \\"Anonymity\\". <br />In all fairness, someone else might enjoy reading the book. In fact, I did not find it hard to finish this novel because I had to wonder how far the author would go with the song and dance. A mistress contrives a devious and involved plan to make a husband leave a wife that he loves with all of his heart, a politician that was a teenaged pimp and his support staff that are involved in homosexual love affairs. If any of these multiple scenarios grab your interest, there is much more in Anonymity. <br />Leanna<br />R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2003-11-29

Dickey takes a look at a familiar story line and yet takes the issue of the other woman to another level.<br />The story line is a tumultuous saga of the devastation infidelity has on a marriage. The characters are lifelike as Dickey explores the challenges of a modern career oriented marriage and its struggles for normalcy. <br />Lives are no longer the same when the other woman enters the picture and everyone's life is changed forever. Dickey answers the question of how two people can love each other intensely and yet with one decision lose everything they have worked hard for. <br />The reader glimpses snap shots of the scorned wife in a love scene with the other husband, and we also see instant messages of lovers lost in a new found forbidden bliss. The reader is spellbound as they see snap shots of a marriage that starts to unravel at the seams until it is ripped wide open.<br />One of the most fascinating features of the book is that E.J. Dickey sparingly reveals the name of the main character as &quot;Freckles&quot;.  Without formally naming the main character, Dickey allows the reader to identify emotionally with the main character. What a roller coaster ride of a read that will keep readers on the edge of their seat. The characters and their riveting story will resonate with readers for a long time.<br />Helen <BR>R.E.A.L Reviewers	2003-11-29

Rachel is a young stay-at-home mother with three children under 5 at home. She is now living with her mother-in-law, against her better judgment, in an effort to support her husband. Rachel leaves behind the fast-life of Atlanta and her support system to \\"stand behind her man\\". Rachel is beginning to resent her circumstances until she realizes that she has the power to make a difference in her life.<br />While living in Small Town, Georgia, Rachel befriends Beatrice, her mother-in-law's younger sister. Beatrice, like Rachel, is facing a lot of changes and<BR>turmoil in her life. But, Beatrice feels powerless for reasons very different from Rachel. However, she, like Rachel, makes a realization and begins to take<BR>charge of her life.<br />Peace Be Still is a story about life and change. It could also be an affirmation for women that see themselves in Rachel and Bea. Richard, Rachel's husband, and Virginia, his mother, are supporting characters that help the main characters on their journey to finding peace. Unlike some novels, the ending is &quot;real&quot; in that everything isn't perfect but the author allows the reader to decide what the future<BR>will bring for the &quot;heroines&quot;.<br />Leanna<BR>R.E.A.L.

Daughters of the Dust is set on the Sea Island.  The story follows the lives of the Peazants.  In one sense, it is historical fiction in that the plot refers to the slave trade in explaining how the residents arrived on the island.  The author also interspersed some of the history of the Africans and Native Americans in explaining the characters.  Finally, she also uses the oral tradition of Africans to further allow the reader to see into the heritage of the characters.<br />Amelia grew up with her father, mother and maternal grandmother.    The dynamics of the household are disturbing to Amelia.  Her grandmother, Hagar, is bitter and runs the household with an iron fist.  Her father spends much of his time at the family business.  Both her grandmother and father tend to verbally abuse or ignore her mother who just seems to suffer through it all.  Amelia is the only bright spot in her mother's days.  Amelia vaguely remembers trips to the \\"island\\" and her mother's family.  She has a lot of curiosity about this facet of her family.  Neither her father or grandmother has anything nice to say about the island but her mother seems to long for the island.  Amelia decides to go to the island to \\"study\\" her family with her mother's blessing and against her father &amp; grandmother's wishes.  <br />On the island, Elizabeth befriends Amelia.  Elizabeth is the one who has ventured away from the island and furthered her education.  She routinely works for two older white women on the \\"mainland\\" as well as teaching on the island.  Elizabeth is Amelia's guide to not only life on the island but their family's history.  Elizabeth, like Amelia, must chose between staying with family or following her dreams.<br />The supporting characters in Daughters of the Dust are colorful and endearing to say the least.  There are children, teenagers, elders, newlyweds, hopes &amp; dreams realized and lost in the lives of the supporting characters:  they each have a tale to tell.  Ms. Dash doesa great job of telling a \\"story\\" with strong African-American women of character.  I would recommend this book to anyone that is curious about the history of Africans in America and enjoy reading about the challenges of family life.<br />Leanna Bailey<BR>R.E.A.L.

Joyce Mitchell was widowed early, when the love of her life Mitch dies in a freak accident.  Joyce has a busy, rich life.  It's only when she has a moment to think, climbing into her empty bed, that she feels something is missing. <BR>    <BR>It has been years since Mitch's death and though she still dreams about him, lately a new vision has been entering her dreams: a red dress.  In this red dress, she dances as if no one's watching... remembering all those parts of her self neglected since she lost her Mitch. <BR>  <BR>Enter Nate Anderson, the new administrator at the high school.  A tall, dark and handsome divorcé, he and Joyce immediately connect-but experience has taught them to proceed with caution, one tiny step at a time...  After all, who has time for love?  They each have their hands full with work (and their own fears about love). <BR>  <BR>At first I wished Pearl Cleage hadn't sent the characters I loved in her previous book off on a road trip first thing in I Wish I Had a Red Dress, but I quickly forgot that disappointment is the richness of Cleage's story. The pacing is a little slow at first (which is authentic to the characters' natures).  The \\"bad guys\\" are just a little too one-dimensional for my taste, but everyone else's characters are strong.  Once the book got going, I found myself truly caring about what happened to the central characters, which for me is a mark of good writing.  My only other criticism would be that sometimes I found the conflict between Joyce and Nate a little superficial, and their resolutions not quite realistic. <BR>  <BR>This is a layered and compassionate book that I would recommend. The characters are strong and compelling, the plotlines intelligent, and the ending satisfying.  If you liked What Looks like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, pick up Pearl Cleage's I Wish I Had a Red Dress. <br />Charisse Sisou<BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewer	2003-09-11

She decides: it is time to move. Setting her heart on San Francisco, she's makes a pit-stop in her old home town, sleepy Idlewild, Michigan. <br />An alluring all-Black resort town in its heyday, Idlewild lost its summer residents to integration. In the ensuing unemployment and poverty, Idlewild has succumbed to so-called \\"big-city\\" problems like drugs and violence. <br />Ava rejoins her sister Joyce, who settled in Idlewild. Joyce is a storehouse of nonstop energy that she devotes to the community through her group, The Sewing Circus, offering support and education for the teenaged mothers of her church.<br />What begins as a stopover for Ava quickly grows into something much more. Before long she is intimately drawn into Joyce's work. As a string of violent events builds to a crescendo, the mystery of who's behind them and their strange connection to the pastor and his wife culminate in a climax that had me holding my breath and turning pages as fast as my fingers could fly. <br />Interweaved through all this drama, Ava re-meets an old friend, Eddie Jefferson, and the sparks fly, just when she's given up on love. But Eddie has some dark secrets of his own... <BR>  <BR>I love this book. Pearl Cleage so skillfully weaves suspense and romance, street-wisdom and compassion, humor and poignancy in this book, I read like it was going out of style. I could hear her playwriting experience in the sharp dialogue and characters' thoughts. What made this book for me were the characters. We get to grow with Ava as the book progresses. Joyce's and Eddie's characters have a complexity and depth that make them real. My only criticisms of this book are that the \\"bad guys\\" don't have nearly the depth of the other characters, making them proportionately less believable, and the ending leaves a few loose ends... In the big picture, these were minorflaws.    <BR>  <BR>Charisse Sisou <BR>R.E.A.L. Reviewers	2003-09-11
