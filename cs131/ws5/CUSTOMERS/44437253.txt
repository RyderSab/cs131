Books	5	3	4	N	N	reliable for orthodox and Orthodox Christians	I groaned when a fellow Eastern Orthodox Christian, a former Protestant, lent me this book.  Reading it, however, I became hooked; I was more than pleasantly surprised.  NT Wright's \\"daring\\" view of St. Paul is old hat, or should be, to Orthodox Christians, but it's still refreshing and illuminating to read what he has to say, even if the Church (the Orthodox Church) would find nothing very new in it.  The only question that remains is--why shouldn't Wright, now an Anglican bishop, make the jump to Orthodoxy?  His ecclesiastical messmates, as it were, are not even sure of Christ's divinity, so one wonders when Bishop Wright will make himself honest, or at least put himself in like-minded company.  In any case, this work is highly recommended.	2005-10-13

It's pretty clear Forester was having an off year in his writing.  First, the research is atypically flawed:  The American captain Peabody knows Long Island Sound well because he served in the \\"Coastguard Service,\\" something that did not exist at the time (there was a Revenue service, but a \\"Coast Guard\\"--two words, not one in British style--didn't exist until 1915).  Second, the writing is just clunkier than in the Hornblower novels; at one point Forester uses \\"fathoms\\" as a unit of distance rather than depth.  Third, Peabody is mildly interesting as a character but is a long way from being as fascinating as Hornblower was even in his first appearance. Whereas Hornblower is constantly in turmoil over his shortcomings, Peabody is a rather predictable fatalist (and the many and annoying references to Providence underscore Forester's own personal disdain for religion).<br /><br />Still, I found the novel entertaining and worth a read.  Just don't expect 'an American Hornblower.'	2005-09-11

I would rate it as a story as high as even the best of his Hornblower series; if one considers its literary qualities it is arguably his best book.  The story of a single action in the Mediterranean fought by a single British light cruiser, it captures the intricacies of organization and teamwork that make a fighting ship.  Above all, Forester makes clear, the business of naval warfare is that of flesh-and-blood men; from the lowliest seaman to the captain of the ship, all have a vital role to play--any one of them can be a hero.	2005-09-11

I'm convinced this is the best way to get the most out of CS Forester's work and Parkinson's treatment alike.  Parkinson obviously has read through and thought about and thought through every aspect of Hornblower's \\"life\\", and he is so clearly very skilled as an historian of the period, that he really does seem to make Hornblower live, in many ways superior to what Forester crafted in his novels.  (Heresy!)<br /><br />As a student of history, I marvel at Parkinson's accomplishment and recognize that much of his work is done a bit tongue-in-cheek, which only adds to the enjoyment.  I particularly like the way he took one single sentence in one of the books and spun it out for Hornblower in later life, making him a pioneer of naval steam power.<br /><br />There's only one jarring note in the book, and that's in Hornblower's posthumously discovered explanation of what \\"really\\" happened in Renown.  I can believe he propelled the old man down the hatchway--but I cannot believe Hornblower ordered his throat cut.  Hornblower calculated ruthlessly, yes, but he was never that kind of monster.  What am I saying?  He's a fictional person!  Anyway, it's a fun book for Hornblower fans.	2005-08-24

Lewis: A Biography	Books	3	16	20	N	N	Encourages More Reading of CSL, not Wilson	This biography is highly recommended for devotees of CS Lewis's works, particularly of his Christian apologetics, even though the work has some serious shortcomings that threaten to distract from its real value.<br /><br />In most aspects as biography, Wilson's description and analysis of Lewis and the events that shaped him ring true :  the tragedy of his mother's death, the difficult relationship with his father (and the subsequent guilt for Lewis's treating him so shabbily), his salient encounter with the writings of George Macdonald and of G.K. Chesterton; his friendship with fellow Christians--particularly J.R.R. Tolkien, the strange affair with an older woman, the debate that led Lewis to write the Narnia series.  In addition, as a literary man, Wilson seems supremely well qualified to speak of Lewis as a man of letters, literary critic, sometime poet, and storyteller.  Indeed, Wilson whetted my appetite for Lewis's works that I have put off reading, such as `A Prelude to Paradise Lost,' `Studies in Words,' the Oxford History of English Literature, and `The Allegory of Love'; for all this I am grateful to Wilson.<br /><br />But there are things--admittedly secondary, unimportant things--about this biography that occasionally make one want to throw it out the window.  There is the frequent gratuitous or unsubstantiated remark that grates:  the comparison in the preface of Malcolm Muggeridge's typewriter, displayed under glass at Wheaton College, to `the body of Lenin'; details from Lewis's childhood that are `too specifically recalled' in his autobiography to be authentic; Lewis's disdain for modern writers as `ideological' (Screwtape would have liked that one!); marriage not recognized as a sacrament until the medieval western church said so; and, in a total non sequitur, an unkind remark about a woman in `The Screwtape Letters' that is made to apply to Lewis's wife 15 years later.  In these cases, Wilson is merely exasperating.<br /><br />There are two more serious instances where Wilson is almost unforgivable.  He spends most of five pages attacking Lewis's clear explanation in `The Problem of Pain' of the choice presented by Christ regarding Who He Is.  By focusing inappropriately on what Gospel `records' might mean, he describes Lewis's profound, succinct, and inspiring witness as the work of `a rhetorical trickster who is not thinking at all.'  Hardly--it's just that Wilson is offended by the argument.  Ironically, Wilson ends that section with an excellent description of the `purely irrational intellectual snobbery' that undermined Christianity in England at that time--and still does, come to think of it, but in Europe and America as well.<br /><br />In the second instance, Wilson goes on and on about a blunt comparison Lewis made regarding the Incarnation:  to a radio audience he suggested imagining becoming a slug or a crab.  Lewis, of course, was making a point about Divine Condescension; Wilson seizes on the figure of speech as `offensive' and `bad theology.'  Wilson is a clever man, but he might consider that, as a theologian he is rather like a slug compared to Lewis.<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings, and now you're ready for them, this is a worthwhile book, and may serve to inspire Christians more than Wilson intended or imagined.more serious instances where Wilson is almost unforgivable.

His thesis is that Ronald Reagan was a \\"transformational President\\" who both reflected and defined his times and thereby indelibly put his stamp on American civil and cultural life in a way that affects us still and will continue to do so for years to come.<br /><br />'The Eighties' is a balanced, well-researched, engaging, and ultimately persuasive book.  Reagan's success, Ehrman argues, was based on two factors; first, Reagan understood and appealled to the natural and moderate conservatism inherent in American politics.  Ehrman's case is that Reaganism, despite the shrillness of its critics, turned out to be a moderate conservatism of the center rather than the extremist caricature touted by the left.  Second, Reagan was helped immensely by the ineptness of his opponents and their failure to understand America's conservative centrism; to this day, the Democratic party has not managed to come up with a coherent answer to Reagan.<br /><br />Ehrman is particularly strong describing broad trends without becoming overly dry or academic.  His description of the origins of the \\"culture wars\\" is very good, as is his discussion of the increasing irrelevance of academia.  His introduction contains the clearest and most concise definitions of liberalism and conservatism I have seen.  There is a withering assessment of Michael Dukakis as the Democrats' candidate of desperation in the 1988 election against Reagan's Vice President (some guy named Bush, who was elected in a landslide as a proxy for a third Reagan term).<br /><br />Above all, Ehrman's objectivity prevents 'The Eighties' from becoming a hagiography of Reagan--which is why a few on the far right don't like it.  The author faces squarely Reagan's shortcomings, especially his managerial style.  But rather than add to the plethora of biographic treatments of the 40th president, Ehrman has wisely focused on how Reagan changed American political life immutably.  Whether it's welfare reform, abandonment of confiscatory taxes, or the death of Clinton's health care, we have to give Reagan credit--and, for many of us, he gets our thanks as well.ident, Ehrman has wisely focused on how Reagan changed American political life immutably.

It is a measure of how far Western civilization has sunk that, today, both Chesterton and Alfred would be considered fanatics, insensitive and most opposed to diversity.  Particularly alien to the modern mind would be the response of the Danish king, who, after Alfred impossibly beats his forces, becomes convinced that Alfred's Christian faith must be true, and is baptized!<br /><br />'For not til the night's blue slate is wiped<br /><br />Of its last star utterly,<br /><br />And fierce new signs writ there to read,<br /><br />Shall eyes with such amazement heed,<br /><br />As when a great man knows indeed<br /><br />  A greater thing than he.'<br /><br />The language is powerful, compelling, demanding that the poem be read aloud.

My five year old son, with whom I've been reading the series, was again transfixed by Lewis's evocative telling of the falling of eternal night on Narnia.

The strength of this book is the portrayal, even more developed than in the previous Narnia works, of Aslan the Great Lion as the ultimate good, the Creator, the Song Made Flesh, the God who became a Beast for our sakes...you get the idea.  Lewis seems to have tapped into something true and beautiful, especially in the narrative of how Aslan brought Narnia into being, and also how He deals with human sin and tragedy.  Spellbinding for the 46 year old, moving and beneficial for the five year old.  Highly, highly recommended.	2004-12-18

The author of this little book, Dennis Engleman, visited St. Nicholas's tomb in Bari, Italy, and clearly was the subject of a miraculous intervention by St. Nicholas.  This book starts out, I must say, in an unappealing way.  Mr. Engleman basically thinks he was sucker-punched as a child by the myth of Santa Claus (though he makes it up to his mother with a sweet dedication) and then, as a grownup, seems to be the only literate adult around who had not even heard of the real saint whose story was twisted into that of the jolly fellow in red who afflicts our modern materialist Christmas.  Then, Mr. Engleman carries this incredulity over into downright rudeness during a tour of a French cathedral, where he first runs into the story of St. Nicholas.  Up to this point--about a third of the book--the reader would be forgiven for not caring, as the subject of the book thus far is Mr. Engleman rather than St. Nicholas.<br /><br />All that changes when he finds himself in Bari, and what follows makes this a good book to read during Advent.  Mr. Engleman manages to get out of the way of the St. Nicholas story, and at this point the strength of the book--its essential sweetness--takes over.  The penultimate chapter on \\"Suggestions for Parents\\" is rock solid common sense for Christians, and I found valuable his epilogue with the story of the translation of St. Nicholas's relics from Myra to Bari in 1087.  Recommended.	2004-12-13

After the relatively dreary tale of The Silver Chair (see my review for the merit I did find in it), we're glad to find in The Horse and His Boy a grand adventure that illuminates how God works in our lives.  It's an escape story, a war story, a story of someone desperate to warn others of danger, and a story of the virtues of trust, forgiveness, and love.  Highly recommended, and can be read on its own independently of the rest of the series (though you really should start with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, still the best of the series).	2004-12-02

It's a critical distinction that too often is lost, in my experience (28 years in federal service).  Maxwell's approach, though he doesn't call it that, is inherently Christian, emphasizing the basic dignity of every person.  Well-organized and easy to read, a chapter a day for 21 days can turn around a person, and perhaps an organization.	2004-11-24

The middle of the book is full of adventures that were not CS Lewis's best work--the children in Narnia go from one scrape to another with predictable frequency.  The strength of the book is in its depiction, at the very beginning and at the very end, of Aslan the Great Lion as the embodiment of ultimate good.  A secondary strength is Lewis's depiction of the evil Queen, who very nearly convinces the children that the reality they know is not real, that the only reality is her reality, and that they must bow to her will.  Powerful stuff, and good teaching points for youngsters.	2004-11-23

Of course, this is but secondary to his main purpose of portraying spiritual struggle and redemption.  My five year old son, to whom I'm reading the whole series, was rapt through most of it, thanks to Lewis's vivid imagery.  At the end, when the children learn that they have to leave Narnia and never come back but that Aslan is present in their world under another name, I stopped and asked my son \\"And what is that name for Aslan in our world?\\"  He smiled and said, \\"Jesus.\\"  Good lad.	2004-10-29

So you have a lot of water nymphs, tree spirits, fauns, satyrs, and dryads about.  Somehow it's all supposed to work in an allegorical Christian context.  I think it does, but I'm in my 40s.  My son needed relief, so I skipped parts and stopped to explain others.  It still held his attention, because even at its most allegorical, Lewis's writing is captivating even for small children.

If so, then we've a lot ahead of us to endure.  It's not great literature, it's overwritten, the violence is often over the top, and yet some passages are so obscure they need explaining.  Even so, I'll admit my five year old boy loved the book--his first 'chapter' book.  Now he wants to be a warrior mouse.  Hmm.  Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed it, but an attentive parent will want to edit as he reads.  I am grateful for those frequent parts where Jacques explains that violence and death are bad but that sometimes the only choice for peaceful woodland creatures who want to stay free is to fight.  Actually a quite realistic message.  The world of Mossflower is quite as fallen as our own.  Christian parents take note:  death means going to 'the gates of Dark Forest,' and, though there are Christian virtues here, they are never so called.	2004-09-25

First, he is one of the intellectual fathers of the very concept of homeland defense (having written about our infrastructure vulnerability long before 9/11).  Second, his book presents a sobering but eminently readable case for plugging the gaps in our national security--he argues convincingly that the current distinction held by the U.S. government between \\"homeland security\\" and \\"national security\\" means that homeland security inevitably suffers.  Third, his message is both disconcerting and important to hear; I saw a room full of government officials collectively wince at a presentation he recently gave.  Their discomfort was the combined realization that Flynn is dead right about crucial infrastructure vulnerabilities any potential adversary would be foolish not to exploit, and that little has been done to address the problems Flynn identifies.<br /><br />The book is compelling but not perfect.  Flynn's voice is not entirely consistent.  At one point, succumbing to the liberal tendency to view the public as dolts, he says the American people have to \\"grow up\\"; then, a few pages later, he castigates the U.S. government for treating Americans \\"as though they are children.\\"  More than once Flynn refers to Americans as \\"they\\" rather than \\"we.\\"  His argument largely rests on the assumption that the U.S. public in its ignorance will demand that a President, the day after the next attack, take actions that will cripple the global economy.  I'm not so sure, and an examination of how Israel, for example, manages both risk and actual terrorist acts would have been helpful.  But these are small points of dissonance in an otherwise coherent symphony of warning.<br /><br />My fear is that, like the Old Testament prophets, Flynn will be ignored or criticized (actually, the OT prophets mostly were killed for being a nuisance).  If there is any justice, Stephen Flynn's jeremiad will be listened to and will lead to his taking a senior position in the Homeland Security department, no matter who wins the presidential election, so he can begin to do something about the parlous situation he so eloquently describes.Flynn's jeremiad will be listened to and will lead to his taking a senior position in the Homeland Security department, no matter who wins the presidential election, so he can begin to do something about the parlous situation he so eloquently describes. <br />	2004-09-06

Turns out Boorstin's wife talked him into doing this book; this is a case where he should have pushed back.<br /><br />Of the 16 chapters, the first four have a breathless, too clever quality that is annoying.  Boorstin is on firmer ground and far more interesting when he's writing about American history:  with 'Printing and the Constitution,' for example, he shows wit and insight.  His chapters on Tocqueville's America, the Capitol and the White House also were interesting.  Subsequent chapters, however, on Darwin, statistics, and the so-called fourth kingdom (the age of machines), return to the overwrought form of the early chapters.  One of the more annoying things Boorstin does is use religious allusions like a club, to the point when it becomes obvious Boorstin is a secularist who thinks it's all bunk.<br /><br />Another reviewer noted that Boorstin is far better in his better known works, like The Discoverers.

As another reviewer has rightly commented, there are better books about pirates for kids. Far better.	2004-08-03

Besides its value for meditation and reflection on the treasures of Orthodox spirituality and worship, he says things that so-called 'traditional' Orthodox people should pay attention to. In particular, Mr. Bush is quite right to point out that membership in the Body of Christ cannot be reduced to a tribal birthright, and the sacraments of the Church are not tribal customs. He rightly denounces how 'Orthodox Christianity's rich truths become the pawn in a demonic game of the politics of ethnic pride.' This is idolatry, not Christianity.  <br />  <br /> A point of secondary importance is his criticism of the pews that unfortunately mar Orthodox worship in too many parishes in America and that turn participants of divine life into audience members. Mr. Bush is absolutely right that Orthodox Christians should stand for worship, unless infirm or ill, and should also hear the so-called 'secret prayers' that have been suppressed from general hearing. But he doesn't go far enough on this theme, as evidenced by his typical description of the liturgical responses sung by 'the choir.' Excuse me, but the liturgy belongs on the lips of the people, and the choir's sole purpose is to help that reality happen. <br />  <br /> Overall, a most useful book, highly recommended especially for Lenten reading.	2004-07-30

It's not a work of theology, it's not an inspirational work--it is what it is, interesting with its limitations. There's much that Pelikan faithfully records that's nonsense, such as Thomas Jefferson's breathtakingly vain and obtuse pronouncements about what Jesus really said. There are also some staggering transitions, such as the discussion on Emerson that suddenly veers into Dostoyevsky's The Grand Inquisitor from The Brothers Karamazov (the greatest novel ever). It's worth a read, particularly in paperback, but understand that it won't bring you much closer at all to an answer to Jesus's own question, Who do men say that I am?	2004-07-29

It is even better than I expected. The photos are as beautiful and moving as advertised.  Especially good are the essays showing the continuity of understanding about the historicity of the site of Christ's tomb.  The text also explains the various positions of the Christian churches with possession or rights within the Sepulchre/Resurrection complex.  The book also does not shy from the embarrassing fact that ancient divisions within orthodox Christianity continue to this day.  How wonderful it would be if these divisions could be put aside, especially in light of the current cultural and religious onslaught against Christians. I recommend that the book be ordered through Daedalus books (beware--Daedalus the book catalog, not the kinky publisher) because Daedalus has it in stock at a much reduced price.	2004-07-09

This book is enjoying, and deservedly so, a bit of a renaissance even though its subject matter, the influence of neoconservatives on US foreign policy, leaves off in 1994.  For those whose formative years included the Vietnam conflict, detente, or the Reagan posture against Soviet totalitarianism, this is a marvelous history of the ideas that helped bring the Cold War to a peaceful and favorable conclusion.  For those interested in the intellectual foundations of the neoconservative movement that influences current US policy, this book is essential.  Highly recommended:  well written, well sourced, and well intentioned.	2004-05-21

In Jakarta Inside Out, Daniel Ziv has written one of the best insider's guides to the dirty, messy, smelly, and yet fascinating Indonesian capital. In a series of one and two page essays on various categories peculiar to Jakarta, Ziv gives the reader new to things Indonesian a great introduction to the capital and country, and yet the long-time expert will also find much of value--not the least of which is Ziv's style.  His text is a hoot, and the photographs he has chosen capture all the wackiness of Jakarta.  Let's hope Ziv changes jobs frequently, allowing him similar sojourns in various Asian capitals and opportunities to produce more essential guides like Jakarta Inside Out.	2004-04-25

This concise commentary on the Gospel and epistles of John, at less than 130 pages, packs in an immense amount of Father Brown's unparalleled scholarship while retaining his typically fresh and readable style.  If Fr. Brown's work is the perfect way for Christians to delve deep into Catholic and Orthodox biblical studies, this book is the perfect introduction to his work.  If you've read one of his massive tomes (which themselves are highly recommended, but be prepared for an intellectual commitment), this one may seem a bit thin, but even so it will be worthwhile.	2004-02-21

Bob Bathurst used to teach that the Russians needed to be understood in a cultural way so that we could understand the Soviets strategically.  But here he argues that American and Russian cultural &quot;coding&quot; prevented either side from really understanding the other, and in fact allowed each side to create the enemy in the other.  In short, a relativistic view of the Cold War.  The author displays an impressive understanding of the glories and idiosyncracies of Russian culture--except for the Orthodox Church, which he seems to misunderstand completely--but his view of American culture is wholly negative.  For example, he laments that American culture, being &quot;oriented to the present&quot; and subject to rapid &quot;personnel turnover,&quot; lacks the sort of &quot;institutional memory&quot; the Russians have.  Well, yes, democratic elections do that.	2004-01-01

It is not a standard sort of history, but its value lies in how the author brilliantly weaves together strands of Indonesia's prehistory, colonial history, and history as an independent nation--it reminds one of Churchill's maxim about the Balkans, that the region has to be a net exporter of history because it produces too much for local consumption.  This book also demonstrates why the Australians are absolutely first-rate in Indonesian studies (look at a map--they have to be).  Another huge plus are the extremely valuable capsule histories scattered throughout--little gems that capture small topics deftly.  My only criticism is about the author's writing style:  hardly &quot;voluptuous&quot; as one reviewer put it (what does voluptuous writing look like?)--but in fact it's fairly inelegant; the list approach to making your points.	2003-12-14

Take an historical figure about whom little is known, ascribe certain banalities about leadership to him, jazz it up with some colorful language, set it in a guidebook format with short chapters and lots of bullets--and sell huge numbers of copies!  Get Ross Perot to endorse it!<br />This book cries out for a spoof--heck, it already seems like a spoof.

Brown's awesome scholarship, extremely readable style, and his ability to be fair to other views while defending his own were just what I needed.  I wanted to start to get serious about NT study, and this book deserves credit for getting me up every morning at 5:30 for an hour of enlighted commentary for two months.  I'm now on to read his Birth of the Messiah during this Advent season.  As a former Roman Catholic, for the last 22 years an Eastern Orthodox Christian, it's high time for me--for you, I'd suggest you get started with Fr. Brown.	2003-12-07

He proudly proclaims himself an atheist--OK, fine, lots of decent people are--but then asserts a superiority over us sots who do believe in God.  For Christianity, Mr. Steele reserves a special animosity, and it affects his judgment and harms the veracity of his narrative.  The mistakes and misinterpretations are too numerous to mention, but they include:<br />\\"The date of Easter stems in part from an original need to provide a full moon for pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem.\\"  [No, early Church fathers actually discouraged pilgrimages.]<br />He thinks \\"pope\\" is derived from \\"pontifex maximus.\\"<br />\\"Until quite recently no festivities were supposed to occur on Christmas day.\\" [Maybe in England]<br />Steele says Christianity and sun worship were intertwined because churches used to face east, toward the rising sun. [uh, no, it was symbolic; an early name for Christ is the Orient from on High]<br />Does not realize that about half the Orthodox Churches use the Gregorian calendar for most church events.<br />He invariably calls early Christians \\"Gentiles.\\"  [most, initially, were Jews]<br />\\"The single factor which has caused most controversy and division in the Christian religions...is the calculation of the date of Easter.\\"  [preposterous; has he never heard of the Reformation?]<br />Seems to think that the Great Council of Nicaea was called to resolve calendar issues.  [no, it was to address the Arian heresy]<br />Mary was a \\"peripheral figure\\" in Christianity until the 10th century.  [4th century councils defined her importance]<br />He describes Advent as a feast. [it's a fasting period]<br />Even on nonreligious matters, there are many mistakes that suggest a cavalier approach to scholarship.  Steele thinks \\"degaussing\\" neutralizes the magnetic field on a ship [no, it compensates for it].  He asserts that the USSR imposed the same time within its borders [no, it had 11 time zones]. As an Australian, he can be forgiven for thinking that Thomas Jefferson wrote the Constitution.  I just wish Steele had approached non-astonomical matters with the same care and respect he uses for his own field.r it].

First, there is a gushiness in Montessori's utopian descriptions of how her program will create a &quot;new man&quot;--it's almost Leninist in its cadence, and it made me wonder whether Mussolini liked her Children's Houses.  The disrespect for what children learn at home is palpable.  Second, the section on the diet for children is hopelessly out of date.  I'm sure her views, circa 1900, were the best science could offer, but we've gone way beyond advocating a diet rich in fats and sugar and prohibiting all milk products except butter.  Third, there is too much detail for the general reader (i.e. most parents) about linguistic theory--and I really like linguistics.  Her strengths, of course, are her emphases on the liberty and independence of the child (tempered by concern for society), stimulation and development of the senses, and the importance of writing.  This inexpensive edition is worth having, but expect to skim a lot.	2003-11-17

Such practices are worthy neither of history nor of journalism.  Moreover, early in the book the author spins out a series of speculations that somehow transform themselves into assertions of fact by the end of the book:  that the hero of the book radioed the first warning of the first Soviet atomic test, that he was ordered by CIA to remain where he was, that he was sent on a mission to Tibet rather than just tried to escape the Chinese communists.  The author also relies far too much on the reminiscences of family members far removed from the scene, who of course have an interest, perhaps subliminal, of sprucing up the story.  Finally, the author's animus toward CIA and his disagreement with US policy toward Tibet drives the narrative often in bizarre ways:  at one point, the hero, caught on the Tibetan plateau, is transformed and transported in time and space to Vietnam in the 1960s, only to betray that people, too!  This is a frustrating book.  The subject has yet to receive a fair, balanced, and well-researched treatment.	2002-08-30
