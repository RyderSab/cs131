The juxtaposition (excuse my high falutin triteness) of Jane Austen with the social circle of modern women, the way of framing the skips between characters by book and meeting, devices like the collective voice -- all that seemed like exactly the sort of thing I'd enjoy and take satisfaction from.<br /><br />I even picked the book up in the store and read the first chapter or so. It's immediately apparent that Ms. Fowler is a polished and thoroughly professional writer. She handled the voice thing without its seeming self-conscious, and within a given scene her descriptive turns of phrase and her sense of rhythm are spot on. This isn't wooden language, it moves right along with skill.<br /><br />The book isn't even going to get finished, though. It's face down on my bedroom carpet right now, steadily becoming more and more creased along the binding, and I very much doubt I'm coming back. Because, not to beat around the bush about this too much, this thing is all Caroline Bingley and no Elizabeth Bennett at all. The characters, and their collective \\"we\\" narrative voice, are all charmlessly clever, unsympathetic, rather harsh people. They discuss Austen's novels not out of love for them, but rather as a sort of arena in which to do battle: who will provide the most adroit observation about today's book? They exclude one another, quite cattily, by dismissing each other's assertions about the marginalia of the stories -- but not a one of them ever seems to have loved Jane Austen, and nobody even mentions the core of any of the books, the heart of it. These people aren't exactly hateful, and they don't hate each other, but they don't seem to be capable of any sort of love either.<br /><br />By contrast, I think Jane Austen herself had a far more loving, and a much shrewder, and a much more satisfying sense of her characters' fine points and follies and general humanity. For all that Mr. Collins in Pride and Prejudice is an oaf and a sententious fool, he's sort of likeably pathetic too. I didn't feel nearly as affectionate toward any of the characters in \\"Book Club\\" as I do toward Mr. Collins.<br /><br />Any publisher would appreciate the \\"pitch\\" for this novel. I liked it too. At 10,000 feet, as an outline, the book looks great. It just doesn't seem to have any soul, once you get closer. Nothing like Jane Austen's soul, anyway.llins in Pride and Prejudice is an oaf and a sententious fool, he's sort of likeably pathetic too.

One followed West Pointers through their careers there, and the other was this book, \\"Pledged.\\" You can probably guess what the common threads were for me as a reader. I'm quite removed from either setting -- never considered joining a fraternity, and saw military life at one remove through some close friends.<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Pledged\\" delivered what I was wanting. It's deftly written and makes an easy and still (sometimes) thought-provoking read. Ms. Robbins frames her story well, moving between storytelling and analysis easily and keeping the reader's interest despite covering an awful lot of ground. It's obvious she faced some serious challenges just in getting access to her subject, and her ability to overcome those and write a coherent breeze of a pop book is impressive.<br /><br />That said, I think this one's about on the level of \\"expose\\" that we see on TV news magazines. That has some pros and cons. It's obvious that Robbins went looking for the events that would \\"punch up\\" her story. She's selling a story. Modern journalism in a lot of ways has become about finding extremes and presenting them as a starker-than-real dialectic, rather than describing normative ranges and filling in middle ground. The news talks to us about Red and Blue states, you know?<br /><br />But does the book give its reader things to think about, and maybe to find other books or articles on? Absolutely. At least for me, the juxtaposition of stereotypes and specific examples actually made me pull back from judgments I'd previously have made about the \\"Greek\\" system. And my interest didn't stop at the immediate topic. I've been thinking about Southern culture and history lately, and \\"Pledged\\" added something there. Doesn't this sound like what a pop culture book on a topic like this should do?<br /><br />I have to say I'm taken aback by some of the apologia offered by \\"sorority girls\\" here. It's not that we didn't expect you to feel defensive. We're just amazed at what you're reacting to and how much you're tacitly admitting. Writing to express indignation that your fascinating ritual secrets have been revealed is just plain silly.  Girls, nobody cares. We don't want to know how you shake hands. (As I read those passages of the book, I thought to myself: \\"I wish the editor had pared this a little.\\")<br /><br />What we're fascinated by is the social nature of the experience -- what young women think they get from joining, whether they're willing participants in their own exploitation in some senses, and so on. The sorority members whose reviews I've read apparently accept that those social truths are real as presented in the book, or at least for a large and scary share of \\"Greeks.\\" Critics question the specific extremes in behavior -- whether all sisters drink quite as much as the \\"Alpha Rhos\\" do in \\"pre-game.\\" Or they offer the \\"It's not just the Greek world, we just get blamed for it\\" defense. (It just isn't true that everyone drinks heavily in college, people. I didn't. My friends didn't. Nobody I ever heard of drank with the numbing, dangerous regularity of the sisters in this book -- except, of course, for the fraternities near my parents' church, which threw blowout drunken parties on Saturday nights.) I haven't yet seen any reviews that say sororities and fraternities don't carry on the rather... \\"deranged,\\" would be the word... relationships that they're depicted as having here. Wow. Wow.<br /><br />The objection that Ms. Robbins only interviewed disaffected sisters is ridiculous. Firstly, the girls she followed didn't \\"de-pledge\\" and seem to have remained in their houses. Secondly, the reason Robbins resorted to those young women was because the national organizations forbade her access to others -- out of paranoia that they as much as admit to. Why are national organizations dedicating themselves to preventing access and openness intheir chapters, rather than throwing open the doors and inviting scrutiny? Something's deeply wrong with that picture.<br /><br />There's a yawning gap between the official truths being expounded in bullet-pointed lists by \\"Greek\\" officials and the actual experience of people in these organizations. Go out and use a search engine. You can find detailed lists of the clothing sisters should wear for the new academic year, down to the \\"unmentionables,\\" in ridiculous detail. In response to the ridicule those lists provoke, sorority kids post defensive messages about the benefits of sisterhood. If you don't think this book has something legitimate to say, what's the surreal disconnect on  those message boards about?<br /><br />But I'm rambling.

You already know, from reading the subtitle, whether you would find this book at all satisfying or pleasing to read. What the heck are you doing reading the reader comments? As someone who found this at the library and did actually read it, though, let me spell out that choice a tiny bit.<br />If you are a person who, watching the American Experience series on the Presidents, felt a mix of great pride and great anguish as Eisenhower failed, in the final hour, to make the Paris summit with Kruschev work -- if you could see in those events surrounding the downed U2 pilot a human tragedy both of history and of the estimable leader, Eisenhower -- this is not the book for you. If, learning that Teddy Roosevelt's beloved son Kermit had died in World War I, you ached for the man but also understood the death as a consequence of the creed he'd lived by, this is not the book for you. Those portraits were far, far too nuanced, far too understanding of both the nobility and the flaws of their public subjects. This book doesn't care to understand Carter's character except as a weapon to be used in scoring points against him. It's not interested in anything but a polemic argument. Carter becomes a sort of gadlfy demon, and his actions are invariably presented as incompetent and inherently evil.<br />If, on the other hand, what you want is to arm yourself with arguments against one of the biased liberal media's accepted truths, this is the sort of title you'll be reading. You'll very likely have heard it excerpted on an AM radio talk show, and you'll want to brush up on its arguments for later use in conducting &quot;flame wars&quot; on the Web. If what you want of the truth is that meager share, settle up to the table and dig in.<br />My advice to you, if you're one of the latter people, is to find those American Experience episodes instead. They're exceptional, they're fair, and you'll learn something more than how to conduct politics as a scorched earth war of attrition.	2004-06-06

It's great fun.<br />Richard Ellis, a capable and lively popular science author, is always wrestling with how to frame his material. His book &quot;Deep Atlantic,&quot; for example, took a long time coming together because he couldn't figure out how to narrow his subject down to a book's length. Even then it included some repetitive material, as a few reviewers noticed. I've read a handful of his other titles now, and this one and the excellent &quot;Encyclopedia of the Sea&quot; are the two where he really succeeded in figuring out how to structure things. This is an effortless read.<br />&quot;Monsters&quot; alternates between reviewing people's mythological, &quot;monstrous&quot; ideas about sea creatures and describing the animals as they actually are: you read all the Kraken stories, and then you learn about squid, and the giant squid in particular. That outline of the book works really well. First you hear the old sea yarns, and then those lead you into the marine biology. Both sides are written very engagingly.<br />And then there are the loose ends. There's a chapter in this book about &quot;blobs and globsters&quot; that I really figured I'd be bored by. Not at all. Those are the enormous things that washed up on beaches that nobody's really explained. Ellis can't write the second chapter about them -- there's no marine biology that's explained the things, not yet.<br />This book, like any good popular science, could lead you in a lot of different directions. If you're interested in Deep Sea life, Ellis's Deep Atlantic would be good -- or you could try William Broad's &quot;The Universe Below&quot; if you're more into the mechanics of submersibles and sunken ships. There are lots of books about sharks and whales of course. Ellis wrote one about the Great White shark that's supposed to be good. He also gathered lots of his giant squid material for a book on Architeuthis Dux.<br />I'd recommend starting with this one, though.

Nothing but the hair of his good, gray, old head and beard left? Well, I will have that, seeing that I cannot have more of him.\\"<br />-- \\"Hue and Cry after Christmas,\\" from the opening page of Old Christmas.<br />This book is what Washington Irving called a \\"sketchbook\\" -- a collection of impressions about something, gathered into a fictionalized story. It's a melancholy, fond evocation of fading English Christmas traditions of the author's time.<br />The story's simple: Irving sets himself in the English countryside, where he's travelling one Christmas Eve. At a country inn he runs into an old schoolmate, who invites him home to spend Christmas at the family estate. The friend's father, it turns out, dotes on all things Christmas, and has tuned his household to some of the more quaint and obscure English traditions celebrating the day. That lets Irving include lots of odd little bits and pieces of Christmas tradition, told through the old man, as part of his plot. The book covers a night and a day. The chapters are pieces of that time: the stagecoach ride is one chapter, then \\"Christmas Eve,\\" and so on through \\"Christmas Dinner.\\"<br />I read this every year lately, and it's a nice, low-key, sad and happy little way to mark the Christmases passing. Washington Irving wrote it in the early 1800s -- the dates of most of his \\"Sketch Book\\" are right around 1819 or 1820 -- and the story is mostly a reminiscence about even earlier Christmas traditions. Then it took until 1894 for this edition to be printed, with the illustrations by Caldecott. Later the facsimile edition I have was printed, in maybe the early 1980s... For a little book about Christmas past to have made it through all those years, and come down to me in this personal \\"sketch,\\" is a glad thing. Coming back to the same copy year after year makes a nice little private tradition.<br />The text to this is available in a few places on the Web. That's an okay way to get to know the language, but a facsimile of the original book, with the illustrations, is still worth the few dollars it'll cost.

It's not a history, though. Michael Capuzzo uses the 1916 shark attacks on the New Jersey coast as a lens through which to describe the America of that year. His pacing, the way he alternates between the shark and the people of the time, and his adroit use of primary sources all serve the book well. It's a fluid read... if only I trusted it.<br />\\"Close to Shore\\" is nonfiction in the sense that \\"The Perfect Storm\\" was nonfiction -- it's based on true events, and it's not really a novel, so where do you put it at the book store? It belongs in a category with television shows like \\"Walking with Dinosaurs\\" -- which presented dinosaurs in faux documentaries, speculating about an awful lot along the way. I loved \\"Dinosaurs,\\" don't get me wrong. The problem is you're never sure with this kind of stuff where the established truths leave off and the speculation begins. Here, too, it's about 1916; you don't go into the exercise with as much skepticism about what we can possibly know about a stegosaurus.<br />The glaring, enormous example of that problem in this book is: There's no way to know for sure that the shark -- or sharks -- responsible for the 1916 attacks was a great white, and there's a lot of evidence to the contrary. There's no way to know that it was an individual shark at all, to start with. More to the point, several obvious traits of the attacks, and especially the Matawan Creek attacks, fit the profile of bull shark attacks a whole lot better than they do the great white. Bull sharks, to mention the most obvious problem with the great white idea, routinely travel and can even live in fresh or brackish water like the water of Matawan Creek. People get attacked by them in circumstances like that, often in murky water. It's among the most common shark attacks. Great whites, by contrast, don't have the organ that lets bull sharks retain salinity in fresh water. They can't go there. It's not just that, though -- basically ALL the Matawan creek attack details point to bull sharks. The twisting style of the initial bite, the way the shark grabbed at feet and limbs and pulled, the apparent time it took with its first victim at the bottom of the creek, the murky water it struck in, the reported color of the shark itself -- all those things are characteristic of bull sharks. They just don't fit the great white profile. It's a huge reach to picture a great white doing anything like what this shark supposedly did. Richard Ellis, in his excellent Encyclopedia of the Sea, summarizes current opinion by saying most experts think these attacks were made by a bull shark (or sharks). In any case, as Capuzzo admits, the \\"rogue shark\\" idea has fallen into disfavor with scientists -- but the entire shark side of this story is predicated on that idea.<br />Unfortunately, unlike a true history, Capuzzo's book can't stop and speculate: were the attacks on the shoreline by different sharks than the ones 11 miles inland? Was this a great white or a bull shark? More than one shark? Instead the author continues through the whole book describing the actual thoughts, leaving alone the movements and actions, of a single juvenile great white. He's using the shark as a sort of literary character, and he doesn't want to break character. That's what'll make you think of \\"Perfect Storm,\\" in which we're given the actual thoughts of people who didn't return from the storm. How does the author know what they thought? Here we know what the shark is thinking. That's too far. What sharks in general might think would be okay. What this one particular shark felt as it was swept north on the warm waters of the gulf stream? That's a real reach. It detracts from the story. Where's that line between what he knows and what he's making up?<br />Anyway, this is a very easy and entertaining read, and I'm not dying to puncture the balloon. The human side of the story is a lovely evocation of a gone time, and the subtitle of the book -- \\"A true story of terror in an age of innocence\\" -- only starts to do justice to that. It's just, when it comes does to it, I suspect the shark side is more \\"story\\" than \\"true.\\", and the subtitle of the book -- \\"A true story of terror in an age of innocence\\" -- only starts to do justice to that.

A book like this should give its reader a sense of how spontaneous and alive history really is; I expected to realize that a bunch of seemingly inevitable events weren't really so ponderous, that the world of the past is fresh -- full of fallible people making the best choices they could.<br />The book didn't quite do that for me. It's readable, it includes a few gems, but it's just not that engaging. I didn't smile that often.<br />Partly this is just a collection of marginalia. Sure, it makes you raise your eyebrows to see Nixon thinking about a speech in case the astronauts die on the moon. When you consider it, though, any president probably would have prepared for the worst there. Whether he wrote the speech or not doesn't really get to the heart of the event -- it doesn't affect whether events happened. The book also includes the speech J.F.K. would have given on the day he was killed. That speech didn't affect whether he was shot. We can maybe hint at ways his future policies might have gone based on its text, but you know, that's hardly a lynchpin on which history turned one way or the other. (It was a fairly platitudinous speech about foreign policy through strength, by the way.)<br />In some cases the chosen tidbits don't really even fit the premise. For example, Teddy Roosevelt's speech after he was shot during a campaign appearance is included. That IS history, it happened. There's an excerpt about the use of Navajo language by the U.S. marines in World War II. That's interesting, but how does it fit this book? The marines DID that.<br />I guess what I'm saying is that this is a pleasant little browse, but it didn't hang together well enough to really grab me and get me staying up late.<br />If you want a book that's lively and fun and that really airs out your sense of American History, two fantastic titles by James Loewen will do the job: \\"Lies My Teacher Told Me\\" and \\"Lies Across America.\\" Loewen's basic approach is to contrast the bland, textbook history we all learned with real, live, primary sources about the same events. \\"Teacher\\" examines a bunch of high school history textbooks, and \\"Lies Across America\\" looks at those historical markers your Dad always stopped at. Loewen's books both made me smile and laugh out loud. I felt like reading them out loud to other people, you know? Almost History, even in its better moments, just isn't quite in their league.\\"Lies Across America.\\" Loewen's basic approach is to contrast the bland, textbook history we all learned with real, live, primary sources about the same events. \\"Teacher\\" examines a bunch of high school history textbooks, and \\"Lies Across America\\" looks at those historical markers your Dad always stopped at.

Makes sense to me, because this book is a wonderful successor to &quot;Culture Clash,&quot; Donaldson's classic set of essays about the value of operant conditioning and the flaws of other training methods.<br />&quot;Culture Clash&quot; is the word-of-mouth classic that clicker-training dog people recommend most often, at least in my experience. It's a lively, engaging book, but it's basically written as a sort of argument for operant methods rather than other training approaches, not as a practical training guide. Because of that &quot;Clash&quot; is not well-organized for use as a how-to title. It has no index, the chapters aren't organized around typical training issues, and so on.<br />Well, &quot;Power of Positive Dog Training&quot; is the practical version. The book is organized around a six-week training regimen -- there's one chapter for each week. Pat Miller does address all the differences between operant training and, say, punishment-based approaches, but she does so largely in her introductory chapters, in a way that complements the approachable, clearly-stated training course she's describing. She doesn't seem to be attacking the methods she's describing, just laying out the advantages of positive methods to win you over. When an author describes &quot;team you and your dog,&quot; you know her heart's in the right place, don't you?<br />When it comes to the training chapters, you'll love the structure of this book. Each week has some Core Exercises and some Bonus Games. They're written with a careful sense of how you're going to use them, which just works.<br />Take one of the core exercises from week 3 -- &quot;Wait.&quot; First Miller explains what the behavior is and why you need it: Wait tells your dog to stay back for a moment or two, and you might use it to keep your dog from rushing out the door when you open it. Then you get simply-stated instructions for how to train the behavior: do this, do this, when the dog does that reward it in this way, and so on. At the end of this section there's a little &quot;remember&quot; paragraph that helps to frame the instructions in terms of the overall approach. (In this case Miller reminds us we're trying to set the dog up to succeed, not trying to lure her into making a mistake we can correct.) Then we get Training Tips, which is a sort of &quot;usual questions&quot; category that addresses some of the common questions or problems that come up in teaching a given behavior. (&quot;My dog wanders off when I try to train this, what should I do?&quot;)<br />Simple enough, isn't it? Good technical writing has a way of seeming so simple that anyone could have written it. (Bad technical writing, well, that's like wading through the six languages in your VCR manual and never being sure which language you're in.)<br />The rest of this book serves to complement the training course. First you have those introductory essays. For most readers, for people who don't have a stake in punishment-based traditional methods, these six brief chapters would be a perfect introduction to positive-reinforcement training. (If you're completely convinced that the purpose of training your dog is to establish your dominance as alpha dog, well, maybe you need Jean Donaldson to needle you some.) Then you have section two, the training regimen, with six chapters for six weeks of training. Section three is built around common challenges: separation anxiety, housetraining, resource-guarding, and adjusting to children are four of the seven topics that get treated in detail.<br />The good organization continues into the back of the book. &quot;Power&quot; has five appendices with useful information like sample calendars you might use, or a list of possible treats you might not have thought of using. Finally, the index is actually useful and complete. (For some reason this is a real problem with lots of dog books; I've got a few &quot;Which breed is right for you&quot; books that don't even list breeds in the index, and &quot;Culture Clash&quot; has no index at all.)<br />Basically, this is the training book I've liked best so far. The writing style is candid and engaging, the structure is thoughtful and consistent, and as a book it just has the feel of a more mature work than most of its competition. I don't give too many five-star ratings, but I'll give one here.; I've got a few &quot;Which breed is right for you&quot; books that don't even list breeds in the index, and &quot;Culture Clash&quot; has no index at all.)<br />Basically, this is the training book I've liked best so far.

A while back, I wrote a relatively evenhanded (I hoped) review of this book, attempting to simply describe the argument from design it was making at the subcellular level. It wasn't a slam of a review; in fact I've gotten several e-mails from people who took me as being quite sympathetic toward Behe's ideas.<br />Basically Black Box is well-written, well-structured, and one can give it its due on those terms without endorsing its central arguments. Behe provides accessible, engaging descriptions of the structures he's talking about. Unlike some other \\"intelligent design\\" proponents, he chooses his argument pretty carefully. He doesn't claim to demolish macro-evolution -- he admits it at the species level for humans and other animals. He doesn't jury-rig straw man arguments for dismissing the geologic record -- a particularly silly effort made in lots of \\"creation science.\\" In general he's far shrewder than the vast majority of Darwin-bashing types. [....]<br />My earlier review was naive, though.<br />You know, it's easy to check some of the arguments in Black Box, and Behe makes some pretty sweeping claims... Not to beat around the bush about it, he exaggerates to the point where you'd call it, um, a lie. For all his descriptive skill, that makes him only a small measure better than the rest of the pop-science creationist genre. He's more eloquent, he's got some credentials that aren't tricked up, okay. But I feel misled.<br />You don't have to be a professional scientist to see through the deceptions, either. I invite you, please, to look for the several cases in this book when Behe claims evolutionary science hasn't said anything about a topic. He makes some pretty sweeping statements like that. Take the book in to a college library system, and search for the terms involved. Gee, I get lots of hits in my local college's system using those keywords; there are plenty of articles on the subjects he's claiming have been swept under evolution's rug. The references often date to before this book, too. Go ahead, take a look yourself. Search for articles on the evolutionary history of the cilia. The articles are there -- and unlike Behe's book, they were published in peer review journals, exposed to the criticism of other scientists.<br />Do you find it plausible that Behe failed to come up with sources that I can find in a simple search at my University library?

US	51768339	R2ZID691J61H5T	0425149587	680629522	Choosing a dog: your guide to picking the perfect breed nanc	Books	3	95	95	N	N	Not my personal choice	As breed guides and puppy-choosing aids go, this one just wasn't a shining light for me. It's not atrocious -- try \\"Why We Love the Dogs We Do\\" if you want truly BAD advice. It's just not the one that seems to catch the personalities of the dogs, or not the dogs I know anyway. The breed descriptions just don't win me over. They aren't quite as pedantic in tone as the Encylopedia-style listings in some other mediocre guides, sure, but they just don't quite get to the essence of a breed.<br />That reaction is based on the several breeds I've had a fair amount of exposure to. For example, there's a Newfoundland sleeping against my foot as a write this. \\"Choosing a Dog\\" describes Newfies as \\"very active for a giant breed,\\" but it makes no distinction between indoor and outdoor activity. \\"The Right Dog for You\\" has little charts that do make that distinction; \\"Paws to Consider\\" catches the personality of Newfs better. It's not that this book is harsh toward the breed, not at all -- it just doesn't give the best sense of what it's like to own a Newfoundland. It  doesn't seem to know that Newfies eat tremendous amounts primarily during their first two years, nor does it mention the overriding concern that good breeders have with not allowing them to become overweight. It says they shed, but it doesn't give you a sense of just how Newf owners come to regard epic shedding as a badge of honor, if you know what I mean.<br />Several other breeds we know seem to be slightly off in the same way. Boxers drool -- my family's had generations of them, I used to ride with their jowls on my lap on vacations -- and this book doesn't mention that. They're also aggressive with other dogs in a particularly abrupt and unpredictable way that this book doesn't quite catch. Corgis can become quite a run-around-the-house-frenetically dog, and I don't see that reflected here. (No distinction between the personalities of Cardigan and Pembroke Corgis is made, either, which struck my Corgi-owning friends as extremely odd.) I've lived with a Chinese Crested, and for a breed that's intended as a companion, Cresteds have quite a bit of sight hound chase to them. This book describes Cresteds as active, but that's not quite catching the sense of the dog. Similarly, \\"Choosing a Dog\\" mentions that Border Terriers are diggers, but it doesn't mention their tendency to bolt impulsively after things; the breed club emphasizes that to potential owners, and cautions owners against letting them off leash. The description of Cairn Terriers here says \\"a barker, but not to the same degree as a Schnauzer or a Wire Fox Terrier.\\" Cairns do bark some, but it's the unbelievably snarly noises when they play with other dogs that really strike the people I know who have one. Again, that trait is something the breed clubs, and some books, mention to people who are thinking about a Cairn. With respect to Soft-Coated Wheaten Terriers, this book doesn't even mention the spring-legged leaping that Wheatens are known for. That's an almost impossible trait to train out of that type of dog. Wheatens are also described as \\"timid,\\" which to my mind doesn't quite catch the sort of suppressed, pent-up enthusiasm Wheatens mostly seem to show people. I didn't see that personality in this book. (Also, Wheatens are often on people's lists because they're supposed to be less allergenic than other dogs, which this book didn't really address. I may have missed it, but allergies didn't seem to be on these authors' list.)<br />There are some positives here, and it sure wouldn't be the worst choice. The authors do repeatedly emphasize socialization and fair, positive training methods. The idea of a \\"Right Home\\" description for each dog is a nice one, though a lot of the listings are pretty similar to one another. (\\"Patient, confident leaders\\" are always the best choice.) I just don't see this as particularly inspired. The dogs are grouped in the same old ways -- Sporting Group, Terrier Group. If I'm a person with a nine-to-five job and allergies, where should I look? (I'd check the index under \\"allergies,\\" but there IS no index.)<br />If you want a similarly concise book on the same basic topic, easily the best I've seen is \\"Paws to Consider\\" by Sarah Wilson and Brian Kilcommin(s?). \\"Paws\\" is thoughtfully written and put together and, judging by the reactions of all the breeders and owners I read it to, hits just the right notes for each dog. It's very enjoyable to read, too -- just right.<br />A less ably-written (and edited) guide that tries to assess each breed's personality in detailed charts would be \\"The Right Dog for You\\" by Daniel Tortora. Tortora's written descriptions aren't as consistently useful as those in \\"Paws to Consider,\\" though they're sometimes really fun. Maybe his charts are a little TOO detailed and specific for the real world, but it's an interesting approach and definitely gives you a sense of a breed's general personality.son with a nine-to-five job and allergies, where should I look?

US	51768339	R1V7QUE2PVKB2J	1888047054	464329530	Culture Clash: A New Way Of Understanding The Relationship Between Humans And Domestic Dogs	Books	4	325	342	N	N	A classic that needs re-editing	Culture Clash is a good example of a classic that really needs to be recast, re-edited in some aggressive ways.<br />This book gets an incredible number of word-of-mouth recommendations from within the dog world, and for good reason. It's also somewhat exasperating, also for good reason. An updated edition might turn into a sort of Dr. Spock guide for dogs; as it is, even for its few blemishes, if you're interested in training at all -- you have a dog, you should be interested -- you need to read this one.<br />The book is basically an engagingly-written set of essays on positive-reinforcement, operant-conditioning dog training. (In a nutshell, that means concentrating on setting a dog up to succeed, and then on rewarding it when it does succeed, rather than on punishing the dog for mistakes.) Culture Clash does two things: it gives you a broad sense of why positive reinforcement techniques work, and it really, REALLY lays into old-style, aversive, leash-jerking training methods. The reason it gets recommended so much is that it's GREAT for people who have only a vague idea of how to train a dog based on what they see others doing, and who might end up with a miserable dog and a sore arm from tugging at a choke collar. Donaldson does a truly excellent job of showing you how and why positive reinforcement will help you communicate with your dog. She does a great job showing you how happy that can feel, and showing you the broad outline of how it works.<br />What she DOESN'T do especially well in this book is give you a specific, basic training regimen for your dog. That's where my editing objection comes in.<br />As I said, the chapters in this book are almost more like stand-alone essays. They don't really flow into one another as well as you might expect. Other, how-to training guides will structure themselves around common issues -- a chapter about housetraining, or sections based on a puppy's age or something. Culture Clash doesn't do that. It reads more like Jean Donaldson -- a lively, agile writer whose style and sense of humor is a delight to read -- sat down and decided to write a set of thematic articles, and like those got packaged together in the form of the book. Each essay is trying to do both the book's jobs at the same time, so we're talking about treats and clickers AND ripping into the &quot;Bad Dog&quot; school of thought simultaneously. That means the level of detail in the text varies pretty dramatically from page to page. So, for example, you'll be reading about how to train a &quot;down stay&quot; or something, and suddenly Ms. Donaldson is skewering leash-jerking in a long aside. She delivers her barbs with obvious relish and skill, she's a heck of a writer, but when you're reading to pick up practical tips, that's a somewhat frustrating style to work through.<br />So, the chapters in Culture Clash are this sort of mishmash of different material, but it's well-written and you enjoyed reading it through. Now, you remember some clever idea about how to train that &quot;down stay&quot; that Rex just can't &quot;get.&quot; You turn to the index... and there isn't one. The single easiest thing the publisher of this book NEEDS to do is include a thorough index. Argh! Frustration!<br />The other irony, of course, is that the book doesn't use positive reinforcement on the reader all that well. When Donaldson goes after the leash-jerkers, or talks about ear pinching at obedience schools, she's saying &quot;BAD DOG&quot; to the old school of dog obedience in about as loud a voice as anyone can write in. You can see why a few people take this book as a sort of personal affront. She sure isn't luring THEM along, she's just plain scolding...<br />If you're already sold on the idea of a rewards-based training regimen for your dog, I still think you'll get a lot out of this book. You might want to avoid dealing with a lot of the hard-hitting criticism, though, and choose a simpler how-to guide. &quot;The Power of Positive Dog Training&quot; by Ms. Donaldson and Pat Miller, is a more practical guide than Culture Clash. It gives you a specific, six-week training regimen. Also, Karen Pryor would be a good author for you; she has a great puppy book, and a nice little book-with-two-clickers-and-some-treats kit that sells in pet stores. Pryor spends almost no time on dissing the &quot;bad trainers,&quot; she's all about the positives.<br />(If you've got kids, you may want to go with something a little more accessible for them; there are guides specifically written for the whole family that way, but you should probably judge those by age by seeing them in a store.)tive Dog Training&quot; by Ms. Donaldson and Pat Miller, is a more practical guide than Culture Clash.

Okay, I take it back: if you haven't read any other breed references, this book will actually be counterproductive, now that I think of it...<br />Where to start?<br />First off, at least half of the text in this thing is taken up with the rich and famous and their preferred breeds. Um, who cares? Jimmy Stewart was a &quot;warm&quot; guy, so he liked Golden Retrievers. Hoop-de-doo. Wading through this junk takes up a lot of reading time.<br />Once you fight past your indifference to all the eagerly-related inside celebrity scoops, you realize Mr. Coren is attempting to use a personality inventory approach to dog selection. He has you take a little set of personality exams -- a quite rudimentary example of this sort of test, about on the level of an article in Cosmo or Women's Day -- and then use the results to choose a breed. As I said, the test is irritatingly incomplete. As another reviewer here has mentioned, the results you get are ridiculously biased against certain groups of dogs, too. It's impossible to score well for certain groups, and almost inevitable that you'll score well for others. A comparable test is included in Daniel Tortora's &quot;The Right Dog for You,&quot; only that one's more well-rounded.<br />Did I mention the way the dogs are grouped? Other books -- &quot;Paws to Consider&quot; by Kilcommins and Wilson, for example -- use interesting systems to group dogs. &quot;Paws&quot; uses groups like Nine-to-Five dogs, or non-shedding dogs, as a counter to the AKC's &quot;Working Breeds&quot; and &quot;Terriers.&quot; Why We Love... tries the same thing, but it's trying to group dog personalities in a really reductionistic way. Believe me, if you love a particular breed, you'll feel vaguely insulted at the way this book tries to stomp that breed's personality flat. The most thorough personality descriptions of the different breeds are probably in &quot;The Right Dog for You,&quot; which uses 16-some personality traits for each dog. This book describes one. &quot;Steady.&quot; &quot;Warm.&quot; Gee, does that mean it's territorial? Dog-aggressive? What DOES it mean?<br />Finally, don't even get me started on this author's strangely compulsive revelations about his own personality. The cats chapter, which amounts to a really insulting, embarrassing tirade against cats AND their owners, is probably the worst example. I can honestly say I learned much more about the author's romantic life from the chapter than I learned about cats. He phrases a fair chunk of the chapter in anecdotes about a former girlfriend, whom he is plainly misquoting and insulting throughout. No, I'm not pulling your leg. This girlfriend supposedly tells him at one point that cats are good for older people because they won't care when their owners die. Does that sound plausible to you?<br />If what you want is excellent, carefully written, well-rounded descriptions of different breeds, my personal recommendation is &quot;Paws to Consider&quot; by Brian Kilcommins and Sarah Wilson. They get to a breed's essence without writing like a ponderous encyclopedia. If you're really into the personality test approach, you'd want a copy of &quot;The Right Dog for You&quot; by Daniel Tortora. The tests in that book are sort of half-put-together, but they'll actually help you think about dogs, which this title doesn't do.<br />If, on the other hand, you want to learn about this author's internal life and whether Zsa Zsa Gabor prefers Great Danes to Yorkies, well, here's your title.

When I read most other dog books, I hear the ponderous narrator's voice from the Westminster Dog Show. This book is written in the real voices of the two authors, and it reads in that simple, direct way. I keep coming back to this one.<br />The breed descriptions in this book are just great. They aren't as long as some of the wordier books' encyclopedia-style listings, and somehow they seem to include much more information. (Partly it's just writing style; I wish technical writers were this good.) Comparing these descriptions to the lengthy temperament tables in &quot;The Right Dog for You&quot; by Daniel Tortora, &quot;Paws to Consider&quot; comes across as being a measure less objective but more genuine and intuitive and accessible. Temperament isn't described in 16 or 18 separate scales, but these are solid writers and they have a way of hitting the right note. Three different people I've shown the book to have looked for 'their' breed and immediately said something like &quot;This is right, my bassett DOES hate to have his nails clipped more than my other dog.&quot;<br />It's also nice to see a dog book that doesn't group breeds by their official (usually AKC) categories. Instead of (cue the Westminster guy's voice again) &quot;The Hounds&quot; and &quot;The Working Dogs&quot; this book has categories like &quot;The High Input, High Output Dog&quot; and &quot;The Low-Shedding Breeds.&quot; There's a category of dogs you can leave home alone for a working day. Geez, that should be in EVERY dog book. Okay, so finding a specific breed is a little harder this way, and some dogs really belong in more than one category, but it's a breath of fresh air to have a new way to think about this stuff.<br />Again, too, each breed starts with separate categories for the usual pluses and minuses you'll see in that type of dog. In just a few spare lines, they get across an awful lot: Newfoundlands are gentle giants who dream of doing everything with you and whose hearts would break if they were left in the yard alone, but they shed and drool and they're enormous. Some of my other books are surprisingly bad at getting those basic tradeoffs across. This one's well thought out and well laid out.<br />As an aside, I also love the way this book emphasizes positive reinforcement in training. They do it by using positive reinforcement... on the reader. Makes a person smile.<br />The thing this book lacks is a really thorough description of the process of buying a puppy from a good breeder. It gives you the usual mantra about reputable breeders and not puppy mills, but it doesn't tell you how to act on the advice. Personally I'm pretty impressed with Your Purebred Puppy, by Michelle Welton, for that stuff. It gives you detailed interview questions to ask, for example, and tells you specifically which health certifications you'd want to see for each breed. Its breed pages aren't as well-thought-through as those here, though.few spare lines, they get across an awful lot: Newfoundlands are gentle giants who dream of doing everything with you and whose hearts would break if they were left in the yard alone, but they shed and drool and they're enormous.

It doesn't accomplish any one of them amazingly thoroughly, though its little charts of temperamental traits are more detailed than others I've seen. It probably needs to be restructured, re-edited, to live up to its potential.<br />This book's best trait is its detailed temperament charts. Tortora's rated each breed of dog in sixteen, count 'em, sixteen &quot;Dimensions&quot; of temperament. Wow. My first reaction was that the charts give a false sense of objectivity, but poring over them gives you a broader sense of a dog's character, definitely. I've spent much more time with those charts than with the rest of the book. Just seeing someone thinking in a careful way about different traits of temperament really gives you a way to approach the whole idea of deciding on a dog. It's a nice model to follow, even if you don't completely buy the specific ratings.<br />The text descriptions of individual breeds can be really pleasing -- Tortora is a behavioral problem-solver and he includes lots of offhand anecdotes -- but they're quite brief, and they aren't satisfying next to more complete sources. Most of them start with a terse description of the dog's appearance, which along with the line drawings still don't tell me much. The book doesn't mention some pretty basic stuff about behavior, either. For example: Greyhounds tend to chase first and think later because they're &quot;sight hounds.&quot; People who own Greyhounds are full of cautions about that trait, and ways to work around it. This book doesn't mention it. The Greyhound is rated as needing lots of outdoor activity, I guess, but the &quot;potential behavioral problems&quot; mentioned don't include running into traffic at 40 mph when it sees a rabbit. Certain terriers' descriptions don't talk about digging when they really should, either. Then too, you really need to go to another source to learn that Basenjis can climb ANYTHING, which is a pretty important thing to know. (Tortora also makes another common Basenji mistake, assuming because they don't bark that they don't vocalize. Basenjis yodel, and scream, quite loudly sometimes.)<br />Getting past the breed listings, the latter half of the book is a series of rating exercises. You answer a series of questions about your social tendencies, say, and then the book provides you with a rating scale and you match yourself up with dogs. I like this idea, it's just great. It's not perfect here, though. This is the part of the book that suffers from being kind of poorly structured, at least for me.<br />For one thing, there are charts after each chunk of questions, but I don't find the charts easy to work with. It can be hard to find a particular breed on them. The whole section of the book isn't well-laid-out; it reads like a bunch of stops and starts all running together. If you open to a particular page you can't really tell where you are. A little white space and maybe some way to break up the text would help.<br />Even with a little layout help, though, I still can't see why things like the height and weight of each breed wouldn't be up with the breed descriptions, rather than described as a tallest-to-shortest range in a chart at the back of the book. It feels like the first half of the book was written separately from the second half, and they need to be edited together. I don't read references front-to-back, and the back of this one feels like it wants me to do that.<br />Speaking of the way I like to use a reference, the index to this book isn't great. Individual breeds aren't consistently in it -- all the terriers have just one reference to &quot;terriers, breeds and functions of&quot; -- and even when they are, the number of references is incomplete. It's not easy to find everything the author says about, say, Soft-Coated Wheaten Terriers.<br />This is a decent place to start in thinking about a dog. Just the model of breaking temperament down as carefully as this author has is a great tool. Once you're seriously considering any particular breed (or that mix at the pound), though, you're really going to want to see more substantial stuff about that type of dog -- from breeders, and owners, and other more complete sources of information. (Probably that would be true of any book like this. I'm not sure of any other, better choices. &quot;Your Purebred Puppy, a Buyer's Guide&quot; seems like another good possibility.)y as this author has is a great tool.

I do very much enjoy the book, and my review below reflects that. But it just gets some things wrong.<br />For example, the species of Bittersweet southern gardeners have trouble with is Celastrus Orbiculatus -- oriental bittersweet. Yep, it's highly invasive, and yes, it can &quot;consume entire forests&quot; as this author says &quot;bittersweet&quot; does. The native American Species is Celastrus Scandens. The two differ in the position of the berries on the vine, partly... and they also differ in that the native one isn't swallowing entire forests. They're hard for an intelligent amateur to tell apart when looking at an individual plant... which is exactly the problem that this book has, too.<br />There's a HUGE difference between American chestnuts -- enormous trees now nearly gone from their native range due to blight -- and the shrubby asiatic Chestnuts that were brought in by nurseries and that carried the blight into this country in the first place. That's exactly the sort of distinction a gardener interested in native plants wants to know about, and it's basically the one this book misses with the two Bittersweets. In a lot of cases it's that sort of thing that got us into native gardening in the first place. So, see, it's bad to make this kind of error in a book on native plants.<br />Again, this is a decent book that just slips up in a few spots.	2001-06-26

They aren't as lean and functional as some of the great bird ID guides, they're... pleasing, like a really engaging encyclopedia. Their layout, their spare but well-written texts, their thoughtfully done range maps, their size and weight, their durable feeling, and just the overall tone of these books all feel right, just right.<br />As a publisher, Lone Pine seems to be aiming for spots that aren't saturated with competitors. They're also taking a regional approach. So, we get a &quot;Plants of the Rocky Mountains&quot; title from Lone Pine, with trees and perennials and annuals and so on, rather than an &quot;Eastern Wildflowers&quot; or something like that.<br />This Mammals book is more of a browsing sort of guide, a reference you skim through or go to check when you've see something, rather than an identification helper you'd use with binoculars. I'm sure it'd be fine as an actual ID guide too, but the idea here isn't to get a bunch of comparable deer species onto the same page to let you compare, it's to provide enough space for each species to really come into its own. (There is a little paragraph for each animal explaining what you could mistake for it, but that's not quite the same. And anyway, how many types of bear are there in the Rockies?) I've also seen a Squirrels guide from them that seemed to follow much the same style.<br />The format's beautiful, easy to use and very consistent. Each species includes at least one illustration and one photo, along with four pages of loving description. There are nice little callouts with explanatory text about behavior and so on. It's all extremely easy on the eye.<br />Once you've used one of this company's books, you'll probably want to set a shelf aside at your cabin.	2001-06-26

Any fifth grader who's drawn little squares with capital letters and small ones knows that term, &quot;recessive.&quot; Richard Milton, on the other hand, does not understand this most basic of genetic concepts. He more than once takes &quot;recessive&quot; to be a term having to do with the unexpressed, interstitial genetic material between expressed traits. Oops!<br />On a much higher level, this book jacket characterizes Darwinism as the idea that &quot;chance is the mechanism of evolution.&quot; Milton repeats this notion, in this book and elsewhere. Wow! I'd thought it had to do with &quot;natural selection&quot; or something like that; good thing Mr. Milton's set me straight on that one...<br />This book is full, chock full, of ridiculously incompetent goof-ups of this sort. Sure, it's intellectually risible on any number of levels, but c'mon, at least get a basic biology class under your belt before you start throwing junk at the wall to see what sticks. If you don't understand what it is that Darwin said, then you don't have any place writing a book to refute it, do you?<br />This book is an embarrassment to the creationist cause. You don't want to find yourself agreeing with intellectually irresponsible, disingenuous authors like this, really. There are far better apologetics for Christian thinkers to read. In the end Michael Behe's done no more to overturn modern biology than Milton has here, but his &quot;Darwin's Black Box&quot; is at least far better written than this risible junk.	2001-01-22

Giant Squid reads almost like a &quot;best of&quot; compilation, reprising a lot of the Architeuthis Dux material from his other titles. Basically it's all been rephrased, and he has a chance here to go into more patient detail this time, but none of it is exactly new.<br />If you found this book enjoyable, I'd strongly recommend &quot;Monsters of the Sea&quot; (for the raise-the-hairs-on-your-arm mystery it calls up) and either the Encyclopedia of the Sea or Deep Atlantic (because those will show you Ellis's impressive illustrations).<br />Ellis really needs a more active editor or something. Another of these reviews was right -- he often includes short repeated passages, at times within a page of two of one another. He has a clean, accessible tone as a writer, and his drawings are distinctive and eye catching, really engaging as science illustrations go. Someone should be helping him to establish a little more continuity in his text, and shaping each book so it'll lay out gracefully around his wonderful pictures. Instead Giant Squid includes only a few drawings by Ellis himself, all repeats from other books I think, and for some reason nobody's told him to put the tiresome (and weirdly overstated) footnotes ironically bashing Jules Verne to rest. (The footnotes are all repeats, too...)<br />Short version: I'd probably recommend Monsters of the Sea, Deep Atlantic, or the Encyclopedia of the Sea first. You can come around to this later if you've got Architeuthis fever.	2001-01-06

I'm an avid Patrick O'Brian reader, one who's been through the series more than once, and I'm running through this one again right now at spare moments.<br />Maybe it's heretical to suggest not starting with the first book, but Desolation Island, H.M.S. Surprise, and The Far Side of the World are the ones I recommend to people when I'm trying to get them hooked. Master and Commander is excellent, but it seems to me like O'Brian was writing for a genre audience to start with. (The historical setting is truly wonderful and the characters are a delight, but he was writing for readers who were already interested, say, in the detailed workings of the royal shipyards.) By the time he got to Surprise he had hit his stride, at least for me. The books had stopped being &quot;Another variation on sea life during the Napoleonic age&quot; for him, and the world he was writing just feels complete and right.<br />Also, those three books all feature long, solo voyages. It's a simple point, but that plotline is easier for a beginning fan to understand and follow. In some ways it gets at the heart of O'Brian's writing best, too. The ship's community as a close, isolated society, the complex nature of Jack's choices as captain, Stephen's isolation with his secret life, the consolation they take in their friendship -- those elements all shine during the long voyages throughout the series.<br />Desolation Island, as a starting point, also includes one of the most exciting, tense chases in the series. It has a full set of complex minor characters whose fates you really do care about, and it's one of those O'Brian plots that gives you a double-take or two if you don't know where it's going. Highly recommended.	2000-12-01

There's nothing especially laid back about reading it; you're going to laugh out loud at this book, and there's plenty of hypocrisy being skewered and all that. Shepherd just lacks the sort of bitterness you expect from some other &quot;humorists.&quot; His overall tone is more amused self-deprecation than anything else.<br />In short, Jean Shepherd makes the perfect bedtime read for grownups. This particular book also happens to include the chapter or two on which the classic movie &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; was based, so it's been rereleased in a form that'll make a relatively cheap, great gift under the tree.	2000-11-27

Richard Milton may be the single least competent author I've ever run across. (Feel free to check my review page for a sense of my reading habits.) This book is a meleange of logical missteps and deliberately misleading use of source materials the likes of which I've never seen in print before. In short, if you're opposed to evolutionary theory or natural selection, you'll only be chagrined at the caliber of &quot;arguments&quot; here.<br />I can only hint at the level of misapprehension this author shows by saying Milton doesn't clearly seem to understand the differences between terms like &quot;natural selection&quot; and &quot;evolution.&quot; As a result, he has a really tough time thrashing against some of the straw men arguments he's constructed; at times, the straw men seem on the verge of winning out. Rather than informing himself before publishing a book on the subject, he's content to repeat lovely creationist arguments like &quot;Darwinism is a religion.&quot; Fine, that sounds good to the choir. The choir's already converted, though, and this book will be nigh on unintelligible for anyone else.<br />In short, this is an embarassment for either side of this debate. If you want to be in on the latest pop science titles debating evolution, Michael Behe and Richard Dawkins are your authors. Leave this risible, sloppily written, disingenuous title alone.	2000-11-22

As I finished Seth's book, two nights ago, I thought of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart. I was reminded of Okonkwo's decisions when I read of Lata's.<br />I don't want to 'give away the story,' but I felt Seth forced his plot along at several points -- particularly about three quarters of the way through, when Maan and Firoz speak to one another in Saeeda Bae's room. It read to me as if Seth had written himself into a rich world and then compromised the integrity of his characters in order to force the ending he'd originally intended to lead us to.<br />The best example I can think of is that, after 1200 pages of a limited omniscience in our narrator, Seth stops describing Lata's thoughts and emotions to us just as she's making the choice around which the entire book has been structured. I found this extremely disturbing, as if an intimate friend suddenly had developed a distant reserve toward me.<br />I agree with many of the reader comments here; when I finished this novel I felt bereft. Partly, though, that was because Seth withdrew the characters from me well before the book ended. Seeing Lata as a sort of sleepwalker rather than as an actively intelligent, emotional person was haunting. I felt she'd been beaten down. That's how she reminded me of Okonkwo, I guess. And I've been debating to myself, over the past two days, whether Seth would have intended her to come across that way.	2000-11-22

(Essentially argument from design amounts to &quot;See that watch? How could it have come about without a watchmaker? How could any of its parts have originally 'evolved' independently? If they didn't, how did the watch spring up out of nowhere?&quot; And so on.)<br />Intelligently, Behe recognizes that the argument from design has been responded to pretty thoroughlyat the species level. (For example, evolutionary theory has worked out how the bones of the ear evolved from a bone that articulated reptilian jaws.) So Darwin's Black Box, unlike countless somewhat apoplectic &quot;creationist&quot; writings, chooses the territory for its argument very carefully. Behe concedes natural selection as a force at the level of complete organisms: certain Amazon reviewers seem not to have noticed that he does allow humans and apes a common ancestor, for a glaring example.<br />The narrowly defined argument Behe wants to stake out is in the biochemical realm. There, he thinks, he can make a case for &quot;irreducible complexity.&quot; In short, he thinks he can convince us that the interdependent, complex systems that constitute such things as cilia in cells could not possibly have come about as the piecemeal result of natural selection.<br />The first half of this book is comprised of lengthy, extremely accessible and enjoyable descriptions of exactly how the smallest cellular mechanisms work. The latter half consists of an attempt to assert the irreducible complexity of those mechanisms. If cilia in cells can't be accounted for by natural selection, says Behe, then there must be intelligent design at work on that level.<br />To synopsize: Behe concedes the evolution of organisms, but argues that the complexity of life at the cellular level proves the existence of &quot;intelligent design&quot; -- of God. God, in a sentence, is in the cellular details for Behe.<br />I wouldn't dream of endorsing or refuting this book's arguments here. I'm not here to blow on already hot embers for anyone; I just thought an intelligent reader would want to understand the basic outlines of what this book tries to do. Some of the positive reviews from religious types seem not to have been based on this book at all...	2000-11-22

Framing the book with Ricci's own mnemonic imagery gives Spence a complex but perfectly coherent lens through which to write. Spence deftly allows Ricci's own images to define the scope of the narrative as well, so he isn't burdened with scholarly asides attempting to fill in the gaps with a general history.<br />This is a book of simple genius. I've reviewed several books on Amazon, and seldom given a five star rating. This wonderful book rates a five.	2000-11-22

This book is a free-wheeling, thought-provoking, incredibly fun jaunt through the range of controversies and rethinkings paleontology has seen in the past twenty years or so.<br />Robert Bakker, first of all, is probably the best popular science writer I've ever come across. His voice is accessible, full of humor and character, and he writes a lean, sharply-turned argument that's easy and fun to follow without being at all pedantic. You don't think, at all, about the welter of disparate arguments Bakker's making in this book, because he just tells them so darn well, he really does. This book is pure delight for anyone with even a passing interest in dinosaurs.<br />I will mention, again, that this is a pop science title. It's a summary of the sorts of things that show up in academic articles, and a broad, idea-spinning take on those issues and problems. If, reading some other reviews here, you get the impression Robert Bakker singlehandedly rethought the whole cold-bloodedness thing, well, don't get too carried away. Pop science books don't do that work. Peer-review journals are where the evidence lives, in science, and books like Dinosaur Heresies get the word out to you and me.<br />I would recommend this as a gift to give anyone twelve or older who has an interest in Dinosaurs. Later on someone may be enthused enough to try Jack Horner, who's slightly less accessible in my experience, and closer to the journal writers than Heresies is. Then, too, reading this book might throw you in all sorts of other directions. (I personally became really excited about prehistoric mammals.) I hate to be hackneyed, but that's what a dazzlingly good popular science book will do; it'll broaden your world and make you remember what curiosity is good for. Dinosaur Heresies does that, in spades. You'll reread it.	2000-11-20

It packs an enormous punch, though. Liang Heng, its author, experienced essentially every side of the cultural revolution in China, and his graceful, somewhat understated prose only acts as a sort of smooth surface to the roiling undercurrent of those huge events.<br />This book often gets assigned as a college-level textbook for History courses, and it's easy to see why. Liang Heng literally experienced almost everything about the cultural revolution first hand. In the course of the book, he lives both sides of almost any set of events you can think of. For example, as a young boy he's involved in a revolutionary group that's excitedly denouncing capitalist influences at its school. In a fit of enthusiasm, he draws a scathing poster of a favorite teacher. Almost immediately he feels tremendously guilty over the drawing. His father and he talk about the teacher's reaction, and Liang Heng goes to apologize. Then, just when the teacher's benevolence and the father's wisdom seem to have smoothed over this pang of overzealousness in the student, Liang Heng discovers that his father, too, has been denounced in a poster, and that he himself has been shut out of his revolutionary group -- as the son of an intellectual. Within a single day he's gone from revolutionary youth to excluded son of a reactionary. He goes home that night to find his sisters threatening to move away to live at school, so as to distance themselves from his supposedly traitorous father. His father sits whispering, almost to himself, that the children should sincerely believe in the party and Mao, and that things will turn out right if they do so.<br />This book is filled with tumultuous turns like that. Just when you've seen the sharp edge of one dilemma, it changes shape and presents another side. Throughout all those twists, Liang Heng keeps a sympathy for those around him that brings you through the book. He can understand why people caught in these events acted like they did, and he doesn't seem to really hate anyone for it despite all he's been through. His father and mother, who divorced early during the revolution because of his mother's political background, become very different objects of sympathy, but neither one is regarded with disdain. (His father, in particular, becomes the sort of quietly tragic figure you'd find in some sprawling Russian historical novel.)<br />Other English language memoirs from these years in China don't approach the startling emotional clarity of this book. Life and Death in Shanghai, in particular, comes across as both shallower and more bitter. Son of the Revolution tells the entire story, first hand, with a sort of forgiveness, a sort of understanding, that I haven't forgotten in the six years since I first read it.<br />This is worth a rare (for me) five stars.m that brings you through the book.

Reading the first chapter, I immediately trusted the author's tone and the fictional world of the book. I think that's at the heart of this novel's good reputation; Frazier's assurance, his tone, bring you along effortlessly.<br />There were several moments in the book, though, when I thought the author's voice overrode the integrity of his characters. A 20-something, illiterate mountain girl points to a farmyard chicken and solemnly intones &quot;There's your sustenance&quot; -- that's jarringly wrong. And then there were winces (for me) at forced symbolism: bears implausibly running headlong off cliffs in their desire to serve as metaphors for Inman, and so on. When you've inhabited the world of a novel for a while, you feel those missteps. They're painful.<br />I won't &quot;give away&quot; events, but the close of the story epitomizes the sort of compromise I went through as a reader. While the final chapters of the book are poignant and affecting, they also just plain jerked me around as a reader. For example, the little epilog clearly intended us to mistake the actual outcome of the plot for a moment. It was like Frazier was playing a little shell game with his characters: Oh, you thought I was talking about Inman? I reread the thing, to see if I'd missed something. No, he just clearly intended us to make a mistake, so he could fool us a bit. When you really trust an author's voice, that sort of thing feels abusive.<br />Suffice it to say that I don't think this is a perfect book. Mr. Frazier's gifts as a storyteller are its best side; when he used those gifts to manipulate me, to contrive characters or events, I was disappointed.<br />Whatever its failings, though, Cold Mountain is a convincing little world. This is a book to linger in, and I wished I had been allowed to.	2000-11-06

If you have any doubts about the lightning rod James Loewen has given us in this book and its predecessor, &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me,&quot; take a look at the few low ratings given by other Amazon readers. The code words  are all there -- he's an ivory tower academic, he's anti-confederate, it's  all &quot;political correctness,&quot; he's racist because he's  &quot;anti-white,&quot; and so on. Cages have been rattled, it's as simple  as that. Some cherished myths go down hard in these books.<br />Anyone who  dismisses this as a &quot;doctoral dissertation&quot; from someone in an  &quot;ivory tower&quot; hasn't read any dissertations, trust me. These are  funny, chatty, entertaining books. (This one in particular is a great  browse, because it's broken cleanly into sections about individual  monuments.) Loewen's voice is perfect for this tone and subject, not in any  way affected or studied; he's a likeable author, and these are enjoyable  books.<br />Loewen's overarching theme is that history would be a much more  vital, constructive force in American life if Americans were actually  exposed to its true breadth and depth. Loewen makes many impassioned  appeals to primary sources, to the voices and sentiments of actual  participants. He gets at those basic themes in a nicely straightforward,  common-sensical way -- by comparing primary sources to the schlock we're  given in their place. For my money, the humor and pathos, the melancholy  irony, in that comparison is a breath of fresh air. Lies My Teacher Told Me  used a comparison of several high school textbooks as its departure point.  Here Loewen begins by examining historical markers, asking whether each  does an adequate job of describing the history it's meant to include. He  compares the words on stone monuments to the words in, say, confederate  generals' mouths. Dusty academic argument this ain't. It's just plain fun.  (I mean, what are we to make of monuments to confederate dead in Montana?  Montana didn't have any soldiers on either side...)<br />To the criticism that  Loewen hasn't been prescriptive enough, that he doesn't say what each  monument SHOULD include, I would say -- Gee, um, he does. If you read the  essays, Loewen goes into extensive discussions about what's missing in many  museums and inscriptions. The Nimitz Museum (Museum of the Pacific War)  should include, for example, specific quotes from Nimitz about the prospect  of invading Japan -- and in any case it shouldn't depict Nimitz as taking a  position diametrically opposite from his real one. Also, both this book and  Lies My Teacher Told Me have been both general histories and wonderfully  ironic lessons in how pressures conspire to prevent real history from  reaching people. Dissecting the workings of those whitewashing forces is at  least as worthwhile as rewriting the actual texts. Loewen does do both  jobs, though, anyway.<br />But hey, don't believe me -- watch the people who  want their ... history left alone squirm, and you'll know you  should be in on the fun.idn't have any soldiers on either side...)<br />To the criticism that  Loewen hasn't been prescriptive enough, that he doesn't say what each  monument SHOULD include, I would say -- Gee, um, he does.

Both of them contrast bland myth-historical blather -- of high school textbooks  here, and of official monuments and markers in his latest -- with real,  living, primary source history. These books are just a kick; they make a  serious argument about the vitality of real history (as opposed to textbook  pablum) into a really good read.<br />Loewen's approach is very readable and  natural. In Lies My Teacher Told Me, he starts by looking at several high  school textbooks and comparing their treatments of various historical  subjects. For example, he takes a look at what each book says about the  Lincoln Douglas debates. He goes into some simple comparisons of the books  -- a few of them, for example, mention Douglas's manner of speaking and  clothes. Then, with relish, he sinks his teeth in and contrasts the books  with the story the primary sources tell. Hey -- NONE of these books  describes what the debates were about... Why are they devoting time to  Douglas's suit and not to his moral justification of slavery? Why don't  they even connect these debates to the civil war?<br />I haven't read all  the reviews on Amazon, but I'm going to guess that Loewen gets an angry  reaction from certain readers. Don't assume this author is  &quot;leftist&quot; just because, say, white supremacists get rattled  reading him. Woodrow Wilson, a president revered by many modern Democrat  sorts as a far-sighted, generally liberal figure brought down by a  misguided political feud with Henry Cabot Lodge, gets absolutely skewered  in this book. Loewen takes a scathing look at Wilson's racism -- and  touches on several implications of that racism for our more recent history.  This book is about how textbook authors dole out sanitized,  &quot;safe&quot; history that fails to give American children anything real  to make judgments by -- it is NOT about deflating any particular group's  mythology.<br />Forget all that, though, and it's still fun. Both Lies My  Teacher Told Me and Lies Across America are really engaging books. The  simple approach -- Look at what these bland textbooks say next to the  lively real history -- just works. Loewen's got a lively voice and a sharp  sense of irony. This book will give you many wry smiles, it'll stir you up,  it'll make you sad sometimes, and it'll make you laugh out loud.<br />If  you're choosing between this one and Lies Across America, I'd say this is  less browsable and slightly more serious in tone. (Lies Across America has  separate short chapters, one for each historical monument or marker, and  you can pick it up pretty much anywhere.)

The book lacks the polish  you might see in comparable hardcover gardening titles. Its pictures are  more those of an academic reference rather than a loving gardening book. I  hate to say it, but it's less inspiring for that absence.<br />I would  recommend this title as a reference for anyone in the upper midwest who's  already into gardening with natives. For people considering native plants  for the first time, there are some other nicer presentations that'll get  you more worked up. (C. Colston Burrell's book on my review page, for  example.)

It  reminded me of similar books by authors like John Toland: the characters  witness essentially all events of historical moment so that the author can  do &quot;the whole story,&quot; and that evaporates most possible suspense  about where the book's going. It's hard to work up tension over whether  lend lease will pass in those circumstances; you take the big events for  granted. In many ways I find real history to be more surprising and  suspenseful than novelizations of it.<br />That being said, Wouk's choice to  bring the novel only up to the American entry into the war was an adroit  one. He orbits around his extended Henry family, touching on its friends  and acquaintances as is convenient for the outline of the war/plot; the  personal stories have a flavor to them that makes sense in the context of  America's ambivalence about entering the fighting. For a historical epic  sort of a novel, that was a good decision.<br />The other fun side of the book  is the framing faux-history of the war from the perspective of a German  army officer. Wouk makes &quot;van Roon&quot; a figure roughly comparable  to Victor &quot;Pug&quot; Henry, his America protagonist - a staff officer  at the planning level. Partly this lets the author present the German side  of things, but you wouldn't describe the effort as unbiased. Pug has  translated van Roon's post war recapitulation of events, is the idea, and  some sly little asides sneak in along the way. Again, there's nothing  really surprising about the stuff, it's just pleasantly well done by Mr.  Wouk.<br />If you enjoyed Winds of War, or if you want to read books like it  and can't decide which ones, I would recommend two very readable history  titles:<br />* John Toland's nonfiction titles, with the glaring exception of  Day of Infamy. The Rising Sun is probably Toland's best general history,  though it's only the Pacific theater.<br />* The War, 1939-1945, edited by  Desmond Flower. An amazing collection of first person accounts that span  the war. No fictional contrivance can compare with the voices in this book,  not meaning any offense to the capable Mr. Wouk. This will keep you up very  late at night.ited by  Desmond Flower. An amazing collection of first person accounts that span  the war.

Both are elegant and still plenty of fun. Either  one would be the ideal gift for a distant grandchild, if that's why you're  on Amazon poking around.<br />Susan Jeffers' illustrations are shot through  with winter light on snow, just a relief to look at. They're also full of  pleasant little hidden treasures for the squirmy set. She uses details to  recast the darker side of the poem, maybe, because this is a children's  title. For example, the narrator's carrying a tree in his sled, to be  planted: one of the promises to keep. (Note to illustrator: In the winter,  the ground is typically frozen.)<br />Reading this aloud to children is a  gratifying experience. Give yourself that tear in your eye.	2000-08-11

My twins, five at the time we picked it up, really responded to Graeme Base's goofy popup illustrations. At that age, too, they already did enjoy Lewis Carroll's turns of language. Now, a couple of years later, both of them can recite the entire poem -- surely not JUST a testament to my brilliantly amazing children (mild self deprecation intended), but also a good measure of how well this book came through to them.<br />Another poem picturebook you might consider for kids would be the Robert Frost &quot;Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; illustrated by Susan Jeffers. Either book makes a nice gift, and if you've got a few moments sometime, if you have some time to stand a while in thought by the tumtum tree, you might even pick them up yourself.	2000-08-11

While the particular forests the book looks at are in the northeast, Tom Wessels' approach and style won't be lost on anyone  with an interest in natural history. Give this as a gift to a birding  friend, or for someone to keep in their cabin.<br />The bedrock of the book is  patient, graceful storytelling. At the outset of each chapter, Wessels  shows us a simple print of a forest. He asks us to wonder what made that  forest, and then he leads us, in unaffected voice, through his thinking as  he answers that question. Why is this maple here? Are the trees here fire  damaged? Wessels describes the outlines from which we can read a larger  story. Each chapter is a little mystery, in a sense. Those little puzzles  are fun.<br />It's apparent how carefully Forested Landscape was crafted. This  isn't just a collection of portraits; the chapters progress from one to the  next intelligently. For example, you learn how to recognize a fire in one  chapter; at the beginning of the next, Wessels starts by asking whether a  similar fire has taken place in this new spot. That's a simple transition,  but it really helps you stay in the flow of the writing. The author's smart  enough to reinforce what you've learned at the same time that he's  establishing continuity in the larger story. This book reads through  wonderfully.<br />And there's a bigger picture you're reading toward, too.  Each chapter also includes a broader natural history subject related to its  particular forest. You've seen a few trees, and you've puzzled out the sort  of setting you're looking at; now, by touching on a bigger natural  historical theme, you place that forest in the natural world as a whole.  Forested Landscape does a wonderful job of drawing you into that big  picture. How can we look at an eastern forest without thinking of the  Chestnuts that dominated there until early this century? Sure, maybe those  trees are gone now, but they're part of this story. (The chestnut blight as  told here has real pathos to it. You'll feel like doing something to bring  them back.)<br />The patient, graceful, intelligent tone of this book reminded  me of Chased By The Light, a collection of Jim Brandenberg photos taken,  one shot a day, in the northwoods of Minnesota. I'm from Minnesota, so I  took out Brandenberg's photos to look at every once in a while while I  read. Buy yourself a collection of local nature photographs, things from  your area.

I skimmed through Harbors and High Seas after each O'Brian book the last time through; leaving alone the  clearer geographical detail, this really adds depth to O'Brian's already  convincing world.<br />I would recommend this highly to fans of the series who  feel bereft at its close and long to return, to poke around a little  themselves. Harbors and High Seas is full of taking off points, tangents to  the stories that the curious reader can follow up on. A print of the  decrepit Temple, reproduced here, might spark you to pursue some detail or  other about Napoleon's Paris. The discussion of the many Desolation Islands  has lots of little sides to it that could reward some curiosity. Like the  stories, this is a sort of open-ended invitation into the historical  setting, you might say.<br />Harbors and High Seas is a &quot;companion&quot;  to the series, a complement to it, not just a reference to be consulted  when you're muddled. Don't just refer to it -- read it for fun.	2000-07-21

With his &quot;ghost units&quot; and  &quot;divisions of less than the first quality,&quot; Keegan turned my  stomach. I kept thinking of the human stories behind those stock phrases.  This book is a collection of those stories.<br />I would strongly recommend  this as a book for the general history reader. It might occasionally lose a  reader who isn't familiar with the skeleton of the war's events, as the  personal diaries from which excerpts are taken sometimes fall between the  cracks of the great events that might appear on a timeline. That isn't a  weakness; it's a strength. Those passages often bring the reader most fully  into the confusion and the real human experience of the war.<br />The great  events are well represented, at any rate, in a highly personal and  emotional way. Where the usual general history concentrates on the  innovations of blitzkreig, this book gives us the diary of Rommel - and  another journal by a 12-year-old belgian boy, waiting in an air raid  shelter for his mother to come back and trying to comfort his steadily more  anxious younger brother.<br />No book could tell this whole story, and of  course this one isn't perfect. There are times when the narrative pauses to  'fill in' some big event in an editor's voice, and when that happens I'm  jarred by the shift in tones. As a starting point, though, and just as a  read, this is without question the first book I would recommend on World  War II. The strength of the bibliography makes it a fantastic resource for  other choices later, too.<br />Very, very highly recommended.	2000-07-20

I've read segments of it to my children at bedtime -- they're six -- and they've identified easily with the little girl described in its  earliest chapters. I find some of the obligatory social studies material a  little less riveting -- the depiction of McCarthyism seems heavily colored  by hindsight, for example -- but the book as a whole won me over.<br />It  would be a mistake to think of this purely as a sendup of 1950s baseball.  Doris Kearns Goodwin does describe her fascination with the Dodgers in  doting detail, but she's doing so partly to reveal her relationship with  her father, her fellow fan. My kids and I would agree that the early  childhood here rings true, and only one of us understands box scores. Don't  let the cover throw you off.<br />A fine, loving book (and a pleasure to read  aloud).	2000-07-19

I personally don't think the  book quite manages to completely encompass &quot;The Home Front in World  War II&quot; along the way, and I probably didn't want it to; instead it  tells the story of the war through the Roosevelts' fascinating circle of  White House &quot;family&quot; members, with broader historical themes  touching on that story.<br />The personal story works. I've never read quite  this sort of parallel biography before. In a lot of ways the relationship  between FDR and his astonishingly complex, compassionate wife makes a  perfect lens through which to view the times. Goodwin has plenty of chances  to let Eleanor's various interests touch on different aspects of American  life; hardly anything escapes the first lady's list of interests and  causes, so there's no strain to include anything, that's for sure.<br />I  sometimes found myself, though, wishing the emphasis was more squarely on  biography proper. Four or five times in reading the book, I became  momentarily bogged down in passages involving, say, big picture statistics,  and wanted to concentrate on the motives and feelings of Eleanor and  Franklin again. In particular, Eleanor's various interests often serve to  introduce some new social issue, and I wanted to really understand *her*  appreciation of things rather than reading a set of statistics she wouldn't  have had access to anyway.<br />Honestly, though, No Ordinary Time breathes  life into these people. You come away from the book understanding that they  could be huge, monumental figures and yet be complex and flawed and very  human at the same time. There's no taking away from the heart of the book.  It's told well, and it makes a wonderful, rich, rewarding read.	2000-07-19
US	51768339	R13HCKDK9YHU9C	0874804639	846391944	Radiant Days - Paper	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Loving Classics of Popular Naturalism	This is a selection of many of the best known essays of Enos Mills, who's regarded as the spiritual (as well as practical) father of Rocky Mountain National Park. Mills is justly loved by people who know the park, and  deserves a broader audience along with other early environmentalist writers  like John Muir.<br />Enos Mills was very much a turn-of-the-century  naturalist. His voice is without any sort of academic affectation; he reads  like the patient, intelligent watcher that he is, but not at all like a  pedantic teacher of great and ponderous truths. Some of these stories are  essentially understated, self-deprecating adventure yarns. There are times  when you feel sure the author's exaggerating for his story's sake. Heck,  for that matter he'll refer to an animal as &quot;Mr. Ground  Squirrel.&quot; I smiled a lot while reading this -- in bemusement,  sometimes, but never in derision.<br />All those somewhat dated tones and  turns of phrase only add to the charm of this book and of Enos Mills' work  in general. Off of his pen, &quot;Mr. Ground Squirrel&quot; is a statement  of the greatest respect. You don't snicker, because his relationship with  that animal has a completely convincing integrity to it. There's a sort of  glow that comes over you, reading this kind of thing, that makes  &quot;Radiant Days&quot; a very fitting title.<br />Don't let my sendup of his  voice fool you, though. Enos Mills was an impassioned environmental  advocate -- just one whose approach, at least in writing, lacks the sort of  anger we often feel a century later in realizing what we've lost.<br />I  recommend this book to anyone who finds the indigant tone of most  environmentally concerned titles to be exhausting. Radiant Days would make  a fantastic gift to a young adult with a vaguish interest in the out of  doors, or to anyone visiting the Rockies. Get it for teenagers who loved  Raiders of the Lost Ark, too; it makes a great adventure read, with  substance and to spare.	2000-04-21

This is a great example of the historian's art, a real case in which an author, by choosing a particular way to frame a set of information, calls a past world back to  vivid life. It's a bittersweet pleasure to relive the life span of each  historical building. Millet's approach is anecdotal, like that old  relative's conversational voice.<br />Indirectly, this book also raises some  natural questions about our country's urban development. The demise of the  Twin Cities' streetcar system is particularly well described, for example.  I could see a creative professor, teaching a lower level course on urban  development, assigning this book as a text. (The same professor would also  have students view &quot;Chinatown.&quot;)<br />The book was also adapted for  television by the local (Minneapolis and Saint Paul) public station. The  program is quite entertaining, and catches the tone of the book pretty  well.<br />Larry Millet has written a few Sherlock Holmes mysteries, largely  as an excuse to present much of this same historical information in a  livelier way. If you're considering which approach to take, stick to this.  The mysteries are awful, extremely flat-footed and despiriting for an  Arthur Conan Doyle fan; this is a wonderful book.	2000-04-03

No  twists, no edge, no juice to the story at all for me.

It's also a quirky sort of book, one that uses what I'd call surrealism not for its own sake but in well chosen measure in  service of an actual story. (Imagine that.)<br />Baron in the Trees is  essentially a surrealist retelling of the enlightenment in the person of a  single obstinate child. You can fill in the blanks yourself by reading the  title and some of the other reviews here.<br />I'd highly recommend Italo  Calvino to anyone who appreciated Umberto Eco one any level. Calvino is  much less dense and strikes me as playful where Eco is more intellectually  engrossing.	2000-03-06

I will, though, warn you not to become intimidated.<br />This isn't the daunting challenge some reviewers make it out to be. Name of the Rose is an engaging read, and you don't need to become bogged down trying to completely understand the religious and political subtexts in order to appreciate it. It's a splendid, enjoyable book if you approach it as one. Nobody's testing you later. Enjoy it.<br />Personally I find Adso and William of Occam, the central characters, to be closer to stock genre characters than they should be. This isn't a harsh criticism; just an explanation of that last star denied. (I've read this four times, too, so once for each star I guess.)<br />People who read Umberto Eco really should appreciate Italo Calvino too. Calvino is far sparer, if you want a graceful read for the park. Neither author's strength is characterization, and they have similarly quirky voices, at least as I read them.	2000-03-06

It's a pleasant browse, and provides a representative sample of the choices you might make with  natives. I appreciated the straightforward tone of the writer, who  studiously avoided the pretensions of some of the more unctious coffeetable  books. Let's just say she's gardening in urban New Jersey, not in northern  California, and leave it at that.<br />On the other hand, there are some gaps  in Ms. Taylor's knowledge that make this a less than definitive reference.  The short version is that she's often recommending a plant based on the  sendup of an arboretum or public garden with which she's corresponded, and  that sometimes she hasn't done the research to back that recommendation up.  For an egregious example, she describes the American form of Bittersweet  (Celastrus Scandens) in a way that clearly demonstrates that she doesn't  know the difference between it and the invasive asian form. That sort of  slip is a real problem, both philosophically and practically, for someone  who's into native plants. Oops.<br />All in all, I'd say this is a useful book  that gets you interested in the plants, but that you should do a healthy  amount of leg work elsewhere before you plant. The research is half the fun  anyway...<br />For another native plant reference, with less species but more  reliable context and detail, try C. Colston Burrell's A Gardener's  Encyclopedia of Wildflowers.	2000-02-26

I'm thoroughly impressed with this book, which does a very good job of placing species in both natural and garden contexts. It also gives adequate treatment to the basics of native garden care in some introductory chapters.<br />A Gardener's Ency of Wildflowers is not a comprehensive reference; I haven't seen anything I'd call a definitive reference out there on native gardening. Intelligently, Burrell chooses to provide very complete descriptions of a representative sampling of 150-some native plants. In side bars, he sends up other species in slightly less detail, contrasting them with the full description he started from. The format works well. Native gardening is still at the point where you need to do a fair amount of poking around yourself to know what's appropriate to your area and your garden, and this book is a perfect starting point for that process.<br />The other positive here for me personally was that Burrell is a Minneapolis author. I happen to also be in zone four, and really appreciated the fact that the book had a very healthy complement of species that are happy in northern gardens.<br />The one absence I noticed was any detailed description of propagating each species. Good nursery catalogs -- Prairie Moon's being one -- include information on when to plant each type of seed, how long to cold stratify it, and so on. Here you get more of a basic description of how fall planting works, in an introductory chapter mostly. After a couple of years with my own garden, I can tell you that isn't quite enough to go by.	2000-02-26

At some point, to say it succinctly, O'Brian began working by rote, or anyway that's how things felt to me.<br />I finished  reading this final book two days before the author's death. Even before the  news broke, though, I had come to accept this as the last in the  series.<br />This book isn't perfect. It sometimes panders to my reverie for  the series at its height.<br />It also, though, provides us with an  incomplete, compromised, very human close to things. Maturin isn't happy,  though he lives in expectation of happiness. Aubrey is older, and if he's  wiser he's also not as bright a flame, so to speak, as he once was.<br />O'Brian might have described a conversation between Cello and Violin,  ending with a muttered irresolute harmony as the daylight through the stern  windows faded to grey. It ended that way.	2000-01-10

Watson, M.D.	Books	1	5	6	N	N	Misses the mark, especially with Sherlock himself	I make a habit of rereading a few of the original, Arthur Conan Doyle mysteries each year in early winter. This year someone gave me The Ice Palace Murders for Christmas, so I've had the chance to read the new book  with the master still fresh in my mind.<br />It's unfortunate, but this  totally misses the mark for me.<br />Without delving into the failings of the  plot, which I'd characterize as befitting a middling modern genre novel, I  have to say this book fails to capture any measure of the style and charm  of the Conan Doyle characters.<br />It also completely fails to make any  capital of the sometimes deliciously subversive deductive moments that  often carry the originals. Here Sherlock Holmes and Watson (and the shallow  introduction Rafferty) simply blunder around asking the obvious people  obvious questions. Sherlock cracks safes to get crucial documents.  Hoop-de-doo. Several times Holmes is at a loss to make any sense of  evidence around which some of the real stories made an entire mystery work.  (Recall the newsprint warnings in Hound of the Baskervilles? Here Holmes  dismisses Rafferty out of hand when it's suggested that a Garamond typeface  might indicate something in a similar note. Gee, has the author even read  the original?)<br />Even when this author tries to inject a note of the charm  of the Conan Doyle stories, his attempt is flat footed. For example, Holmes  deducts that a character has just come from a rendevous with a woman. Why?  Well, he has a long red hair on his shirt, and there's -- get ready to be  stunned at the obviousness -- lipstick on his collar. Hardly the 'Your  washbasin is on the east wall, I find' we've all come to expect.<br />I was,  to be shorter, thoroughly disappointed.	2000-01-10

The little identification signs in the nurseries are often inaccurate with the little they do say, and they're coming from such a different (&quot;if you  want to prevent the birds from eating your berries, cover the entire tree  in garish mesh&quot;) perspective, for the most part, that I never felt I  was getting anywhere.<br />The only faults with this title all have to do with  too much information. The many appendices might have been better integrated  with one another. There are times when the plant tables involve an awful  lot of flipping back and forth, and could have been more cleanly organized.  Finally, the sheer number of species of plant involved make it impossible  to do what many garden books do; often you're looking at a description like  &quot;TS&quot; (tall shrub) and wondering what shape it is, how dense, and  so on. I went to the web and used the latin names to find descriptions of  everything.<br />You'll need to go from this book to other sources to be sure  of the appearance of things, and consulting with the average nursery or  landscaper will still be necessary to discover things like when to prune.  But this is the place to start, without question, for anyone in the  midwest.	1999-05-18

Use it for a week, though. I agree with another review in being mildly  frustrated with its excessive use of symbols, often when a tiny printed  word would have done the same work. But it's indispensible, and I'd  recommend it to everyone.<br />A number of unique choices set this one apart.  At first I was somewhat irritated by the placing of broader essays on the  right page next to the species descriptions on the left. Then, with long  use, it became clear to me just how well that worked. It's the perfect  browsing format - just right for when you go to learn more about the thing  you just saw. Also, the essays are written above the individual species  level, so you can start out reading about Cowbirds and end up understanding  the issue of nest parasitism, and the human impact on birds that practice  it, far more completely than you would if you'd read Kenn Kaufmann's  individual species description. It works.<br />There are some formatting  issues here that do puzzle me. I don't really see the virtue in ordering  the birds to correspond with the order in the NGS guide. There are other  guides, to begin with, and now that we're about to get a new NGS guide,  even the page numbers are going to be wrong. In any case, I can't see how  you'd easily flip from one book to the other unless you were reading them  sequentially. Who does that?<br />But those are quibbles. This is a terrific  book, quite useful as a complement to your field guide and very nice to  just read through. It could use a face lift, but it's got a heart of gold.	1999-04-26

Next to the Birder's Handbook, which tried several funky organizational and icongraphic systems at once, Kaufman is pure readability. The attractive,  intelligent presentation here is immediately appealing. This serves double  duty as a coffee table book and reference.<br />I read both this and the  Birder's Handbook when I see something new. Kaufman gives you a solid  account of each bird, but he's limited to individual species. (There are  brief family introductions, written about at the level of the family intros  in a field guide.) The essays in Birder's Handbook are very pleasing to  browse into; in Kaufman, once you've read a species, you're on to another  species. Kaufman has nothing to say, for example, about mobbing behavior.  Birder's Handbook has a long essay, naming several species and discussing  the state of research on the subject.<br />Kaufman is also less clear about  what's missing about a bird. Birder's Handbook is held to its schematic  approach, so you immediately know when there's a question mark in a  location that's usually got a little symbol. Kaufman occasionally mentions  that something isn't well known, but you have to read into the essay to  find that.<br />As complements to a field guide, both this and The Birder's  Handbook are useful and enjoyable. I personally wouldn't be happy without  either one.	1999-04-26
US	51768339	R12I3I5Y45BYZC	0062730282	609092523	All the Birds of North America : American Bird Conservancy's Field Guide	Books	3	19	22	N	N	Okay, but I personally wouldn't use it in the field	Basically this is a try at a new organizational scheme for field guides - by habitat, generally. It doesn't really work for me when I'm hiking somewhere. On the other hand, it can be useful to read before you go out,  to see the types of things you might find in a given place you're headed  for.<br />The organizational idea of putting species together by habitat is  interesting, but it's not really that helpful when you're trying to ID  something you're seeing. For example, a beginner sees a field sparrow  singing in a smallish tree near some brushy growth on a rising slope above  a wetland: What habitat is that? In the book, I mean. Quick, the bird's  getting away.<br />The essays in the book are nice, as another review  mentions. Next to books like the Birders Handbook or Kenn Kaufmann's lives  of North American Birds, though, this doesn't even come close to providing  the full contextual information, about individual species, that you want  from the book you left at home.<br />The art, as one of the positive reviews  mentioned above, is hit and miss. There are times when birds are painfully  wrong. When I have a borderline bird, one I have doubts about, and I check  it in the National Geographic Society guide and in Griggs, the difference  in the detail and overall quality of the paintings is sometimes  embarrassing. NGS has postures right; this book has the body shape wrong a  fair amount of the time. There are some really lovely images, and some  dogs.<br />I bought this, from Amazon actually, hoping it would give me a  sometimes, when-I-feel-like-it replacement for my battered old NGS guide.  It is, as I say, a decent complement to your field guide, but it's not a  replacement for it. It's basically a middling helper ID book you can refer  to at home when the ID is confused. It's also nice to read before you head  out at all.<br />I find this to be an okay complement to the field guides I  *would* choose to bring in my pocket when I go out birding.	1999-04-26
