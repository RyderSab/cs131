There's something about losing yourself in the world of fussy and friendly little animals with startling personalities--I wish more books were written like this. I'd reccommend it for older children, maybe 9-13, and up,  because the language can be difficult. But everyone will love the story, so  read it aloud, read it to yourself, read it read it!	2000-03-23

The writing is cliche and ungrammatical, and in some cases dumb (&quot;he had to admit he cared for the bony whore&quot;??) the storyline was contrived  and unrealistic, and I was NOT interested in the naive character of Titus  Bass.	1999-09-05

The plot, although slightly unbelievable, was interesting. I cared about some of the characters and their situations. The  writing was surprisingly good, at times. But I did feel it was unrealistic.  How many problems can one girl go through in 23 years of life? She had some  BAD luck meeting the WRONG people... Some of the writing was bad, just as  some of the writing was good. I could sense when she was hurrying through a  particular passage or scene. All in all, I'll probably read another...but I  wasn't terribly impressed.	1999-08-31

It was entertaining but it doesn't compare to the great tried and true young adult series: The Anastasia books by Lois Lowry. Those are humorous and inventive, this seems as if it is a compilation of a lot of young adult  books, dealing ineffectually with every problem under the sun.	1999-08-24

I read it in high school, when all I did (and still do) was read everything I could get my hands on. I love literature, I am even majoring in creative writing in college. I UNDERSTOOD the book,  what it was trying to say, the plot, etc. I just thought it didn't do a  very good job of saying what it was trying to say. It was unnecessarily  vague (what is the reason behind trying to confuse somebody?), wordy,  high-flown and just too big. The story could have been told more  effectively as a short story, even half the length. I don't reccommend.	1999-08-24

I found this book's subject matter to be interesting (growing up in Ireland, growing up in general) but I found the narrative disjointed. A tracable story line, connectedness for characters throughout the book and  explanatory notes on just who some people and what some places are (I'm  sure I'm not the only one who didn't know) would have helped this book a  great deal. I think that the author is a good WRITER...but the book to big,  sprawling and disconnected.	1999-05-04

I've never been to LA (although now I want to go), but still I found the plot of WEETZIE BAT to be a little farfetched. But that didn't matter--the book is about character, acceptance, love and happiness. It teaches the  reader about getting along with every different type of person and how to  dream. I would reccomend this book to every reader, young and older (I am  21) to open eyes and warm hearts.	1999-04-21

I am an aspiring writer of young adult literature, and this is my favorite type of book to read (and Louise Fitzhugh is one of my favorite young adult authors). It is brave, real, honest, and funny. What a perfect heroine Emma  is! The book ends in a realistic way, and Emma keeps pushing on. This is a  character that people admire, and this is a character to which people can  relate.	1999-04-21
US	52267460	R2DIPSJBHZGUH9	0451197747	795266779	The Deep End of the Ocean	Books	2	0	0	N	N	So-so	I think that there were good and bad points about The Deep End of The Ocean. Some of the characters were outstanding, others were cardboard cut-outs. Some parts of the plot were inventive, some were predictable.  Some of the writing was very good, and some was not so good. I would have  enjoyed this book much more if I had been let more into the mind of Ben/Sam  and less into Vincent/Reese, and more into what actually happens to the  family. Vincent/Reese seemed like a way to kill time until another plot  development could be made. I would reccommend The Deep End of the Ocean to  anybody looking for a quick, but not entirely profound read.	1999-04-15

I am a creative writing major in college and I reread Louise Fitzhugh's Harriet The Spy, Sport and especially The Long Secret over and over again.
