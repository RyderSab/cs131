There is the novel itself, of course, a complex and sometimes difficult post-modernist narrative written years before the appearance of the so-called post-modernists (Alfau was, in other words, ahead of his time).  There is the history of the novel's publication, a fascinating tale in its own right.  There is the fact that Alfau, a Spaniard who came to the United States at the age of fourteen, wrote \\"Chromos\\" and his earlier novel, \\"Locos,\\" in English, rather than his native Spanish.  And there is, finally, the biography and the views of the author himself-the former enigmatic, almost mysterious, in its obscurity; the latter disturbingly reactionary, reminiscent of Ezra Pound and forcing the reader to separate the man from his work.<br />\\"Chromos\\" is a series of narratives within narratives of a coterie of Spanish immigrants living in New York City sometime between the two World Wars.  Among the main characters is Don Pedro Guzman O'Moor Algoracid, also known as Peter Guz and the Moor, and his close friend, Dr. Jose de los Rios, whom the Moor calls Dr. Jesuscristo.  It is the Moor who first tells the novel's unidentified first person narrator to write the story of Spaniards living in New York, of the \\"Americaniards\\" as he calls them:<br />\\"You should write a book about the Americaniards, somebody should-but you have not written for a long time-anyway you could not write any more about your people in Spain-have been too long away, forgotten too much-don't know what it's all about and you could not write about Americans-don't know enough-impossible ever to understand another people.  I could not understand them when I first came and every day I understand them less.  We meet, we talk, but neither knows what it's all about-total confusion.  My English was abominable when I arrived and everyday I speak it worse-impossible; can't understand a damn thing.\\"<br />It is this request that frames the narrative, the Moor mysteriously taking the reluctant narrator to an old, dark, cockroach-infested basement apartment devoid of furniture (except for a book-filled bookcase), its walls covered by chromos-chromolithographs-\\"depicting people and scenes that came to life, but more like things remembered or imagined.\\"<br />From this place, the unidentified narrator of \\"Chromos\\" relates his close relationship with the writer Garcia.  It is Garcia who provides two narratives within the larger framing story, reading aloud to the narrator from two different works-one the seemingly \\"corny\\" and salacious multi-generational saga of the rise and decline of the Sandoval family in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Spain, the other the cinematic narrative of a Spaniard named Ramos who, in a Mephistophelian bargain, is given the ability to skip through time and emigrates to America in the early twentieth century.  All the time, while Garcia narrates the stories contained in his two novels, the larger narrative of \\"Chromos\\" provides a first-person account of the day-to-day life of the Moor, Dr. de los Rios, Garcia, and the narrator.  And the narrator, too, provides another narration as he sees into the mind-sees the imagination and dreams-of the seemingly forlorn, hapless character Fulano.  Indeed, one of the most powerful narrative sequences of \\"Chromos\\" occurs near the end, when the narrator details Fulano's sordid, obsessive, sexual and homicidal dreams of a female store mannequin.<br />\\"Chromos\\" is, in short, a complex novel that reminds the reader of the post-modern writings of Borges, Calvino, Coover, Pynchon, and others.  It is, in this sense, a remarkable achievement since it was written in 1948, long before such fictions became prominent.  And this leads us to the next part of the story, the fact that while \\"Chromos\\" was written in 1948, it was not published until 1990, when it was nominated for the National Book Award.  For this, we have an editor of the Dalkey Archive to thank.  As related in a 1990 article in Newsday, reprinted at the Dalkey Archive web site ([...]<br />\\"In 1987, Steve Moore, [an editor at] a small publishing company, Dalkey Archive, found a copy of \\"Locos\\" [Alfau's 1936 novel] at a barn sale in Massachusetts.  He paid $10 for it and after reading it, immediately found Mr. Alfau's number in the Manhattan phone book.  Mr. Alfau, living alone in Chelsea, told them to publish the book if they wanted to; he didn't care what happened.  When \\"Locos\\" did reasonably well, Mr. Alfau told them to use the money for somebody else's unpublished work.  He had no use for money.  Moore asked Mr. Alfau if he had written anything else.  Mr. Alfau took \\"Chromos\\" out of the dresser where it had been since 1948.\\"<br />While a native Spaniard and Spanish speaker, Alfau wrote in English and, for this reason, he has been compared to other writers who adopted another, non-native language for writing their fictions, writers like Conrad, Beckett, Nabokov, and Brodsky.  Indeed, the first paragraph of \\"Chromos\\" adumbrates the theme not only of the immigrant living in a foreign country, but the way that immigrant experience is further occluded by language:<br />\\"The moment one learns English, complications set in.  Try as one may, one cannot elude this conclusion, one must inevitably come back to it.  This applies to all persons, including those born to the language and, at times, even more so to Latins, including Spaniards.  It manifests itself in an awareness of implications and intricacies to which one had never given a thought; it afflicts one with that officiousness of philosophy which, having no business of its own, gets in everybody's way and, in the case of Latins, they lose that racial characteristic of taking things for granted and leaving them to their own devices without inquiring into causes, motives or ends, to meddle indiscreetly into reasons which are none ofone's affair and to become not only self-conscious, but conscious of other things which never gave a damn for one's existence.\\"<br />So what is a reader of \\"Chromos\\" to make of all this?  If you believe Alfau himself, not too much.  When asked in an interview about the sale of his first novel, \\"Locos,\\" which departed drastically from the commercially accepted novels of the time, he replied:  \\"I got $250 for `Locos.'  But you are right.  In fact, I don't see how anybody could like my books or could even understand them.  They are unreadable.\\"  <br />In that same interview, published in the Spring, 1993, edition of Review of Contemporary Fiction (and reprinted at the Dalkey Archive web site), Alfau-ninety years old at the time and demonstrating his reputation as iconoclastic, opinionated, curmudgeonly, and politically incorrect-is quoted as follows:  \\"I think democracy is a disgrace.  Machiavelli was absolutely right:  the difference between tyranny and democracy is that in tyranny you need to serve only one master, whereas in a pluralistic society you have to obey many.  I always thought Generalissimo Francisco Franco was a trustworthy ruler of Spain, and thus supported him.  Since his death, the Iberian peninsula is in complete chaos.  In fact, at the time of the Spanish Civil War, I championed Franco's cause in this country as much as I could.\\"<br />While Alfau's politics and personality may seem anathema, \\"Chromos\\" is a remarkable work of literary imagination and narrative structure that should be read by anyone interested in modern and post-modern writing.  While perhaps \\"unreadable,\\" as Alfau says, by those looking for a traditional linear narrative with an unvarnished plot, \\"Chromos\\" is a joyride for those who like experimentation, complexity and intellectual pyrotechnics.	2002-02-25

At Least Until Proust	Let's begin with Nabokov's \\"Lectures on Literature,\\" where he introduces \\"Madame Bovary\\" as follows:  \\"The book is concerned with adultery and contains situations and allusions that shocked the prudish philistine government of Napoleon III.  Indeed, the novel was actually tried in a court of justice for obscenity.  Just imagine that.  As if the work of an artist could ever be obscene.\\"  Written over a five-year period, \\"Madame Bovary\\" was published serially in a magazine in 1856 where, despite editorial attempts to purge it of offensive material, it was cited for \\"offenses against morality and religion.\\"  Fortunately, Flaubert won his case and \\"Madame Bovary\\" remains to this day one of the masterpieces of French and world literature.  Indeed, in Nabokov's view, the novel's influence is notable:  \\"Without Flaubert, there would have been no Marcel Proust in France, no James Joyce in Ireland.  Chekhov in Russia would not have been quite Chekhov.\\"<br />The story of Emma Bovary is well known and uncomplicated.  Set in the provincial towns of Tostes and Yonville (it is subtitled \\"Patterns of Provincial Life\\"), with adulterous interludes in Rouen, \\"Madame Bovary\\" narrates the life of Charles Bovary and Emma Rouault.  Charles, an \\"officier de sante\\"--a licensed medical practitioner without a medical degree--meets Emma while tending to her injured father.  Charles is married at that time to the first Madame Bovary, also called Madame Dubuc, a widow and thin, ugly woman who dominates the mild-mannered Charles from the very beginning.  \\"It was his wife [Madame Dubuc] who ruled:  in front of company he had to say certain things and not others, he had to eat fish on Friday, dress the way she wanted, obey her when she ordered him to dun nonpaying patients.  She opened his mail, watched his every move, and listened through the thinness of the wall when there were women in his office.\\"<br />When Madame Dubuc dies a few short years after their marriage, it appears that Charles is fortunate, for he is not only freed from the shrewish oppression of his wife, but enabled to court and marry the beautiful Emma.  It is the eight-year marriage of Charles and Emma that embodies the tale of \\"Madame Bovary,\\" a tale marked by Emma's ennui, her dissatisfaction with the unsatisfied yearnings of bourgeois marriage in a small provincial town, her steadily growing sensual insatiability, her adulteries with a series of men.  It is this marriage, too, that gives us one of literature's great cuckolds, Charles Bovary.<br />\\"Madame Bovary\\" has often been described as a realistic novel and, insofar as it tells a seemingly ordinary tale of sensual longing and adultery while, at the same, time depicting characters and sensibilities typical of bourgeois, philistine rural France during the reign of Louis Phillipe, it is grimly realistic.  It is also, however, a deeply psychological novel, one in which Flaubert brilliantly probes the feelings, the sensations, the romantic longings and dreamscapes of Emma Bovary.  Above all, \\"Madame Bovary\\" is the apogee of the French novel prior to Proust's Parnassian achievement, a novel whose poetic language and artistic rendering transcend mere narrative and elevate Flaubert's work to that of high literary art, a novel for the ages.

Eleven years later the Commission delivered its answer in a document entitled \\"We Remember:  A Reflection on the Shoah.\\"  Perhaps not surprisingly, the Commission concluded that the Church bore no responsibility, resting its conclusion on the specious distinction between \\"anti-Semitism\\"--the doctrine that grew up in Europe in the nineteenth century and that motivated the Holocaust--and \\"anti-Judaism,\\" the doctrine that the Church preached for hundreds of years.  As David Kertzer summarized the intellectually painful semantic parsing of the Vatican Commission in his Introduction to \\"The Popes Against the Jews\\":<br />\\"According to the report, a crucial distinction must be made.  What arose in the late nineteenth century, and sprouted like a poisonous weed in the twentieth, was `anti-Semitism, based on theories contrary to the constant teaching of the Church.'  This they contrasted with `anti-Judaism,' long-standing attitudes of mistrust and hostility of which `Christians also have been guilty,' but which, in the Vatican report, had nothing to do with the hatred of the Jews that led to the Holocaust.\\"<br />In \\"The Popes Against the Jews,\\" Kertzer meticulously documents how the Vatican, and the Catholic Church throughout Europe, created fertile ground for the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany.  Kertzer's factually-based historical argument demonstrates that, contrary to the 1998 conclusion of the Vatican Commission, a more credible statement of the Church's role was made in 1939 by Roberto Farinacci, a member of Mussolini's Fascist Grand Council, while speaking on \\"The Church and the Jews\\":<br />\\"We fascist Catholics consider the Jewish problem from a strictly political point of view. . . . But it comforts our souls to know that if, as Catholics, we became anti-Semites, we owe it to the teachings that the Church has promulgated over the past twenty centuries.\\"<br />\\"The Popes Against the Jews\\" is a grim indictment of the Church's antagonistic relationship with the Jews in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Kertzer shows how this relationship was particularly heinous in the Vatican states during the years prior to Italian unification, when the religious authority of the Church was combined with secular power.  While seemingly little known today, as recently as the mid-nineteenth century the Church in Italy engaged in the kidnapping and forced baptism of Jewish children and the forced ghettoization of the Jews (including the requirement that Jews wear a yellow star). When Vatican political power began to wane in Italy, the Church directed its energies more strongly towards the propagation of the infamous myth of Jewish ritual murder-the \\"Blood Libel\\"-and the \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\\" fueling the atavistic fires of anti-Semitism and pogroms among the Catholic faithful in Europe.  In all of this, the Catholic press was deeply involved, including, as Kertzer documents, the Vatican-approved \\"L'Osservatore Romano\\" and \\"Civilta Cattolica\\" (published by the Jesuits).<br />While there is a polemical edge to Kertzer's history, it is an edge that to this reader, anyway, is unavoidable given the heinous nature of the events and attitudes he documents.  Far from a smear campaign against the Church, \\"The Popes Against the Jews\\" is a well-written, carefully researched and methodically documented historical argument that enlightens rather than misleads.	2002-02-01

While it is a remarkably vivid novel, it is also an accurate and detailed depiction of what it was like to be a struggling author in late nineteenth century England, \\"a society where,\\" as Professor Bernard Bergonzi points out in his introduction, \\"literature has become a commodity, and where the writing of fiction does not differ radically from any other form of commercial or industrial production.\\"<br />\\"New Grub Street\\" is the contrapuntal narrative of two literary figures, Edwin Reardon, a struggling novelist who aspires to write great literature without regard to its popular appeal, and Jasper Milvain, a self-centered, materialistic striver whose only concern is with achieving financial success and social position by publishing what the mass public wants to read.  As Milvain relates early in the novel, succinctly adumbrating the theme that winds through the entirety of \\"New Grub Street\\":<br />\\"Understand the difference between a man like Reardon and a man like me.  He is the old type of unpractical artist; I am the literary man of 1882.  He won't make concessions, or rather, he can't make them; he can't supply the market.  I-well, you may say that at present I do nothing; but that's a great mistake, I am learning my business.  Literature nowadays is a trade.  Putting aside men of genius, who may succeed by mere cosmic force, your successful man of letters is your skillful tradesman.  He thinks first and foremost of the markets. . . . Reardon can't do that kind of thing, he's behind his age; he sells a manuscript as if he lives in Sam Johnson's Grub Street.  But our Grub Street of today is quite a different place:  it is supplied with telegraphic communication, it knows what literary fare is in demand in every part of the world, its inhabitants are men of business, however seedy.\\"<br />Gissing brilliantly explores this theme through the lives of his characters, each drawn with stunning depth and verisimilitude.  There is, of course, Reardon, whose failure as a novelist and neurasthenic decline destroys his marriage and his life.  There is also Reardon's wife, Amy, a woman whose love for Reardon withers with the exsanguination of her husband's creative abilities.  While the manipulative and seemingly unfeeling Milvain pursues his crass aspirations, he also encourages his two sisters, Dora and Maud, to seek commercial success as writers of children's books.  And intertwining all of their lives are the myriad connections each of the characters has with the Yule family, in particular with the nearly impoverished Alfred Yule, a serious writer and literary critic, and his daughter and literary amanuensis, Marian. <br />It is Marian--struggling to reconcile the literary demands and expectations of her father with the desire to lead her own life, struggling to escape the claustrophobic world of the literary life--who ultimately, pessimistically challenges the verities of that life while sitting in its physical embodiment, the prison-like British Museum library:<br />\\"It was gloomy, and one could scarcely see to read; a taste of fog grew perceptible in the warm, headachy air. . . . She kept asking herself what was the use and purpose of such a life as she was condemned to lead.  When already there was more good literature in the world than any individual could cope with in his lifetime, here she was exhausting herself in the manufacture of printed stuff which no one even pretended to be any more than a commodity for the day's market.  What unspeakable folly! . . .  She herself would throw away her pen with joy but for the need of earning money. . . . This huge library, growing into unwieldiness, threatening to become a trackless desert of print-how intolerably it weighed upon the spirit.\\"<br />It is Marian, too, who ultimately becomes the romantic victim of Milvain's aspirations, the powerful language of Gissing's anti-romantic subplot twisting into almost gothic excess as he extends the metaphor of London's fog to Marian's sleepless depression:<br />\\"The thick black fog penetrated every corner of the house.  It could be smelt and tasted.  Such an atmosphere produces low spirited languor even in the vigorous and hopeful; to those wasted by suffering it is the very reek of the bottomless pit, poisoning the soul.  Her face colorless as the pillow, Marian lay neither sleeping nor awake in blank extremity of woe; tears now and then ran down her cheeks, and at times her body was shaken with a throe such as might result from anguish of the torture chamber.\\"<br />\\"New Grub Street\\" is deservedly regarded not only as Gissing's finest novel, but also as one of the finest novels of late nineteenth century English literature.  Grimly realistic in its depiction of what it was like to be a struggling writer in late nineteenth century London, it is also remarkable for its historical accuracy and its literary craftsmanship. If you like the realism of writers like Harding and Zola, then \\"New Grub Street\\" is a book you must read!	2002-01-29

Why did one have to wait for a completely godless Jew?\\"  It is this question that provides both the epigraph and the intellectual predicate for \\"A Godless Jew,\\" Peter Gay's erudite, brief and readable exploration of the relationship between Freud's atheism and his seminal, world-changing innovations in how mankind came to view the human mind in the twentieth century.<br />Subtitled \\"Freud, Atheism, and the Making of Psychoanalysis,\\" Gay's short book was originally embodied in three lectures delivered at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in December 1986.  It is an attempt, in Gay's words, \\"to translate [Freud's] two light-hearted rhetorical questions into three propositions.\\"  Gay states these propositions as follows:<br />\\"It was as an atheist that Freud developed psychoanalysis; it was from his atheist vantage point that he could dismiss as well-meaning but futile gestures all attempts to find common ground between faith and unbelief; it was, finally, as a particular kind of atheist, a Jewish atheist, that he was enabled to make his momentous discoveries.\\"<br />After an introduction exploring the late nineteenth century intellectual milieu in which science and religion did battle (\\"Science Against Religion: `Clericalism, There's the Enemy'\\"), wherein Gay succinctly draws a counterpoint between the thought of William James and Freud, \\"A Godless Jew\\" successively examines each of Gay's three propositions.  <br />Chapter One (\\"The Last Philosophe: `Our God Logos'\\") advances the notion that Freud was a child of the Enlightenment, a confirmed atheist who rejected all belief in supernatural faith as inconsistent with the scientific method.  \\"Freud appropriated the whole range of the Enlightenment's agenda, its ideals and its methods, its very language.\\"  In doing so, Freud saw his mission, like that of the Philosophes who preceded him more than a century earlier, as one of \\"awaken[ing] the world from the enchantment in which the magicians and priests had held it imprisoned since pagan antiquity.\\"  <br />Chapter Two (\\"In Search of Common Ground: `A Better Christian Never Was'\\") examines the antagonistic relationship between psychoanalysis and religion, an antagonism adumbrated by Freud himself:  \\"Analysis produces no new world view.  But it does not need one, for it rests on the general scientific world view with which the religious one remains incompatible.\\"  It also examines, however, the way in which many religious thinkers (including Freud's friend Pfister and the brilliant Paul Tillich) managed to absorb psychoanalysis into Christianity and Judaism through a syncretic legerdemain that simultaneously exasperates and amuses.<br />Chapter Three (\\"The Question of a Jewish Science\\") explores the relationship between Freud the Jew and Freud the scientist, for while Freud may have denied the existence of God, he never denied that he was a Jew.  The question for Gay, then, is not one of Freud's Jewish identity, but \\"just what share that identity could have had in the making of psychoanalysis.\\"  In exploring the way in one may speak of the presence or absence of a \\"Jewish quality\\" in psychoanalysis, Gay examines the professional, intellectual, tribal, and sociological meanings of such a quality.  It is an interesting, if at times unsatisfying, discussion that fails to provide the reader with a conclusion more definitive than Gay's statement that \\"Freud was a Jew, but not a Jewish scientist.\\"	2002-01-28

What I mean to say is that once I start reading one of his books, I can't stop. Nothing gets done around the house, I have less time with my wife and children, the dog doesn't get walked, and you can forget about the stack of papers I brought home from the office to review over the weekend. <br />This is exactly what happened when, on a Friday night, I decided I needed something easy to read, a page-turner, a plain old story-in short, something by Stephen King, the modern American master of the ripping yarn, replete with its baggage of cultural references no one will be able to decode a hundred years from now and deficient only if you cannot abide horror or terror or the macabre. Once I started &quot;Misery,&quot; I didn't put it down until I was finished, and I loved every reading minute of it.<br />&quot;Misery&quot; is not one of King's typical horror stories, that is, it does not require &quot;the willing suspension of disbelief&quot; that is needed when you read about telekinetic powers (&quot;Carrie&quot; or &quot;Firestarter&quot;), monsters from sewers (&quot;It&quot;), vampires (&quot;Salem's Lot&quot;), or any one of King's many other supernatural or unnatural characters (a very long list of King's books). &quot;Misery&quot; is, instead, one of King's stories that, while extreme and terrifying, is also realistically possible. It is one of his better books, written during a time when he wrote a string of similar, realistic horror stories that I consider among his best, including &quot;Dolores Claiborne,&quot; &quot;Gerald's Game&quot; and &quot;Rose Madder.&quot;<br />The plot is straightforward. Paul Sheldon is a popular author known for his series of novels featuring a character named Misery Chastain. Sheldon finally kills off Misery, thereby ridding him, once and for all, of the pulpy best selling series and allowing him to move on, living off the royalties, to write more highbrow literary novels. Sheldon has, in fact, just finished writing such a novel and is driving home, manuscript in tow (the only copy, in fact), when he drives off a road in the wilds of Colorado during a blinding snowstorm. He is severely injured and, under less fortunate circumstances, his car probably would have been buried in snow and he would have died of exposure. Instead, he has the blessed fortune to be found by Annie Wilkes, one of his most devoted fans, an avid admirer of the Misery Chastain novels, and a reclusive-and deadly-psychopath. <br />Annie, a nurse by training, takes the author to her home, where she holds him captive for several months while he resurrects Misery Chastain, writing a new novel in the series for Annie Wilkes's private enjoyment. The Babylonian Captivity pales in comparison to the mental and physical tortures that author Paul Sheldon endures, and King keeps the reader turning the pages, wondering what cruel or grisly event will follow one of Annie's many mood changes. It is vintage Stephen King, one of his better efforts, a book that I highly recommend if you're a King fan and, if your not, a good place to get some insight into King's imagination and skill as a story teller. It is also an interesting book for many other reasons, not the least of which are the way in which the plot of his novel is a kind of horror-writer's take on the relationship between author and editor, as well as between author and reader (Annie Wilkes, his mentally deranged, sadistic fan becoming not only his reader, but also his editor-in-captivity), the way in which an author who may have more serious literary aspirations can become captive to a reading public that becomes enthralled with his commercially-motivated work, and the way in which &quot;Misery,&quot; as well as several other works written around this same period, embody things going on in King's own life (see, in this regard, his autobiographical piece in his book, &quot;On Writing&quot;).<br />While &quot;Misery&quot; may not be a great work of literature by highbrow standards, it is a great piece of storytelling by an author who is, perhaps, America's foremost popular, contemporary storyteller. For that reason, if no other, it's worth putting everything aside for awhile and just reading.	2002-01-14
US	38955473	R15CX97FE3HF4M	0393960587	295639784	Candide (A Norton Critical Edition)	Books	5	38	40	N	N	Voltaire's Amusing Intellectual Masterpiece	\\"Candide,\\" subtitled \\"Optimism\\" and purporting to be \\"translated from the German of Doctor Ralph with the additions which were found in the Doctor's pocket when he died at [the Battle of] Minden in the Year of Our Lord 1759,\\" is the single work of Voltaire that continues to be read and recognized as a canonical work of Western literature.  A mere seventy-five pages long, it is an amusing and, at times, cruel book that satirically lays waste to many philosophical ideas of its time while simultaneously illuminating the mind, the temperament and the personal conflicts of its author, a man who, perhaps more than any other, came to define the intellectual spirit of eighteenth century France. <br />At its most abstract level, \\"Candide\\" examines the age-old question of why a supposedly omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent god would create a world so afflicted with evil and suffering.  This question particularly troubled Voltaire following the great Lisbon earthquake and fire in November 1755, which killed as many as forty thousand people.  <br />Hence, in the very first page of \\"Candide,\\" the reader encounters one of literature's most famous characters, Pangloss, the learned tutor of Candide, who \\"gave instruction in metaphysico-theologico-cosmoloonigology.\\" Echoing the popularizers of Leibniz, the early eighteenth century German philosopher, Pangloss espouses the notion that there cannot be cause without effect, that we live in the best of all possible worlds:<br />\\"It is clear, said he, that things cannot be otherwise than they are, for since everything is made to serve an end, everything necessarily serves the best end.  Observe: noses were made to support spectacles, hence we have spectacles.  Legs, as anyone can plainly see, were made to be breeched, and so we have breeches.  Stones were made to be shaped and to build castles with; thus My Lord has a fine castle, for the greatest Baron in the province should have the finest house; and since pigs were made to be eaten, we eat pork all year round.  Consequently, those who say everything is well are uttering mere stupidities; they should say everything is for the best.\\"<br />From the introduction of this philosophical idea, Voltaire proceeds to narrate a dizzying tale (really, a series of tales, like Chinese boxes or Russian dolls or the Arabian Nights) of the adventures of Candide, Cunegonde, Pangloss, Cacambo, and a host of other characters, adventures that include war, torture, dismemberment, and death and utterly confound any claim that we live in the best of all possible worlds.  At the same time Voltaire satirically challenges certain prevailing ideas, however, he also introduces a plethora of personal, political and historical references, thereby making \\"Candide\\" a sort of literary and intellectual cornucopia of Voltaire's thought.  In the words of Robert Adams, the able translator and editor of the Norton Critical Edition of the work, \\"`Candide' is at the same time a novel of abstract ideas with long, complex histories and a highly personal book, into which Voltaire poured an immense amount of himself-his experiences, his enmities, his learning, his desires, his anguish.\\" <br />The Norton Critical Edition of \\"Candide\\" contains extensive and useful background materials on the text, including valuable discussions of the philosophical ideas adumbrated in Voltaire's tale and excerpts from critical studies, books and letters that have been published over the years since the book was written.  Among these materials, \\"Gestation: `Candide' Assembling Itself\\", an excerpt from Haydn Mason's 1975 book on Voltaire, is particularly useful in understanding the context in which Voltaire wrote, including the effect that the catastrophe in Lisbon and the Seven Years' War had on his thinking.	2002-01-10

Di Piero, in his introduction to Leonardo Sciascia's \\"To Each His Own,\\" aptly comments that Sciascia \\"used storytelling as in instrument for investigating and attacking the ethos of a culture-the insular, mafia-saturated culture of Sicily-which he believed to be a metaphor for the world.\\"  He did this as a political journalist, as a short story writer (notably in his fine collection, \\"The Wine-Dark Sea,\\" which I also have reviewed here at Amazon) and, perhaps most effectively, as a writer of a unique type of detective story, one in which the usual investigation and solution of a crime is occluded by the lie, the secret, the collusion, and the murder that seemingly pervade Sciasica's Sicily.<br />In \\"To Each His Own,\\" a pharmacist receives a simple, threatening and anonymous letter: \\"This letter is your death sentence.  To avenge what you have done, you will die.\\"  The threat is apparently soon carried out, for a few days later the pharmacist and a close friend, Dr. Roscio, are found murdered.  The two men had been hunting and their pack of dogs returned to the town without the men, prompting much speculation and a typically Sciascian commentary on the Sicilian code of silence:<br />\\"The return of the dogs set the whole town to disputing for days and days (as will always happen when people discuss the nature of dogs) about the order of Creation, since it is not at all fair that dogs should lack the gift of speech.  No account was taken, in the creator's defense, that even had they had the gift of speech, the dogs would, in the given circumstances, have become so many mutes both with regard to the identity of the murderers and in testifying before the marshal of the carabinieri.\\" <br />From this point forward, \\"To Each His Own\\" narrates the personal investigation of the crime by Professor Laurana, a sexually repressed high school teacher who lives alone with his mother in the same house he has lived in all his life.  Professor Laurana undertakes the investigation not because he really cares to bring the perpetrator to justice, but \\"rather like the man in a living room or club who hears one of those stupid puzzles volunteered by the fools who are always eager to propose and, what is worse, to solve them, and who knows that it is a futile game and a waste of time, yet who feels obliged to solve the problem, and doggedly sets about doing so.\\"<br />Professor Laurana methodically follows the clues and, along the way, provides a narrative that illuminates the corruption, the secrecy, the complicity, and the silence that make any effort to bring a criminal to justice in Sicily \\"a futile game and a waste of time.\\"  It is a narrative sharply critical of every institution in society-the Government, the Police, the Church, the Family-and laden with commentary and erotically charged innuendo on the relationship between men and women in a patriarchal and overtly sexist, if not misogynistic, culture.  \\"To Each His Own\\" is, ultimately, a tale that ends grimly for those who seek the truth, even as the perpetrators celebrate their crimes in Sciascia's cynical Sicilian world.	2002-01-08

Le Guin until I recently picked up \\"Dancing at the Edge of the World,\\" a chronologically arranged collection of essays, talks and book reviews written by Le Guin during the period 1976 through 1988.  It is a collection that is intended, in the author's words, \\"[to] provide a sort of mental biography, a record of responses to ethical and political climates, of the transforming effect of certain literary ideas, and of the changes of a mind.\\"<br />Each of the essays listed in the table of contents is denoted with a glyph that categorizes the essay as dealing with feminism, social responsibility, literature, or travel.  This categorization gives the reader a good idea of the range of the collection and of Le Guin's interests, which extend far beyond the science fiction genre for which she is most well known.<br />The quality of the essays is uneven.  Some of the travel pieces are soporific (\\"Places Names,\\" \\"Along the Platte\\" and \\"Over the Hills and a Great Way Off\\"), although they might be more interesting to readers who have been to the places Le Guin describes.  Other pieces seem to suffer from the loss caused by transforming what were originally spoken presentations into writing.  The feminist writings in some cases are the victim of changing times.  What is useful, however, even in these weaker pieces, are Le Guin's introductions, which provide a useful contextual background that helps the reader understand the import of the essay.<br />While some of the essays are unremarkable, there also are several exceptional writings that are worth the price of admission.  I refer, in particular, to the 1988 essay, \\"The Fisherman's Daughter,\\" which provides a provocative and interesting discussion of women and writing, a text that follows in the line from Virginia Woolf's \\"A Room of One's Own\\" through Tillie Olsen's \\"Silences,\\" drawing heavily on both authors for another view of this much discussed literary/feminist theme.  I also refer to the essays from 1986, a very good year for Le Guin insofar as the six essays included here from that year all provide interesting and worthwhile glimpses at why her writing is so well regarded.  In particular, I enjoyed \\"Bryn Mawr Commencement Address\\" and \\"Text, Silence, Performance,\\" two essays that illuminate the ways in which spoken and written language, and the privileging of certain communicative forms over others, affects the world.<br />Despite the shortcomings of some of its essays, \\"Dancing at the Edge of the World\\" provides a fascinating picture of Le Guin's worldview, successfully painting the \\"mental biography\\" of one of America's more interesting and accomplished writers during one decade of her life.	2002-01-04

The original thirteen volumes were subsequently supplemented by two additional volumes, \\"The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings,\\" translated by Avrahm Yarmolinsky (a volume which is still in print under the auspices of another publisher) and the book I review here, \\"Notebook of Anton Chekhov,\\" translated by S. S. Koteliansky and Leonard Woolf.  <br />Chekhov's stories are, of course, classic examples of the genre.  In writing those stories, he was known (not surprisingly) to draw on numerous incidents from his everyday life.  As Vladimir Nabokov relates in his &quot;Lectures on Russian Literature,&quot; interpolating and quoting from an article on Chekhov:<br />&quot; 'Do you know how I write my short stories?' [Chekhov] said to Korolenko, the radical journalist and short story writer, when the latter had just made his acquaintance.  'Here's how!'  'He glanced at his table,' Korolenko tells us, 'took up the first object that met his eye--it happened to be an ash tray--placed it before me and said: &quot;If you want it you'll have a story to-morrow.  It will be called 'The Ash Tray.' &quot; ' And it seemed to Korolenko then and there that a magical transformation of that ash tray was taking place: 'Certain indefinite situations, adventures which had not yet found concrete form, were already beginning to crystallize about the ash tray.' &quot;<BR>   <BR>Chekhov regularly recorded seemingly mundane daily incidents in notebooks and diaries and later referred to them in writing his stories.  It is from this material that Koteliansky and Woolf have drawn in compiling the short (146 pages) collection of materials titled &quot;Notebook of Anton Chekhov.&quot;   While hardly an exhaustive collection of these materials, it is a useful little volume that illustrates some of Chekhov's writing habits.  <br />The diary excerpts are a mere twelve pages from Chekhov's 1896 diary.  The notebook excerpts are 130 pages from the notebooks written between 1894 and 1896.   As the translators note in their short introduction to this collection, &quot;[the] volume consists of notes, themes and sketches for works which Anton Chekhov intended to write, and are characteristic of the methods of his artistic production. If he used any material, he used to strike it out in the note-book.&quot; <br />While unfortunately out of print, &quot;Notebook of Anton Chekhov&quot; is a fascinating companion to Chekhov's stories, a little glimmer of insight into how Chekhov created the remarkably drawn pictures of nineteenth century Russian life that still enchant readers today.	2002-01-01

Schiele was a draftsman and printmaker, but was best known as a painter.  He entered the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts at the tender age of sixteen and soon became a student of August Klimt, the most well known Austrian painter of that time.  As one of the preeminent artists associated with Austrian expressionism, Schiele's paintings are transgressive depictions of contorted, erotically charged nude figures, often in provocative sexual poses and often including young girls.  Not surprisingly, Schiele's art was controversial.  Moreover, his use of adolescent girls as models for his drawings and paintings led to numerous charges of immorality.  Often, this simply meant he had to move from one small Austrian town to another, hounded by the wrath of common people who viewed him as morally repugnant.  However, in one case, Schiele was prosecuted and spent time in prison for his averred transgressions.<br />\\"Arrogance\\" is Joanna Scott's fictional account of Schiele's life, a parallax narrative that tells its tale from a series of changing and different perspectives.  Nominated for the 1991 PEN/Faulkner Award (which, regrettably, it did not win), it subsequently earned Scott a MacArthur Fellowship for her presumed literary genius.  While not a novel for readers who prefer straightforward, linear narratives, \\"Arrogance\\" is nonetheless a penetrating fictional exploration of Schiele's artistic genius as related not only from the facts of his life, but also from the imaginary inner world of the artist and those around him, including his long-time female companion, Vallie Neuzil, and a fictional female narrator who tells of her fascination and involvement with Schiele and Vallie during their residence in the small Austrian village of Neulengbach, where Schiele was arrested for corruption of minors.<br />\\"Arrogance\\" is a vivid and convincing portrait of the life and mindof the artist, a complex narrative that challenge the reader to understand and interpret that life from multiple perspectives, both biographical and imaginative. It is, in short, a brilliant example of how fiction and imagination can inform biography, how literature can be written to illuminate and inform the real.	2001-12-28

Joyce wrote the first of the fifteen stories in this collection, \\"Sisters,\\" in Ireland in 1904.  The story was published in August of that year under the pseudonym \\"Stephen Daedalus.\\"  Joyce wrote the last, longest and most famous of the stories, \\"The Dead,\\" in Rome in 1907.  The stories were published in the book known as \\"Dubliners\\" in 1914.  While there are many editions of \\"Dubliners\\" in print, the definitive edition of the work is generally considered to be the corrected text prepared by Robert Scholes in consultation with Richard Ellman, Joyce's biographer.  Random House publishes the Scholes edition under its Modern Library imprint and I recommend this edition.<br />\\"Dubliners\\" stands as one of the Ur-texts of modernism, a startlingly original collection of stories set in turn-of-the-century Dublin that began the Joycean literary project.  That project subsequently moved through the increasingly difficult, and characteristically modernist, iterations of \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\\" \\"Ulysses\\" and \\"Finnegan's Wake.\\"  Like those succeeding texts, the interested reader can find thousands of pages of commentary on \\"Dubliners,\\" the study of Joyce's works being akin to a Talmudic undertaking, an undertaking that can, if one chooses, occupy an entire life.<br />Joyce once commented that the stories of \\"Dubliners\\" constitute a \\"chapter of moral history\\" that represents the \\"first step towards the spiritual liberation of [Ireland].\\" He also said, \\"I call the series `Dubliners' to betray the soul of that hemiplegia or paralysis which many consider a city.\\"  The stories are, in other words, inherently critical (although also, at times, appreciative) of the Dublin life that Joyce abandoned, living and writing as an expatriate in Paris, Trieste, Rome, and Zurich for nearly the entirety of his adult life.<br />The stories operate on two levels.  On one level, the stories are realistic narratives of every day life in Dublin.  On another level, however, the stories are suffused with symbolism, with recurring, allusive images of spiritual, sexual and political meanings that mark a departure from nineteenth century literary realism and make \\"Dubliners\\" an enduring, and deservedly canonical, modernist narrative.<br />The first story, \\"Sisters,\\" begins with a striking example of the tone of the stories in \\"Dubliners.\\"  A young boy stands, in the evening, looking up at the shadows flickering through the window of an upstairs room where a priest is dying:  <br />\\"Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word `paralysis'.  It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word `gnomon' in the Euclid and the word `simony' in the Catechism.  But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being.  It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.\\"  <br />Thus, a vivid, realistic image appears in the reader's mind, but so does a collection of words that suggest meanings and themes that go far beyond the real, that capture physical and intellectual and religious undercurrents, the inner life of a young boy living in Dublin.<br />\\"Sisters\\" is a brilliant story, as is \\"The Dead\\" and nearly every other story in \\"Dubliners\\" (excluding, perhaps, one or two, the worst being \\"After the Race,\\" a story that Joyce reluctantly included in the collection).  Realistic in its narratives, richly allusive in its language and symbolism, \\"Dubliners\\" is one of a handful of story collections that truly deserves the label \\"classic\\" and should be read and studied by every serious reader.	2001-12-19

Stumbling upon it as a teenager in the mid-`80s, I found a space in which you could be an intellectual and a punk; where it was okay to love Kafka and comic books, Anne Sexton and the Sex Pistols, Mary McCarthy and Mary Gaitskill.  Back then, lit-crit institutions like the Partisan Review and The New York Review of Books-once breeding grounds for original minds-had settled into a stiff, stuffy worldview.  Swapping highbrow snobbery for a seductive mix of downtown cool and zealot fervor, The Voice Literary Supplement discovered a new audience-readers like me who loved books but felt alienated by the way the established magazines treated literature as a sanctuary from the funky mess of the modern world.\\"<br />\\"War of the Words\\" is organized into five distinct sections, the title of each providing a good insight into the articles that follow.<br />The first section, \\"Writers Reconsidered: New Takes on the Old Guard,\\" contains seven revisionist readings of well-known authors.  These articles include some of the most interesting writing in the collection, with Albert Mobilio providing a sympathetic and interesting take on Gertrude Stein, David Foster Wallace writing a footnote-laden, insightful reading of Dostoevsky, and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. illuminating the real significance of Langston Hughes and the need to create an African-American literary canon.  There is also a short, acerbic and largely correct assessment of John Cheever (\\"the most overrated American writer there is\\").<br />The second section, \\"Rescue Me: Snatching Writers from the Dustbin of History,\\" is an outstanding series of pieces on writers who have never quite had the audience or prominence that their writing deserved.  Here we have characteristic explorations of the writing of Zora Neal Hurston, Philip K. Dick, Thomas Bernhard, Samuel Delany, Djuna Barnes, William Goyen, Albert Murray, and Angela Carter.   <br />\\"Signs of the Times: Capturing the Cultural Moment,\\" is perhaps the most difficult and, in some respects, dated group of articles in this collection.  The articles provide, however, a very good insight into the way the VLS has engaged the cultural clashes of the past twenty years, often publishing viewpoints that don't easily fit into categories of Right and Left, Highbrow and Lowbrow.  The articles here explore such topics as queer theory, postmodernism, anthropology and whiteness, black feminism, and other cultural and intellectual flash points of the past two decades.<br />The fourth section, \\"Pulp Fiction: Obsessing over Pop Culture,\\" is a sampling of articles that demonstrate how the VLS has never fit easily into highbrow literary culture.  There's Dorothy Allison writing on Anne Rice, Geoffrey O'Brien on Classic Comics (a topic near and dear to my heart since my early literary education was largely from those wonderful cultural texts), and Greil Marcus with a long, detailed exploration of Situationism.  There's also articles on Black Romance Novels, Sammy Davis, Jr., The Andy Warhol Diaries, and Physique Magazines.  Get the picture?  The VLS doesn't discriminate in its literary/cultural explorations.<br />The last section of the book is devoted to reprinting some of the short articles that have appeared in the VLS over the years on new writers.  \\"Brave New Wave: Spotlight on Emerging Writers,\\" includes pieces on Dennis Cooper, Kathy Acker, Mary Gaitskill (one of my favorites), Nicholson Baker (another favorite), Lorrie Moore, Chang-Rae Lee, and Jonathan Lethem (who also has written a piece of his own, \\"Science Fiction's Lost Promise,\\" that is published in the \\"Pulp Fiction\\" section).<br />\\"War of the Words\\" is a very good collection of articles from the past twenty years of the VLS, a collection that I highly recommend to anyone interested in seeing new and different ways to envision and understand literature and culture at the close of the twentieth century.	2001-12-05

Rudolf suffers from sarcoidosis, a disease not described in the narrative, which is characterized by inflammation of the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, and other tissues.  Physically miserable and obsessively fearful of death, he also is a man paralyzed by his misanthropic, conflicted, exhaustingly relentless thoughts.  Trapped in his own mind, Rudolf is a literary creation directly descended from Dostoyevsky, Kafka and Beckett.<br />Rudolf has been working for ten years on a biography of Mendelssohn, yet has failed to write even the first line of his work.  \\"I had been planning it for ten years and had repeatedly failed to bring it to fruition, but now had resolved to begin writing it on the twenty-seventh of January at precisely four o'clock in the morning, after the departure of my sister.\\"  It is an intention to begin writing that recurs again and again throughout Rudolf's narrative, an intention to begin writing at a specific time in a specific location after the completion of specific preparatory tasks.  And in each instance, Rudolf fails to begin, a sign of procrastination bred by obsession or of extreme writer's block or of extreme mental imbalance.<br />When Rudolf's sister leaves the house, he still cannot begin to write.  Despite her departure, her aura remains:  \\"Although she had gone, I still felt the presence of my sister in every part of the house.  It would be impossible to imagine a person more hostile to anything intellectual than my sister.  The very thought of her robs me of my capacity for any intellectual activity, and she has always stifled at birth any intellectual projects I have had  .  .  .  There's no defense against a person like my sister, who is at once so strong and so anti-intellectual; she comes and annihilates whatever hastaken shape in one's mind as a result of exerting, indeed of over-exerting one's memory for months on end, whatever it is, even the most trifling sketch on the most trifling subject.\\"<br />This theme, Rudolf's hatred for his older, worldly sister, runs throughout his narrative, the sister becoming one among many reasons (or excuses) for Rudolf's intellectual paralysis, his inability to write, even his inability to function in day-to-day life.<br />But it is not merely his sister that Rudolf despises.  He also despises Vienna, the city where he once lived (and where his sister continues to live).  \\"Vienna has become a proletarian city through and through, for which no decent person can have anything but scorn and contempt.\\"<br />A complete recluse, his mental world bordering on solipsistic isolation, Rudolf no longer has any interest in social life of any kind.  \\"To think that I once not only loved parties,\\" he reflects, \\"but actually gave them and was capable of enjoying them!\\"  Now he sees no reason or need for the company of others, for the people Rudolf spent years trying to \\"put right\\" but who only regarded him as a \\"fool\\" for his efforts.  As Rudolf thinks, in a long, discursive interior response to his sister's claim that his desolate, morgue-like house, \\"is crying out for society\\":<br />\\"There comes a time when we actually think about these people, and then suddenly we hate them, and so we get rid of them, or they get rid of us; because we see them so clearly all at once, we have to withdraw from their company or they from ours.  For years I believed that I couldn't be alone, that I needed all these people, but in fact I don't:  I've got on perfectly well without them.\\"<br />Rudolf is isolated in his own mind, a man who cannot accept the imperfections of others and of the world, but also cannot accept his own imperfections.  And it is perhaps this, more than anything else, which explains his inability to get along in the world, his inability even to write thefirst sentence of his Mendelssohn biography.  \\"Once, twenty-five years ago, I managed to complete something on Webern in Vienna, but as soon as I completed it I burned it, because it hadn't turned out properly.\\"  As Rudolf says, near the end of his short, but exhausting, narrative:<br />\\"I've actually been observing myself for years, if not for decades; my life now consists of self-observation and self-contemplation, which naturally leads to self-condemnation, self-rejection and self-mockery.  For years I have lived in this state of self-condemnation, self-abnegation and self-mockery, in which ultimately I always have to take refuge in order to save myself.\\"<br />\\"Concrete\\" leaves the reader exhausted from Rudolf's excessive and relentless narrative, giving truth to the remarkable power of Bernhard's literary imagination and narrative voice.  It is a stunning literary achievement, perhaps the best work of one of Austria's greatest twentieth century authors.	2001-11-28

It is a novel marked by humor, but also by a subdued, bittersweet melancholy. While written in the first person, the voices are ever-shifting as the narrative moves from character to character, place to place, backward and forward in time.

The Italo-Ethiopian War lasted less than eight months, Emperor Haile Selassie's kingdom falling quickly before Italy's modern weaponry.  It was a little war that, nonetheless, implicated the great powers of Europe and foreshadowed the much bigger war to follow.<br />Evelyn Waugh was in his early 30s, already the author of four remarkable comic novels, when he accepted an assignment to cover the Italo-Ethiopian War for a London newspaper.  The enduring result of that assignment was Waugh's fifth novel, \\"Scoop,\\" a scathing satirical assault on the ethos of Fleet Street and its war correspondents, as well as on Waugh's usual suspects, the British upper classes.<br />The time is the 1930s.  There is a civil war in the obscure country of Ishmaelia and Lord Copper, the publisher of the Beast newspaper, a newspaper that \\"stands for strong, mutually antagonistic governments everywhere,\\" believes coverage of the war is imperative:<br />\\"I am in consultation with my editors on the subject.  We think it a very promising little war.  A microcosm you might say of world drama.  We propose to give it fullest publicity.  We shall have our naval, military and air experts, our squad of photographers, our colour reporters, covering the war from every angle and on every front.\\"<br />Through the influence of Mrs. Algernon Stitch, Lord Copper soon identifies John Courteney Booth, a best selling popular author, as the right man to cover the war in Ishmaelia.  Neither Lord Copper nor his inscrutable editorial staff, however, is especially well read or familiar with the current socially respectable literati.  Amidst the confusion, Mr. Salter, the foreign editor, mistakenly identifies William Booth, country bumpkin and staff writer for the Beast, as the \\"Booth\\" to whom Lord Copper was referring:<br />\\"At the back of the paper, ignominiously sandwiched between Pip and Pop, the Bedtime Pets, and the recipe for a dish named `Waffle Scramble,' lay the bi-weekly column devoted to nature: --<br />Lush Places.  Edited by William Boot, Countryman.<br />\\" `Do you suppose that's the right one?' \\"<br />\\" `Sure of it.  The Prime Minister is nuts on rural England.' \\"<br />\\" `He's supposed to have a particularly high-class style:  `Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole' . . . would that be it?' \\"<br />\\" `Yes,' said the Managing Editor.  That must be good style.  At least it doesn't sound like anything else to me.' \\"<br />Thus, William Boot, Countryman, soon finds himself on his way to Ishmaelia to cover the civil war for the Beast.  Boot hooks up with an experienced wire reporter named Corker along the way.  Corker teachers Boot the ins and outs of covering the war, a war in which reportage comes from little more than the imagination of the journalists sent to cover it and the editorial policies of their papers.  The real nature of the war correspondent's profession is suggested when Boot and Corker go to the Ishmaelia Press Bureau to obtain their credentials:  \\"Dr. Benito, the director, was away but his clerk entered their names in his ledger and gave them cards of identity.  They were small orange documents, originally printed for the registration of prostitutes.  The space for thumb-print was now filled with a passport photograph and at the head the word `journalist' substituted in neat Ishmaelite characters.\\"<br />Boot, despite his naivety and ignorance of the war correspondent's trade, inadvertently succeeds in trumping his more experienced journalistic competitors in reporting the war.  Along the way, his adventures in Ishmaelia provide the perfect Waugh vehicle for a satiric dissection of the journalistic trade and of what passes as governance in the less developed parts of the world, where tribalism and nepotism more often than not underlie the veneer of ostensibly functioning political systems.<br />Boot, of course, returns to England, where he is now a household name.  But one Boot is just as good as another, or so it seems.  In the confusion of Boots, William, the real war correspondent, thankfully returns to his country home while his doddering, half-senile Uncle Theodore fulfills his role as the center of attention at the Beast and the prominent author John Courteney Booth (the man who started all this) mistakenly ends up with a knighthood intended for William.<br />\\"Scoop\\" is another brilliant Waugh comic send-up based on real-life experience, in this case his experience as a war correspondent in Ethiopia.  It also is one of his best works, a little comic novel that will keep you in stitches from beginning to end.	2001-11-25
US	38955473	R3VNIF1J9EY4MV	0880010517	627216849	004: The Party and Other Stories: The Tales of Chekhov (Short Stories) (English and Russian Edition)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Eleven Near-Perfect Stories from The Master of the Art	In 1984, The Ecco Press published a handsome thirteen-volume edition of The Tales of Chekhov containing the highly respected, if somewhat dated, English translations of Constance Garnett.  The original thirteen volumes were subsequently supplemented by two additional volumes, \\"The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings,\\" translated by Avrahm Yarmolinsky (a volume which is still in print under the auspices of another publisher) and \\"Notebook of Anton Chekhov,\\" translated by S. S. Koteliansky and Leonard Woolf.  While I was fortunate to have purchased the entire paperback set at a pittance during a remainder sale (and it remains one of the favorites of my book collection), it is, alas, sadly out-of-print.<br />\\"The Party &amp; Other Stories,\\" volume 4 of The Ecco Press edition, contains eleven stories written during the period from the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s.  These are stories from Chekhov's so-called \\"middle period,\\" the years after Chekhov had finished his medical studies and began writing and publishing the longer, more serious psychological studies whose characteristics became a universal ascription for short stories of that sort: \\"Chekhovian.\\"  As Harold Bloom has written, \\"the formal delicacy and somber reflectiveness [of Chekhov's stories] make him the indispensable artist of the unlived life, and the major influence upon all story-writers after him.\\"<br />Every one of the stories in this volume is a remarkable example of Chekhov's ability to write in simple, straightforward fashion, while, all the time, illuminating with almost microscopic precision the internalized, psychological lives of his characters.  As one commentary on Chehov's writing during this period has noted, apropos of the stories in this volume (and in contrast to Chekhov's early humorous stories): \\"Characters are no longer perceived satirically, as social archetypes, but seen from within.  And the inner life revealed is often an unhappy one, the characters' `real life' being in sharpcontrast with their `world of desire,' reached only through memory or fantasy.\\"<br />The stories range from long to short, each a near-perfect model of the short story, worthy of enjoyment and careful study.  The longest of the stories, \\"A Woman's Kingdom,\\" tells of Anna Akimovna, the daughter of a factory owner who, as a young girl, mingled with the working classes, only to find herself the lonely, single, middle-aged heiress and proprietor of those same factories later in life.  It is a remarkable exploration of Anna's loneliness and of her yearning to return to the life of her childhood, as well as of the separation between owner and worker in an industrialized Russia.  As Anna says, longingly: \\"Yes, I'll go and get married.  I will marry in the simplest, most ordinary way and be radiant with happiness.  And, would you believe it, I will marry some plain working man, some mechanic or draughtsman.\\"<br />In the title story, \\"The Party,\\" Chekhov brilliantly probes the mind, the thoughts, the silent unhappiness and dissatisfaction of Olga Mihalovna, a pregnant, married woman who clearly does not like her philandering, brash husband or her social obligations.  In a passage that strikingly illustrates both the luster of Chekhov's art and the deep-seated discontent of the character of his story, Olga stands watching her guests, the partygoers of the story's title, glide by in boats:<br />\\"Olga Mihalovna looked at the other boats, and there, too, she saw only uninteresting, queer creatures, affected or stupid people.  She thought of all the people she knew in the district, and could not remember one person of whom one could say or think anything good.  They all seemed to her mediocre, insipid, unintelligent, narrow, false, heartless; they all said what they did not think, and did what they did not want to.  Dreariness and despair were stifling her; she longed to leave off smiling, to leap up and cry out, `I am sick of you,' and then jump out and swim to the bank.\\" <br />These are just two of the stories.  The volume also contains \\"The Kiss,\\" a story that no less a literary arbiter than Bloom considers the best of Chekhov's early stories (written in 1887, when Chekhov was 27 years old).  And the rest are equally good, demonstrating why Chekhov is considered among the greatest practitioners of the story-writer's art. <br />If you can, find this volume and the others in The Ecco Press's wonderful edition of Chekhov and read them all.  If you can't, then find another edition.  Just read Chekhov.  You will not be disappointed.	2001-11-18

There is Sir Francis Hinsley, an aging Englishman who, when he first arrived in America more than twenty years earlier was the only knight in Hollywood, President of the Cricket Club and chief screenwriter at Megalopolitan Pictures.  Now in decline, he no longer reads, writes or does much of anything except sit in a rocker, read a tawdry magazine or two, and drink whiskey and soda.  He lives with the much younger English expatriate, Dennis Barlow, a poet whose one literary success earned him an invitation to Hollywood where his screenwriting career quickly dissipated.  Barlow now works at the Happier Hunting Ground pet cemetery, an embarrassment to his English colleagues in Hollywood.  As the actor Sir Ambrose Ambercrombie tells young Barlow, in a sort of recasting of the White Man's Burden in a thoroughly modern context:<br />\\"We limeys have a peculiar position to keep up, you know, Barlow.  They may laugh at us a bit-the way we talk and the way we dress; our monocles-they may think us cliquey and stand-offish, but, by God, they respect us.  Your five-to-two is a judge of quality.  He knows what he's buying and it's only the finest type of Englishman that you meet out here.  I often feel like an ambassador Barlow.  It's a responsibility, I can tell you, and in various degrees every Englishman out here shares it.  We can't be at the top of the tree but we are all men of responsibility.  You never find an Englishman among the under-dogs-except in England, of course.  That's understood out here, thanks to the example we've set.  There are jobs that an Englishman just doesn't take.\\"<br />The stage thus set, \\"The Loved One\\" soon takes off into a dark comic narrative of the American funeral industry.  Sir Francis, no longer wanted by Megalopolitan Pictures, is turned out of his office and shunned.  Young Barlow returns home to find that Sir Francis, in despair, has hanged himself.  Appropriate funeral arrangements must be made.<br />Barlow then embarks upon his adventure in the funeral industry, making arrangements at Whispering Glades, a full-service funeral establishment and cemetery for Hollywood's rich and famous:<br />\\"Times without number since he first came to Hollywood he had heard the name of that great necropolis on the lips of others; he had read it in the local newssheets when some more than usually illustrious body was given more than usually splendid honours or some new acquisition was made to its collected masterpieces of contemporary art.  Of recent weeks his interest had been livelier and more technical because it was in humble emulation of its great neighbor that the Happier Hunting Ground was planned.  The language he daily spoke in his new trade was a patois derived from that high pure source. . . . As a missionary priest making his first visit to the Vatican, as a paramount chief of Equatorial Africa mounting the Eiffel Tower, Dennis Barlow, poet and pets' mortician drove through the Golden Gates.\\"<br />In a brilliant comic chapter, Barlow meets first the Mortuary Hostess, who explores burial options with him:<br />\\"Embalmment, of course, and after that incineration or not, according to taste.  Our crematory is on scientific principles, the heat is so intense that all inessentials are volatilized.  Some people did not like the thought that ashes of the casket and clothing were mixed with the Loved One's.  Normal disposal is by inhumement, entombment, inurement or immurement, but lately many people just lately prefer insarcophagusment. . . . That, of course, is for those for whom price is not the primary consideration.\\"<br />Afterchoosing a burial option, there is the matter of selecting appropriate garb for the deceased, viewing the various slumber rooms for Sir Francis' wake, and selecting a burial site in Whispering Glades.  As the Hostess explains:  \\"The Park is zoned.  Each zone has its own name and appropriate Work of Art.  Zones of course vary in price and within the zones the prices vary according to the proximity to the Work of Art.\\"  And the Park is, of course, restricted to Caucasians:  \\"The Dreamer has made that rule for the sake of the Waiting Ones.  In their time of trial they prefer to be with their own people.\\" <br />Barlow then moves on to the Funeral Director, who, in a brilliant passage of dark comic wit, explains the benefits of Before Need Arrangements to Barlow, trying to sell him on the need for making his own funeral arrangements while he's young.  <br />Finally, young Barlow is introduced to the mortuary cosmetician, Aimee Thanatogenos, and the embalmer, Mr. Joyboy.  It is here that the real plot begins, for the second half of \\"The Loved One\\" brilliantly narrates an offbeat love triangle among Barlow, Aimee and Joyboy that ends in a darkly comic way that only Waugh could imagine.  <br />\\"The Loved One\\" is a short, brilliant, dark, and funny comic novel that represents Waugh at his best.  Read and enjoy!	2001-11-17

The \\"Handbook\\" has nearly one thousand entries, large and small, providing comprehensive coverage, in a single volume, of every aspect of Russian literature during the past ten centuries.  A large format book with small print and double columns on each page, the \\"Handbook\\" contains entries written by over one hundred leading scholars and ably edited by Victor Terras.<br />The entries range from one or two lines to several thousand words over several pages.  There are biographical entries of Russian authors, little and well known, as well as entries on various genres, historical periods, literary movements, literary journals and periodicals, and critical theories.  Each entry includes a bibliography and, in addition, there is a useful general bibliography, broken out by historical periods, at the end of the book.  The \\"Handbook\\" is, in other words, a perfect reference and entrée into the world of Russian literature.  I find myself dipping into this book often, at random, and never fail to learn something new and interesting.  I also use it as a valuable source of background reading when I sit down to read a Russian author.  <br />The only shortcomings of the \\"Handbook\\" are that its print is very small (allowing the book, of course, to cram an immense amount of information in less than 600 pages) and that it devotes little coverage to authors of roughly the last quarter of the twentieth century, including some of the so-called \\"dissident\\" authors who wrote in the years immediately preceding publication (a shortcoming, however, that is excusable because most of the research for the \\"Handbook\\" was done in the early 1980s and the book was published in 1985).  Also, while the bibliographies are useful for the casual reader, serious research requires reference to more recent sources.	2001-11-16

The pieces originally appeared in The New York Times Book Review, The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, and Vanity Fair.  There is nothing really new in this collection, some of the interviews going back nearly thirty years and addressing literary matters that are now of no more than historical interest.<br />Apart from his own writing, Roth has been involved over the years in publishing the work of Eastern European authors.  I think, especially, of the numerous books published by Penguin, with Roth's imprimatur, in the \\"Writers from the Other Europe\\" series. I also think of Roth's active support (through PEN and otherwise) of those writers who were, prior to the dissolution of the Soviet monolith, writing under the repression of Eastern Bloc governments.  Accordingly, and not surprisingly, the most interesting of the pieces in \\"Shop Talk\\" are the contrapuntal interviews with the Czech authors, Ivan Klima (interviewed in 1990) and Milan Kundera (interviewed in 1980).  While these two interviews are, alas, somewhat dated, they do provide interesting insights into the literary-historical struggle that marked writing from that country over the past several decades.<br />\\"Shop Talk\\" also contains interviews with the late Primo Levi (from 1986) and Aharon Appelfeld (from 1988) that provide useful, albeit well-known, insights into the biographical peculiarities that have informed their writing.  There are also shorter interviews with the late Isaac Bashevis Singer (from 1976) on the topic of Bruno Schulz (another Eastern European writer) and the Irish writer Edna O'Brien.  <br />In addition to the interviews, there are three other pieces.  One is a short vignette of Roth's relationship with Bernard Malamud, published shortly after Malamud's death in March of 1986.  The second is a similar piece on the artist Philip Guston, who became a friend of Roth's while both lived in Woodstock, New York, in the 1970s.  The article contains several whimsical illustrations that Guston gave Roth depicting Roth's character, David Kepesh, the professor who turned into a female breast in Roth's novel \\"The Breast.\\"  Last, there is a discussion of the works of Saul Bellow, the most recent of the pieces in this collection (published in The New Yorker in 2000).  It is a discussion that can be fully appreciated only if you've read Bellow's works.<br />\\"Shop Talk\\" is, in short, a useful compendium of previous published pieces, albeit a compendium which provides nothing new.  It would have benefited, perhaps, from an introductory essay from Roth to place these pieces in perspective.	2001-11-16

No, Literary Master	In the July 2001 issue of The Atlantic Monthly readers were treated to the pinheaded literary musings of one B. R. Myers in an article titled \\"A Reader's Manifesto: An Attack on the Growing Pretentiousness of American Literary Prose.\\"  More recently, we have witnessed the literary dust-up between Jonathan Franzen, a serious writer who has written a profoundly serious novel-\\"The Corrections\\"-and the Popular Television High Priestess of Literature, none other than Oprah Winfrey herself.  That dust-up has, of course, spilled over into some of the Amazon reviews of Franzen's book, most notably by those who bought the Oprah label only to find out that the \\"The Corrections\\" is actually literature, contains Big Words and Big Thoughts, and even requires, for the uninitiated or the unknowing, a prop so dramatic as a dictionary.  Oprah has, of course, done the literary world a favor (and Franzen has as much as acknowledged this in his comments on the ambivalence of being an \\"Oprah Selection\\") because her endorsement has been an accelerant for the best-selling success of a literary novel-a highly unusual occurrence in American popular culture.  <br />With the foregoing preamble in mind (and without intending to denigrate the virtues of good old-fashioned storytelling, simple language and straight-forward linear narrative), Paul West's \\"Master Class\\" is a refreshing anodyne to the popular tendency towards literary debasement.  West is the serious and prolific author of more than twenty works of fiction and more than a half-dozen works of non-fiction, all of them marked by linguistic pyrotechnics and a willingness to expand and experiment with language in ways that make literature more than just storytelling.<br />\\"Master Class\\" relates West's last graduate seminar in fiction writing.  The book contains a short appendix of \\"Dramatis Personae\\" providing brief biographies of each of the students in the class and the narrative itself focuses, in each chapter, on a critical discussion of the story or novel of one of the students.  To say this, however, is to simplify-and West's writing style and approach to literature is never simple.  In fact, the use of this structure is really the starting point for West's streaming, fragmented and difficult commentary on writing fiction.  <br />West's approach to literature becomes apparent early in \\"Master Class,\\" when he talks about the first sentence of a story or novel.  The advice is simple and pragmatic:  \\"Never begin with a dull phrase.\\"  But what, exactly, does West mean by this?  He means make the sentence difficult for the reader, invert its order, place the subject and the verb at the end.  He means, in other words, do things that immediately speak of literary pretension in the minds of the simplifiers.  \\"Skip what the words mean; they're just nonce words . . . Gather up all that is strange . . . , a fistful of novelty, and make the reader assimilate it before passing on to the noun or pronoun, thus ensuring the attractive, sensuous part of the statement gets you off to a good start that keeps its momentum all through, shutting out the rest of the world.\\"  In other words, \\"make the reader concentrate.\\"<br />\\"Master Class\\" is a densely written, difficult and allusive exploration of approaches to writing that will reward the serious reader.  It does, however, require the reader to bring to the text an expansive knowledge of literature, for West's discussions, examples and allusions are unintelligible to the uninitiated.  For this reason, West will not sit well with those readers who are disinclined to the self-consciously literary, for both West's persona in this book, as well as West's views of literature, are highbrow and intellectually demanding.  Here's a taste of \\"Master Class,\\" a passage where West sarcastically takes issue with the American emphasis on \\"no-nonsense\\"-i.e., pragmatic, straight-forward, action-driven-fiction at the expense of cerebrally demanding literary fiction:<br />\\"Checkthrough the schools of prose writing and find the no-nonsense criterion solidly established, the list of self-indulgent malefactors clearly posted, behaving as if they were French or Spanish.  The English too have their version of this, only too readily dismissing Woolf and company as pansy writers besotted with surfaces and conversation, as Sarraute calls it.  I suppose the view never dies that fiction should be matter-of-fact and straightforward because anything further demands thought, and this is something for which the high schools have trained almost nobody.\\"<br />Similarly, in another passage in which West rues the contemporary literary insignificance of Sir Thomas Browne, Rabelais, Beckett, Lispector, Woolf, and Sarraute (the references themselves being a remarkable litmus indicating West's perspective), a world where MBA's preside over publishing houses and all writers are encouraged to write alike \\"the same corrugated cardboard prose,&quot; he writes:<br />\\"If there's a battle of the books, it was over long ago with the arrival onstage of a huge skim-reading public that cares no more about sentences than about how an ostrich wipes its rear.  These are the condom readers, I suppose, to be seen at airports and on planes, racing ahead through their page-turners to a destiny as illusory as the one at the end of their 500-miles-an-hour charge.\\"<br />Thus, \\"Master Class\\" draws a line in the sand of sorts, a line that puts the intellectual demands of serious writing and literature on one side and the surrender to the popular and the formulaic on the other.  For those on one side, this book will be a marvel; for those on the other, an unintelligible bore.	2001-11-11

He was 26 years old at the time and had just completed a graduate writing program at the University of Virginia.  Four years later \\"The Stories of Breece D'J Pancake\\" was published, a collection of twelve stories that posthumously established his literary reputation as one of the finest short story writers in twentieth century American literature.<br />Pancake grew up in the hollows of West Virginia and each of the carefully wrought stories in this collection deals with the seemingly desperate lives of the working poor in that part of the country.  They are remarkably crafted stories, written with a deep sense for the locale and the people from which they are drawn.  They are also models of precision, the kind of stories that deserve to be read over and over, studied for the way in which they use foregrounding and the mundane details of everyday life--albeit everyday life that quietly screams with the desperation of poverty, deadening work, drinking, promiscuity, and brutality-to draw complex portraits of people who endure, even when endurance is no more than a substitute for hope.  As he writes in \\"A Room Forever,\\" the story of a tugboat mate spending New Year's Eve in an eight-dollar-a-night hotel room where he drinks cheap whiskey out of the bottle and eventually ends up with a teen-aged prostitute: \\"I stop in front of a bus station, look in on the waiting people, and think about all the places they are going.  But I know they can't run away from it or drink their way out of it or die to get rid of it.  It's always there.\\"<br />The best of these stories are \\"Trilobites,\\" \\"The Honored Dead,\\" \\"Fox Hunters,\\" and \\"In the Dry.\\"  But there really isn't a weak story in the bunch.  Every story is captivating, every one an exemplar of what good short story writing should be.  At the end, the only thing that disappoints, that leaves the reader discomforted, is the thought that Pancake died so young, that these are the only stories we have by a truly remarkable writer.	2001-11-06

While less well know in the United States than some of his Italian contemporaries-I think here of Italo Calvino, Primo Levi, Umberto Eco-Sciascia enjoys a well deserved reputation in Italy as a writer of novels, stories and political commentary.<br />Sciascia was a Sicilian.  This fact, more than any other, colors all of the stories in this collection.  Each of these stories reflects, in some way, the particularities of Sicilian culture and society.  There is, of course, the uneasy and often conflicting relationship that Sicily has had with the rest of Italy, particularly the northern part of that country.  There is also the pervasive influence of the Mafia on Sicilian life, particularly the strong notions of honor and \\"omerta,\\" the Mafia code of silence.  And there is, finally, the interplay of the tightly knit Sicilian family, the Roman Catholic Church and the Italian state.  <br />The best of the stories in this collection are marked by subdued irony, subtle wit and steely-clear insight into the idiosyncrasies that mark Sicilian life within the larger context of Italy.  <br />In \\"A Matter of Conscience,\\" a Sicilian lawyer traveling back home from Rome picks up a women's magazine on the train.  He reads an anonymous letter to a priest, written by a woman from his hometown, asking for advice.  The woman had an affair with a relative for six months, is tormented by her adultery and wants to know whether she should tell her husband.  She relates that, \\"as a very devout person, I have confessed my fault on several different occasions.\\"  She then goes on-drawing the distinction between her Sicilian mores and those of the rest of Italy-as follows:  \\"Every priest except one (but he was a northerner) has told me that if my repentance is sincere, and my love for my husband unchanged, then I must remain silent.\\"  From here, the story turns into a witty, ironic exploration of life in the lawyer's town as each of his colleagues becomes obsessed with the thought that he is the cuckold.<br />In \\"Mafia Western,\\" a big town \\"on the border between the provinces of Palermo and Trapani\\" is embroiled in a bloody battle between two feuding mafia cells.  It is at the time of World War I and, \\"the death-toll from assassination [is] comparable to the death-toll of its citizens falling at the front.\\"  In dry, matter-of-fact style, Sciascia relates this fictional tale, the interstices of his story relating the society within the society-the society of the mafiosi, the capo and the code of silence.  Thus, a mother's son is killed and she knows his assassin.  But she remains silent, picking up her son's body and bringing it back home.  \\"The next morning she let it be know that her son died of a wound there upon his bed, but she knew neither where nor by whom he had been wounded.  No word did she utter to the carabinieri about the man who might have killed him.  But her friends understood-they knew-and they now set about very careful preparations.\\"<br />In \\"Philology,\\" two men that are to be called before the Commission of Enquiry investigating the activities of the mafia in Sicily engage in an ironic, witty discourse on the origin and meaning of the word \\"mafia\\".  They are doing this in preparation for their interrogation, their dialogue a bit of dry, absurd humor that conflates the high intellectual pretension of philological discourse with the pragmatic, cold-blooded realities that underlie their preparations.  As one of them says, \\"the fact is that everyone tries to establish the current meaning of the word before establishing its origin.\\"  After exploring possible Arabic and French origins of the word, and the deficiencies in education of the general public, who misunderstand the importance of etymology and meaning, he ultimately presents an ironically pragmatic, if high-sounding, statement of the meaning of the word \\"mafia\\":  \\"Mafia impliesa consciousness of self, an exaggerated concept of the power of the individual as sole arbiter of every conflict of interests or ideas; from this derives the inability to bear with the superiority, and even more, the authority of others.  The mafioso expects respect and nearly always offers it.  When crossed, he does not appeal to the law, public justice, but takes matters into his own hands and, should the remedy be beyond his own power, he will call on the assistance of like-minded friends.\\"<br />\\"The Wine-Dark Sea,\\" the longest of the stories in this collection, wonderfully depicts the cultural separation between Sicilians and other Italians.  In this story, Bianchi, an engineer traveling to Sicily for the first time, shares a compartment with a Sicilian family and \\"a girl of about twenty-three\\" who is attached to the family \\"by ties of family, friendship or casual acquaintance.\\"  Over the course of their long train ride, Bianchi, if only briefly, manages to penetrate the seemingly deep cultural divide between him and the family, along the way also sharing a fleeting romantic connection with the young girl.<br />These are only some of the stories in this collection.  There are others that are equally good.  In particular, I think of \\"Demotion\\" (which provides a fascinating contrapuntal theme of Catholicism and Communism, Saint Filomena and Joseph Stalin) and \\"The Ransom\\" (which retells a popular Sicilian folk tale of familial duty, love and betrayal).  With the exception of \\"Apocryphal Correspondence re Crowley,\\" which, at best, is of nothing more than historical interest and utterly unremarkable, \\"The Wine-Dark Sea\\" is an exceptionally good collection of stories and a wonderful introduction to an Italian writer that, thus far, has been little read in the United States.	2001-10-31

Sebald's works to appear in English translation, is a disorienting narrative that conflates history, memory, dream, and imagination.  The result is another literary tour de force from the author of \\"The Emigrants\\" and \\"The Rings of Saturn,\\" a remarkable work that is difficult to classify, but reinforces Sebald's deserved reputation as one of Europe's most original and preeminent contemporary writers.  <br />\\"Vertigo\\" begins with an historical figure, in this case Marie Henri Beyle, better known to literary history as Stendhal.  In the opening section (\\"Beyle, or Love is a Madness Most Discreet\\"), our third person narrator relates certain of the amorous adventures of Beyle during his travels in Italy, beginning with his first arrival in that country at the age of seventeen as a soldier in Napoleon's army.  The year is 1800 and the historical record is drawn from Beyle's own notes of his experience, written more than three decades later at the age of 53.  As if foreshadowing the vertiginous unreliability of the narrative to follow, the narrator (Sebald?) relates as follows: \\"The notes in which the 53-year-old Beyle, writing during a sojourn at Civitavecchia, attempted to relive the tribulations of those days afford eloquent proof of the various difficulties entailed in the act of recollection.\\"<br />The third person narrative shifts, in the second section, to a first person relation of travels in Austria and Italy by our narrator beginning in the year 1980.  It is an unreliable narrative, confounding dream and reality, past and present, in a text that seems to have a mysterious, underlying hermeticism.  Thus, while aimlessly wandering the dark streets of Vienna, the narrator often thought he saw someone he knew walking ahead of me.  \\"On one occasion, in Gonzagagasse, I even thought I recognized the poet Dante, banished from his hometown on pain of being burned at the stake.\\"  Similarly, in the dark, misty, maze-like streets of Venice, \\"there sat, and in fact very nearly lay, a man in a worn green loden coat whom I immediately recognized as King Ludwig II of Bavaria.\\"  <br />In a remarkable, resonant passage that writes another layer on the palimpsest of literary renderings of Venice, Sebald writes: \\"As you enter into the heart of that city, you cannot tell what you will see next or indeed who will see you the very next moment.  Scarcely has someone made an appearance than he has quit the stage by another exit.  These brief exhibitions are of an almost theatrical obscenity and at the same time have an air of conspiracy about them, into which one is drawn against one's will.  If you walk behind someone in a deserted alleyway, you have only to quicken your step slightly to instill a little fear into the person you are following.  And equally, you can feel like a quarry yourself.  Confusion and ice-cold terror alternate.\\"<br />In Venice, too, the narrator muses on the dark history of the Doge's Palace, reflecting, in particular on the early nineteenth century writings of the German Franz Grillparzer and on one of the victims of the harsh justice carried out in that palace, Giacomo Casanova.  Grillparzer, a lawyer, ponders that \\"the resolutions passed here by the Council of State must be mysterious, immutable and harsh.\\"  It is a thought that brings to mind Kafka's \\"The Trial\\", among other things, and it is not surprising that, in the next breath, the reader learns that Casanova's memoir of his imprisonment in the Doge's Palace was first published in, of all places, Prague. <br />From here, the narrative shifts once again to the third person, this time in a section entitled \\"Dr. K Takes the Waters at Riva.\\"  It is, again, a purportedly historical narrative of Franz Kafka's trip in 1913 from Prague to Vienna and then on to Italy, where he visits Venice, Verona and Riva, a city on the shores of Lake Garda.  Kafka's journeys mirror those of the narrator in the second section of the book and the dreamlike repetitions, doublings, doppelgangers which re-occur throughout \\"Vertigo\\" provide a deeply entwined narrative for the careful reader.  Thus, in a passage that, in some sense, is a trope for the entire text, Kafka stands on the porch of the Pellegrini Chapel in Verona, a place where the narrator himself related he had stood in 1980 in the previous section of the book: \\"When Doctor K. stood in the porch once again, on the threshold between the dark interior and the brightness outside, he felt for a moment as if the selfsame church were replicated before him, its entrance fitting directly with that of the church he had just left, a mirroring effect he was familiar with from his dreams, in which everything was forever splitting and multiplying, over and again, in the most terrifying manner.\\"<br />From Kafka's 1913 experiences, the final section of Vertigo relates the narrator's return in November, 1987, to his childhood home in the Tyrol.  It is the most introspective and personal section of \\"Vertigo,\\" but still remains tied to the text that has gone before, resonating with themes, enigmas and uncertainties that make \\"Vertigo\\" a puzzle-palace of literary and historical renderings.<br />I could say much more about \\"Vertigo,\\" tie many more passages and themes together, make a plethora of textual allusions and connections.  This would do nothing more, however, than demonstrate the richness of Sebald's imagination, the density of his writing, the dream-like dislocations and uncertainties of his original and unclassifiable literary enterprise.  If you read no other book this year, read \\"Vertigo\\" or \\"The Emigrants\\" or \\"The Rings of Saturn\\"; just be sure to read at least one of W. G. Sebald's books because you will not be disappointed.	2001-10-25

Michel Houellebecq is no stranger to literary controversy.  As I sit here writing a review of \\"The Elementary Particles\\" (published in the UK under the title \\"Atomised\\"), I am looking at a headline in The Guardian newspaper's web site captioned \\"Muslim Anger Denies Prize to Sex Trade Novel.\\"  The article, dated October 14, 2001, relates that Houellebecq's novel, \\"Platforme\\", has been removed from the short list for the Prix Goncourt because, in light of the events of September 11, it is \\"too controversial.\\"  The book has been criticized, among other reasons, as being \\"a thinly veiled apology for sex tourism in Thailand\\" and for the apparently vitriolic hatred which its main character, Michel, has for Muslims.  <br />I mention The Guardian article because, while I have not read \\"Platforme\\", it sounds as if the themes of Houellebecq's most recent novel (described as \\"France's most critically acclaimed and popular novel of the year\\") represent a continuation of the misogynistic and puerile intellectual pretensions adumbrated in \\"The Elementary Particles\\". <br />\\"The Elementary Particles\\" narrates the story of half-brothers Michel Djerzinski and Bruno Clement.  They share the same mother-Janine-a woman who was \\"extraordinarily intelligent\\" according to the novel's third-person narrator, apparently because, \\"she lost her virginity at the age of 13-a remarkable achievement given the time and place.\\"  Thus, from the very beginning, Hoellebecq's narrator conflates promiscuity with a form of intelligence, an abiding theme of \\"The Elementary Particles.\\"<br />Michel and Bruno are born in the 1950s, grow up in very different circumstances and, ultimately, lead very different lives.  Michel becomes a molecular biologist, a deep thinker whose life is devoid of the ability to love or even any interest in the erotic.  Bruno, brutally abused as a youth in boarding school, lives the mundane life of a civil servant whose only interest is where he can find the next woman to satisfy hissexual desires.  He is a misogynist pure and simple, someone who views women merely as the instrument of his pleasure.  <br />Michel and Bruno are, in short, one-dimensional, pathological characters who become the vehicle for the narrator's retrospective commentary on the development of French (and world-wide) society during the period from the end of World War II until today.  While bearing the momentum of a pretension to profound social analysis and scientific insight, \\"The Elementary Particles\\" is shallow, cynical and anti-human.  It is a book that fails as literature, as social analysis and as scientific prognostication; indeed, it even falls short of the mark in its graphic depictions of Bruno's sexual escapades, whether judged by the standards of literature or those of pornography.  <br />Read \\"The Elementary Particles\\" if you want to find out what's apparently popular in the French literary world.  Or read it if you want to be ineptly titillated.  Or read it if you want to see what literature is like when it has lost all feeling for human character and emotion.  But remember:  read it quickly, because it's not worth your time!	2001-10-17

Writing about the affair in The Times of London, Mosley related that all of his choices were rejected because they were novels of ideas, or novels in which characters were subservient to ideas.  He went on to opine, in a statement that seems to apply as much to his Whitbread Prize-winning novel Hopeful Monsters as to his view of his Booker choices:  My point was that humans were beings who did have ideas, who were often influenced by ideas, to whom ideas were important.  If they were not, then there was some lack in being human.  <br />Hopeful Monsters is a novel where character development is subservient to ideas, where narrative action takes place against big historical events. While it ostensibly tells the story of a life-long romantic relationship between Max Ackerman, an English physicist, and Eleanor Anders, a German-Jewish anthropologist, the romance is as much a vehicle for the promulgation and exploration of ideas as it is a tale of a man and a woman in the twentieth century.  <br />Hopeful Monsters begins at the end of World War I.  Max is ten years old and lives outside Cambridge, England.  His father is a biologist who specializes in genetic inheritance and his mother is a woman of seeming artistic interests who had been brought up on the fringes of what was even then known as the Bloomsbury Group.  His parents have had long ties to the Cambridge University community.  Eleanor, too, lives in an intellectual milieu, one in which ideas predominate.  Eleanor lives in Berlin, where her mother is a Marxist and follower of Rosa Luxemburg and her father is a lecturer in philosophy.  From such beginnings, novels of ideas are made!<br />From this starting point, Hopeful Monsters narrates the story of Max and Eleanor through the rise of Nazism in Germany, the post-Lenin rise to power of Joseph Stalin, the Spanish Civil War, and the development of the Atomic Bomb.  It does this while, all the time, interweaving Darwinism (and its Lamarckian heresy), Marxism, quantum physics and the uncertainty principle, Freudian psychoanalysis, Jungian archetypes, and even suggestions of Jewish mysticism.  It is a story that runs from 1918 until the 1970s and continually challenges the reader to think about the ideas, the opinions, the intellectual sensibilities and feelings of Max, Eleanor and the books other characters.  It is a magnificent and challenging novel of ideas, a novel that deservedly won the Whitbread Prize in 1990.<br />If Hopeful Monsters has any shortcomings, it is that ideas and historical events predominate at the expense of character development.  It also suffers, at times, from a somewhat turgid prose style.  In particular, Mosley is fond of introducing statements by Eleanor and Max with the clauses I said and You said.  It is a construction that helps the reader follow long spoken exchanges, but gets a bit tedious.  Mosley also tends to write sentences as statements with a question mark at the end.  This, too, can be annoying, suggesting a rising inflection by the speaker that can hardly be the intent.  These are, however, relatively minor failings in a novel which is majestic in the breadth and depth of its intellectual suggestiveness, a really big modern novel that deserves to be more widely read.	2001-10-04

I know about him, however, because the movie Fight Club is based upon Palahniuks novel of the same title.  Chuck Palahniuk is a big fan of Denis Johnsons collection of short stories, Jesus Son.  A recent article about Palahniuk in Poets &amp; Writers Magazine says that Palahniuk has read Jesus Son over and overmore than two hundred times.  Palahniuk says, in that article, whenever Im stuck, thats a book I read to sort of jump start myself.<br />Palahniuks endorsement was good enough for me.  Any book that someone has read more than two hundred times must be worthwhile, or at least worth taking a look at.  Besides, this remarkable collection of short stories is only 160 pages long, the pages are small (I measured it and it was about 7 x 4), and there are not many words on each page.  It doesnt take long to read.  If it matters, I also always knew Denis Johnson was out there, a highly regarded poet and novelist, ever since Fiskadoro had been published more than a decade ago.  I had to read something by him sometime.<br />I sat down last night and started reading Jesus Son and didnt put it down until I was finished.  It didnt take me long and was worth every minute.  Jesus Son contains eleven short stories, all written in the first person, all connected by the common voice of the same narrator, a young, strung-out misfit whose pathology permeates every story.  The stories are grim, just like the dark, desperate life of the narrator, just like the violent, disconnected, drug-clouded lives of the people who surround him.  They are stories in which the narrator seemingly transcends his life, his drug- and alcohol-induced cloud of unknowing illuminating an at times crystalline-pure vision of the world.  The physical world becomes continuous with the mental world in rushes of stunning prose.  Thus, in Car Crash While Hitchhiking,Johnsons narrator, sitting in the back of a car:  Under Midwestern clouds like great grey brains we left the superhighway with a drifting sensation and entered Kansas Citys rush hour with a sensation of running aground.  And later, while in a hospital emergency room, his mind drifts in a kind of hallucinatory fugue:  It was raining.  Gigantic ferns leaned over us.  The forest drifted down a hill.  I could hear a creek rushing down rocks.  And you, you ridiculous people, you expect me to help you. <br />The writing is brilliant, attaining remarkable heights of intensity and clarity.  At the same time, the characters and the events are dark and disturbing, the narrative interrupted and discontinuous.  There is drug addiction, alcoholism, violence, torture, murder, voyeurism.  There is a disturbing coldness, but also a profound clarity.  It is writing from the bowels of life, writing that achieves its power through prose that is as hard, as pure, as the finest diamond.  Jesus Son is not an upbeat collection of stories, but it is resplendent with a writing style and an imagination that celebrates the power of fiction written with stark feeling, written so it reflects the real lives of its desperate characters.	2001-09-05

It is a train that makes no stops.  From this simple premise, Pelevin elaborates a sometimes absurd, sometimes mystical, parable of life in Russian society.  Or is it life in general?  Either way, the narrative works on many levels and provides an entertaining and, for those who like, metaphysically speculative foray into where we're all headed.<br />\\"The Yellow Arrow\\" is essentially the story of one passenger-Andrei's-life on the train.  Told in the third person, the reader lives inside the mind of Andre, thinking what he thinks, seeing what he sees, experiencing what he experiences.  Andrei becomes the protagonist for open-ended speculation about the meaning of life on the train.  Thus, early in the narrative, Andrei sits in the restaurant car of the train and speculates (in a passage that is typical Pelevin and that provides a resonant connection to the meaning of \\"The Yellow Express\\"):<br />\\"Watching the hot sunlight falling on the table-cloth covered with sticky blotches and crumbs, Andrei was suddenly struck by the thought of what a genuine tragedy it was for millions of light rays to set out on their journey from the surface of the sun, go hurtling through the infinite void of space and pierce the mile-thick sky of Earth, only to be extinguished in the revolting remains of yesterday's soup.  Maybe these yellow arrows slanting in through the window were conscious, hoped for something better-and realized that their hopes were groundless, giving them all the necessary ingredients for suffering.\\"<br />The train becomes a deep-seated metaphor for lives in society, for those who live those lives with unquestioning acceptance and for those who don't-those who wonder about the train and about whether there is anything else, anything outside the train.  Thus, Andrei's friend, Khan, draws a distinction between those like him and Andrei, who reflect and question where they are and what they're doing, and those who do not:  \\"A normal passenger never thinks of himself as a passenger.  So if you know you're a passenger, you no longer are one.  They could never imagine it's impossible to get off this train.  Nothing else exists for them, apart from the train.\\"<br />But whether or not anything exists outside the train, whether you can get off the train, is less important than what is in your head.  As Khan suggests to Andrei, \\"It doesn't matter in the least whether anything else exists apart from our train.  What matters is that we can live as though there is something else.  As though it really is possible to get off.  That's the only difference.  But if you try to explain that difference to any of the passengers, they won't understand.\\"<br />I hope this gives a flavor for Pelevin's writing and for the tone of \\"The Yellow Express.\\"  While a short work, Pelevin succeeds in creating a compelling and satirically amusing metaphorical world, a world that provides sublime insight into what it means to think and to question in a society that encourages unquestioning acceptance.stioning acceptance and for those who don't-those who wonder about the train and about whether there is anything else, anything outside the train.

US	38955473	R1GNOFL9ELJDU9	1568360487	608685392	The Forbidden Experiment: The Story of the Wild Boy of Aveyron (Kodansha Globe)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Thoughtful, Sympathetic Story of What It Means to be Human	In January, 1800, a boy of about eleven or twelve years old walked out of the woods near the village of Saint-Sernin in the Languedoc region of southern France. Except for a tattered shirt, he was naked. He had no shame or concern for his nakedness and had no ability to speak. He made only strange and apparently meaningless sounds and cries. While human in appearance, he lacked any qualities which otherwise would suggest that he was part of any human society. <br />The boy was captured by a villager, transported and kept for several months in an orphanage in a nearby town, and eventually transferred to Paris in June, 1800, where &quot;The Wild Boy of Aveyron&quot; was claimed &quot;for science and humanity&quot; by the newly-formed Society of Observers of Man. In Paris, the boy was given over to the Abbe Sicard, a famous educator and the head of the Institute for Deaf-Mutes. &quot;Miracles were expected of Sicard, for some of his deaf-mute pupils had made a reputation by their intelligence and wit in answering written questions before large audiences.&quot; Sicard, however, apparently believed that he could never train the seemingly wild creature and made no efforts to do so. Instead, he left the boy to run wild at the Institute and a commission appointed by the Society of the Observers of Man subsequently declared him to be an incurable idiot.<br />It is at this point, however, sometime in the summer or fall of 1800, that the course of the Wild Boy's life took a different course. A twenty-five year old medical student, Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard began working at the Institute and became interested in the boy. More or less simultaneously with the declaration by the Society of the Observers of Man that the boy was an incurable idiot in November of that year, Itard was hired and given a room at the Institute for the sole purpose of working with the boy. Itard named the boy Victor and went on, over the course of the next six years and with the able assistance of a motherly figure by the name of Madame Guerin, to train the boy in accordance with principles Itard had derived from the writings of Locke and Condillac. These principles were intended to give the boy the ability to respond to other people, to train his senses, to extend his physical and social needs, to teach him to speak, and to teach him to think and reason logically. While Itard was never fully successful in achieving all of his objectives, his work was remarkably original and his observations and experiments have left the world with a fascinating picture of the Wild Boy of Aveyron.<br />&quot;The Forbidden Experiment: The Story of the Wild Boy of Aveyron&quot; is a fascinating exploration of what it means to be human and how our humanity is, in a sense, created by the society in which we live, defined by our communications and relationships with others. In telling this story, Roger Shattuck has thoughtfully and sympathetically interwoven the factual story of the Wild Boy with the philosophical, psychological and historical background that ultimately makes this story so interesting. Thus, Shattuck explores the historical peculiarities of the Languedoc region from which the Wild Boy came (known for the poetry and song of the troubadors, as well as the Albigensian heresy), the historical forces which made him such a topic of interest (he was a boy seemingly straight from Rousseau's state of nature at a time when the French Revolution had given way to Napoleon), and the philosophical and psychological forerunners (Locke, Condillac, Rousseau) that provided the intellectual impetus for marking this &quot;tabula rasa&quot; of humanity. Shattuck's book also provides interesting appendices containing other published accounts of the Wild Boy of Aveyron, other cases of isolation and deprivation (including Kaspar Hauser, Peter of Hanover, The Elephant Man, and Helen Keller), and a short essay on Francois Truffaut's 1970 film, &quot;The Wild Child,&quot; which is based upon the story of the Wild Boy of Aveyron.<br />While simple in the telling, &quot;The Forbidden Experiment&quot; is a book which poses the deepest and most enigmatic of questions, the question of what it means to be human. Read it, ponder it, learn from it.	2001-08-29

J. A. Symons and Christopher Millard, each somewhat obscure and eccentric literary figures in their own right, were sitting in a garden discussing books and authors that had never received proper recognition from the arbiters of literary history. Millard asked Symons whether he had ever read &quot;Hadrian the Seventh.&quot; Symons acknowledged that he had not and that he was unfamiliar with the book. &quot;To my surprise, [Millard] offered to lend me his copy-to my surprise, for my companion lent his books seldom and reluctantly. But knowing the range of his knowledge of out-of-the-way literature, I accepted without hesitating; and by doing so took the first step on a trail that led into very strange places.&quot;<br />Very strange places indeed! Symons began reading &quot;Hadrian the Seventh,&quot; a book written by Frederick Rolfe, also known as Baron Corvo, and originally published in 1904, and quickly felt &quot;that interior stir with which we all recognize a transforming new experience.&quot; Symons went on to spend the next eight years of his life tracking down the details of the life and writings of Baron Corvo, one of the most eccentric, original and enigmatic English writers of the last one hundred years. The result was &quot;The Quest for Corvo: An Experimental Biography,&quot; a fascinating book that has been in- and out-of-print since its first publication in 1934 and has enjoyed a literary cult following akin to that of the text (&quot;Hadrian the Seventh&quot;) and the author (Rolfe, aka Corvo) that originally inspired it. <br />As one reads &quot;The Quest for Corvo,&quot; it seems that Symon's text represents the outermost of three concentric circles of eccentricity. <br />The innermost, core circle is &quot;Hadrian the Seventh,&quot; a strange and imaginative novel that tells the story of an impoverished, eccentric and seemingly paranoid writer and devotee of the Roman Catholic faith, George Arthur Rose. Rose, a brilliant, self-taught man whose candidacy for the priesthood had been rejected twenty years earlier, is unexpectedly approached one day by a Cardinal and a Bishop who have been made aware of his devotion and his shameful treatment by the Church. Rose is ordained and ultimately becomes the first English Pope in several hundred years. While a work of fiction, Symons' biographical investigations disclose that much of the story of &quot;Hadrian the Seventh&quot; closely parallels the life of its strange author, Frederick Rolfe. <br />The second circle of eccentricity is, of course, the life of Frederick Rolfe, Baron Corvo, himself. It is the telling of this life that occupies Symons in &quot;The Quest for Corvo,&quot; and the result is a fascinating, if perhaps not always historically accurate, detective story cum biography. Starting with his obsessive search for information on Rolfe and his meetings and correspondence with those who knew him, Symons brilliantly recreates a life-the life of a strangely talented artist, photographer, historian, and writer who led a life of seemingly paranoid desperation, ultimately dying impoverished in Venice at the age of forty-five.<br />The third, outermost circle is the eccentricity of the author of the &quot;Quest for Corvo,&quot; A. J. A. Symons, a founder of The Wine and Food Society of England, a collector of music boxes, and a master at card tricks and the art of forgery. Like Corvo himself, Symons died at an early age-he was only forty years old-and his life and his book is seemingly as eccentric as its subject.<br />&quot;The Quest for Corvo&quot; is one of those little gems that deserve a cherished, if perhaps minor, place in English literature and the literature of biography. Happily, it is back in print again, courtesy of New York Review Books. Read it, and then read &quot;Hadrian the Fourth&quot; (also brought back into print by NYRB) for a fascinating turn in the world of the imaginative and the eccentric.	2001-08-20
US	38955473	RULJE1YVME7V1	0393048071	84088208	Candor and Perversion: Literature, Education and the Arts	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Outstanding Essays on Education, Literature and the Arts	Candor &amp; Perversion collects nearly forty of Roger Shattucks previously published essays on a broad range of topics in education, literature and the arts.  Nearly all of these essays were published after 1985, predominantly in Salmagundi, The New York Review of Books and The New Republic.  It is an outstanding collection of essays by a scholar of wide-ranging, thoughtful and sober intelligence.<br />The collection is divided into two parts.  The first part, Intellectual Craftsmanship, contains a series of polemical essays that deal with topics generally subsumed in recent years under the term Culture Wars.  In this part, Shattuck stakes out his position clearly in a number of essays dealing with the proper role of education and the importance of the canon.  Thus, in the essay Nineteen Theses on Literature, Shattuck states that, we have brought ourselves to a great deal of perplexity about the basic role of education.  This perplexity arises from the question of whether educations proper role should be [to] socialize the young within an existing culture and offer them the means to succeed within that culture or, in the alternative, [to] give to the young the means to challenge and overthrow the existing culture, presumably in order to achieve a better life.  Shattucks response is in favor of the former, choosing a conservative view of educations role.  In doing so, he essentially resolves this question consistent with a position he articulates in another of his essays, Education, Higher and Lower, where he states that, some of us have come to believe that it is possible, even necessary, to be liberal in political matters and conservationist in cultural matters.<br />These polemical pieces on the role of education are followed by a number of essays that explore such topics as The Spiritual in Art, How We Think at the Movies (where he explores, among other things, whether thinking is possible without language), Life Before Language: Nathalie Sarraute (where he examines Sarrautes attempts to capture, in fiction, mental life as it exists before it gets caught and stifled in the rough net of conventional language), Michel Foucault, and Radical Skepticism and How We Got There.  In all of these essays, Shattuck explores, with erudition and balance, a range of topics that have been prone in recent years to irrational polemics.<br />The second part of the collection, A Critics Job of Work, contains essays that are best described as literary journalism.  In a series of essays under the broad title Tracking the Avant Guard in France, Shattuck explores the biographies and artistic significance of a range of artists and writers, including Marcel Duchamp, Hans Arp, Sarah Bernhardt, Pablo Picasso, and Jean Cocteau.  The most telling of his essays in this part of the book is titled From Aestheticism to Fascism, where Shattuck calmly proffers the lineage that ran from the antinomian, decadent aestheticism of the art for arts sake movement to the irrationalism, racism and nationalism that produced the most vicious and destructive aberration of modern times in Germany and Italy.  <br />The final essays in the collection are broadly grouped under the title America, Africa and Elsewhere.  Here, Shattuck explores a number of writers, including Mary Settle, Arthur Miller, Octavio Paz, V. S. Naipaul, and Leopold Senghor, as well as the artistic significance of the collaboration between Stieglitz and OKeefe.  These essays are wide ranging, insightful and balanced.  The last of these essays, Scandal and Stereotypes on Broadway:  The New Puritanism, seemingly comes full circle from the opening essay of the book insofar as Shattuck reiterates his culturally conservative position in a stinging review of Angels in America, stating that it was a play for which he was ashamedof himself for not having walked out.  In Shattucks words, the play represents Puritanism inverted. <br />Candor &amp; Perversion reaffirms Roger Shattucks position as one of Americas foremost cultural commentators.  If youre interested in the polemics that have engulfed education, literature and the arts in the past decade, I can only say: read this book! You may not agree with Shattuck, but you will find his intelligent and careful reasoning regarding these issues a refreshing change from the often muddled and irrational posturing that characterizes much writing on these very important subjects.	2001-08-13
US	38955473	R24P2JHE6QP99N	0060975091	358731561	Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance	Books	5	14	15	N	N	An Intelligent, Complex Novel of Ideas	In 1910, Richard Powers relates in \\"Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance,\\" the German photographer August Sander came upon the idea of an epic photographic collection to be called \\"Man of the Twentieth Century.\\"  Sander went on, during the next several decades, to take thousands of photographs of everyday life, \\"a massive, comprehensive catalog of people written in the universal language-photography.\\"<br />One of Sander's photographs, taken in May, 1914, depicts three German farmers standing in a muddy road, their heads turned to the camera.  The three farmers are dressed in their best suits, white shirts, ties, hats, and walking sticks.  They are on their way to a dance.  As Powers' first person narrator writes, \\"the date sufficed to show that they were not going to their expected dance.  I was not going to my expected dance.  We would all be taken blindfolded into a field somewhere in this tortured century and made to dance until we'd had enough.  Dance until we dropped.\\"<br />From this intriguing beginning, Richard Powers tells three stories, each of them connected through the photograph and through time.  The first is that of the narrator, who stumbles upon Sander's photograph at the Detroit Institute of Arts.  He becomes obsessed with the haunting aura of the photograph and spends the next several months trying to find out more about the photographer and the three men in the photograph.  The second is that of the three farmers themselves-Hubert, Peter and Adolphe-and what happens to each of them when the Great War breaks out in Europe.  The third story is that of Peter Mays, a writer for a computer trade magazine in 1980s Boston, who also becomes obsessed-not with the photograph, but with a beautiful red haired woman dressed in early twentieth century period costume that he sees on the street following a Veterans' Day Parade-and ultimately finds out that he has a connection to one of the men in the picture and to the events of the Great War.<br />To say that \\"Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance\\" tells three stories is misleading, however, insofar as the novel is dominated not by plot, but, rather, by a range of discursive narratives on how the world has changed between the Great War, when Sander's photograph was taken, and the present day.  Plot does not drive the action of Powers' densely intellectual novel; rather, it provides a touchstone for the narrator to explore certain events and fundamental ideas of the Twentieth Century.  For example, when the office cleaning woman shows the narrator artifacts from the Great War, it strikes an intellectual cord that leads to a long discourse on Charles Peguy, the French thinker who, in 1913, made the subsequently oft-quoted remark that \\"the world had changed less since the death of Jesus than it had in the last thirty years,\\" and the ideas \\"hidden\\" in Peguy's formulation.  Similarly, the narrator's obsessive study of the 1914 photograph leads to an historical investigation of Sander's life and works.  It also leads to speculations on the nature of photography and on how photography changed conceptions of art that derive closely from Walter Benjamin's classic essay, \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.\\"  <br />Ideas and intellectual referents are ubiquitous in this novel; simply read the epigraphs to each chapter to get a feel for the intellectual gyroscope that orients \\"Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance\\".  It is a remarkable work that demands a great deal from the reader.  It is also a work that will disappoint anyone who is looking for a straightforward plot or a mere \\"page turner.\\"<br />If you're interested in ideas, in novels with intellectual density, in narratives that force you to think deeply and reflectively about the world, \\"Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance\\" is the perfect novel.  Read it, enjoy it, and move on to the rest of Richard Powers' remarkable list of fictions.	2001-08-12

What really happens is that God gathers everybody in one large hall.  Then He gives them the Talmud and commands them to start studying.  For the wicked, studying Talmud is hell.  For the pious, it's heaven.\\"<br />Halbertal's tale amusingly illustrates the importance that sacred texts play in Judaism and provides a fitting entrée into this short, but fascinating, exploration of the development and importance of the Bible, the Mishnah and the Talmud as canonical works of the Jewish community.<br />Halbertal begins with a short introduction adumbrating the meaning of a \\"canonical\\" text and its various guises.  The adjective, of course, refers to a text's special status in a community.  The special status of a canon can be \\"normative\\" (it is obeyed and followed as the law of a community), \\"formative\\" (it is a curriculum that is taught, read, transmitted, and interpreted) or \\"exemplary\\" (it is a paradigm for aesthetic value and achievement).  For example, the Talmud is both a normative and a formative canon of the traditional Jewish community; normative in the sense that it establishes appropriate behavior in many aspects of life, formative in the sense that it is a fundamental text that is the object of endless interpretation and debate and, in some cases, the intellectual sine qua non of membership in the community.  <br />From this brief introduction, \\"People of the Book\\" then explores, in successive chapters (which mirror the chronological development of each successive text), the canonization of the Bible, the Mishnah, and the Talmud and what the ascendancy of each of these texts meant for the formation of authority and meaning in the Jewish community.  He also explores the challenges that philosophy and Kabbalah posed to the Talmudic canon in the Middle Ages and closes with a short appendix discussing how Hobbes and Spinoza appropriated and interpreted the canonical text of the Hebrew Bible in their political philosophy.<br />In less than one hundred fifty pages (excluding the extensive footnotes), Moshe Halbertal has written a challenging and thoughtful exploration of the development of the canonical works of Judaism and how those canonical works shaped authority and meaning in the community and between the community and the non-Jewish world.  \\"People of the Book\\" is a concise, but intellectually rich, exegesis of the key texts of Judaism and how those texts shaped Jewish thought through the ages.	2001-08-06

As Remembered and Viewed from Chicago	Alexander Hemon left his home in Sarajevo in 1992 to visit a friend in Chicago.  The visit was intended to last a few months.  Hemon never returned to Bosnia, however, because the Bosnian-Serb army had surrounded his hometown on the very day he planned to return.  Undaunted, Hemon, a half-Serbian, half-Ukrainian writer, remained in Chicago, where he worked at a number of menial jobs and began learning English.  He published his first story in English in 1995 and, five years later, the collection of seven stories and a novella that form \\"The Question of Bruno.\\"  <br />Perhaps because he is from Eastern Europe and had been a writer in his native language before he learned English, he has often been compared to Nabokov.  While the comparison is simplistic, it is seemingly suggested by Hemon himself, at one point, when he related to Salon Magazine how he learned English: \\"I read `Lolita' in English and underlined the words I didn't know.\\"  However, unlike Nabokov, who circulated largely in academic circles, Hemon spent two and a half years canvassing for Greenpeace, where he met and spoke with thousands of people of every stripe, developing an ear for English as it is actually spoken.  It is not surprising, then, that Hemon's writing is less academic and obscure than that of Nabokov.<br />\\"The Question of Bruno\\" is a remarkably good collection of stories that continually engage the reader.  Like many first works of fiction, the stories, while fictional, appear to draw heavily from Hemon's own experiences, particularly those of living under Marshall Tito's communism and the implosion of Yugoslavia which followed Tito's death, of growing up in a family with roots in both Serbia and the Ukraine, and, ultimately, living and writing in a language not his own.  Hemon's writing is vivid, intelligent and darkly humorous, his style marked by keen description and uniquely discordant turns of phrase that sometimes seem to reflect his alienation from the English language in which he writes as much as his remarkable skill as a writer.<br />The best of the stories in this collection is \\"A Coin,\\" a tale of Aida, a woman living in Sarajevo under siege, and a man, presumably Hemon, living in Chicago, where he worries about Aida, about whether she is still among the living.  Thus, Aida relates what it's like in Sarajevo:  \\"Suppose there is a Point A and a Point B and that, if you want to get from Point A to Point B, you have to pass through an open space clearly visible to a skillful sniper.\\"  And Hemon, the author, relates from the disconnected safety of his dingy Chicago apartment:  \\"I open my mailbox-a long tunnel dead-ending with a dark square-and I find Aida's letter, I shiver with dread.  What terrifies me is that, as I rip the exhausted envelope, she may be dead. . . I dread the fact that life is always slower than death and I have been chosen, despite my weakness, against my will, to witness the discrepancy.\\"  \\"A Coin\\" is a remarkable story which vividly captures both the hellish, contingent existence of Aida in war-torn Sarajevo and the dark anxiety of her Chicago correspondent.<br />\\"The Sorge Spy Ring\\" is another outstanding story, the fictional childhood memoir of a boy growing up in Sarajevo during the time of Tito, a boy fascinated with spies who develops an elaborate fantasy that his father is a spy.  It is a fantasy that seemingly becomes grim reality when Marshal Tito's security police appear in the middle of the night and take the boy's father away.  He is released from prison several years later, \\"diagnosed with brain cancer, curled into an old man, with most of his teeth missing.\\"  Longer than the story itself is the subtext, a series of forty footnotes that relate snippets of the biography of Richard Sorge, a real-life Soviet spy who achieved high rank in the German army and the Nazi Party and was eventually executed by Japanese security police in 1944.  <br />\\"Exchange of Pleasant Words\\" is a wonderful fictional memoir of theHemon family history and a Hemon family reunion of sorts.  \\"Inspired by the success of the Sarajevo Olympiad and the newly established ancient family history, the family council, headed righteously by my father, decided to have an epic get-together, which was to be held only once, and was to be recorded as the Hemoniad.\\"<br />\\"Blind Josef Pronek &amp; Dead Souls\\", which runs to nearly eighty pages and may be characterized as a novella, tells the story of a man named Pronek who emigrates to Chicago from Sarajevo in 1992.  The story appears to be, of course, the thinly fictionalized, episodic story of the author himself. While somewhat uneven in quality, the story within the novella titled \\"Iceberg Lettuce, Romaine Lettuce\\" is a wonderfully humorous narrative of Pronek's first job in the United States that displays Hemon's writing at its best.<br />\\"The Life and Work of Alphonse Kauders\\" is a series of short, factual statements about a character named Alphonse Kauders, who appears Zelig-like (as one reviewer has aptly put it) at various important moments in history and with various historical personages.  It is a humorous and enigmatic piece that is accompanied by a glossary providing background on its referents.<br />Finally, there are three shorter stories.  \\"Imitation of Life\\" is a wonderful little memoir of childhood recollection, fantasy and film.  \\"The Accordion\\" is an almost photographic tale of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.  \\"Islands\\", the first story in the book, is another reminiscence of a childhood trip from Yugoslavia to the coast that suffers from excessive and discordant use of language.  It is the weakest of the writing in this collection, a story that has a kind of strangeness that apparently derives as much from Hemon's alienation from the English language as it does from any innate skill as a writer.	2001-07-31
US	38955473	RZRGCWUP1LKUX	0385494149	801233492	Enduring Love: A Novel	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A Narrative of Science, Religion and Psychological Obsession	I first read Ian McEwan in 1976.  I had just arrived in Ireland for a year of study and picked up an inexpensive Picador paperback edition of his first collection of stories, \\"First Love, Last Rites.\\"  I still have that paperback, its pages dog-eared and fragile, and I re-read it from time-to-time.  After that first encounter, I became a McEwan \\"fan,\\" enraptured by his dark, edgy, disturbing, psychologically obsessive narratives.  <br />\\"Enduring Love\\", published more than twenty years after that first collection of stories, is different from his earliest writing in the sense that its narrative turns around a more conventional, albeit still psychologically driven and bizarre, set of circumstances.  <br />As many reviewers have commented, the first chapter of \\"Enduring Love\\" is a compelling page-turner.  Joe and Clarissa, long-time lovers, are setting up a picnic under a tree on the edge of a wide expanse of field.  Clarissa, a Keats scholar, has just returned from an extended research trip to Rome and the picnic is an occasion for them to celebrate their reunion.  In Joe's first person narrative: \\"The beginning is simple to mark.  We were in sunlight under a turkey oak, partly protected from a strong, gusty wind.  I was kneeling on the grass with a corkscrew in my hand, and Clarissa was passing me the bottle-a 1987 Daumas Gassac.  This was the moment, this was the pinprick on the time map: I was stretching out my hand, and as the cool neck and the black foil touched my palm, we heard a man's shout.  We turned and looked across the field and saw the danger.\\"<br />And what was the danger?  Joe and Clarissa see a hot air balloon pulling away from the ground, a young boy in the basket of the balloon while an older man, his companion, struggles desperately to hold onto the balloon, to keep it tethered to the ground in the face of gusty winds.  <br />Soon, Joe is running across the field to help, along with three other men.  It is a moment in time, \\"the pinprick on the time map,\\" that Joe explores obsessively, examining it, turning it, over and over, trying to understand how such an instant can change an entire life.  <br />Joe and the three other men soon catch up to the balloon, the four of them, together with the boy's older companion, struggling to hold the balloon down, to keep it from blowing off with the young boy as scared passenger.  It becomes apparent, however, that their efforts are failing, the balloon starting to rise higher, the four men holding on, each of them facing grave physical danger and a powerful moral dilemma.  Each must decide whether to continue to hold on, running the risk that if the others do not then he will face near certain death from falling.  As Joe later relates, looking back on that moment, \\"I didn't know, nor have I ever discovered, who let go first.  I am not prepared to accept that it was me.  What is certain is that if we had not broken ranks, our collective weight would have brought the balloon to earth a few seconds later as the gust subsided.\\"<br />Thus begins \\"Enduring Love\\", the first chapter seemingly narrating an event and a moral conundrum that immediately captures the reader, leading him to believe that the rest of the novel will explore how this event affects the lives of Joe and Clarissa and the rest of the book's characters.  However, in typical McEwan fashion, the plot takes a much different turn.  What begins as a tragic event that elicits moral ponderings veers into a narrative of science, religion and psychological obsession.  <br />Joe Rose encounters one of the other would-be rescuers, Jed Parry, while standing in the field after their ill-starred rescue attempt.  Parry, an apparently religious fanatic, sees deep meaning in his time-bound encounter with Joe.  He becomes obsessed with Joe, stalking him and, eventually, threatening Joe's relationship with Clarissa and Joe's very well-being.  Parry suffers from de Clerambault's syndrome, a type of homo-erotic obsession with religious overtones.  As the scientific appendix to the novel notes, \\"this is indeed a most lasting form of love, often terminated only by the death of the patient.\\"<br />\\"Enduring Love\\" thus begins by posing a moral dilemma, but soon evolves into a compelling novel of deviant psychological obsession, of conflict between religion and science, and of a deep, introspective examination of how a loving relationship can soon unravel in the face of threats from the outside.  It is a thought-provoking novel, albeit one which at times seems somewhat lacking in feeling, the reader (at least this reader) having difficulty identifying with the often clinical coldness of Joe's first person narration.  While the tone of Joe's narration may be intentional, McEwan intending to write in a voice that reflects the unfeeling tone of Joe's deep-seated scientific rationalism, the narrative never quite rings true to life.  \\"Enduring Love\\" is, nonetheless, a fascinating and worthwhile novel that gives the reader much to ponder.	2001-07-24

I say \\"unreliable\\" quite consciously, because Freddie Montgomery says as much throughout the novel, another in a long line of remarkable fictions from John Banville, perhaps Ireland's finest living author.  As Freddie relates at the end of his tale, \\"I thought of trying to publish this, my testimony.  But no.  I have asked Inspector Haslet to put it into my file, with the other, official fictions . . . [H]ow much of it is true?  All of it.  None of it.  Only the shame.\\" <br />And what is Freddie Montgomery's story?  An educated and brilliant academic, he married a young woman, Daphne, whom he met while teaching at Berkeley.  He left academia for a dissolute life on a Mediterranean island.  He became indebted there to apparently dark and unseemly characters, left his wife and young child behind, and returned to his family home in Ireland to obtain enough money to repay his debts.  While in Ireland, he committed a brutal and seemingly inexplicable murder, fled the scene of his crime in a kind of \\"Lost Weekend\\" of drunken binging and obsession with his dark deed, and, ultimately, is apprehended and imprisoned.  He writes the dark, powerful, obsessive interior monologue of \\"The Book of Evidence\\" while sitting in prison awaiting his trial.<br />The reader is never quite certain what to make of Freddie Montgomery.  He is, indeed, a disturbed and disturbing narrator, someone who kills an innocent woman for no apparent reason, with chilling sang-froid.  He bludgeons her with a hammer and then wonders, as if he were the victim:  \\"How could this be happening to me-it was all so unfair.  Bitter tears of self-pity squeezed into my eyes.\\"<br />Freddie Montgomery's narrative is lucid, but it's not clear that he is entirely sane.  There is complete lack of feeling.  He seems a psychopath, or worse.  Perhaps he's simply mad.  Perhaps he is commenting on himself when he says, \\"Madmen do not frighten me, or even make me uneasy.  Indeed, I find that their ravings soothe me.  I think it is because everything, from the explosion of a nova to the fall of dust in a deserted room, is to them of vast and equal significance, and therefore meaningless.\\"  <br />There is a cold anomie that pervades Freddie's actions, his reflections, his feelings.  It reminds the reader of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" or \\"Notes from Underground\\".   But there is also a dark humor and a sleight of hand working here that is absent from the great Russian master.  Perhaps Irish sensibility is creeping in, perhaps just the penumbra of the post-modern.  Whatever it is, it works.	2001-07-23

I think, particularly, of Mary Karr (\\"The Liar's Club\\" and, more recently, \\"Cherry\\") and Kathryn Harrison (\\"The Kiss\\") and, of course, Frank McCourt's Irish ramblings, among others.  But thirty or so years before all these candid, sometimes titillating, self confessions, Frank Conroy wrote a book titled \\"Stop-Time,\\" a memoir that surpasses all of them in the beauty of its prose and the poignant and deep sensitivity of its feeling.<br />\\"Stop-Time\\" tells the story of Frank Conroy's first eighteen years of life, a life marked by the ordinary rather than the lurid or unseemly.  But the ordinariness of the life is elevated by the dreamlike, sensitive, asynchronous wonder of Conroy's writing.  As Conroy relates in the first chapter of his narrative, in a passage that gives you a feeling for his writing style and for the narrative to follow:  \\"My faith in the firmness of time slips away gradually.  I begin to believe that chronological time is an illusion and that some other principle organizes existence.  My memories flash like clips of film from unrelated movies.\\" <br />\\"Stop-Time\\" is a stunning example of how great writing can elevate even the most ordinary of lives.  The facts of Conroy's memoir are not remarkable.  He grew up in relatively poor circumstances, his father died of cancer when he was 12 and lived most of his life apart from Conroy's mother, he spent his time primarily between New York and Florida, and he was a bright boy who performed miserably in school.  But while the broad outlines of his life are seemingly unremarkable, Conroy possesses the great gift of the writer:  he can focus on the mote of dust floating in the sunlight and take the reader into a world of dreams and memories that are startlingly real, a world that the reader can feel and identify from his or her own recollections of growing up.  <br/>Conroy can lie down in a kennel with his family's dogs and dream that he, too, is a dog running through a field.  He can relate the fear of being left alone in a cold cabin in the middle of winter while his mother and her boyfriend work the third shift at a state mental institution.  He can recall a trip to the carnival with his best friend and how he was cheated and more by a seedy carnie hawker.  He can precisely detail learning all the tricks you can do with a yo-yo, and learn them well.  And he can recall the tumescent longings of early adolescence, of sneaking and peeking with his cousin and, as he got older, of experiencing, too.  It is all related with a feeling, with a literary sense, that would be called \\"perfect pitch\\" if it were music.      <br />\\"Stop-Time\\" is a remarkably written memoir that not only should be read, but also studied, as a stunning example of how the literary imagination can give vibrant life to the mundane.	2001-07-17

Set primarily in Los Angeles (although some of his novels, such as \\"American Tabloid\\", have taken on bigger settings and themes), Ellroy's narratives are marked by what one critic has described as a \\"telegraphic\\" style, one short sentence following another in a breathless staccato of hard-boiled language, graphic (at times grisly) description, and a pervasive, and often seemingly morbid and pessimistic, obsession with sexual crime and violence.  <br />Ellroy is an astonishingly good writer, albeit a writer who is not for everyone:  his vivid and grotesquely detailed explorations of rape and murder, of men preying on woman, of brutal police practices, often make the reader squeamish and uncomfortable.  The effect is powerful testimony to the talent.<br />But where does Ellroy's remarkable writing come from?  \\"My Dark Places,\\" subtitled \\"An L.A. Crime Memoir,\\" provides an answer: from the real life noir of Ellroy's life.<br />On a Sunday morning in June, 1958, James Ellroy's forty-five year old mother, Jean, was murdered. Her body was found in a vacant lot next to a school in El Monte, California, a gritty, working class city east of Los Angeles.  \\"A nylon stocking and a cotton cord were lashed around her neck.  Both ligatures were tightly knotted.\\"  James Ellroy was ten years old at the time.  His parents were divorced. He had just returned home from a weekend visit with his father when he was told about the murder.  While a \\"Swarthy Man\\" was seen with the victim, the murder was never solved.<br />\\"My Dark Places\\" tells the story of Jean Ellroy's murder in 1958.  It also tells the story of the next twenty years of James Ellroy's life, when he drifted to drugs and alcohol, to an obsession with crimes of sex and violence, to a kind of noirish bottom which was the prelude to his life as a writer.  It tells the story of how the noir obsessions of Ellroy's fictions were the creative and self-sustaining response to the dark episodes of his real life.  And, finally, it tells the story of Ellroy's renewed search for his mother's murderer and, along the way, his search for his mother herself.  In Ellroy's words:<br />\\"I knew things about us.  I sensed other things.  Her death corrupted my imagination and gave me exploitable gift.   My mother gave me the gift and the curse of obsession.  It began as curiosity in lieu of childish grief.  It flourished as a quest for dark knowledge and mutated into a horrible thirst for sexual and mental stimulation.  Obsessive drives almost killed me.  A rage to turn my obsessions into something good and useful saved me.  I outlived the curse.  The gift assumed its final form in language.\\"<br />\\"My Dark Places\\" is a dark and disturbing memoir, an intimate plunge into the life and the psyche of James Ellroy.  It is also, like his novels, a chilling exploration of real life crimes of sex and violence in Los Angeles, Ellroy's search for his mother's murderer being the touchstone for a narrative contrail of grisly and perverse crimes that he encounters along the way.	2001-07-12
US	38955473	R81NW96N5QXJ3	0316925284	891948822	A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again: Essays and Arguments	Books	4	43	44	N	N	Best Introduction to One of America's Finest Young Authors	&quot;A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again&quot; is a collection of seven essays originally published between 1992 and 1996. They range over a variety of topics and, while somewhat uneven in quality, demonstrate that David Foster Wallace is one of contemporary America's most intelligent and imaginative writers.<br />The best of the essays are two that were originally published in Harper's magazine, &quot;Getting Away from Being Pretty Much Away from It All&quot; and the title essay, &quot;A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again&quot;. <br />In &quot;Getting Away from Being Pretty Much Away from It All&quot;, Wallace relates a visit to the Illinois State Fair in 1993 in a style that alternates between intellectual ponderousness and hilariously obsessive description and commentary on the minutest details of his experience. Approaching his task with the wonder of a child, Wallace, in a passage illustrative of his style (or at least one aspect of it), reflects: &quot;One of the few things I still miss from my Midwest childhood was this weird, deluded but unshakable conviction that everything around me existed all and only For Me. Am I the only one who had this queer deep sense as a kid?-that everything exterior to me existed only insofar as it affected me somehow?-that all things were somehow, via some occult adult activity, specially arranged for my benefit? . . . The child leaves a room, and now everything in that room, once he's no longer there to see it, melts away into some void of potential or else (my personal childhood theory) is trundled away by occult adults and stored until the child's reentry into the room recalls it all back into animate service.&quot;<br />Similarly, in the title essay, Wallace spends nearly a hundred pages describing a seven-night Caribbean cruise on a Celebrity Cruise Lines megaship. Wallace ponders the fantasy the Celebrity brochures are selling, wanting to believe &quot;that maybe this Ultimate Fantasy Vacation will be enoughpampering, that this time the luxury and pleasure will be so completely and faultlessly administered that my Infantile part will be sated.&quot; But it will not be, for, as Wallace relates in another ponderous/humorous philosophical musing: &quot;But the Infantile part of me is insatiable-in fact its whole essence or dasein or whatever lies in its a priori insatiability. In response to any environment of extraordinary gratification and pampering, the Insatiable Infant part of me will simply adjust its desires upward until it once again levels out at its homeostasis of terrible dissatisfaction.&quot; It's like watching a show like &quot;The Love Boat&quot; filtered through a humorous Heideggerian lens.<br />In both essays, Wallace brilliantly and humorously captures his experience, writing obsessive and, at times, gut wrenchingly funny commentary on everything from the baton twirling competition at the Illinois State Fair (which had me laughing out loud while riding the exercise bike at the YMCA, drawing querulous stares) to the dangers of the vacuum sewage system on board the Celebrity cruise ship. And the humor is magnified, again and again, by footnote after digressive footnote, each microscopically elaborating Wallace's observations, commentaries and deductions.<br />Another outstanding essay is Wallace's piece on director David Lynch (&quot;David Lynch Keeps His Head&quot;). Originally published in Premiere magazine, it is an incisive examination of Lynch's films commingled with a typically zany journalistic relation of Wallace's visit to the shooting of Lynch's &quot;Lost Highway&quot; in 1995. <br />For anyone who has read Wallace's doorstop of a novel, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, there is another essay here that is worth reading, &quot;E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction&quot;. Here, Wallace provides an analytical view of how fiction has changed in the U.S. over the past forty years and how fiction has been influenced by pervasive cultural presence oftelevision. It is an essay full of thoughtful musings, although I found it, at times, too long and disjointed to keep my full attention. If any piece in this collection deserves editing, this is it.<br />The other essays include a fascinating essay on Wallace's visit to a professional tennis tournament (and, in particular, Michael Joyce, &quot;whose realness and approachability and candor are a big reason why he's whom I end up spending the most time watching and talking to&quot;), a piece on Wallace's adolescent days playing competitive tennis in Illinois (and the way play was affected by the winds and geometry and so forth), and a short book review that delves into the long-standing topic of &quot;the death of the author&quot;.<br />&quot;A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again&quot; is ultimately the best introduction to the writing of David Foster Wallace, a collection I strongly recommend to anyone interested in contemporary American fiction and this brilliant young writer.	2001-07-06

The woman was twenty-two year old Elizabeth Short, a femme fatale who had moved from Medford, Massachusetts to Southern California as a teenager and lived an itinerant and promiscuous life in post-World War II Hollywood.  Her body had been cut in half at the waist and disemboweled.  It also showed signs of extreme torture.  It was a gruesome murder that caught the undivided attention of the Los Angeles press, particularly the Hearst papers, as well as that of the Los Angeles police and district attorney's office.  Quickly dubbed the \\"Black Dahlia\\" murder, the real-life crime remains unsolved to this day and has been a fertile source of books and articles speculating on the perpetrator of this noirish horror.<br />\\"The Black Dahlia\\" is James Ellroy's fictional re-working of the story, a gritty, graphic and vividly imagined crime novel that marks Ellroy as the finest, and perhaps only, contemporary successor to Chandler, Hammett and Cain.  <br />\\"The Black Dahlia\\" is the first-person, hard-boiled narrative of Bucky Bleichert, a member of the LAPD Warrants Squad at the time of the Black Dahlia murder.  Bleichert, and his partner, Lee Blanchard, are both former boxers.  They also share the friendship and romantic attention of a young woman named Kay Lake, a woman with intellectual interests and a somewhat checkered past.  From this starting point, Ellroy writes a fascinating, complex and cynical tale of how the fascination with the murdered Elizabeth Short-the Black Dahlia-marks the lives of all the books characters (and this book is bursting with characters and motives).  <br />Ellroy is brilliant in developing a wide range of realistic characters, in writing and successfully resolving a complex and extraordinarily imagined plot, and in depicting the corrupt and often self-serving underbelly of the LAPD and District Attorney's office in post-World War II Los Angeles.  In a tone which suggests the subversive and conspiratorial elements of Don DeLillo's \\"Underworld\\", but written in the starker style of a noir novel, Ellroy uses the real-life story to show the manipulation and corruption that often belies what we read in the popular press and what lives on in the popular imagination.   <br />\\"The Black Dahlia\\" is not intended to be a factual accounting of the real-life murder.  Rather, it is a fiction that brilliantly uses the real-life murder to develop a vivid (and at times gut-wrenchingly graphic) description of how the lurid fascination with the Black Dahlia became obsessive, fetishistic, in the lives of Ellroy's characters.  If you're interested in noir, or even if you're interested in just plain good, hard-boiled crime novels, \\"The Black Dahlia\\" should be at the top of your reading list.	2001-07-05

Seeking a sanctuary to finish his work, he rents a small cottage at an estate in southern Ireland known as Fern House, \\"a big gloomy pile with ivy and peeling walls and a smashed fanlight over the door, the kind of place where you picture a mad stepdaughter locked up in the attic.\\"  It is a setting, and a story, heavy with gothic overtones.    <br /> In his words, \\"the book was as good as done, I had only to gather up a few loose ends and write the conclusion-but in those first few weeks at Ferns something started to go wrong . . . I was concentrating, with morbid fascination, on the chapter I had devoted to [Newton's] breakdown and those two letters [Newton had written] to Locke.\\"  <br />He becomes obsessed, however, not only with Newton's two letters to John Locke, but also with the inhabitants of Fern House:  Edward, the often drunk master of the house; Charlotte, his wife, a tall, middle-aged woman with an abstracted air and a penchant for gardening; Ottilie, the big, blonde, twenty-four year old niece of Charlotte; and Michael, the adopted son of Edward and Charlotte.  <br />The narrator soon becomes entangled with Ottilie in a mysterious way when she appears at his door.  \\"It's strange to be offered, without conditions, a body you don't really want.\\"  But what, exactly, is the nature of his relationship with Ottilie?  When he embraces her, he feels \\"the soft shock of being suddenly, utterly inhabited.\\"  In the pervasive aura of the gothic, the reader wonders exactly what is happening, for, as the narrator enigmatically relates in the middle of the novel while making love to Ottilie, \\"how should I tell her that she was no longer the woman I was holding in my arms?\\"  It is a strange statement, presumably intended to refer to the fact that the narrator's true obsession is with the older, aloof Charlotte, even as he cavorts with Ottilie.  The mystery is fed by the narrator's conclusion, where he speaks of brooding on certain words, \\"succubus for instance.\\"  It suggests, in short, a kind of surreal narrative imagining, where the realism of the narrator's struggle with his book on Newton is confounded by the incursion of the strange, enigmatic and, at times, dreamlike inhabitants of Fern House.  <br />\\"The Newton Letter\\" is a powerful, intricate and allusive work of imagination that demands the reader's careful and thoughtful attention.  Banville shows, with remarkable skillfulness, how the narrator's imagined history of the inhabitants of Fern House is undermined by successive, incremental discoveries of the reality of their lives.  At the same time, Banville draws on the gothic to lend his tale an imaginative element that is both a counterpoint to the real lives at Fern House and a touchstone to the enigma of the Newton letters.  Like great works of literature, \\"The Newton Letter\\" is an ambiguous text open to many interpretations, the writing an elliptical treasure that allows the reader's imagination to run free in the interstices of Banville's creative field.	2001-07-02
US	38955473	R2OCT0P3DDR29J	0312273207	96429552	In America: A Novel	Books	3	11	12	N	N	A Listless Tale That Glides On A Sparkling Smooth Surface	The plot of \\"In America\\", Susan Sontag's National Book Award-winning novel, is adumbrated in her introductory note, where she describes the real historical life that inspired the fictional work.  In Sontag's words, the novel was \\"inspired by the emigration to America in 1876 of Helena Modrzejewska, Poland's most celebrated  actress, accompanied by her husband, Count Karol Chlapowski, her fifteen-year-old son Rudolf, and the young journalist and future author of `Quo Vadis' Henryk Sienkiewicz, and a few friends; their brief sojourn in Anaheim, California; and Modrzejewska's subsequent triumphant career on the American stage under the name of Helen Modjeska.\\"   While Sontag strongly emphasizes that the characters and actions depicted in her novel are purely invented (and there is no reason to believe the contrary), the plot largely follows the biography that inspired it.<br />\\"In America\\" begins in a post-modernist fashion, the book's \\"Chapter Zero\\" being the first person narrative of a contemporary authorial voice who finds herself coming out of the cold winter of an unidentified Eastern European city, shivering, into a party in the private dining room of a hotel more than a hundred years earlier.  There is seemingly a disjunction of time and place.  The narrator does not understand the language the people are speaking, \\"but somehow, I didn't question how, their words reached me as sense.\\"  From this point, the authorial voice, the imagination, begins naming the people in the room-in effect, begins creating the characters that will populate the tale to follow-and begins probing the animated conversation she overhears, the snippets of enigmatic dialogue that will gradually accrete into the novel.  As the narrator suggests at the end of this Chapter Zero, in words resonant of a theme by Virginia Woolf, \\"each of us carries a room within ourselves, waiting to be furnished and peopled, and if you listen closely, you may need to silence everything in your own room, you canhear the sounds of that other room inside your head.\\"  Thus, in typical Sontag fashion, the novel itself begins with a self-conscious intrusion of theory and authorial presence.<br />From this interesting and auspicious beginning, \\"In America\\" seamlessly glides into the narrative proper, the story of Maryna  Zalezowska, a much beloved Polish actress who, together with her husband Bogdan, her son Piotr, her paramour Ryszard, and an entourage of friends and followers, emigrates to America in 1876.  Landing in New York, the group spends a brief period living in Hoboken, visiting the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and exploring New York City before embarking on a voyage to the West.  After a brief sojourn in San Francisco, they move down the coast to Southern California, where they establish a small settlement in Anaheim.  Maryna, the leader of her band of ardent disciples, sees their vineyard and farm in Anaheim as a kind of acting out of Fourieristic ideals, a little Brook Farm of Polish emigrants in the Wild West.  Life is hard, however, and the utopian dream soon becomes a dystopic unraveling as Maryna goes back to San Francisco, has a brief affair with Ryzsard and returns to the theater.  Her husband, Bogan, remains at the Anaheim settlement until it can be sold and then rejoins Maryna in San Francisco, where she has become an overnight theatrical sensation, her Polish stardom now burning brightly in America.   <br />From this point, the novel becomes almost exclusively the story of Maryna.  She changes her name to Marina Zalenska, travels to Virginia City and, eventually, New York City (and even, briefly, London), and attracts fans and admirers wherever she goes.  Her life becomes a self-centered, exhaustive tour of America, performing with her own repertory company and making stage appearances with the Edwin Booth, the most renowned actor of the time.  Pushing the narrative's other characters into the shadows, Marina Zalenska makes America her own, \\"In America\\" being not so much the story of what it was like for a group of Eastern Europeans to emigrate to America, but, rather, the story of Marina Zalenska's personal triumph in America.  <br />Susan Sontag is a brilliant writer, her prose supple and lithe.  Reading this book is effortless.  Sontag also uses a range of stylistic devices-journal entries, letters, theatrical dialogue, monologue-which make \\"In America\\" a fascinating literary construction.  However, the quality of the writing does not redeem the listless tenor of the tale or the shallowness of the characters and ideas which Sontag propogates.  At one point, Maryna says, \\"an actor doesn't need to have an essence.  Perhaps it would be a hindrance for an actor to have an essence.  An actor needs only a mask.\\"  Unfortunately, Maryna's view of acting seemingly permeates this novel, the view of the character becoming the practice of the author: the characters and the ideas of \\"In America\\" are not essential, but only superficial.  Like the post-modernist beginnings of Chapter Zero, the reader only gets a shallow tale, a tale that glides on a sparkling smooth surface with trivial and uninteresting characters; while the writing is easy, the story fails to hold the reader's interest and, hence, the reading becomes difficult and soporific.  \\"In America\\" is perhaps worth reading, but it is not deserving of the National Book Award.	2001-06-22

And Then Read Again	Walker Percy was forty-six years old when his first published novel, \\"The Moviegoer\\", was awarded the National Book Award in 1962.  It was, in some sense, the public beginning of the second half of Percy's life for, as Percy himself wrote in 1972: \\"Life is much stranger than art-and often more geometrical.  My life breaks exactly in half:  1st half=growing up Southern and medical; 2nd half=imposing art on 1st half.\\"  But what, exactly, did Percy mean when he said this?  In some sense, \\"The Moviegoer\\" is the beginning of an answer.<br />Percy was born in 1915 and lived his early life in Birmingham, Alabama.  His grandfather committed suicide when Walker was an infant and his father, too, committed suicide in 1929.  Following his father's suicide, his mother moved Walker and his two brothers to Mississippi.  Percy's family was one of the oldest families in the South and he and his brothers soon found a father figure in the form of his cousin, William Alexander Percy, known affectionately as Uncle Will.  Three years after his father's suicide, Percy's life was again marked by tragedy when his mother's car went off a bridge, killing her and leaving Walker and his brothers in the charge of his Uncle Will.  <br />Percy went to medical school at Columbia University, where he contracted tuberculosis during his internship.  In and out of sanitariums for several years, he finally returned to the South in his early 30s, getting married in 1946 and settling in the New Orleans area, where he lived the remainder of his life.  It was at this time that Percy received an inheritance from his Uncle Will that allowed him to devote himself completely to his long-standing interest in literature and philosophy.  <br />I relate the biographical details because, as you read \\"The Moviegoer\\", it seems (not surprisingly) heavily marked by Percy's life experience, the author's biography being one point of reference for the novel.<br /> \\"The Moviegoer\\" is a peculiarly American and belated expression of the existential novel that had been so brilliantly articulated in France by Albert Camus.  Like \\"The Stranger\\", Percy's novel focuses on meaning-in this case, the obsession of Binx Bolling, the novel's narrator, on what he calls the \\"search\\".  As Bolling says at one point, \\"the search is what anyone would undertake if he were not sunk in the everydayness of his own life.\\"  And exactly what does this mean?  \\"To become aware of the possibility of the search is to be onto something.  Not to be onto something is to be in despair.\\"  An enigmatic definition, but one which makes the reader who spends time with \\"The Moviegoer\\", who reads the book carefully and reflectively, to think more deeply about his or her own life.<br />\\"The Moviegoer\\" is not a novel dominated by plot.  At a superficial level, the novel relates, in a wry and matter-of-fact way, a few days in the seemingly unremarkable life of Bolling, a New Orleans stockbroker whose main activities are going to the movies and carrying on with each of his successive secretaries.  \\"Once I thought of going into law or medicine or even pure science.  I even dreamed of doing something great.  But there is much to be said for giving up such grand ambitions and living the most ordinary life imaginable, a life without the old longings; selling stocks and bonds and mutual funds; quitting work at five o'clock like everyone else; having a girl and perhaps one day settling down and raising a flock of Marcias and Sandras and Lindas of my own.\\"<br />What \\"The Moviegoer\\" suggests is resonant of Thoreau's contention that most men lead lives of quiet desperation.  But it is a desperation that arises not from the ordinariness of everyday lives, but, rather, from the failure to transform that ordinariness through contemplation and self-reflection, through an appreciation for the mundane.  Thus, in the book's epigraph, Percy quotes Kierkegaard:  \\"the specific character of despair is precisely this:  it is unaware of being despair.\\"  As Percy has suggested in another of his books, \\"Lost in the Cosmos\\" (a work of non-fiction subtitled \\"The Last Self-Help Book\\"), we inhabit a society of alienated and despairing \\"non-suicides\\" who Percy wanted to transform, through his writing, into \\"ex-suicides\\".  In Binx Bolling's words: \\"For some time now the impression has been growing upon me that everyone is dead.  It happens when I speak to people.  In the middle of the sentence it will come over me: yes, beyond a doubt this is death . . . At times it seems that the conversation is spoken by automatons who have no choice in what they say.\\"  <br />\\"The Moviegoer\\" is a thoughtful and a thought-provoking book that should be read and then re-read, slowly and carefully, for every paragraph is laden with insight into the character of its narrator, the character of its author and, ultimately, the character of ourselves.	2001-06-10

Winslow went on to write a detailed compendium of alleged cases of premature burial, mixing fact with folklore and creating a kind of Ur-text for what subsequently became both a widespread popular fear in Western Europe and an at-times respected (if sometimes eccentric) intellectual and social movement for measures to eliminate the risk of premature burial.  <br />In \\"Buried Alive\\", Dr. Jan Bondeson, professor at the University of Wales College of Medicine, traces the history of the fear of premature burial in Western Europe and the United States, a fear that attained its clearest popular expression in the macabre literature of writers such as Edgar Allen Poe, but which had a much more significant, albeit less well known, intellectual history.  Beginning with Winslow's treatise, which was written in Latin and known by few outside the Parisian medical profession, Bondeson carefully explores how Winslow's work was translated into French, and popularized, in the mid-eighteenth century by Jean-Jacques Bruhier, another French physician.  While Winslow's Latin treatise would have been confined to the dusty archives of history, Bruhier was a great popularizer and his translation and expansion of Winslow's book was widely read and translated in France and other countries of Western Europe.  From this popularization, there developed a widespread popular fear of premature burial, as well as a legitimate medical debate about how to determine whether a person was dead or alive.<br />The popular fear and the professional debate went through many iterations.  In Germany, Christopher Wilhelm Hufeland, a practicing physician, published an article in 1790 which outlined a plan to erect a house for the dead in his hometown of Weimar.  The idea was based upon the general belief that the only reliable means of determining death was the onset of putrefaction.  Popularizing an idea originally suggested in Bruhier's work, Hufeland's proposal was avidly endorsed within Germany and led to the construction of numerous waiting mortuaries or \\"Leichenhauser\\", where the dead were attached to alarm devices to detect movement and identify those who were not, in fact, dead and also to observe the onset of putrefaction.  Indeed, Leichenhauser continued to exist into the twentieth century in Germany.<br />In England and the United States, both the popular and medical concern about premature burial arrived much later.  Indeed, it was only in the nineteenth century that the English and Americans began to give any credence to the fear and to the medical issue and, even then, it largely became the short-lived domain of spiritualists and charlatans.  It did result, however, in the development of a number of ingenious security vaults and other coffins and burial devices intended to allow the person buried alive to survive and signal those in the world of the living of their grim fate.  Perhaps the most well known of these devices was the so-called \\"Bateson's Belfry\\", a coffin which allowed its still living inhabitant to ring a bell that stood above the grave, presumably permitting a post-interment rescue.<br />\\"Buried Alive\\" is a fascinating and methodical exploration of the fear and the intellectual and social history surrounding the idea of premature burial in Western Europe and the United States from the eighteenth century to the present.  However, unlike Bondeson's earlier work, \\"A Cabinet of Medical Curiosities\\", which never ceased to fascinate and entertain, \\"Buried Alive\\" is much more like an academic treatise, a book whichcertainly has suitable rewards for the reader, but which is written in prose that is dry as bone.	2001-06-03

Then imagine that a twelve-year-old girl who lives in the town disappears in the middle of the day, less than a mile from her home, while returning from school.  Disappears without a trace, except only for the bicycle found by the side of the road.  Then imagine a more chilling twist.  The girl's clothes and belongings suddenly appear at the town police station, the clothes washed and neatly folded in a box.  A second and a third girl vanish in the same way, their clothes, too, cleaned, folded and mysteriously returned.  And all of this occurs in a town with a history, a history that includes the unsolved murder of a seemingly promiscuous, middle-aged woman several years earlier, a woman who was known by many men in the town.  <br />This is the narrative premise of  \\"The Church of Dead Girls\\", a literate and disturbing portrait of how a community unravels when the bonds of trust are broken, when someone in the midst of the community becomes a killer.  And while the reader knows from the first lines of the book what has happened (\\"This is how they looked: three dead girls propped up in three straight chairs\\"), Stephen Dobyns succeeds in writing a story that is as complex as real life, a discomforting exploration of the lives and histories and motivations of everyone in the town.  Narrated by an enigmatic and unidentified biology teacher, a middle-aged man who has taught all of the missing girls and has a close personal relationship with a young girl who is one of their classmates, \\"The Church of Dead Girls\\" is peopled by a wide range of characters whose lives intersect in many ways, each drawing suspicion, if not for their relationship with the victims, then simply because they deviate from the norm.  <br />\\"The Church of Dead Girls\\" is the perfect book for someone looking for a well written, page-turning diversion or someone who wants to curl up in their bed alone on adark night and give themselves over to a chillingly disturbing tale of every town's worst nightmare.	2001-06-02

I remember first reading him while I was a graduate student in Ireland.  I always loved horror, the macabre, and other ghoulish tales, so when I saw a paperback copy of  \\"Salem's Lot\\" in a department store bookstand on O'Connell Street, I quickly bought it and spent a day in my room reading it beginning to end.  I read \\"Carrie\\" shortly after that and even saw the heavily edited version of the movie in Dublin, where censors savagely brought scissors to celluloid.  I became, in short, a Stephen King fan.<br />After returning to the States, I continued as an avid King reader.  The timing was usually convenient, since paperback editions of his novels appeared in the bookstores just around the time I was finishing my graduate school exams, or embarking on a summer vacation when I began working for a living, and provided a convenient escape from reality.  I vividly remember, for example, lying in bed, the covers up to my chin, reading \\"The Shining\\" alone in the dark New York City night in my studio apartment.  I still regard \\"The Shining\\" as King's finest novel.  <br />Over the years, I've continued to read and enjoy Stephen King, avoiding only his fantasy works (such as \\"The Dark Tower\\").  King knows how to tell a story and his ability to weave contemporary culture into his fiction is unsurpassed.  He is, in short, one of the best of this generation's popular writers even though his work has often been relegated to the horror genre.<br />Having read most of King's published fiction, I looked forward to reading \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft\\", hoping to gain insight into King's approach to writing and an understanding of how some of his novels have been written.  I was, unfortunately, disappointed.<br />\\"On Writing\\" is generally broken into four parts.  The first part, covering approximately the first half of the book, is a loosely organized autobiographical sketch of King's life.  For someone who has followed King's career, there is little new here and it's only value is as another short riff on King's life.  The second part of the book, covering most of the second half of the book, provides King's insights on writing.  King has little new to offer and, frankly, his suggestions are of little value to anyone who has actually engaged in the writing trade.  It is helpful, if at all, only to the neophyte who has little or no knowledge of writing or useful writers' references (such as Strunk and White).  The remaining two short sections contain a narrative of King's near-fatal 1999 accident (which has been published elsewhere) and a short section illustrating the rewrite of one of King's stories.  <br />If you're a Stephen King fan, then \\"On Writing\\" is probably worth the short investment of time it takes to read this somewhat disjointed book.  If you're not, don't judge King by this book and don't expect to learn much about the craft of writing.  It's an interesting insight into the author, but not an interesting insight into the author's craft.	2001-05-22

So much for the erstwhile judgment of the publishing establishment, for this novel is a near perfect work of fiction that can rightfully be considered one of the finest American novels of this century.<br />\\"Desperate Characters\\" tells the story of Otto and Sophie Bentwood, a childless couple in their 40s (\\"Sophie was two months older than Otto\\") living in a fashionably renovated Brooklyn brownstone circa 1970. They have a high income and can purchase \\"pretty much\\" whatever they want.  Their bookcase holds the complete works of Goethe and two shelves of French poets.  They have a Mercedes-Benz sedan and a Victorian farmhouse on Long Island.  Otto is a lawyer and Sophie a translator.  They are, by all outward appearances, living the perfect life.  It is the genius of Paula Fox to lay bare the underlying disturbances, the morbid self-consciousness and despair, the ennui, that undermines this seemingly ordered world.  \\"Desperate Characters\\", a short novel set over a few days, is literary dissection of the highest order, a tightly written masterpiece that leaves the reader uneasy and disturbed.<br />Things begin to unravel early in the story.  Sophie, feeding a stray cat, is bitten.  Life no longer seems so perfect now, the fear of rabies intruding.  When they leave the security of their brownstone, they find \\"refuse everywhere, a tide that rose but barely ebbed.\\"  There were \\"beer bottles, beer cans, liquor bottles, candy wrappers, crushed cigarette packs, caved-in boxes that held detergents, rags, newspapers, curlers, string, plastic bottles, a shoe here and there, dog feces.\\"  The world outside is disorderly, threatening, rabid.<br />Anomie and uncertainty seem now to press everywhere.  A rock is thrown through a friend's window during a party.  Otto's law firm partnership is breaking up.  Sophie drifts off inexplicably with Otto's law partner to walk the streets in the middle of the night.  The quiet emotional estrangement of Otto and Sophie becomes apparent from a simple thing like Otto's refusal to answer the telephone \\"because I never hear anything I want to hear any more\\".  Thus, they stand facing each other \\"rigidly, each half-consciously amassing evidence against the other, charges that would counterbalance the exasperation that neither could fathom.\\"  <br />Sophie no longer has any interest in her work as a translator and can think, instead, only of the unsatisfying affair she had several years earlier. Sitting in their living room, Otto and Sophie's tense, uneasy conversation is interrupted by the doorbell, a black man asking to come into their house and use their phone.  \\"Robbery and murder appeared before [Sophie] in two short scenes, clicked on and off like pictures projected on a screen.\\"  The outside world can intrude at any moment.  \\"Life is desperate,\\" as Sophie says.  When they seek an escape for a day to their home on Long Island, they find it ransacked and vandalized.  And all the time there looms the fear that the cat was rabid.  As Sophie, alone, says aloud to herself, \\"God, if I am rabid, I am equal to what is outside.\\" <br />\\"Desperate Characters\\" draws its title from Thoreau's oft-quoted line about the quiet desperation of most men's lives.  In a little over 150 pages, Paula Fox has written a near masterpiece of Otto and Sophie Bentwood's fictional lives, of the desperation of their lives, of the desperation of living in a world without certainty and order when certainty and order are all that you live for.	2001-05-18

For this reason, if no other, Peter LaSalle's collection of stories, \\"Hockey Sur Glace\\", is remarkable in itself.  But the seeming anomaly of the book's mere existence only draws the light more brightly on these deeply affectionate, elegantly written, warm and human stories about the way hockey indelibly marks the lives of those who play it, those who watch it, those who live their lives at the rink or on the icy ponds of long northern winters.  \\"Hockey Sur Glace\\" is, to be sure, an uneven collection of stories (with a few short poems interspersed).  The best of the lot are the first two, \\"Hockey Angels\\" and \\"Le Rocket Negre\\".  But while the other stories are somewhat less than remarkable, all of them bear the mark of strong feeling for a sport which, perhaps more than any other, suffuses the lives of those who play it.  If you play hockey, or have children who play hockey, or if you just like the sport, reading this slim collection of stories will be time well spent.	2001-04-27

It is, first and foremost, the epistolary narrative of Anne Winterbourne, an English widow who moves to Egypt, falls in love with, and ultimately marries, the Egyptian lawyer and political activist Sharif Pasha al-Baroudi in 1901.  It is also the story of Isabel Parkman, the great granddaughter of Anne and Sharif, a thirty-five-year old American divorcee who, like her great grandmother before her, falls in love in 1997 with Omar, a brilliant, self-centered and much older Egyptian conductor and political activist for the Palestinian cause.  <br />The stories of these two romances are largely told by Omar's sister, Amal, herself a woman who has had her own failed marriage and two grown children who she no longer sees.  Given a trunk full of Anne Winterbourne's letters by Isabel, who finds them when her dying mother enters the hospital, Amal soon becomes obsessed with writing the story of Anne Winterbourne, in the process also becoming the confidant of the Isabel and her passionate obsession for Omar.  <br />\\"The Map of Love\\" weaves an intricate and powerful narrative, spanning time, geography and culture, providing a remarkable picture of Egyptian history and politics as it confronts the British colonialism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and its legacy nearly a century later.  If the book has a shortcoming, it is in the relative weakness of the story of Isabel and Omar, a romance that never quite grips the reader.  It is a shortcoming which is perhaps more apparent because the epistolary tale, the tale of the life of Anne Winterbourne and Sharif Pasha, is brilliantly wrought, a romantic narrative with true feeling and verisimilitude.  \\"The Map of Love\\" should be read slowly and savored, preferably on a warm beach near the sea on a long summer'svacation.	2001-04-26

I picked up Thomas Disch's \\"The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of\\" primarily because I had read and immensely enjoyed \\"The Castle of Indolence\\", his superb collection of essays on \\"poetry, poets and poetasters\\".  I also was aware of Disch's reputation as a \\"literary\\" writer of science fiction, an author who reputedly stood above the pulpy cauldron of a genre often castigated as \\"low brow\\", and was interested in his opinion of the significance of science fiction-a significance which is strongly suggested by the subtitle of this book: \\"How Science Fiction Conquered the World\\"<br />\\"The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of\\" is a wide ranging, opinionated romp through science fiction, a book which keeps you turning the pages with an avidity more typical of a horror or suspense novel.  Beginning with the claim that science fiction is, at its root, an American genre that originated with Edgar Allen Poe (\\"our embarrassing ancestor\\"), Disch propels the reader through nearly two centuries of writing, showing how science fiction has been able to combine genuine visionary power with the most irrational, \\"lumpen-literature\\" characteristics of the black-print-screaming tabloid headlines about UFO abductees.  In chapter after chapter, Disch renders strong opinions and insightful observations on how science fiction has evolved over the years, how that evolution has affected our view of the world and its possible futures, and how science fiction has been able to appropriate and define political, religious and social perspectives on the world.  Along the way, Disch takes on feminism (\\"Can Girls Play Too? Feminizing Science Fiction\\"), Republicans (\\"Republicans on Mars-Science Fiction as Military Strategy\\"), and, not surprisingly, the unmitigated xenophobic need for an \\"other\\" (\\"The Third World and Other Alien Nations\\").  <br />The most compelling thing about &quot;The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of&quot;, however, is that it makes you want to sit down and read some of these science fiction writers-at least if you're like me, and haven't already.	2001-04-25

It is this position which ultimately defines Pamuk's writing, and &quot;The White Castle&quot;, a novel originally published in Turkey nearly twenty years ago and translated into English in the past decade, represents a kind of &quot;locus classicus&quot; of the Pamukian literary project.<br />&quot;The White Castle&quot; is a story contained in a manuscript found by Faruk Darvinoglu in 1982 in a long forgotten archive of the Turkish governor's office in Gebze. The manuscript, written in the first person, narrates the tale of a young, educated Venetian who is sailing from Venice to Naples in the seventeenth century. His ship is attacked and captured by Turkish ships and the young Italian is carried off to Istanbul, where he becomes the slave of a man named Hoja. Hoja, an advisor to sultans and pashas, is physically identical to the young Italian. Hoja, too, is highly educated-at least by the standards of his time and place-and he seeks to learn from the Italian everything the Italian knows about the literature, science, technology, and art of the West.<br />Over the course of time, the Venetian and Hoja become indistinguishable, not only in their appearance, but in their thoughts and actions. They collaborate on a number of projects together for the Turkish sultan, the last being the development of a war machine for use in an ill-fated war against the Poles and their Western allies. Using the machine to lay siege to the white castle of the book's title, the the two men ultimately recognize, in the shadow of that castle, that all that they had &quot;experienced for years as coincidence had been inevitable.&quot; It is then, in the face of certain failure, that they appear to exchange identities-Hoja fleeing to Italy and assuming the identity of his slave and the slave, in turn, assuming the identity and place of his former master. Or do they? In the enigmatic and occluded narration of &quot;The White Castle&quot;, the reader is left as uncertain of the identities of the two men as the Italian and the Turk are of their own confused identities.<br />&quot;The White Castle&quot; is a powerful, hypnotic, richly imagined book which plays on the notions of identity and cultural difference, on the meeting of East and West, on the sometimes seemingly indeterminate place of Turkey in the geography of the world-and of the mind. It is, in other words, a book worth reading by an author who deservedly merits all the recognition he has gotten in his native Turkey, as well as in the West.	2001-04-09
US	38955473	R2NMCIXMYMP2BF	0375708456	750514487	The Book of Revelation: A Novel	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Sexual Captivity and Revelation	The blurb on the back cover of &quot;The Book of Revelation&quot; suggests that the novel &quot;fearlessly exposes our darkest fears to reveal the sinister connections between sex and power and how we are shaped by our experiences.&quot;  It is a bold claim for Rupert Thomson's work, and one that, ultimately, cannot be sustained.<br />&quot;The Book of Revelation&quot; tells the story of a talented, successful young dancer and choreographer living in Amsterdam with his girlfriend of seven years, Brigitte.  One day he goes out to buy cigarettes for her and is drugged and kidnapped by three black-hooded women.  They keep him chained and captive in a stark white room for eighteen days, where he is emotionally and sexually abused, made to masturbate and perform, and, ultimately, mutilated, before being released.  This occurs in the first half of the book and is narrated in the third-person.  The man is never identified by name and the third-person narrative voice has the desired effect of distancing the reader from the victim's experience, making the reader feel the stark, dehumanizing experience of the dancer.  This first part of the book is psychologically disturbing and erotically charged, in a dark sort of way; it is, in other words, a powerful piece of writing.<br />The second half of &quot;The Book of Revelation&quot; is written in the first person and relates what happens after the dancer is released by his captors.  The victim remains unidentified by name, but the first-person narrative voice now brings the reader intimately into the mind of the dancer.  Unfortunately, this part of the book requires the reader to suspend belief, the dancer's behavior seemingly at odds with what the claims of realism demand.  Thus, upon his release, he makes his way back to his apartment, where he sees his girlfriend Brigitte.  He does not tell her what has happened to him, nor does he tell anyone else.  All he can say, at this point, is &quot;how difficult it is, sometimes, to find the right words, or any words at all.&quot;  In some ways, his inability to communicate with his girlfriend (and others) is adumbrated at the beginning of the story, when he gets into an argument with Brigitte about her smoking, an argument that seems curiously devoid of any real interpersonal relationship.  The effect of all this is to make the reader (or at least this reader) feel that the dancer's problems are as much a result of his own disfunctionality as they are of his bizarre kidnapping and captivity.<br />From this point forward, the story is propelled by the dancer's unmitigated attempt to find the three women who held him captive.  His only touchstones are the identifying marks he had observed on the naked bodies of those women.  He is thus compelled to embark on a misogynistic crusade to sleep with every woman he meets in the hope that he can identify one of them by the revelation of her nakedness.  This is one of the possible meanings of the book's title, a meaning suggested by the book's epigraph: &quot;Will there ever be anything other than the exterior and speculation in store for us?  The skin, the surface--it is man's deepest secret.&quot;  <br />In the end, the dancer becomes a victim of his own obsession and his own inability to communicate, his inability to verbalize his experience and intimately share that experience with others.  His redemption, if it will come at all, can only occur if he can overcome these inabilities, if he can &quot;reveal&quot; his kidnapping, his humiliation, his disturbed motivations; if he can tell his story, a book of revelation.<br />&quot;The Book of Revelation&quot; is an interesting book which keeps you turning the pages, wanting to know what happens in the end, whether the dancer will ever find his captors.  Rupert Thomson is also a writer with great imaginative and writing ability.  It is certainly a book worth spending time with, but not quite deserving of some of the critical acclaim it has received.	2001-03-24

That novel told the simple story of an adolescent French girl living in Vietnam in the 1930s.  She meets an older Chinese man who becomes her lover.  It is a sparely written novel, shifting in time and narrative perspective, often difficult to follow.  It is also a novel charged with memory, yearning and erotic feeling.  <br />\\"The North China Lover\\", written several years later and published in an English edition in 1992, is a kind of extension of the earlier novel, written with much more detail, inhabiting the interstices of \\"The Lover\\". Like its precursor, \\"The North China Lover\\" tells a powerful tale of love between the twenty-seven year old Chinese man and the barely teen-aged girl whom he meets on a ferry crossing the Mekong River.  Once again, neither the Chinese man nor the girl has a name.  However, unlike the earlier novel, many of the other characters are identified and the narrative of \\"The North China Lover\\" is considerably more detailed.  Originally written as notes for a screenplay of \\"The Lover\\", the narrative of \\"The North China Lover\\" is episodic, described by one reviewer as having the \\"grainy, filmic qualities of a documentary.\\"  It is also more linear in its story line, easier to follow than the earlier novel, but still characterized by the nouveau roman influences that permeate Marguerite Duras' writing.<br />\\"The North China Lover\\", like its precursor, is a compelling work of memory, eroticism and yearning that, in true Duras style, conflates literary imagination and biography.  Read it slowly, languorously savor its eroticism, and let it linger in your mind long after you've closed the book.	2001-03-23

He just as easily could have won the award for his first novel, \\"In the Pond\\", an equally stunning tale of life in China during the Cultural Revolution.  Set in Dismount Fort (a locale that Jin has explored in other stories, notably in his fine collection, \\"Under the Red Flag\\", which won the 1997 Flannery O'Connor Award), \\"In the Pond\\" is a sparely written, profoundly witty and insightful tale of Shao Bin and his struggle for just treatment by Secretary Liu and Director Ma, the Party leaders who dominate his work and life.  <br />A worker in the Harvest Fertilizer Plant by day, Shao Bin is a remarkably talented and creative artist by night, a self-educated and self-styled intellectual whose talent goes unrecognized by Liu and Ma.  When Shao Bin and his wife, Meilan, and their young infant daugher are passed over for a decent apartment because Shao Bin refuses to make gifts and payments to his bosses, he begins a campaign of satirical cartoons and attacks on the corruption of Liu and Ma.  Liu and Ma, in turn, mercilessly persecute and humiliate Shao Bin.  The result is a seemingly endless series of attacks and counterattacks, thrusts and parries.  Each time, Shao Bin succeeds in escalating the struggle to another level, his lonely battle against the local Party bosses eventually widening to the highest levels of the Party.  <br />Like the humble lives of his characters, Ha Jin's prose once again sparkles in its simplicty and purity. And like human nature everywhere, Ha Jin's narrative wittily captures the pettiness, the foibles, which often motivate day-to-day behavior.  In Shao Bin, Ha Jin has created an irrepressible and deeply human hero.  Like his other work, \\"In the Pond\\" is another little gem of English prose, another simple tale of what it's like to be human.	2001-03-23

As it turns out, Mitya and Dima are moths (or are they humans?) drawn to the light in one of the many episodes in Pelevin's remarkable and imaginative satire of life in modern Russia.  As Mitya explains, \\"if I wrote a novel about insects, that's how I'd represent their life: a village by the sea, darkness, and a few lamps shining in the darkness above this repulsive dancing.  But to fly to those lamps means . . . [death].\\"<br />\\"The Life of Insects\\" is the novel Mitya would have written.  Set in an old resort hotel by the sea, the story begins with intrigue: Sam, an American, meeting two Russians, Arthur and Arnold, while a loudspeaker blares, first in English (\\"The Voice of God, Bliss, Idaho, U.S.A.\\"), then in dreamy Ukrainian.  The conversation among them immediately puzzles the reader, talk of hemoglobin, glucose, insecticides in the blood.  \\"Sam looked around at his partners.  Arthur and Arnold had turned into small mosquitoes of that miserable hue of gray familiar from prerevolutionary village huts, a color that in its time had reduced many a Russian poet to tears.\\"  Arthur and Arnold, the Russian mosquitoes, in turn looked enviously at Sam, an American, \\"a light chocolate color, with long elegant legs a small tight belly, and wings swept back like a jet plane's.\\"  <br />From this first episode, I realized I was in for a wild imaginative ride, and Pelevin did not disappoint me.  Weaving his story from chapter to chapter with stunning imagination and verve, \\"The Life of Insects\\" is an episodic narrative of many lives, all of them adumbrating ideas (from Ancient Egyptian religion to Buddhism to Marcus Aurelius) and biting satirical commentary on modern life inRussia and America.  Appropriately described as a \\"satirical bestiary\\" by one reviewer, Pelevin's narrative tells not only of Sam, Arthur and Arnold, but also of a father and son, dung beetles, whose life is defined by the sphere of dung that they push along.  \\"I know it's difficult to understand, but there simply isn't anything other than dung . . . and the purpose of life is to push it along in front of you.\\" And there are Mitya and Dima, the moths, whose lives are dominated by the need to fly towards the light.  And there is Marina, the pregnant female ant whose daughter, Natasha, decides to become a fly.  As her mother watches, Natasha leaves her cocoon, \\"and instead of a modest ant's body, Marina saw a typical young fly in a short sexy dress with spangles.\\"<br />\\"The Life of Insects\\" is the work of a remarkable imagination, a biting satire that, at the same time, is laden with insightful reflection and commentary. I highly recommend it!	2001-03-20

The simplest way to express my reaction to this book is to say that, after finishing it, I promptly went out and bought several more of Banville's novels, realizing that he is one of a small handful of truly outstanding contemporary English writers.<br />\\"The Untouchable\\" is the first person narrative of Victor Maskell, Royalist and Marxist, art curator for the English monarchy and spy for the Soviet Union.  Maskell's narrative begins in the 1980s, when he is in his seventies, sick with cancer.  It is then that his past is suddenly and unexpectedly made public, the prominent, seemingly conservative intellectual revealed to be a man leading a double life, a traitor to his country.  The reality, of course, is much more complex, for Maskell's motives, beliefs and actions, like those of all humans, are uncertain, clouded by conflicting memories, versions and perspectives.  Married and the father of two children, Maskell is a homosexual.  Ostensibly a Marxist and supporter of the great Soviet experiment, he is deeply attached to England and, in very personal ways, to the Royal family.  Presumably acting for many years as a spy for the Soviets, the practical value of his activities is largely confined to being a symbolic trophy for his spymasters in the Kremlin, someone who rubs elbows with the highest levels of the British government while providing little in the way of truly useful information.<br />Drawing on the historical facts surrounding the Cambridge spies, \\"The Untouchable\\" is a brilliantly imagined, vividly realistic fictional memoir of the complex and often perplexing life of such a spy. Banville's prose is flawless, his narrative voice is always at perfect pitch, and his characters and story are a masterpiece of verisimilitude.	2001-03-09

It is appropriate and commendable, then, that Grove Press has undertaken the publication of the King James Version in a series of small (4&quot;x5 ¾&quot;) , inexpensive, book-by-book paperback editions, known as the &quot;Pocket Canon&quot;. The initial publication includes twelve volumes, representing a sampling of the range of writings in the Old and New Testament, each introduced by a contemporary writer.<br />&quot;The First Book of Moses, Called Genesis&quot; is the first of the books in the Bible and, appropriately, the first of the books in the Pocket Canon series. And while the text itself, being the Authorized King James Version, needs no further commentary, the introduction to this little volume by E.L. Doctorow bears mentioning. In six short pages, Doctorow manages to draw the reader quickly to the literary merit and fascination of Genesis, a book whose stories and narrative strategies have endured for more than twenty-five centuries and continue to illumine and perplex the thoughtful reader. Apart from an early lapse by Doctorow, who claims the King James Version &quot;is the version preachers quote from who believe in the divinity of the text&quot; (thereby ignoring the fact that his claim, when stated this way, applies only to preachers who are both Christian and English speakers), Doctorow thoughtfully and succinctly draws the reader into the Genesis narrative, successfully writing a sort of &quot;pocket&quot; introduction to a little book with unbounded literary and religious value.<br />If you've never sat down and read the Authorized King James Version, and if you have an interest in the English language and the Bible as literature, the Pocket Canon edition of Genesis is an easy place to begin. If you have, it's still a usefullittle book because it's so small that you can conveniently carry it anywhere.	2001-03-07

Sebald's &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; is categorized as a work of fiction, although it is often difficult to discern what is, in fact, imagined and what is real.  Dreamlike, mysterious, sublime, enigmatic, strange--all these adjectives appropriately have been used to describe Sebald's remarkable work of literary, philosophical and historical imagination.  <br />&quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; is a first person narrative of the author's year-long ramble through East Anglia beginning in August, 1992.  It is a &quot;ramble&quot; not only in the physical sense--a walker's tour and observation of the natural surroundings and history of the land--but also in the mental sense, being a series of historical, philosophical and psychological digressions triggered by everything Sebald sees and experiences on his journey. The landscapes are, thus, both interior and exterior.  They are also landscapes that exist not only in the present, but extend back into the past and forward into the future; both natural and mental history become trans-temporal, the ground for a dreamlike ponderousness that, at times, takes the reader's breath away.<br />&quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; is, in many ways, a dark relation of the author's experience, for he &quot;became preoccupied not only with the unaccustomed sense of freedom but also with the paralysing horror that had come over [him] at various times when confronted with the traces of destruction, reaching far back into the past, that were evident even in that remote place.&quot;  He ends up, at the end of his journey--&quot;a year to the day after [he] began his tour&quot;--in a total state of immobility in a Norwich hospital.  It is here that the book begins, that Sebald &quot;began in [his] thoughts to write these pages.&quot;<br />Filled with grainy and sometimes mysterious, disturbing and imaginatively illustrative black and white photographs of the narrator's thoughts and experiences, &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; is equallyfertile in flights of imaginative and historical reflection.  Thus, the author's stay in the Norwich hospital leads to a digressive exploration of the obscure writings of the seventeenth century writer Thomas Browne, whose skull was at one time kept in the hospital's museum, an old-time cabinet of wonders.  This, in turn, runs into a discursis on Rembrandt's painting, &quot;The Anatomy Lesson&quot;.  Reaching the seaside leads to an exploration of the history of herring fishing.  The dim recollection of a PBS documentary on the life of Roger Casement, a recollection floating in the narrator's mind as he drifts off to sleep, leads to a detailed exploration of Joseph Conrad's experiences in the Belgian Congo, where Conrad had briefly encountered Casement.  <br />The digressions go on and on.  &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; is, in a sense, like being in the mind of Sebald during the course of time, a mind experiencing reality, dreaming illusion, and speculating on nature, man, literature, and time.  The imaginary becomes real; the real, imaginary.  Thus, tracts of Borges are cited as authority, treated as valid scientific works, when Sebald discusses time.  &quot;The denial of time, so the tract on Orbius Tertius tells us, is one of the key tenets of the philosophical schools of Tlon.  According to this principle, the future exists only in the shape of our present apprehensions and hopes, and the past merely as memory.&quot;  <br />Conflating the real and imaginary, the historical and the fictional, &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; represents an obsessive and powerful work of literature, a narrative that shows the uncanny ways in which imagination can be used to connect our lives with the world and with the past, even though &quot;we know that we shall never be able to fathom the imponderables that govern our course through life.&quot;	2001-02-04

The moment lives starkly in Lol's memory, even after she's been married for ten years, after she's had three children, after she should have moved on with her life.  The memory endures until it can be revised, until Lol can make a new memory to replace it.<br />Tatiana Karl, Lol's best friend in childhood, was with Lol the night her fiance left her.  He did it publicly, at a prominent dance in the Town Beach casino, while Lol and Tatiana watched.  Lol collapses in a state of depression, becomes uncommunicative, changes.  She is brought back to South Tahla, the place of her birth, to recover.  It is here that she meets John Bedford, marries him and seemingly moves on with her life, literally leaving South Tahla, as well, for ten years and breaking off all contact with old friends, including Tatiana.  But the memory lingers, darkly, and can only be erased when Lol and her husband return to South Tahla, return to the place where the memory was made.<br />Lol works at erasing the mental trauma of her past with a new memory, a memory wrought from obsession, voyeurism, and calculated seduction.  She resumes her relationship with Tatiana, now married, and makes a new relationship with Tatiana's lover.  Haunting and erotically charged, marked by a disturbing psychological aridity, and written in a complex, non-linear style marked by the shifting viewpoint of its narrator, \\"The Ravishing of Lol Stein\\" is another example of why Marguerite Duras deserves to be ranked as one of the finest writers of Twentieth century literature.	2001-01-30
US	38955473	R3BB2A5ZPODAGT	0879517867	599410857	Pope Joan	Books	5	61	67	N	N	A Comic Masterpiece Brilliantly Translated and Adapted	\\"Pope Joan\\" or \\"Papissa Joanna\\" was originally written and published in 1886 by the Greek author Emmanuel Royidis.  The book tells the story of Pope John VIII, the purported female Pope who ruled Christendom for a period of two years, five months and four days in the middle of the ninth century.  \\"Pope Joan\\" is a comic masterpiece of irreverence towards the medieval Church and the accepted pieties of its revisionist historians. Indeed, insofar as Royidis continued to propagate the legend of Pope Joan, to claim that the work contained only \\"facts and events proved beyond discussion\\", the text itself ingeniously combines history and legend, as well as brilliant wit, to subvert claims of authority.  As Lawrence Durrell notes in his Preface to his brilliant English translation and adaptation, \\"the authorities of the Orthodox Church were horrified by what seemed to them to be the impious irony of its author-and no less by the gallery of maggot-ridden church fathers which he described so lovingly.\\"  Not suprisingly, Royidis was excommunicated from the Orthodox Church and his book was banned in Greece.<br />The first three parts of \\"Pope Joan\\" tell the story of Joanna prior to her arrival in Rome, before she became an historical personage.  Set in the ninth century, the narrative captures the European world in disarray after the death of Charlemagne, captures a time when civilization was tenuous and the Church provided one of the few viable social structures.  It is this part of the narrative that is unambiguously fictional, the imagined story of Joanna's life in Germany and then in Greece.  After her parents die, Joanna clandestinely enters a monastery where she meets the monk Frumentius and develops a romantic relationship with him.  When her true sexual identity is surmised, Joanna and Frumentius flee one monastery and then another, eventually ending up in Greece.  Joanna soon becomes tired of her romance and her intellectual brilliance attracts the attention of Churchleaders throughout Greece.  She leaves Frumentius and departs alone for Rome, where the legend, some say the history, of Pope Joan begins.  She becomes a papal secretary renowned for her intellect and, when Pope Leo IV dies, she ascends to the papacy.  Pope Joan becomes pregnant and dies after giving birth during a procession through the streets of Rome.  <br />While the general outline of the narrative may seem only mildly interesting, the brilliant translation and prose of Lawrence Durrell, together with the biting, irreverent wit of Royidis, make \\"Pope Joan\\" an unsurpassed work of comic genius.  A flavor for this wit and style can be found in a short passage describing what ensued after Pope Joan gave birth:  \\"Great was the consternation when a premature infant was produced from among the voluminous folds of the papal vestments . . . Some hierarchs who were profoundly devoted to the Holy See sought to save the situation and change horror and disgust to amazement by crying out `A miracle! A miracle!'  They bellowed loudly calling the faithful to kneel and worship.  But in vain.  Such a miracle was unheard of; and indeed would have been a singular contribution to the annals of Christian thaumaturgy which, while it borrowed many a prodigy from the pagans, had not yet reached the point where it could represent any male saint as pregnant and bringing forth a child.\\"<br />While the apologist position has consistently denied the historicity of Pope Joan, there is at least some suggestion that the legend is indeed a fact.  As Durrell suggests in his Preface, one telling point is that Platina includes a biography of Pope John VIII in his \\"Lives of the Popes\\".  And no less an authority than The Catholic Encyclopedia states that Platina's \\"Lives of the Popes\\" is \\"a work of no small merit, for it is the first systematic handbook of papal history.\\"  Historical disputation aside, however, \\"Pope Joan\\" stands as a brilliant work of comic writing and masterful translation, a masterpiece of Royidis and Durrell.	2001-01-26

If  \\"Mistero Buffo\\" has a shortcoming, it lies in the fact that it is merely a text and does not embody the vitality of Fo's imaginative work, which relies as much on performance as it does on literary content. <br />\\"Mistero Buffo\\" draws on the popular and comic tradition of the medieval mystery plays, as well as the tradition of the so-called \\"jongleur\\", or traveling comic and mime, whose performances provided a subversive counterpoint to the authority of Church, Monarchy and Lord.  As the jongleur in Fo's piece, \\"The Birth of the Jongleur\\", reminds his audience:  \\"I leap and pirouette, and make you laugh.  I make fun of those in power, and I show you how puffed up and conceited are the bigshots who go around making wars in which we are the ones who get slaughtered.  I reveal them for what they are.  I pull out the plug, and . . . pssss . . .they deflate.\\"<br />Written and originally performed by Fo himself, \\"Mistero Buffo\\" consists of a series of pieces involving mime, improvisation and performance art.  The texts are fiercely anti-Church, anti-materialist and anti-authority, but they are written with a comic verve and playful sensibility that mark Dario Fo as a remarkably unique writer, director, and performer.  Drawing on religious traditions, the pieces include Fo's modern take on Biblical stories entitled \\"Slaughter of the Innocents\\", \\"Marriage at Cana\\" and \\"Resurrection of Lazarus\\", as well as a series of short dialogues (entitled \\"Passion Plays\\") where Fo adumbrates the death of Christ as experienced by Mary.  All of these pieces border on the blasphemous, subverting conventional pieties and unthinking reverence for established religion and replacing them with a kind of popular re-writing of Christianity, a revision which glorifies the common man at the expense of those in power.  Not surprisingly, \\"Mistero Buffo\\", like most of Fo's texts and performances, is controversial and provocative.  It is also, however, a short text worth reading for an insightful sampling of one of Italy's most remarkable literary and theatrical geniuses.	2001-01-25

Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to human existence.\\" And while I have not read the entirety of Stead's fictional work, the appropriateness of Carter's characterization rings true with every word, every narrative turn and stylistic nuance, of Stead's regrettably little-read classic, \\"The Man Who Loved Children\\", even though it is a book which veers sharply toward one side of the Blakeian contraries-those of \\"Repulsion\\" and \\"Energy\\" and \\"Hate\\"-in its dialectic.<br />\\"The Man Who Loved Children\\" tells the story of a family, the Pollitts, who live in the Washington-Baltimore area in the 1930s, in the Age of Roosevelt and the Depression.  But to say simply that it tells the story of a family is misleading.  For \\"The Man Who Loved Children\\" does not merely tell a story, it makes the reader's skin crawl in the discomfiting darkness of a family dominated by discord, disfunction, and abuse.  It is is book which deftly, yet idiosyncratically, thrusts the reader into the emotional and psychic turbulence of the family's day-to-day existence, telling its story with a richness and texture of dialogue that is nearly suffocating in its intensity.  It is a book whose main character, Sam Pollitt, is so repulsive in the degradation of his hapless wife and the pathological manipulation and abuse of his children, that no less a critic than Randall Jarrell has suggested that it makes the male reader worry, \\"Ought I to be a man?\\"  And it is, finally, a book which-perhaps more than any other work of fiction-makes the reader wrenchingly experience the saturating discomfort of a familial hell on earth, where the father and mother do not speak to each other (except in argument, abuse or threat) and where each child becomes the emotional victim of this horrible relationship and of their overbearing and manipulative father, Sam, the man who loved children.<br />Christina Stead's vision and writing in \\"The Man Who Loved Children\\" is excessive and troubling. It is also profound and memorable, a sharply etched portrait of the dark side of the family.	2001-01-03

Written by a young, white American male in the late Twentieth century, it brilliantly depicts the life of a geisha in Japan during the 1930s and 1940s.   The novel has been appropriately described by one reviewer as an act of ventriloquism because of the author's ability to get inside the mind of the book's female protagonist and write a novel of sustained versimilitude and historical and cultural accuracy.  The achievement is even more notable when you realize that &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is Golden's first published novel.<br />&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; tells the story of Chiyo, the poor daughter of an elderly fisherman and his dying wife.  When Chiyo is eight years old, she and her older sister, Satsu, are sold by their father, both designated to become geisha in Kyoto.  While Satsu is unremarkable and she ends up as a common prostitute, Chiyo's striking eyes, diminutive beauty and resilient intelligence make her a suitable geisha in training.  She soon finds herself in conflict, however, with the resident geisha in her house, Hatsumomo, a beautiful and mean-spirited woman whose antagonism runs through the novel like a thread.  <br />Hatsumomo makes life unbearable for Chiyo and seemingly destroys her future until she is taken under the wing of Mameha, a beautiful and accomplished geisha whose motives are uncertain.  Through the efforts of Mameha, Chiyo becomes a succesful and avidly sought geisha, taking the name Suriya and becoming the favorite of a war-maimed, wealthy patron named Noru.  All this time, however, Suriya's romantic obsession is a business partner and deeply-indebted friend of Noru, a man simply known as the &quot;Chairman&quot;, a man who had once been kind to the young Chiyo when he found her crying by a stream.  <br />&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is, thus, an historical romance set in Japan during the Depression and the years during and following World War II.  As a romance, it is a somewhat lacking because of its fairy tale quality, its unbelievability, its departure from realism.  However, while its romantic aspects fall short, it is remarkably successful in depicting the geisha culture of the period--the extensive training of the geisha, the incredible physical and mental demands of the geisha profession, the cultural milieu, trappings, beliefs, and superstitions of the geisha in day-to-day life, and the place of the geisha in Japanese society.  &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is also remarkable for the way its author succeeds in imagining, and expressing, the intimate life and thoughts of the young Chiyo and the mature geisha Suriya.<br />While &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; does not rise to the level of classic status and can, at times, be somewhat tedious, it is a remarkably well written and imagined first novel, a stunning and sympathetic fictional portrayal of an aspect of Japanese culture that is often misunderstood in the West.	2000-12-18

Connell's \\"Mr. Bridge\\" stands, together with its companion novel, \\"Mrs. Bridge\\", as one of the outstanding works of Twentieth century American fiction.  The two works, taken together, form the brilliantly wrought portrait of an upper middle class marriage in the years preceding and encompassing World War II.  Linear in its narrative and meticulously realistic in its style, \\"Mr. Bridge\\" tells the story of Walter Bridge, a financially successful, but emotionally stunted, lawyer who lives out his proper married life in the wealthy Mission Hills suburb of Kansas City.  <br />Mr. Bridge recognizes that his life did not begin until he knew his wife, India Bridge.  His marriage is, in this sense, important to him.  But he cannot articulate his deep feelings for his wife and, ultimately, gives up trying to express any emotion at all.  \\"So the years passed, they had three children and accustomed themselves to a life together, and eventually Mr. Bridge decided that his wife should expect nothing more of him.  After all, he was an attorney rather than a poet; he could never pretend to be what he was not.\\"<br />Cold and emotionally repressed, Mr. Bridge spends all of his time at the office, becoming involved with his family only when necessary to ensure that proper middle class respectability is maintained.  He spends his time visiting the bank, scrutinizing his stock certificates and counting his profits.  Indeed, he is so focussed on wealth that he surprises his wife and children with stock certificates of Kansas City Power &amp; Light on Christmas morning, only to take the gifts back into his possession so that he can properly manage them.  <br />Manipulative and controlling, Mr. Bridge persuades his reluctant daughter, after she has won a contest, to accept a pony as a prize, even though she would much rather have a bicycle.  When the day comes to accept the prize, \\"Mr. Bridge could not attend the presentation ceremony because he was again spending Saturday at the office.\\"  Like his self-centered Christmas present of utility company stock, this prize, too, becomes cheerless for his daughter because of his need to impose his will.<br />Deeply bigoted, Mr. Bridge cannot tolerate Jews or Blacks very well.  When he has an opportunity to take investment advice from an obviously successful Jewish stockbroker, Mr. Bridge, instead, becomes offended by the man's ethnicity and ostensible pretension to be a successful upper middle class man like himself.  Reluctantly shaking the man's hand, Mr. Bridge \\"could hardly restrain a shudder.\\"  Resonating with antisemitic feeling,  \\"he withdrew his hand, which came away stickily.  He wanted to wash it.  His hand felt moist and unhealthy, as if during those few seconds it had become infected.\\"  Similarly, when his wife shows him horrifying pictures of a brutal lynching in the South, his only reaction is to ask, \\"what was this fellow doing that he shouldn't have been doing?\\"<br />A fiercely conservative man, with political views as deeply repressive as his stunted emotions, he cannot tolerate President Roosevelt.  He even suggests that while Hitler was insane, \\"some of his ideas were sensible.\\"  <br />Indeed, the repressed feelings of Mr. Bridge find their darkest allusions in his feelings about his daughters, feelings that suggest powerful undercurrents of the sexuality that is absent from his marriage.  Seeing his grown daughter, Carolyn, one night posing naked in front of a mirror, he cannot get her out of his mind.  \\"He reminded himself that she was his daughter, but the luminous image returned like the memory of a dream.\\"<br />\\"Mr. Bridge\\", like its companion novel, \\"Mrs. Bridge\\", is a stunning work of realism, a crystalline pure narrative of a marriage without feeling, a life without love, a man without the ability to move outside the bounds of middle class probity and respectability.	2000-12-15

However, use of the word in Roman times is unattested, the first documentary evidence of its Latinate origins appearing in the Medieval Latin of the second millenium of the Christian era.  <br />Notwithstanding that fact, the word has often been associated with ancient Rome, particularly the historical and political, as well as the artistic, decline of that once great civilization.  As Richard Gilman points out, in his compelling tour-de-force, \\"Decadence: The Strange Life of an Epithet\\", \\"though the word was not used by the Romans, so strongly has modern consciousness been impressed by its evocative and categorical power that it has been widely and anachronistically employed in regard to Rome.\\"  <br />More significantly, the word has been used in regard to Ancient Rome in a misleading way, replacing generally descriptive words used by contemporary Roman historians and  chroniclers with the more value-laden, modern term.  For, as Gilman also convincingly demonstrates, \\"decadence\\" has become, in the course of time, an evaluative and judgmental word, a word which no longer describes reality, a word which is merely an epithet.<br />\\"Decadence: The Strange Life of an Epithet\\" is a fascinating and erudite discursive essay on the way in which the meaning and use of the word has been vulgarized over the course of time, a singular demonstration of the way \\"we cheat ourselves of truth through language.\\"  Tracing the use of the term from its Latin origins, Gilman shows how the word has been used facilely, with little thought or consideration for its true meaning, to denote anything which contravenes moral or literary or artistic convention.  <br />Thus, the word attached itself to the writings of Baudelaire, Gautier, Huysmans, and others, the so-called \\"poetes maudits\\", who became the \\"French Decadents\\".  Indeed, the label carried over to England, where Oscar Wilde represented the ultimate example of \\"decadence\\" in English literature and society, the homosexual aesthete.  However, ascription of the term to these writers was nothing more than a kind of intellectual laziness, for while the innuendo of the word was that of decline, the reality of their writing was not.  As Gilman quite astutely notes, \\"the existence of a word does not guarantee a reality, palpable or abstract, to which it refers.\\"  <br />From its belated ubiquity in the nineteenth century, Gilman moves on to a critical discussion of twentieth century analytical attempts to attach certain meaning to the word, examining the 1948 work of British philosopher C.E.M. Joad, \\"Decadence\\", which Gilman describes as \\"extremely useful, since in its pursuit of the subject it goes down nearly every blind alley into which the word has enticed so many minds.\\"  Gilman then moves into the more recent proliferation of the word, where its meaning has become particularly haphazard and devoid of content.<br />Sadly out of print, \\"Decadence: The Strange Life of an Epithet\\" is a significant study of a word that is often used, but little understood, \\"a portmanteau stuffed with emptiness.\\"	2000-12-07

Connell's \\"Mrs. Bridge\\" is one of the truly outstanding works of Twentieth century American literature, a restrained, yet brilliantly wrought fictional portrait of upper middle class married life in the decades surrounding World War II.  Connell tells the story of India Bridge in 117 short chapters, each a spare vignette of her enervated life in the perfectly manicured \\"country-club district\\" of an affluent Kansas City suburb.  Linear in its narrative and meticulously realistic in its style, \\"Mrs. Bridge\\" follows India's life from marriage, to the birth of three children, to the rejection by those children of the repressed life of their parents as they grow into adults, to lonely suburban widowhood.  While it is, at its heart, a grim tale of one woman's life of repression and, ultimately, loneliness and resignation, Connell's flawless and restrained narrative ultimately leaves the reader feeling exhilarated at the sheer literary achievement of \\"Mrs. Bridge\\".<br />Ostensibly the story of a marriage, Mr. Bridge is noticeably absent from much of the narrative.  A successful lawyer, he is a man who is unable to express love or affection for his wife or his children, a man who is focussed on becoming \\"rich and successful,\\" the epitome of the status-conscious husband and father whose identity lies in material possessions.  \\"The family saw very little of him.  It was not unusual for an entire week to pass without any of the children seeing him.  On Sunday morning they would come downstairs and he . . . greeted them pleasantly and they responded deferentially, and a little wistfully because they missed him.  Sensing this, he would redouble his efforts at the office in order to give them everything they wanted.\\"<br />Mrs. Bridge, too, is powerfully repressed, unable to articulate her feelings of dissatisfaction, a woman who is beholden to the expectations of respectability and obsessed with appearances.  \\"She brought up her children very much as she herself had beenbrought up, and she hoped that when they were spoken of it would be in connection with their nice manners, their pleasant dispositions, and their cleanliness, for these were qualities she valued above all others.\\"  Thus, she ultimately drives all three of her children from her life, her unthinking obeisance to social convention destroying any thread of relationship that she might have had with them.  Her oldest daughter, \\"curiously dark\\", flees to New York City, where she pursues her more unconventional dreams.  Her second daughter, an accomplished golfer, enters an ill-fated marriage with a college dropout who cannot provide the country club life that she has been weaned to expect.  Her son joins the army, asserting an act of individuality that Mrs. Bridge never seems able to accept or reconcile.<br />It is, most notably, however, in her relationships with her peers-with the other affluent housewives of the \\"country-club district\\"-that the grim and vapid nature of Mrs. Bridge's life becomes most apparent.  In particular, her friend Grace Barron becomes a kind of outward manifestation of India Bridge's discontent, someone who lives a life of equal desperation, but not so quietly as Mrs. Bridge.  Grace Barron \\"was a puzzle and was disturbing\\" to Mrs. Bridge.  Why?  Because she actually questioned the life she led, moving outside the banal, the conventional, if only in her discourse.  As Grace once said to Mrs. Bridge:  \\"India, I've never been anywhere or done anything or seen anything.  I don't know how other people live, or think, even how they believe.  Are we right?  Do we believe the right things?\\"<br />Unlike Mrs. Bridge, who talked of \\"antique silver, Royal Doulton, Wedgwood, the price of margarine as compared to butter, or what the hemline was expected to do,\\" Grace Barron talked of \\"art, politics, astronomy, literature.\\"  Ultimately, Grace cannot cope with the ennui, the claustrophobia of her life, and she does what Mrs. Bridge ultimately lacks the fortitudeto do; in a sense, Grace is a sort of \\"double\\" who acts out the dark alternative to Mrs. Bridge's repression.  And when Grace does act, all that comes to Mrs. Bridge's mind is something Grace once said to her:  \\"Have you ever felt like those people in the Grimm fairy tale-the ones who were all hollowed out in the back?\\"	2000-12-05

Jean-Baptiste Clamence, a once-respected and successful Paris barrister, sits alone in an Amsterdam bar delivering his stark monologue to an unknown listener.  It is a confessional narrative, a tale in which Clamence slowly unravels the spare facts of his life, his deceptions, his inauthenticity, his bad faith.  <br />As he sits in the dimly lit bar, Clamence makes the locus of his telling a metaphor for the narrative to follow:  \\"We are at the heart of things here.  Have you noticed that Amsterdam's concentric canals resemble the circles of hell?  The middle-class hell, of course, peopled with bad dreams.  When one comes from the outside, as one gradually goes throught those circles, life-and hence its crimes-becomes denser, darker.  Here we are in the last circle.\\"  It is a metaphor that resonates with existential imagery, reminiscent of Sartre's claim, in \\"No Exit\\", that \\"hell is other people.\\"  From this grim place, Camus writes a classic of Existentialist literature, building on this metaphor, writing an extended trope of unremitting self-examination, self-doubt and anguish.<br />Clamence was, by all outward appearances, both a virtuous and a modest man.  His courtesy was famous and beyond question.  He was generous in public and private, literally exulting at the approach of a beggar.  He helped the blind man cross the street and the indigent defendant secure a reduced sentence.  He ended his afternoons at the café with \\"a brilliant improvisation in the company of several friends on the hard-heartedness of our governing class and the hypocrisy of our leaders.\\"  <br />But appearances give lie to the truth, for the truth in \\"The Fall\\" is that life has no meaning, that it is full of ennui, and that people act unthinkingly, inauthentically, habitually.  Thus, Clamence reflects on a man he knew, a man \\"who gave twenty years of his life to a scatter-brained woman, sacrificing everything to her,\\" only to realize in the end that he never loved her.  How does Clamence explain this?  \\"He had been bored, that's all, bored like most people.\\"  And from this boredom, the man married and created \\"a life full of complications and drama.\\"  For, as Clamence suggests, \\"something must happen-and that explains most human commitments.\\"<br />Clamence describes himself, too, as \\"a double face, a charming Janus,\\" for his motives and feelings, his very psyche, belie his outward virtue.  While outwardly supporting the poor and downtrodden, he is \\"well aware that one can't get along without dominating or being served, [for] every man needs slaves as he needs fresh air.\\"  While known as a defender of justice, a great Parisian lawyer, his \\"true desire\\" is not \\"to be the most intelligent or the most generous creature on earth, but only to beat anyone [he] wanted to, to be the stronger.\\"  While professing deep love and affection for the many women in his life, he is a misogynist who \\"never loved any of them.\\"  As Clamence cynically suggests, \\"true love is exceptional, [occurring] two or three times a century more or less.  The rest of the time there is vanity or boredom.\\" <br />\\"The Fall\\" is a little novel that makes the reader ponder big questions, questions of meaning and existence and death, of how we live our lives and of what motivates our actions.  It is, in other words, a novel that articulates the open-ended questioning characteristic of the French Existentialism of the 1940s and 1950s.  But it is more than that, for it is also perhaps the finest work of one of France's greatest Twentieth Century authors, a work that deserves to be read, re-read and pondered.	2000-11-30

There was little in the way of material comfort, most people struggling merely to subsist.  Liberty, too, was scarce in a feudal system dominated by the often capricious and competing forces of King, Lord and Church.  And there were intermingled the ubiquitous spectres of magic, superstition, banditry, and disease.  With the ravages of the Black Death, life in the late Middle Ages was truly nasty, brutish and short.  <br />Against this background, Barry Unsworth's \\"Morality Play\\" weaves a masterful and compelling tale of Nicholas Barber, a twenty-three year old priest, \\"a poor scholar, open-breeched to the winds of heaven as people say, with nothing but Latin to recommend [him].\\"  Nicholas, after commiting adultery and losing his cloak while fleeing the wrathful husband, takes up with an itinerant band of players.  He thus becomes both a fugitive, by leaving his diocese without permission of his Bishop, and a sinner by entering upon an occupation forbidden by the Church.<br />The players soon find themselves in a town where Thomas Wells, a twelve year old boy, has been murdered and a young woman has been hastily tried, convicted and sentenced to hang for the crime.  It is then that their leader, Martin, suggests that the troupe depart from the accepted practice of the day, the enactment of plays based upon Biblical stories with well-known themes.  Martin proposes, instead, that they perform a \\"Morality Play\\" based upon the murder of Thomas Wells.  It is a proposal fraught with peril, not only to their physical safety, but also to their moral well-being, for as Nicholas suggests, \\"if we make our own meanings, God will oblige us to answer our own questions, He will leave us in the void without the comfort of his Word.\\"<br />The players accept Martin's suggestion, and soon the facts surrounding the murder of Thomas Wells, as well as the motives and behavior of the players, become troubling and enigmatic.  The result is an absorbing narrative that unravels as part murder mystery, part suspense story and part historical fiction, the telling all the time enriched by Nicholas Barber's first person voice and diction. <br /> \\"Morality Play\\" leaves the reader with a profoundly satisfying feeling for the historical period and the characters.  But the book also operates on a deeper level, the text providing an often thought-provoking gloss on the relationship between theatre and reality, between life on the stage and real life. \\"Morality Play\\" is, thus, like all great fiction, not only an entertainment, but an intellectually stimulating short novel that educates even as it delights.	2000-11-28

In accordance with this model, there also has been a tendency to identify such canonical works as the \\"cause\\" of historical events.  Eighteenth century French history has not been an exception, many historians arguing, rightly or wrongly, that the Enlightenment writings of Voltaire, Montesquieu, Diderot, and Rousseau provided the ideological basis for the French Revolution.<br />There are, of course, many problems with this approach.  Among those problems, Robert Darnton suggests in his fascinating and carefully researched \\"The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France\\", is that, \\"if we put the issue that way, we are likely to distort it, first by reifying the Enlightenment as if it could be separated from everything else in eighteenth-century culture; then by injecting into it an analysis of the Revolution, as if it could be traced through the events of 1789-1800 like a substance being monitored in the bloodstream.\\"<br />Moreover, as Darnton's book argues, any approach which focusses exclusively on the canonical literature of the Enlightenment necessarily misses the mark since there was a flourishing popular and illegal underground literature, the so-called \\"livres philosophiques\\" or \\"philosophical books\\", which exerted a powerful impact on eighteenth century French culture and politics.  These were the books sold \\"under the cloak\\", illegal books forbidden by the French Monarchy because they undermined the authority of the king, the Church, or conventional morality.  \\"By sampling them, the reader will be able to form his or her own impressions of the world of illegal literature.  It may seem surprising, shocking, naughty, or comic; but it certainly will look different from the world made familiar by the great-man, great-book variety of literary history.\\"<br />From these premises, Darnton carefully explores the trade in forbidden books in seventeenth and eighteenth century France and the potential impact of that trade on popular consciousness and the ever-changing way in which the French Monarchy was perceived from the reign of Louis XIV until the Revolution.  Darnton elucidates the mechanics of the book trade of the time, how it worked to disseminate forbidden literature, and which forbidden books attained \\"best seller\\" status.  Darnton also elaborates on the various categories of forbidden literature, including the works of philosophical pornography, utopian fantasy and political slander which fed the public's desire for transgressive works and, ultimately, undermined the foundations of monarchical legitimacy.  Finally, in painting this brilliant history of the forbidden book in pre-Revolutionary France, Darnton carefully and persuasively outlines the details of the vast communcations network which existed in French society in the seventeenth and eighteenth century,  a network which ran from Court to caf&eacute; to popular pamphlet to book and back, each element operating in a way which served to reinforce popular (and usually unfavorable) notions of the Court and Church and create a fertile breeding ground for social unrest.<br />In all of this, Darnton displays great care in sifting the historical evidence and avoiding hasty conclusions.  If anything, his research asks as many questions as it answers, leaving the reader with a much deeper understanding of the complexity of the historian's task in reaching any firm conclusions about the interplay between popular literature, Enlightenment ideas and the Revolution in France.  \\"The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France\\" is a carefully researched and fascinating piece of historical writing, a book which I highly recommend to anyone interested in the history of the book.story.\\"<br />From these premises, Darnton carefully explores the trade in forbidden books in seventeenth and eighteenth century France and the potential impact of that trade on popular consciousness and the ever-changing way in which the French Monarchy was perceived from the reign of Louis XIV until the Revolution.

Like other works of Marguerite Duras, \\"The Lover\\" conflates a vivid and deeply sensuous literary imagination with thinly-veiled autobiographical elements and a non-linear, ever shifting perspective.  The result is a short, powerful novel of memory and erotic yearning. a novel which lingers in the reader's mind long after the last page.<br />Neither the girl nor her Chinese lover has a name. The girl meets the Chinese lover on a ferry, seeing him in a limousine while she is returning to boarding school in Saigon.  She is wearing a flat brimmed fedora hat, a silk dress turned sepia-toned with age, and gold lame high heels.  She is a girl who is accustomed to people looking at her.  \\"People do look at white women in the colonies; at twelve-year-old white girls too.  For the past three years white men, too, have been looking at me in the streets, and my mother's men friends have been kindly asking me to have tea with them while their wives are out playing tennis.\\"<br />Each is a starkly drawn character acting in ways that seem predestined.  The Chinese lover does not intend to marry her, only to be her lover.  The girl surrenders to what seems her fate.  \\"She agreed to come as soon as he asked her the previous evening.  She's where she has to be, placed here.  She feels a tinge of fear.  It's as if this must be not only what she expects, but also what had to happen especially to her.  She says, I'd rather you didn't love me.  But if you do, I'd like you to do as you usually do with women.\\"  <br />It is a deeply moving erotic tale.  It is also a tale of the girl's troubled life, of her strained relationships with her mother and her two brothers, and the way those relationships color her affair.  Her mother speaks of \\"blatant prostitution and laughs at the scandal.\\"  And in her elder brother's presence, the Chinese man \\"ceases to be [her] lover.\\"  \\"He doesn't cease to exist, but he's no longer anything to me.  He becomes a burnt-out shell.\\"  <br />Written in one short paragraph after another, moving back and forth in time, ever changing its narrative locus, \\"The Lover\\" paints a fictional world of eroticism, longing and memory.  The result is a compelling work of fiction, nothing less than a minor masterpiece of Twentieth century French literature.	2000-11-15

The stories, set in China at various times during the Cultural Revolution, were remarkable for their crystalline pure prose, realistic attention to detail and depiction of the intersection of the personal and the political in the quotidian lives of their characters.  From that first reading, Ha Jin struck me as perhaps the finest prose stylist writing in English  today.  <br />Ironically, Ha Jin was illiterate in his own Chinese language until his mid-teens, when he began reading voraciously while serving in the Chinese army on the Russian border.  It was not until the age of twenty that Jin began studying English and, twelve years later, in 1988, began writing in English.  By that time, Jin had completed graduate study at Brandeis University and, in the wake of the events at Tiananmen Square, emigrated to the United States.  While Ha Jin's prose is remarkable for its austere beauty, and his themes are universal and set in the ordinary, everyday lives of his characters, the setting of his fictions remains exclusively and particularly Chinese.  <br />\\"Waiting\\", Ha Jin's second novel, tells the story of an eighteen year love triangle among Lin Kong, a doctor in Muji City, his loyal, but illiterate wife, Shuyu, and his educated and urbane mistress, the nurse Manna Wu.  Kong lives and works apart from his wife, in a hospital in Muji City, where he meets Manna Wu.  Each year, for eighteen years, Kong returns to the country to visit his wife and to request a divorce so he can marry Manna Wu.  Each year Kong's wife, whose bound feet are a sign of her rural backwardness, refuses to consent to his request.  It is a simple story told in simple prose.  Set during a period from the early 1960s until the 1980s, \\"Waiting\\" is a realistic and human tale of relationships set against the backdrop of Chinese culture and society during the years of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath.   Marked by Ha Jin's remarkable attention to the details of everyday life, \\"Waiting\\" is a sparkling gem of a novel, a deserving winner of both the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award.	2000-11-14

The result, based upon two papers she delivered to literary societies at Newnham and Girton in October of that year, was \\"A Room of One's Own\\", an extended essay on women as both writers of fiction and as characters in fiction.  And, while Woolf suggests that, \\"when a subject is highly controversial-and any question about sex is that-one cannot hope to tell the truth,\\" her essay is, in fact, an extraordinarily even-handed, thoughtful and perceptive reflection on the topic.<br />Woolf begins with a simple and enigmatic opinion:  \\"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction; and that, as you will see, leaves the great problem of the true nature of woman and the true nature of fiction unresolved.\\"  From this spare beginning, Woolf deftly explores the difference between how women had been portrayed in fiction, and how they actually lived in the world, during the preceding centuries.  \\"A very queer, composite being emerges.  Imaginatively, she is of the highest importance; practically she is completely insignificant.  She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is all but absent from history.  She dominates the lives of kings and conquerors in fiction; in fact she was a slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger.\\"<br />The source of dissonance between how women were portrayed in fiction, and how they actually lived, was the fact that most fiction prior to the nineteenth century was written by men.  As Woolf astutely points out, \\"[i]t was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until Jane Austen's day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex.\\"  Woolf's observation is no feminist polemic; it is, rather, an incisive comment on how fiction was impoverished when it was written only by men.<br />Even when fiction was written by women, it was powerfully influenced by patriarchal notions of virtue and the proper role of women.  Thus, Woolf suggests there could be no female Shakespeare in sixteenth century England because no women would be tolerated who lived in the real world like the Bard.  \\"No girl could have walked to London and stood at a stage door and forced her way into the presence of actor-managers without doing herself violence and suffering an anguish which may have been irrational-for chastity may be a fetish invented by societies for unknown reasons-but were none the less inevitable.\\"  Indeed, this \\"relic of the sense of chastity\\" dictated that more daring female authors-George Eliot, George Sand, Currer Bell-maintain anonymity as late as the nineteenth century.<br />When female writers did find a \\"room of their own,\\" they were still limited by social and cultural imperatives.  Thus, the first of the great women novelists-Jane Austen, the Brontes, George Eliot-wrote largely from the drawing room, not from the experiences of the larger world-the very conditions of their writing life being as cramped as the their restricted lives.  As Woolf notes, in commenting on Charlotte Bronte, \\"[s]he knew, no one better, how enormously her genius would have profited if it had not spent itself in solitary visions over distant fields; if experience and intercourse and travel had been granted her.  But they were not granted, they were withheld.\\"<br />Ultimately, Woolf suggests that the \\"true\\" nature of women will only be approached in fiction when women are sufficiently independent-not only in a financial sense, but in the sense of being freed from societal and cultural restraints-to explore the quotidian, the everyday lives of people in the world.  This is the aspect of the fictional world that, in Woolf's view, was absent from the male-dominated novel prior to the nineteenth century.<br />Woolf further suggests that the \\"true\\" nature of fiction is expressed only through those writers who can transcend their narrow sexual roles-become \\"man-womanly\\" or \\"woman-manly\\"-so as to convey the fullness of the real world.  As Woolf notes, \\"Coleridge perhaps meant this when he said that a great mind is androgynous.  It is when this fusion takes place that the mind is fully fertilised and uses all of its faculties.\\" Based on this criterion, Woolf promulgates her own canon of English male writers, a canon which includes Shakespeare, Keats, Sterne, Cowper, Lamb, Coleridge, and Proust (who \\"was perhaps wholly androgynous, if not perhaps a little too much of a woman\\").<br />\\"A Room of One's Own\\" is, in sum, a fascinating, thoughtful and perceptive essay on women and fiction written by one of the Twentieth century's most formidable writers and thinkers, a woman who truly succeeded in creating a room of her own in the canon of modern English literature.man-manly\\"-so as to convey the fullness of the real world.

In Proust, the stunning use of memory and sense perception, as well as the stream of consciousness narrative of the great \\"roman fleuve\\", marked the auspicious beginnings of a modern sensibility and technique in fiction.  Similarly, Joyce's difficult, blasphemous and similarly streaming novel, set in the course of a single day and emanating from the perceiving mind of its narrator, carried forward this sensibility and technique.  It is not surprising, then, that Virginia Woolf, while writing her brilliant and innovative \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", was reading these two authors at the time, for Woolf's novel stands as yet another masterful work of modern sensibility and technique, a classic in its own right.<br />\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is set entirely during a single bright beautiful day in June, when Clarissa Dalloway is occupied by last minute preparations for a party she is having that evening.  The wife of Richard Dalloway, a member of Parliament, Mrs. Dalloway is someone who is skilled, like an artist, at creating the perfect party.  But the resemblances to a character and a narrative from Jane Austen or Anthony Trollope end there, for Woolf's fictional agenda is consciously modern and her technique is entirely that of interior monologue, omniscient description and, most markedly, a stream of consciousness narrative.  Thus, Woolf's text gracefully and imaginatively moves from the interiority of Clarissa Dalloway's thoughts, perceptions and memories  to those of the her former lover, Peter Walsh, who has just returned from India, to those of Septimus Warren Smith, a kind of literary doppelganger to Clarissa, a broken young man who served in World War I and suffers the horrible psychological effects of that conflict.  It is, in particular, Septimus who darkly hovers over the gaiety of Mrs. Dalloway's day and, ultimately, brings that psychologicaldarkness to Mrs. Dalloway's party.<br />Continually challenging the reader, Woolf's difficult, stream of consiousness narrative technique brings the reader into the minds of the characters, the language on the page telling a coherent and deeply sensitive story by describing sensations, memories, feelings.  But it is worth the effort, for \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is truly one of the great works of Twentieth century English literature, a modern novel that can stand comfortably, albeit diminuitively, next to The Great Marcel and the creator of Bloom's Day.	2000-10-25

Set during a single day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, Woolf brilliantly used techniques which became hallmarks of the modern novel--interior monologue, first person narrative and a stunning, albeit unrelentingly difficult, stream-of-consciousness rendering--to produce one of the masterpieces of twentieth century English literature.  Nearly seventy-five years later, Michael Cunningham has used many of these same techniques to write \\"The Hours\\", a fitting homage to Woolf and a novel which deservedly won both the PEN/Faulkner Award and the Pulitzer Prize.<br />\\"The Hours\\" tells the story of a bright June day in the lives of three different women living in three different times and places.  The first story is that of Virginia Woolf during a day in 1923, when she is writing \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  The second is the story of Laura Brown, a thirtyish, bookish married woman living in the suburbs of Los Angeles.  Laura has a four-year-old son and is pregnant with another child as she plans a birthday dinner for her husband on a day in 1949.  The third story is that of Clarissa Vaughn, a fifty-two year old, slightly bohemian, literary agent who is planning a party for Richard, her long-time friend and one-time lover, a prominent writer dying of AIDS.<br />\\"The Hours\\" is, among other things, a nuanced and sensitive picture of middle age in the lives of its characters.  Like the novel to which it pays tribute, \\"The Hours\\" relies heavily on interior monologue-on thoughts, memories and perceptions-to drive the narrative and to establish a powerful bond between the reader and each of the female protagonists.  The reader feels the psychic pain of the aging Virginia Woolf as she contemplates suicide in the Prologue. The reader has an almost tactile sense of Laura Brown's claustrophobia, of her feeling that life is closing in around her, as she flees to a hotel for two hours in the middle of the day simply to spend time reading (\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", of course).  And the reader can identify with the yearning, the melancholy, that is suggested when Clarissa Vaughn thinks back to the time when she was young, when her life's choices had not yet been made. <br />\\"The Hours\\" is written, in short, like all great fiction--with deep feeling and love for its characters-and it stands as one of the outstanding American novels of the past decade. While resonating with the themes, techniques and characters of Woolf's difficult modern masterpiece, \\"The Hours\\" is masterful and original in its own right, an accessible and engaging work that is worth all the time you spend with it.	2000-10-24

Immediately the subject of controversy upon its publication in 1796, Lewis was prosecuted and subsequent editions of the book were heavily censored.  Coleridge described it as blasphemous, \\"a romance, which if a parent saw it in the hands of a son or daughter, he might reasonably turn pale.\\"  Yet, \\"The Monk\\" was so popular that its author became a minor celebrity-coming to be known as \\"Monk\\" Lewis--and Sir Walter Scott prounounced that \\"it seemed to create an epoch in our literature.\\"  And whether \\"The Monk\\" truly created an epoch in English literature, or merely marked the early apogee of a genre, it stands as a stunning example of the Gothic novel.<br />\\"The Monk\\" tells the story of Ambrosio, the ostensibly pious and deeply revered Abbot of the Capuchin monastery in Madrid, and his dark fall from grace.  It is a novel which unravels, at times, like the \\"Arabian Nights\\", stories within stories, a series of digressions, the plot driven by love and lust, temptations and spectres, and, ultimately, rape, murder and incest.  It is sharply anti-Catholic, if not anti-clerical, in tone, Ambrosio and most of its other religious characters being profane, murderous, self-centered hypocrites cloaked in displays of public piety.  And while it sometimes seems critical of superstition, \\"The Monk\\" is  replete with Mephistophelian bargains, supernatural events, appartions, and spectres, as well as entombment  and dark forebodings of mystery and evil.  It is, in short, a stunningly entertaining, albeit typically heavy-handed, Gothic novel, perhaps the ultimate classic of the genre.	2000-10-17

It is, in short, a book not for the intellectually faint of heart, Ducornet's richly allusive prose streaming through interpretive tropes that constantly demand the reader's utmost attention and imaginative empathy.  And while this wide-ranging collection appropriately has been compared to a kind of intellectual \\"wunderkammern\\" or \\"cabinet of wonders\\", Ducornet imaginatively demonstrates in these essays that the world cannot be contained within the artificial bounds of the \\"wunderkammern\\", for ultimately its contents are \\"topsy turvy and promiscuous.\\"  <br />In the essay \\"Optical Terror\\", Ducornet sets the stage for the essays to follow, discussing the great Renaissance voyages of discovery, voyages \\"which revealed a sprawling world, infinitely stranger than previously imagined.\\"  The curiosities that came from these voyages, the stuff of the \\"wunderkammern\\", challenged accepted notions of the world, generating the intellectual unease which ultimately led to the Enlightenment.  In Ducornet's words, \\"the fantastic influx of curiosities had a profoundly unsettling effect upon pedestrian and pious minds persuaded that the finite world was created reasonably, to the measure of man and for his salvation.\\"  <br />From \\"Optical Terror\\", Ducornet goes on to develop the trope of the \\"wunderkammern\\" through the diversely imagined and imaginative essays of \\"The Monstrous and the Marvelous\\".  Thus, she ranges from a stunningly imaginative essay connecting Kafka and Borges (\\"Alphabets and Emperors: Reflections on Kafka and Borges\\") to a short essay on Rosamond Purcell's studies on human monstrosities and anomalies (\\"The Impossible Genus\\") to an essay on stories of haruspicationor divination by the inspection of animal entrails (\\"Sortilege\\").  There is a strangely imagined, intellectually difficult and  scatologically-driven essay on Swift which bears the imprint of the excessive envisionings of Georges Bataille, and there is a quirkily dark essay exploring the lethal female body in Pasolini, David Lynch, Robert Coover, and Angela Carter.  <br />Intellectually provocative, and at times deeply disturbing, the essays strive to reorder the way we see and, ultimately, the way we articulate and dream, the world.  The essays transgress the boundaries of the reader's imagination, often going beyond the point of comprehension, and this is perhaps Ducornet's only weakness: the imaginative flights of imagination are so startling and, at times, abstruse that the reader struggles with her metaphors, her tropes, her meanings.   But while imperfect, there is a scent of genius in \\"The Monstrous and the Marvelous\\", a scent which is worth taking the time to savor.	2000-10-13

Thus begins Bernhard Schlink's short, sparely written novel, \\"The Reader\\".  From there, the plot of this best-selling novel is well known.  Berg spends many days with Hanna, reading to her and making love, the mysterious woman becoming the obsession and fulfillment of erotic desire.  Then, Hanna suddenly disappears, leaving Berg's life as quickly and mysteriously as she had entered it.  Several years later, in the mid-1960s, Berg once again encounters Hanna, this time standing trial for war crimes as a former guard at Auschwitz.  His obsession rekindled, Berg's narrative follows Hanna's trial, disclosing her wartime crimes and her \\"secret\\", and relating the austere relationship which continued between them during Hanna's years of imprisonment.<br />\\"The Reader\\" is a little novel which has big aspirations, its austere prose and simple plot suggesting to the reader that there is something more, something unsaid, about the engimatic Hanna.  Unfortunately, Hanna's ultimate \\"secret\\"-her illiteracy-does not bear the weight of Schlink's story, does not adequately explain Hanna's actions.  It may become a wonderful television movie, but \\"The Reader\\" is not the classic work that, for example, George Steiner's profuse praise suggests.  While the first part of the novel, a little erotic fairy tale of the affair between Berg and Hanna, is a concentrated work of spare, lucid prose which \\"hooks\\" the reader,  the remainder of the book is not nearly so good and never carries the weight of the big questions Schlink wants to raise-questions of guilt and love and the relationship between generations in post-War Germany.<br />It is certainly worth spending a few short hours with \\"The Reader\\", an interesting, if not profound, novel with some very good writing.  Just don't expect a modern classic.	2000-10-03

Thus, the noun precedes him--\\"sadist\\"-and the adjective-\\"sadistic\\"-our language itself fixing the man's transgressions before the fact of his biography, making the biography appear superfluous in light of the enormity of the man's crimes.  But there was, indeed, a real human being behind the noun and the adjective--Donatien Alphonse Francois, Marquis de Sade--and Francine du Plessix Gray's \\"At Home With the Marquis de Sade\\" provides an insightful, sympathetic, well written picture of that human being in all his complexity.<br />Gray's biography concentrates largely on the relationship de Sade had with two women-his first wife, Renee-Pelagie de Sade, and his indomitable mother-in-law, Madame de Montreuil.  De Sade's wife remained a constant companion to the erstwhile Marquis for more than a quarter century, suffering his sexual excesses (including dalliances with her younger sister, Anne-Prospere), the ensuing scandals and, ultimately, the many years of imprisonment.  His mother-in-law, a social climbing women of fierce and irrepressible will who at first found the Marquis charming, ultimately became his worst oppressor, driven like the Eumenides to avenge de Sade's seduction of her virginal younger daughter, Anne-Prospere.  She was, in Gray's characterization, a woman who exemplified \\"primitive female fury, a rage that is unquestioning in its self-righteousness.\\"  And it was Madame de Montreuil who unstintingly worked to keep the Marquis imprisoned for over thirteen years, freedom coming only with the fall of the Bastille in 1789, when the Marquis was forty-nine years old.  <br />Gray deftly uses correspondence and other contemporary historical documents to illuminate de Sade's life, including his prominent involvement as \\"Citizen Louis Sade\\"in the Revolutionary government of France, his role in saving his hated mother-in-law from the guillotine in 1793, and his subsequent incarceration in the Charenton asylum from 1799 until his death in 1814, where he carried on as an author and director of numerous theatrical productions staged by the inmates of the asylum and by professional actors.  Gray also puts de Sade's early life and sexual excesses  in context, showing how his actions, while transgressive and freely chosen, were also the product of a society and an upbringing which allowed libertinism to flourish among the pre-Revolutionary French nobility and clergy.  Finally, Gray provides illuminating, albeit brief, discussions of de Sade's literary works, putting his writings in historical context and showing that the excesses of the man's life did not attain the excesses of his imagination.<br />&quot;At Home With the Marquis de Sade&quot; is, in short, a carefully researched, lucidly written life of the historical figure who has come to symbolize sexual transgression, a biography that eludes the imprisonment of culturally fixed meanings to get at the real life behind the &quot;Sadist&quot;.	2000-10-02

Together, in the 1920s, Bohr and Heisenberg had been instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics, complementarity and the uncertainty principle, concepts which provided the theoretical underpinning for modern nuclear physics and, ultimately, the atomic bomb.  Hence, the reason for Heisenberg's visit to Bohr, and what Heisenberg and Bohr discussed during that visit, has been the subject of much historical speculation.  It is this event which forms the basis for Michael Frayn's thought-provoking play of ideas, \\"Copenhagen\\".<br />Heisenberg's role in Germany's effort to develop atomic weapons has been the topic of much speculation, historians tending to place him on one side or the other of the moral dividing line.  There are those who paint him as an evil tool of the Nazis, someone who willingly devoted himself to Germany's scientific efforts to develop an atomic weapon.  From their perspective, there has been a tendency to read Heisenberg's 1941 visit to Bohr as an effort to recruit Bohr to the German scientific fold.  There are others who see the visit as more enigmatic, who do not ascribe such clear intentions to Heisenberg, and who see in the historical record evidence that Heisenberg was a passive opponent of the Nazis' objectives, a scientist who quietly undermined the German scientific effort while ostenbibly remaining a \\"good\\" German.  <br />Frayn brilliantly depicts the uncertainty of Heisenberg's motivations, as well as the uncertainty of what occurred at the meeting between the two scientists, using the theory of these physicists to illumine not the physical world, but the psychological world of human motives. \\"Uncertainty\\" thus describes not merely the behavior of the atom, but also the behavior of individuals living in ethically difficult historical circumstances.  As Frayn notes in his Postscript to the text of this play, \\"thoughts and intentions, even one's own-perhaps one's own most of all-remain shifting and elusive.  There is not one single thought or intention of any sort that can ever be precisely established.\\"<br />\\"Copenhagen\\" is lucidly and sparely written, a play of dialogue among only three characters-Heisenberg, Bohr and Bohr's wife, Margrethe.  There are, of course, numerous references to the esoteric world of theoretical physics, particularly as it developed in the 1920s, and the Postscript to the text is therefore especially helpful in understanding both the scientific and historical frames of reference for the play. <br />Read this little play-better yet, see it if you can-because \\"Copenhagen\\" is a dramatic work that truly deserves to be recognized as one of outstanding plays of recent years.	2000-10-02

This was one year after the publication in Germany of Robert Walser's eccentric little novel,  \\"Jakob von Gunten\\".  The fact is worth noting because Kafka had read Walser  and liked his writing, writing which can be characterized as  \\"Kafkaesque\\"  even though it preceded the publication of Kafka's work by several years.  The resemblances between Walser and Kafka-- in sensibility, in prose style,  in eccentricity of thought and syntax--are remarkable.  <br />\\"Jakob von  Gunten\\" is the first person journal of a student at the Benjamenta  Institute, a school for butlers in an unidentified city.  In young Jakob's  words, \\"one learns very little here, there is a shortage of teachers, and  none of us boys of the Benjamenta Institute will come to anything, that is  we shall all be something very small and subordinate later in life.\\"   <br />The Institute is run by Herr Benjamenta and all classes are taught by  his sister, Fraulein Lisa Benajamenta.  There are no other teachers, all of  the others being either \\"asleep, or they are dead, or seemingly dead, or  they are fossilized.\\"  It is a narrowly circumscribed world full of  students who are enchanted with the most mundane and trivial matters.  But  it is also a mysterious world, a world alienated from reality, a dreamlike  projection of  Jakob's mind expressed in the concrete language of the real.   \\"The Benjamentas are secluded in the inner chambers and in the classroom  there's an emptiness, an emptiness that almost sickens one.\\"  <br />Humorous  and absurd, disturbing and, at times, childlike in its simplicity, \\"Jakob  von Gunten\\" is the work of an undeservedly obscure master of modern prose.   Thus, Christopher Middleton, the translator, in his fascinating and useful  introduction, describes Walser as \\"in significant ways untutored, something  of a primitive.\\"    More precisely, Middleton notes that Walser's prose  \\"can display the essential luminous naivete of an artist who creates as if  self-reflection were not a barred door but a bridge of light to the real.\\"   It is, in other words, prose which seeks to rewrite the \\"real\\" in the  distorted image of the narrator's mind, making simple descriptions of  mundane experience absurd.  It is Kafkaesque writing before the advent of  Kafka, a diminutive precursor of the Master of Prague.	2000-09-19

Port and Kit Moresby, husband and wife,  and their friend, Tunner, are \\"travelers,\\" not \\"tourists,\\" as Port says  early in the narrative.  \\"The difference is partly one of time . . .  Whereas the tourist generally hurries back home at the end of a few weeks  or months, the traveler, belonging no more to one place than to the next,  moves slowly, over periods of years, from one part of the earth to  another.\\"  Like travelers, Port, Kit and Tunner seem to have little in the  way of an itinerary, their days languourously slipping by, one day into the  next, without purpose, marked only by a palpable psychic discomfort. <br />But  there is another important difference between the tourist and the traveler.   As Port relates, \\"the former accepts his own civilization without  question; not so the traveler, who compares it with the others, and rejects  those elements he finds not to his liking.\\"  In doing this, however, the  traveler runs the risk, if the degree of cultural separation is too great,  if the foreign culture is too extreme, that he will become completely  untethered from reality.  As Bowles once said in a 1981 Paris Review  interview:  \\"Everyone is isolated from everyone else.  The concept of  society is like a cushion to protect us from the knowledge of that  isolation.  A fiction that serves as an anaesthetic.\\"  <br />It is,  ultimately, the removal of this anaesthetic, the removal of societal and  cultural moorings, which drives the narrative of \\"The Sheltering Sky\\"and  determines the fate of Port and Kit and Tunner.  One does not survive;  another will never be the same again. Disturbances of the interior  landscape, the landscape of the psyche, become the catalyst of this  psychologically discomforting novel.  And this stunning mingling of  interior landscape with the landscape of the Sahara-the sands, the sky, the  maze-like passages of the cities, the alien culture-brilliantly unfies and  completes the narrative of \\"The Sheltering Sky\\", marking it as a profound  and compelling work of genius.	2000-09-18
US	38955473	R1ITIMG2JQSQ73	0679725407	568288173	Aké: The Years of Childhood	Books	5	24	25	N	N	A Densely Written, Deeply Evocative Memoir of Childhood	There is a wonderful chapter in Wole Soyinka's \\"Ake: The Years of  Childhood\\" which can be read as an extended metaphor for growing up or,  more specifically, growing up in a small town in western Nigeria and  becoming a world-recognized author and Nobel Prize winner.  In that chapter  Soyinka relates the story of how his older brother first hoisted the then  four year old boy up on his shoulders so he could see over the wall, see  outside the school compound, where he lived.  This glimpse of the outside  world fascinated the inquisitive young boy, so much so that the next time  he heard a commotion outside the walls-a police band marching by-he ran to  the gate, only to find it latched.  As Soyinka relates: \\"Then I heard  excited voices on the outside, obviously there were others before me who  had the same idea.  I banged on the gate and someone opened it.\\"  <br />It was  an epiphany for the young boy, leaving the safe confines of the compound  for the fascinations of the outside world. Soyinka clearly was enchanted by  what he saw and experienced, following the band for many miles, to the next  town, where he suddenly found himself alone.  \\"The ragged, motley group of  children who had followed, clowning, mimicking, even calling out orders had  fallen off one by one.  It occurred to me now that I had seen no one nor  heard any of their festive voices for a while.  They had all vanished,  leaving no one but me.\\" <br />Just as Wole, the little boy, plunged into the  outside world only to find himself alone at the end, so has the mature  Soyinka, the brilliant author of this densely written, deeply evocative  childhood memoir, written himself into a singular position as Nigeria's  leading and, perhaps most courageous, literary figure.<br />\\"Ake: The Years of  Childhood\\" is not an easy book to read.  Soyinka's prose is rich and  detailed, his style at times elliptical, requiring the reader's careful  attention.  But the effort is certainly worth it, for Soyinka warmly and  affectionately details not only his own memories and experiences from the  age of four to eleven, but strikingly captures the universal feelings,  sensations, and perceptions of childhood itself.  Soyinka takes the  particularity of growing up in a culture where traditional folklore, magic  and superstition mix with Western Christianity, education and invention,  where Yoruba is spoken along with English, where cultural and experiential  references are polyglot, and he sees this particularity through the eyes of  a child.  By doing this, Soyinka brilliantly depicts not only his own  experience of growing up in Nigeria during the late 1930s and 1940s, but  also the experience of just plain growing up.  It doesn't matter whether  you know anything or nothing about Wole Soyinka or Nigeria to appreciate  this marvelous memoir; it only matters that you have an inquisitive mind  that wants to enter an even more inquisitive mind, the mind of a child.	2000-09-12
US	38955473	R1V0HZYMMKNPUO	189979171X	629078564	Arthur Rimbaud (Outlines)	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Rimbaud as a Saint of Gay Culture	In the early 1950s, Rene Etiemble published a doctoral dissertation of monumental proportions, &quot;Le Mythe de Rimbaud&quot;, which enumerated  the numerous, variegated and, ultimately, misleading and false mythologies  which had been propogated about Rimbaud in the decades following his death  in 1891.  Etiemble devoted more than twenty years to researching and  refuting these myths, including the myths of Rimbaud the seer, the  Catholic, the Communard, the homosexual, the scoundrel, and the martyr.  As  Enid Starkie suggested in her definitive biography, Etiemble's work had a  salutary effect on modern approaches to Rimbaud by showing that &quot;no  single one of these descriptions accurately fits him.&quot;  The result,  among other things, was to shift the focus of Rimbaud studies from  hagiography, on the one hand, and demonization, on the other, to an  exploration of Rimbaud's revolutionary poetic language and  expression.<br />More than fifty years after Etiemble's watershed  dissertation, Benjamin Ivry has written &quot;Arthur Rimbaud&quot;, a  brief, fascinating, but ultimately somewhat disingenuous biographical gloss  on Rimbaud's life.  Ivry's book is the first in a series of books to be  published by Absolute Press, books intended &quot;to explore and portray  the various and often unexpected ways in which homosexuality has informed  the life and creative work of the influential gay and lesbian artists,  writers, singers, dancers, composers, and actors of our time.&quot;  It is,  in other words, a book which has an agenda--an agenda which once again  seeks to fit the enigmatic nature of Rimbaud's biography into a mythology,  this time a mythology of Rimbaud as a founding saint of modern gay culture.   Thus, Rimbaud's brilliant, complex and poetically difficult masterpieces,  &quot;Une Saison en Enfer&quot; and &quot;Illuminations&quot;, works which  are laden with symbol and mystery, with a radically innovative poetic  vitality, are reduced by Ivry tothe product of Rimbaud's erstwhile  homoerotic relationship with Paul Verlaine.  Every aspect of Rimbaud's  brief life as a poet, in Ivry's depiction, is driven by Rimbaud's  &quot;gayness&quot;, by his love for Verlaine, by his presumed disinterest  in women.  Never mind other aspects of Rimbaud's biography--his severe  mother, his absent father, his religious upbringing, his revolutionary  poetic work itself!  Moreover, while the book contains a useful  bibliography, it is devoid of footnotes, so it is impossible to ascertain  the veracity of the speculations which permeate Ivry's text.  <br />Having  said all of this, I also must say that Ivry is an outstanding writer--his  prose sparkles--and this little book is definitely worth reading if you  have an interest in Rimbaud because it provides fascinating details on  Rimbaud's relationship with Verlaine and others.  In particular, the book  extensively discusses the gay aspects of Rimbaud's life and poetry and  Rimbaud's influence on subsequent writers from Cocteau to Kerouac to Jim  Morrison.  These are aspects of Rimbaud's life which are not explored very  closely by Starkie's definitive biography and, if you read Ivry's book with  some degree of skepticism, it provides a fascinating and provocative  complement to the standard treatment of Rimbaud's life	2000-08-27

He  ultimately produced nine brilliant volumes which still stand as the finest  and most complete summary of  Western philosophy from the earliest  Pre-Socratics to modern Existentialists and Structuralists (the last of the  volumes covering Sartre, Camus and Levi-Strauss, among others).  <br />The  first volume, which covers the conception of Western philosophy in the seed  of the early Ionian thinkers, through the gestation of Pythagoras,  Heraclitus, Zeno, Anaxagoras, and the Sophists, ultimately culminating in  the birth of Western philosophy in the axis of Socrates-Plato-Aristotle and  its post-Aristotelian Roman afterbirth, is a detailed and analytical  discussion of the origins of Western thought.  Complete in itself, it  provides a comprehensive introduction to the beginnings of Western  rationalism and a useful starting point for a general study of the history  of philosophy in the West or a more detailed exploration of the ancient  thinkers from the Pre-Socratics to Plotinus.  <br />If any criticism can be  made of Copleston's work, it is that his analyses are dominated by an  overriding scholasticism, by Copleston's adherence to traditional, Thomist  perspectives on  these thinkers.  This criticism is difficult to make,  however, because he never minces words in disclosing his point of view and  because, despite his own Jesuitical intellectual predilections, his  treatment is always comprehensive, thoughtful and genuine.	2000-08-23
US	38955473	R3RJQ8JWZOA5CO	0140042598	303305496	On the Road (Penguin Orange Collection)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	A Streaming, Sensuous Work of Chaotic Experience	No work of American literature has ever captured the spirit of youthful  wanderlust, of the freedom of wide-open American spaces, of the country's  romance with its transient possibilities, better than \\"On the Road\\".  It is  a streaming, sensuous work of chaotic experience, forever carving the  \\"Beat\\" spirit into the soul of American literature.  It is a book which  must be judged not simply by looking at whether it conforms to traditional  notions of technical literary technique (because it does not), but, rather,  upon Kerouac's own terms, which are much different.  In Kerouac's words, in  a 1968 Paris Review interview:  \\"I spent my entire youth writing slowly  with revisions and endless rehashing speculation and deleting and got so I  was writing one sentence a day and the sentence had no FEELING.  Goddamn  it, FEELING is what I like in art, not CRAFTINESS and the hiding of  feelings.\\"<br />\\"On the Road\\" has little in the way of plot or careful  character development, the story being largely a chaotic narrative of the  New York to San Francisco and back again adventures of Dean Moriarty  (modeled almost wholly on the  real life Beat figure Neal Cassady) and Sal  Paradise (the erstwhile Kerouac himself), together with Beat buddies like  Carlo Marx (Allen Ginsberg) and Bull Lee (William Burroughs).  But its  breathless, rambling narration of transient experience is a kind of  literary \\"free fall\\" through the world of unfettered possibility  that the  open road offered in  post-World War II America.  It is a book heavily  influenced by  Jazz culture, as well as  the culture of America's cities,  the open highways which connect them, and America's love affair with the  car.  <br />Kerouac got the idea for \\"On the Road\\" from Neal Cassady himself,  the model for Dean Moriarty.  In Kerouac's words, \\"[I saw] how good old  Neal Cassady wrote his letters to me, all first person, fast, mad,  confessional, completely serious, all detailed.\\"  Being a very rapid  typist, Kerouac took this idea, taped together twelve-foot long sheets of  paper, fed them into the typewriter and, fortified by pea soup, coffee and  benzedrine, began writing.  It was a novel technique-a technique which  prompted Truman Capote to say that \\"On the Road\\" wasn't really \\"writing\\",  it was just \\"typing\\"-but it resulted in one of the classic works of modern  American literature.  <br />In Ken Kesey's words, \\"Kerouac was part of the  ongoing exploration of the American frontier, looking for new land, trying  to escape the dust bowls of existence.  He had a deep connection to the  American romantic vision.\\"  It is this romantic vision, this connection  with that long strand of American literature and culture that began with  the frontier and its endless possibilities, that makes \\"On the Road\\" a book  still worth reading today, a book that vividly captures something of what  it's like to live and dream in America.	2000-08-22

I consciously use the term &quot;Beat  Generation&quot;, rather than &quot;Beat Movement&quot;,  because the  collection incorporates a diverse group of poets and writers who, while  largely contemporaries,  are each so idiosyncratic in their own right that  it is inaccurate to lump them together in a single &quot;movement&quot;.   All of the interviews originally appeared in &quot;The Paris Review&quot;  between 1965 and 1998.  Each interview is preceded by a short biographical  introduction and a description of the circumstances in which the interview  occurred.<br />If there is any unifying characteristic among these writers, it  is their rejection of literary formalism and their reliance upon  sponaneity.  As Lawrence Ferlinghetti observerves in his 1998 interview,  one of the best in this collection, &quot;I would call it the 'graph of  consciousness' school of poetry because the poetry, as conceived and as  defined in this manner, is exactly what goes through your consciousness at  any given moment.&quot;<br />Consistent with Ferlinghetti's view of the Beat  poets, Allen Ginsberg thus proclaims in his 1996 interview, that  &quot;there should be no distinction between what we write down and what we  really know.&quot;  Attacking literary formalism, the owlish iconoclastic  &quot;Howl&quot; author notes:  &quot;the hypocrisy of literature has  been-you know like there's supposed to be formal literature, which is  supposed to be different from . . . in subject, in diction and even in  organization, from our quotidian inspired lives.&quot;<br />Not surprisingly,  Ginsberg's poetics echo the 1968 interview with Jack Kerouac, the  breathless unpunctuated Beat proponent of unrevised prose, the very  inventor of the term &quot;Beat&quot;.  In Kerouac's words,  &quot;by not  revising what you've already written you simply give the reader the actual  workings of your thoughts about events in your unchangeable  way.&quot;<br />Charles Olson, whose virtually unintelligible 1970 interview  appears here, follows this same poetic line.  Olson (more appropriately  identified with the &quot;Black Mountain School&quot;) advocated so-called  &quot;open-field composition&quot;, described by George Plimpton in his  introduction to the Olson interview as &quot;poetry whose appearance and  internal logic are governed by the spontaneity of the writing  process.&quot;<br />Thus, in some respects, Beat poetics seems to resemble the  spontaneity, the anti-formalism of Surrealist automatic writing (something  which Ferlinghetti suggests in his interview).  But this resemblance is  attenuated by the Beat experience of America and of the Beats turn to the  East (specifically, Buddhism) and to the influence of  consciousness-expanding drugs.  Furthermore, while there may be unifying  strands running through Beat poetics, this collection of interviews also  demonstrates the remarkable diversity of these authors, a diversity which  makes it difficult to collate their writings under any unified theory.   After reading the interviews with William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Gary  Snyder, a reader is enthralled and exasperated at the eclection of thought  among them.<br />&quot;Beat Writers at Work&quot; contains exceptional  interviews with Ferlinghetti, Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kerouac, Snyder, Paul  Bowles, and Ken Kesey.  These interviews make this collection required  reading for anyone interested in the Beats.  The interviews with  Ferlinghetti and Barney Rosset also provide an insightful look at the role  of City Lights Books and Grove Press in publishing the Beats in their early  days, a time when censorship made such publication a financially parlous  venture for small presses.  Finally, Elissa Schappell, a contributing  editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, provides a fascinating memoir of a  graduate class taught by Ginsberg in 1995.  The only weak pieces in this  collection are the 1980 &quot;conversation&quot; among Ginsberg, Peter  Orlovsky and Russian poet Andrei Vosnesensky and the largely unintelligible  wordplay of Charles Olson's 1970 interview.  There is also one notable  author missing:  Gregory Corso, who is, in Ferlinghetti's words, &quot;the  most important Beat poet after Ginsberg.&quot;	2000-08-14
US	38955473	RYQUGOFF3AXU5	0684852225	55789944	Close Range : Wyoming Stories	Books	5	11	14	N	N	Stories Destined to Stand the Test of Time	Annie Proulx's &quot;Close Range: Wyoming Stories&quot; is so rich in language and characters, so textured in details of plot, landscape and  memory, that it is difficult to decide where to begin a review of this  dark, often disturbing, but ultimately overpowering collection of eleven  stories.  <br />The names of the characters who people these stories suggests  their grim and stinted existence:  Hulse Birch, Wauneta Hipsag, Shy Hamp,  Noyce Hair, Sutton Muddyman, Car Scrope, Pake Bitts, Horm Timsley.  They  are characters who lead desperate lives as rodeo riders, cowboys, sheep  farmers, and poor ranchers.  As one reviewer has suggested, &quot;[n]o one  is successful here except the bar owners, the dude ranchers and the cattle  traders, and they are always just offstage, counting their money.&quot;   Shattering all romantic illusions of the West, Proulx paints a relentlessly  bleak picture of characters who cannot escape their past, who are often  driven by the basest of instincts, and whose hardscrabble existence is  continually overwhelmed by exigencies of geography, climate and  landscape.<br />It is a claustrophobic and atrophied world, a world where  possibilities have narrowed to nothing.  As a character in &quot;A Lonely  Coast&quot; disquietly relates while sitting at the Golden Buckle bar,  &quot;[t]here were times when I thought the Buckle was the best place in  the world, but it could shift on you and then the whole dump seemed a mess  of twist-faced losers, the women with eyebrows like crowbars, the men  covered with bristly red hair, knuckles the size of new potatoes, showing  the gene pool was small and the rivulets that had once fed it had dried  up.&quot;<br />When a character does try to escape his past, he invariably  meets with a bitter end.  Thus, in the story &quot;People in Hell Just Want  a Drink of Water&quot;, Ras Tinsley, a boy who &quot;was smart with  numbers, read books [and] asked complicated questions no one could  answer,&quot; leaves Wyoming at the age of sixteen to see the world.  Gone  more than five years, his parents finally hear that he has been severely  injured in an auto accident.  Arriving back home by train, thanks to the  courtesy of a Methodist minister, his parents can barely recognize him.   &quot;He was a monster.  The left side of his face and head had been  damaged and torn, had healed in a mass of crimson scars.  There was a  whistling hole in his throat and a scarred left eye socket.  His jaw was  deformed.&quot;  But that is not the end of Ras Tinsley's misery.  He rides  the range, exposing himself to women and young girls, until neighboring  ranchers deal with him in a grim and sadistic way.  Similarly, in &quot;The  Half-Skinned Steer&quot;, a story selected by John Updike for inclusion in  &quot;The Best American Short Stories of the Century&quot;, Mero Corn, an  &quot;octogenarian vegetarian&quot; (or &quot;a cattleman gone wrong&quot;)  who had left his Wyoming home more than sixty years earlier, meets a darkly  mystical end while returing for his brother's funeral.<br />Proulx captures  the grim, gritty reality of rodeo life in &quot;The Mud Below&quot;, one of  the best stories in this collection.  Its hard bitten, bull riding  protagonist, Diamond Felts, remembering back to a day when he watched a  ranch hand gelding calves, grimly reflects that, &quot;[t]he course of  life's events seemed slower than the knife but not less  thorough.&quot;<br />Proulx's densely evocative prose strkingly captures, as  well, the paralyzing loneliness of her characters.  In &quot;The Bunchgrass  Edge of the World&quot; Ottaline Touhey, a lonely, spinsterish girl  &quot;distinguished by a physique approaching the size of a hundred-gallon  propane tank,&quot; finds herself communing with an old green tractor, a  tractor that speaks to her in a voice &quot;hoarse and plangent, just above  an injured whisper, a movie gangster's voice.&quot;  The tractor, seeminly  protective of her, confesses to killing a ranch hand in a rollover accident  many years earlier, a ranch hand who had unseemly desires for the then  four-year-old Ottaline.  The story, like the others in this book,  ultimately ends with a clever little twist of fate involving the  tractor.<br />More than anything, however, &quot;Open Range: Wyoming  Stories&quot; brilliantly draws relationships between its characters and  the land, using nature as a touchstone for the plots to follow.  Thus, in  &quot;Pair a Spurs&quot;, Car Scrope, who had lived on the Coffeepot Ranch  for the entire forty years of his life, had developed a &quot;morbid  passion for the ranch as a child when he believed he could hear the grass  mocking him.&quot;  Remembering his older brother's apparent suicide,  something which his parents never talked to him about, Scrope remembers the  grass hissing, &quot;best one lost, worst one stays.&quot;  In  &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, perhaps the finest story in this remarkable  collection, two young cowboys develop a passionate, life-long and,  ultimately destructive, relationship while herding sheep in the mountains  one summer.  Foreshadowing the story to come, Proulx describes them  descending the mountain with vivid imagery:  &quot;The mountain boiled with  demonic energy, glazed with flickering broken-cloud light, the wind combed  the grass and drew from the damaged krummholz and slit rock a bestial  drone.  As they descended the slope Ennis felt he was in slow motion, but  headlong, irreversible fall.&quot;<br />Reading &quot;Open Range: Wyoming  Stories&quot; is like gorging yourself on a dark chocolate cake.  The  writing is richly layered, the author deeply in touch with her characters  and her place.  It is fiction brilliantly written, stories destined to  stand the test of time.	2000-08-07

Distilled from introductory lectures on contemporary  art, culture and critical theory delivered at the Rhode Island School of  Design more than a decade ago, &quot;Believing is Seeing&quot; provides a  useful counterpoint to mainstream art history texts by challenging  traditional, transhistorical views of aesthetic value.<br />Appropriately  subtitled &quot;Creating the Culture of Art&quot;, Staniszewski's book  demonstrates that Art is something &quot;that has a specific history and  belongs to a particular era.&quot;  What our culture generally calls  &quot;Art&quot; is an invention of the past two hundred years.  Thus,  modern culture has appropriated the paintings, frescoes, sculptures, and  artifacts of earlier times and cultures (where they had historically  specific meanings) and labelled them &quot;Art&quot;.  Modern culture  applies this label even though the original creators of these  representations and objects would not have regarded their creations as Art  in the way we commonly use the term.<br />The task of defining and identifying  Art in contemporary Western society is largely a function of the  institutional structures--the museums, galleries, auction houses, and  publications--that create the culture of Art.  In this way, Marcel Duchamp  can mount a urinal on a pedestal and this plumbing fixture becomes  &quot;Art&quot;, acquires meaning and value, through validation by these  institutional arbiters of the Art world.  Rejecting essentialism,  Staniszewski argues that aesthetic value and meaning are socially  constructed, the products of a particular historical moment and culture.   As individuals, we may not consider Duchamp's urinal anything more than  that--a urinal--but that does not obviate the fact that cultural  institutions have conferred (rightly or wrongly) some greater meaning (and  value) on the object. <br />&quot;Believing is Seeing&quot; is not an  important book; it is a book which, like its thesis, is the product of a  particular historical moment and culture.  It is, however, full of  provocative and challenging ideas about how culture creates meaning and  value.  And for this reason alone, it is worth careful reading.	2000-08-01

This perception became the basis for &quot;Exercises in  Style&quot;, a literary experiment which stunningly challenges the notion  of realism.<br />Queneau was a polymath, with interests and accomplishments as  a novelist, poet, linguist and mathematician.  Briefly a member of Andre  Breton's Surrealist group, Queneau subsequently joined the &quot;College of  Pataphysics&quot; in 1950.  Pataphysics was the science of imagainary  solutions, a science which originated with the poet and playwrite Alfred  Jarry.  The Pataphysicians were a tongue-in-cheek group of French  intellectuals who didn't take themselves too seriously.  At the same time,  Queneau was exploring the Pataphysical, however, he was also serving as  Director of the prestigious &quot;Encyclopedie de la Pleiade&quot;, thus  combining the whimsical with the serious.  A decade later, Queneau was a  founder of &quot;OuLiPo&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Ouvroir de Litterature  Poetentielle&quot; or &quot;Workshop for Potential Literature&quot;).  In  contrast to the Dadaist and Surrealist movements, which gave free reign to  chance and the unmediated workings of the unconscious, OuLiPo emphasized  the systematic and deliberate generation of texts.<br />&quot;Exercises in  Style&quot; is based upon an uninteresting and simple story, a story  without any plot, a story that in itself is pointless and boring.  Queneau  tells this story ninety-nine times, each time using a different variation  in the telling.  Barbara Wright, the translator of the English edition,  notes in her introduction that the variations fall into roughly seven  categories.  These categories include different types of speech, different  types of written prose, different poetic styles, and different grammatical  and rhetorical forms.  Another category are variations which are told in  the form of character sketches through language (e.g., reactionary, biased,  abusive, etc.).  Queneau, in this fashion, demonstrates the fluidity of  language, the variability in the ways that language can describe reality.   As one critic succinctly and correctly stated, &quot;Exercises in  Style&quot; demonstrates &quot;the impossibility of realism in any unitary  sense.&quot;<br />Queneau wanted &quot;Exercises in Style&quot; translated  into English and, unike most literary texts, this particular text loses  little in translation.  While Barbara Wright's translation is outstanding,  she also rightly notes that &quot;the story as such doesn't matter, [nor]  does the particular language [in which] it is written.&quot;  What matters,  and what &quot;Exercises in Style&quot; brilliantly illustrates, is that a  simple story can be expressed in an infinite variety of literary and  linguistic styles, that the transformation of reality into language is  susceptible of manifold permutations.  This is the genius of Queneau's  text, a genius which makes this book a minor classic of modern literature.	2000-07-31

However, the essays constitute much more than that, being a brilliant and heartfelt  series of arguments in support of what Eric Liu appropriately calls  &quot;omniculturalism&quot; and what others, with derisory connotations,  call &quot;assimilationism&quot;. It is a book which has as much to say  about what it means to be an American, and where American culture and  society are heading, as it does about the specific struggles of its  author.<br />There is a scene which Liu describes in his essay, &quot;The  Chinatown Idea&quot;, which particularly struck me and which illustrates   Liu's view of ethnicity and the claims of tradition. When Liu was a young  boy, he and his family took a day trip to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, a  trip which Liu remembers vividly. &quot;[W]hat I remember most is meeting  the eyes of an Amish boy about my age.  He stared back at me, pale and  expressionless, as if from a history book.  To me, this was a boy already  dead, consigned to live out his days in someone else's past.&quot;  <br />This  memory, like many others, form the ground for Liu's compelling arguments  for individual choice and against the claustrophobic, lock-step claims of  ethnic and cultural traditions.  Since &quot;[e]very identity is a social  construction, a drawing of arbitrary lines,&quot; each generation (indeed,  each individual within each generation), must establish his or her own  cultural identity, drawing on traditions of the past, but ultimately  deriving authenticity from the exercise of freedom.  As Liu writes, with  thinly veiled gratitude to his parents, &quot;[i]t just happens that I was  raised with great latitude--to preserve, discard, combine, and  create.&quot;  Thus, Liu proffers a kind of existential argument for  assimilation, or at least for having the freedom to choose the degree of  one's ethnic identity.  As Liu notes, &quot;Chineseness isn't a mystical,  more authentic way of being; it's just a decision to act  Chinese.&quot;<br />In arguing for &quot;omniculturalism&quot; or  &quot;assimiliation&quot;, Liu provides a particularly insightful  discussion and analysis of the development, since the 1970's, of the  so-called &quot;Asian American&quot; identity, an imagined community that  has sought to unify the   interests and cultures of the polyglot Asian  ethnic groups.  He also notes the compelling demographic trends which  establish, &quot;that America is white no longer, and it will never be  white again.&quot;  Thus assimilation in America  no longer has the same  meaning, and rejecting the past in favor of a future in an omnicultural  society &quot;is an act of creation, as much as destruction.&quot;   <br />While you may disagree with Liu's ultimate position, &quot;The  Accidental Asian&quot; is a lucidly written, thoughtful examination of the  issues raised by ethnicity and the claims of tradition, a memoir which  deeply mirrors the cultural and social turmoil of America at the dawn of  this new millenium.	2000-07-25

Redeemed Only by Its Lyricism	&quot;A Small Place&quot; is a small book of unsubtle reflections about Antigua, the nine-by-twelve mile island in the West Indies where Jamaica Kincaid was born and spent her childhood.  Unfortunately, the book is  redeemed only by the lyricism of Kincaid's prose.  In simplistic fashion,  Kincaid explores the legacy of British colonialism and the corruption of  Antigua's native leaders.  Kincaid acknowledges the splenetic nature of her  endeavor, telling the reader to &quot;look at this prolonged visit to the  bile duct I am making, look at how bitter, how dyspeptic just to sit and  think about these things makes me.&quot;  The book is certainly bilious, a  sort of juvenile screed from an author demonstrably capable of more subtle  analysis.  Read &quot;A Small Place&quot; if you're traveling to the West  Indies or read it if you're an admirer of Jamaica Kincaid's literary  craftsmanship.  Just don't expect too much from it.	2000-07-23

Perhaps few of the theatregoers realized that the  &quot;madhouse&quot; they had witnessed was a watershed in the history of  drama.  While many of the innovations of &quot;Six Characters&quot; may now  seem commonplace, Pirandello's innovative, iconoclastic masterpiece marked  a break from traditional dramatic structures and stage settings, a break  which enabled twentieth century drama to develop along self-reflective  imaginative lines much different than its predecessors.  As Eric Bentley,  the play's translator, notes in his introduction to this edition,  &quot;this was the first play ever written in which the boards of the  theatre did not symbolize and represent some other place, some other  reality.&quot;<br />&quot;Six Characters&quot; is set in a theatre where a  director, his stage manager and a group of actors are about to rehearse  another of Pirandello's plays, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;.  The  curtain is up, the stage is empty of props and background, and the lights  illuminate the bare wall at the back of the stage.  It is an austere  setting, a kind of theatrical analogue to the blank sheet of paper an  author faces each day he sits down to write.<br />Suddenly, this austerity,  this mundane theatrical rehearsal, is interrupted by the unexpected arrival  of six characters--a father, a mother, a son, a stepdaughter, a boy, and a  little girl.  They are six characters who have lives, who have stories to  tell, but whose dramatic text has not been written.  They need an author.   As Pirandello says in his 1925 introduction to the play: &quot;Every  creature of fantasy and art, in order to exist, must have his drama, that  is, a drama in which he may be a character and for which he is a character.   This drama is the character's raison d'etre, his vital function, necessary  for his existence.&quot;  <br />The play proceeds, with the six characters  relating fragmentary scenes of incidents in their lives, scenes which are  accompanied by commentary, quarrels, dialogue, and interaction among the  characters and between the characters and the actors.  A kind of theatrical  hall of mirrors, the actors who view these characters become, in effect, an  audience.  The actors are also, however, the actors who will be called upon  to play the parts of the six characters in the dramatic text which is being  created in their presence.  For these actors and these characters, the  stage becomes more real than the world.<br />&quot;Six Characters in Search of  an Author&quot; is a remarkable work of imagination, both in its structure  and its dialogue.  It is comic and absurd, tragic and ponderous.  The play  is a work of original genius; the text (like its characters) is open to  multiple interpretations and meanings.  As one character says, in an  appropriate Pirandellian bit of dialogue: &quot;[t]herein lies the drama .  . . in my awareness that each of us thinks of himself as one but that,  well, it's not true, each of us is many, oh so many, according to the  possibilities that are in us.&quot;	2000-07-22

Apart from that fact, however, little is known of her life or the  circumstances in which she wrote and performed her poetry.  Indeed, the  poetry itself exists only in fragments.  In the words of Page duBois, the  author of this thought-provoking collection of essays, &quot;[s]he is not a  person, not even a character in a drama or a fiction, but a set of texts  gathered in her name.&quot;<br />&quot;Sappho is Burning&quot; presents a  series of close, subtle readings of Sappho's poetry, readings which present  a powerful, disruptive challenge to the traditional Classicist's view of  Greek antiquity. Writing in the period between Homer and the so-called  &quot;Golden Age of Greece&quot;, Sappho's &quot;lyrical, sensual,  emotionally laden textuality&quot; undermines the austerity of Plato and  other writers of the ancient Greek canon, disrupting  prevailing views of  cultural wholeness and opening a space for difference at the origins of  Western civilization.<br />While &quot;Sappho is Burning&quot; is undermined  by the author's own propensity for self-characterization (&quot;I am a  psychoanalytic female subject, an academic, a Marxist historicist feminist  classicist, split, gender-troubled&quot;) and occasionally lapses into the  thickets of Lacanian jargon, these shortcomings are overcome by the  brilliant insights of four of the essays: &quot;Sappho's  Body-in-Pieces&quot;, &quot;Sappho in the Text of Plato&quot;,  &quot;Helen&quot;, and &quot;Sappho in the History of Sexuality&quot;.  In  each of these essays, duBois, through close readings of the texts of Sappho  and others, persuasively establishes a number of counter-readings to  Classicist orthodoxy and, perhaps more significantly, inscribes Sappho in  the history of ancient Greece, the history of Western sexuality, and the  psychoanalytic history of the development of subjective identity.  The  ultimate effect is to cause the careful reader to re-examine received  notions of the origins of Western thought and to recognize that &quot;[t]o  begin the history of the West with classical Greece and with the  philosophers is a polemical choice.&quot;	2000-07-20

Plato is also, perhaps, the earliest philosopher to  examine the full range of philosophical questions.  Using the dialogic  method, Plato explored questions of truth, beauty, immortality, ethics, and  love.  He contemplated the &quot;mind-body&quot; problem and, in his master  work, &quot;The Republic&quot;, sought to establish a sound foundation for  the Greek polis.  However, while Plato's range was extensive, his dialogic  method created open texts, sometimes internally contradictory and always  subject to interpretation.  Plato adumbrated, in other words, a set of  philosophic questions and a method which provided a fertile beginning for  Western metaphysics. <br />Professor Williams effectively uses snippets of  Plato's dialogues to illustrate Plato's philosophical method, as well as  the uncertain conclusions, the &quot;openness&quot;, of Plato's texts.   Rather than approaching Plato as a systematic philosopher with fixed views,  Williams quite accurately notes that &quot;Plato seems to have thought that  the final significance of philosophy for one's life does not lie in  anything that could be embodied in its findings, but emerges, rather, from  its activities.&quot;  Adhering to that notion, this little book provides a  wonderful way, particularly for the initiate to Plato (I think, here,  particularly of the high school student exploring Philosophy for the first  time), to begin grappling with  timeless questions.	2000-07-13

Thus, they were often likened to the old-time &quot;cabinet of curiosities&quot;, displays of disparate and unusual artifacts which bore no relationship to one another. A visitor to these museums often saw things which, in later years, became the staple of carnival side shows.<br />In &quot;A Cabinet of Medical Curiosities&quot;, Jan Bondeson, a British physician who also holds a doctorate in experimental medicine, has written a fascinating and brilliantly executed textual analogue to the cabinet of curiousities. In successive chapters, Bondeson details, among other curiousities, the histories of spontaneous human combustion, apparent death and premature burial, maternal impressions (the belief that what a pregnant woman sees and experiences can cause corresponding alterations in the unborn fetus), and people with tails. Bondeson tells true, and not so true, stories of dwarfs and giants. He relates the story of Mary Toft, the English woman who, in 1726, was believed to have given birth to seventeen rabbits. And, of course, such a compendium of marvels would not be complete without a bearded lady--in this case, Bondeson narrates the remarkable life story of Julie Pastrana, who made appearances throughout the world in the mid-nineteenth century and whose mummified body (along with the mummified corpse of her infant child) continued to draw crowds at fairs and carnivals many years after her death. <br />While these topics may seem grotesque, even repulsive, Bondeson writes with deep feeling for his human subjects and a wry sense of humor for the foibles of his sometimes credulous profession. He also integrates these seemingly freakish and disparate topics into remarkably lucid and informative discussions of their place in the medical, scientific, religious, and literary discourse of their times.	2000-07-09

This place is ineffable; Rudolf Otto, in his memorable book, &quot;The Idea of the Holy&quot;, referred to it as the &quot;numinous&quot;. Nathan Englander, in his collection of stories, &quot;For the Relief of Unbearable Urges&quot;, captures this place in the best of his stories. In &quot;The Tumblers&quot;, a band of Hasidim escape a train to the death camps, ending up instead on a train of circus performers. While &quot;clumsy as Jews&quot;, they improvise a tumbling act which leads to a magical and redemptive outcome that leaves the reader breathless and disturbed. In &quot;The Twenty-seventh Man&quot;, Englander tells the tale of Pinchas Pelovits, a writer who has never published--a writer known only to himself. That is, until the day Pinchas is rounded up with &quot;an eminent selection of Europe's surviving Yiddish literary community&quot; as part of Stalin's purges. In this setting, in a room no bigger than a closet, Pinchas Pelovits encounters the numinous, finds an audience, and generates meaning for the desperate situation of his cellmates. <br />These are only two of the nine stories, perhaps the two best. Each story in this vividly imagined and often disturbingly brilliant collection seeks to capture the meeting of the ordinary with the extraordinary, the ineffable. Each story seeks to provide a locus where religious belief (in this case, Orthodox Judaism) inscribes meaning in the mundane, and sometimes desperate, lives of its characters. While Englander doesn't always succeed, and there are as many mediocre stories in this collection as there are remarkable ones, &quot;For the Relief of Unbearable Urges&quot; is, at its best, the work of nascent literary genius, perhaps the beginning of a remarkable career.	2000-07-08

Andre  Aciman, the editor and author of both the Foreward (&quot;Permanent  Transients&quot;) and the first of the essays (&quot;Shadow City&quot;),  focuses on the theme of being an &quot;exile&quot; (as opposed to being an  &quot;expatriate&quot; or a &quot;refugee&quot; or an &quot;emigre&quot;).  Aciman suggests, in his Foreward, that &quot;[w]hat makes exile the  pernicious thing it is is not really the state of being away, as much as  the impossibility of ever not being away.&quot; He goes on to elaborate, in  his ensuing essay, that the exile is not just someone &quot;who has lost  his home; it is someone who can't find another, who can't think of  another.&quot; Aciman, impressionistically explores the way in which living  in a new city (New York) can vividly reincarnate the memories of cities in  which the exile has lived previously (the &quot;shadow cities&quot; of his  title). Aciman's essay is fascinating, perceptive and insightful; it is a  wonderful short piece which illustrates why his much-praised memoir,  &quot;Out of Egypt&quot;, has become a minor classic of the genre.   <br />Similarly, Bharati Mukherjee's essay, &quot;Imagining Homelands&quot;,  provides thoughtful elaborations on the nuances and connotations of the  words &quot;expatriate&quot;, &quot;exile&quot; and &quot;immigrant&quot;;  she draws fine and interesting distinctions among these words and carefully  entwines these distinctions with an elaboration of her own life  experiences.<br />The strongest essays in this collection, however, are those  of Eva Hoffman, Edward Said and Charles Simic. All three of these writers  provide classic insights into the experience of &quot;exile, identity,  language, and loss&quot; which are worth careful thought and consideration.   All threesuggest (as does Mukherjee when she describes herself as an  &quot;integrationist&quot; and a &quot;mongrelizer&quot;) that the exile  can only ultimately be redeemed by rejecting irrational devotion to the  narrow and myopic tribalism of nation, ethnicity, religion, and ideology  which so often encumbers the exile community; that redemption comes only  through freedom, reason and syncretism.  Thus, Simic writes, in concluding  his essay, &quot;Refugees&quot;, that the poet &quot;is a member of that  minority that refuses to be part of any official minority, because a poet  knows what it is to belong among those walking in broad daylight, as well  as among those hiding behind closed doors.&quot;<br />Hoffman's essay,  &quot;The New Nomads&quot;, is clearly the best of this collection.  She  carefully delineates the universality of the exilic experience, an  experience which can be found in the Ur-text of Adam and Eve's exile from  the Garden of Eden. She then discusses the way in which exile can magnify  the impulse to &quot;memorialize&quot; the past.  The result, she suggests,  is that exile distorts the vision of the past, tending to make it an  idealized &quot;mythic, static realm&quot; which forever impedes the  ability to deal with the present (what Hoffman perceptively characterizes  as the &quot;rigidity of the exilic posture&quot;). She then provides an  interesting discussion of A.B. Yehoshua's provocative essay, &quot;Exile as  Neurotic Solution&quot;, wherein he postulated that there were many  opportunities for the Jews (prior to the creation of the modern State of  Israel) to settle in Palestine more easily than in countries where they had  chosen to live, but it was the one location they avoided. In Hoffman's  words, &quot;[i]t was as if they were afraid precisely of reaching their  promised land and the responsibilities and conflicts involved in turning  the mythical Israel into an actual, ordinary home.&quot; The ultimate  result of the &quot;memorialization&quot; of the past and the  &quot;rigidity of the exilic posture&quot; is that exile communities often  cannot function in the locus of the larger society; rather, they conceive  of themselves as perpetually &quot;Other&quot;.  <br />Edward Said's essay,  &quot;No Reconciliation Allowed&quot;, describes the dislocation of the  exile in vivid terms: &quot;a Palestinian going to school in Egypt, with an  English first name, an American passport, and no certain identity at  all.&quot;  Thus, he finds himself in a secondary school where only English  is permitted to be spoken, even though none of the students is a native  speaker of English. While his entire educational experience is Anglocentric  in the extreme, he is also trained to understand he is a &quot;Non-European  Other&quot;, someone who can never aspire to being British in any true  sense of the word.  While Said has been criticized recently for allegedly  misrepresenting his past, he is quite forthcoming in this essay in  acknowledging his admiration for &quot;self-invention&quot;. In some sense,  Said's essay and the narrative of his life reflects his theory,  specifically the notion that we can (and do) use language instrumentally to  construct social realities (in this case the reality of his life). <br />While  somewhat uneven, as all collections are, &quot;Letters of Transit&quot;  ultimately provides a rich, varied and deeply insightful range of readings  on what it means to be an exile.	2000-07-05

While Fowlie's translations are workmanlike and somewhat unimaginative, they are generally faithful to the original French text.  Moreover, because the original French version and the English translation are on facing pages, the reader can easily compare Fowlie's translation with the reader's own understanding and interpretation of the French text.  In this respect, the book is particularly useful if you have some French fluency. <br />All translations are, by their nature, inauthentic since there is never a perfect correspondence between the resonant images and meanings of the original language and the new language into which a text is translated.  Translation is, as one critic has said, &quot;like kissing someone through a veil&quot;; the sensations (meanings) of the original are occluded by the translative process. Recognizing this inevitable deficiency, all that a reader can ask is that a translation approximate, as closely as possible, the linguistic meaning of the original.  Fowlie has achieved this, more so than many other translators of Rimbaud, who have corrupted the integrity of Rimbaud's original meanings by their own creative and symbolistic interpretive renderings.  <br />Fowlie also has provided solid translations of Rimbaud's important letters, particularly the letters of May, 1871, to George Izambard and Paul Demeny which articulate Rimbaud's precocious and iconoclastic aesthetic view of the role of the poet. If the book has any real shortcoming, it is the truncated and relatively unintersting biographical section and a lack of detailed notes. However, those failings can be excused by the fact that Wylie's book achieves its main objective--bringing a complete text of Rimbaud's poems to the English speaking world.  If you are studying Rimbaud and the biographical details of his early life, and you cannot read the original French, Wylie's collection is indispensable	2000-06-29

It struck me then, as it strikes me now upon re-reading it, as one of the most peculiarly funny  books I've ever read. It combines elements of original lunacy and weird  science with the resonating touchstones of a uniquely Irish comic  sensibility. The story is driven by the madcap schemes of a character named  De Selby, who describes himself as &quot;a theologist and a physicist,  sciences which embrace many others such as eschatology and  astrognosy.&quot;  De Selby invents a substance which removes all oxygen  from the atmosphere (a substance he calls &quot;DMP&quot;, the acronym for  the Dublin Metropolitan Police) and then discovers that a deoxygenated  atmosphere cancels the serial nature of time.  The plot moves on from  there, with Mick Shaughnessy, a &quot;lowly civil servant&quot;, engaging  the local constable to help him save the world from De Selby's scheme to  deoxygentate the world's atmosphere.  In the course of things, &quot;The  Dalkey Archive&quot; contains two of the funniest chapters ever written  (Chapters 4 and 9): one in which De Selby, Mick Shaughnessy and a drinking  companion named Hackett, clad in aqualungs, talk to Saint Augustine (his  &quot;Dublin accent was unmistakable&quot;) about arcane theological  doctrines and the Church Fathers in an underwater cave; the other in which  Sergeant Fottrell, the constable, explains to Mick his &quot;Mollycule  Theory&quot;, the theory that people's personalities become mixed up with  those of bicycles through the pounding of man and machine while pedaling  down bumpy Irish country roads (&quot;a process of prolonged carnal  intercussion&quot;).  Along the way, Mick discovers that James Joyce is  alive, well and bartending in the small coastal town of Skerries.  Need I  say more? &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot; is a work of startling wit and  originality, one of my comic favorites!	2000-06-28

But while this big, baggy eight-hundred page monstrosity of comic characters and  situations may lack a hero, it has two of the most memorable characters in  English literature: Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp. The contrapuntal,  shifting fortunes of these two women drive the narrative of this big book,  painting, along the way, a brilliant satirical portrait of English and  European society at the time of the Napoleonic wars. We first meet Amelia  and Becky in the opening pages of the novel, leaving Miss Pinkerton's  School for the wider world of fortune, love and marriage. Amelia Sedley,  the naive, sheltered daughter of a rich London merchant whose fortunes will  dramatically change over the course of her life, &quot;was a dear little  creature; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in novels, which (the  latter especially) abound in villains of the most sombre sort, that we are  to have for a constant companion so guileless and good-natured a  person.&quot; In contrast, Becky Sharp, the impoverished orphan of an  artist and a French opera singer of dubious repute, was a calculating,  amoral social climber. &quot;Miss Rebecca was not, then, in the least kind  or placable . . . but she had the dismal precocity of poverty.&quot; From  the opening pages, Thackeray captures the reader's interest in these two  characters and carries the reader through marriages, births, deaths,  poverty, misfortune, social climbing . . . even the Battle of Waterloo!  While Amelia and Becky wind like a long, contrasting thread from the  beginning to the end of this story, there are also plots and subplots,  intrigues and authorial asides, and one character after another, all of  this literary invention keeping the reader incessantly preoccupied and  enthralled. Reading &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is the furthest thing from  &quot;killing time&quot; (as the dusty,misguided literary critic F. R.  Leavis once said); it is, rather, the epitome of the nineteenth century  English comic novel, a masterpiece in every sense of the word.	2000-06-20

Yet, once he discovered Rimbaud, Miller  became obsessed with the poet's life and writing. &quot;I . . . could talk  of nothing but Rimbaud. Everybody who came to [my] house had to listen to  the song of Rimbaud . . . &quot;  The result of this obsession was &quot;The Time of the Assassins&quot;, a  complex, brilliant and imaginative reading of the connection between  Rimbaud's poetry and the engima of his life. Rimbaud is one of literature's  most fascinating figures. In less than four short years, before reaching  the age of twenty, he articulated a radical new view of the role of the  poet, wrote poems of startling imagination (including &quot;Le Bateau  Ivre&quot;, &quot;Une Saison en Enfer&quot; and &quot;Illuminations&quot;)  and lived a life of archetypal bohemian rebellion.  Rimbaud, in these few  years, became the precursor of both French symbolism and other literary  modernisms. For Miller, Rimbaud &quot;is the father of many schools and the  parent of none. It is his unique use of the symbol................&quot; Miller, in brilliant style and with penetrating  imagination, explores the foundational importance of the symbol in  Rimbaud's poetry and the way in which Rimbaud, by turning his back on the  writing of poetry after completing &quot;Une Saison en Enfer&quot;, made  his own life a symbol. In effect, Rimbaud's renunciation of the life of the  poet made him a &quot;living suicide&quot;. Miller links this act to a  broader poetic theory which he draws from Rimbaud--that poetry no longer  has efficacy in the modern world: &quot;At the very beginning of hiscareer  he understood what others understand at the end, if at all, ............. &quot; Rimbaud, rather than allow the purity of his poetic vision to be  compromised, chose &quot;a new form of madness--the desire for total  adaptation, total conformity.&quot; By doing so, Miller suggests, Rimbaud  lives the purity of a vision which can no longer be written: the poetic  work becomes the poet's life; &quot;Une Saison en Enfer&quot; becomes  Rimbaud's living hell. Miller's book is an original, penetrating and  brilliant interpretation of Rimbaud's life and a wonderful complement to  Enid Starkie's biography.	2000-06-19

Enid Starkie's biography of Rimbaud, published nearly forty years ago, still stands as both the definitive narrative of Rimbaud's life and a model  of literary biography. Rimbaud was a rebellious, enigmatic, brilliant, and  inscrutable poet who, in just four short years between the ages of sixteen  and twenty, wrote the poetry which has made him a figure of mythic  proportions, not only in French literature, but in the literature and  history of Modernism. Starkie, in brilliantly lucid prose and with loving  attention to every detail, tells Rimbaud's life story and connects that  story to the writing of the poems and the evolution of Rimbaud's views on  poetry and the task of the poet. Influenced by his studies of Kabbalah,  alchemy and illuminism, and writing in the long shadow of Baudelaire's  &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot;, Rimbaud precociously enunciated his attack  on the then dominant Parnassian school of French poetry at the tender age  of sixteen.  Starkie examines Rimbaud's original aesthetic doctrine in  great detail; in her words, the poet must discover a &quot;new language . .  . capable of expressing the ineffable, a new language not bound by logic,  nor by grammar or syntax.&quot; In Rimbaud's words, the &quot;Poet&quot;  must make himself a &quot;seer&quot; by a &quot;long, immense and  systematic derangement of all the senses.&quot; From this initial position,  Starkie brilliantly details Rimbaud's turbulent relationship with Paul  Verlaine and his descent into what one reviewer has aptly described as a  &quot;perpetual roister of absinthe, hashish and sodomy.&quot; Starkie  painstakingly relates Rimbaud's poetry to his experiences with Verlaine in  London and Paris. In particular, Starkie convincingly demonstrates, through  careful exegesis of the poems and their correspondences with Rimbaud's  letters and other biographical materials, that the  &quot;Illuminations&quot; (perhaps Rimbaud's most brilliant poems) were  written over several years preceding and following &quot;Une Saison en  Enfer&quot;.  Starkie then goes on to demonstrate that the latter prose  poems were hardly intended to be Rimbaud's &quot;farewell to literature in  general, but only to visionary literature.&quot; In other words, &quot;Une  Saison en Enfer&quot; represents the rejection by Rimbaud of his original  mind-bending iconoclasm--the liquidation &quot;of all his previous dreams  and aspirations&quot;--in favor of a rational and materialist aesthetics.  Of course, after completing &quot;Une Saison en Enfer&quot;, Rimbaud's life  moved in completely different directions and there is, unfortunately, no  existing evidence that he continued his poetic endeavor after the age of  twenty. Starkie's biography captures the details of the remainder of  Rimbaud's life--he died at the age of thirty-seven--with fascinating and  attentive detail. And the remainder of his life, as related by Starkie, is  a biography in itself--vagabond in Europe, sailor to the East Indies, gun  runner and (slave?) trader in Abyssinia, and mysterious cult hero of the  emerging French symbolist movement. Indeed, in 1888, more than fourteen  years after Rimbaud's known literary career had ended, he received a letter  from a prominent Parisian editor: &quot;You have become, among a little  coterie, a sort of legendary figure . . . This little group, who claim you  as their Master, do not know what has become of you, but hope you will one  day reappear, and rescue them from obscurity.&quot; Starkie scrutinizes all  of these events with scrupulous attention to detail and accuracy. This is  truly a classic of literary biography! (One additional comment: Rimbaud's  poetry and letters are quoted extensively in the original French.  If you  are not fluent in French, you should have Wallace Fowlie's English  translation of Rimbaud's Complete Works and Selected Letters by your side  as a reference.)	2000-06-14

This big, rich multicultural cacophony of a novel is a modern comic masterpiece  that brilliantly captures the mixture and conflict of races, ethnicities,  cultures, and beliefs in London at the millenium. Moreover, unlike other  British writers who sometimes seem condescending and unabashedly full of  themselves (Martin Amis and Salman Rushdie immediately come to mind), Zadie  Smith's writing is full of good humor and prescient insight into the value  of even the most disparate life experiences.  Smith anchors her story  around the unlikely friendship of an easy-going, seemingly unflappable  working-class Englishman, Archibald Jones, and a deep-thinking, serious  Bengali Muslim waiter, Samad Iqbal.  The two first meet inside a tank in  the waning days of World War II.  They then reunite thirty years later in  North London, two unsuccessful middle aged men living out their lives in  O'Connell's Poolroom, &quot;an Irish poolroom run by Arabs with no pool  tables.&quot;  But while the stories of Archie and Samad anchor the  narrative, their relationship is only a small part of this  hilarious and  deeply insightful novel.  Zadie Smith, in reviewing her own novel in the  British publication Butterfly, described White Teeth as &quot;the literary  equivalent of a hyperactive, ginger-haired tap-dancing ten-year-old.&quot;   The amazing thing is that her description is accurate, for we get not  merely the story of the unlikely pair of Archie and Samad, but also many  other amusing and intersecting stories, all of them driven by the clash of  culture, belief, race, traditon, lineage, and science which forms the  turmoil which marks London, and all of the Western world's major cities, at  the millenium.  We get the story of Archie's young Jamaican  wife, Clara,  and of Clara's mother, Hortense, a devout and rapturous Jehovah's Witness.   We get the story of Samad's turbulent relationship with his wife, Alsana,  as well as Samad's struggle to raise his two twin sons, Millat and Magid,  in the face of a materialist culture that pervades and undermines  traditionalism of all kinds. We get the story of Marcus and Joyce Chalfen,  one a geneticist and the other a  pop horticulturist, and their son, Josh.  The Chalfens are unstintingly secular, scientific and self-centered  celebrants of their own ideology of &quot;Chalfenism&quot;. Finally, we get  the story of Irie, the awkward daughter of Archie and Clara, who winds  through the novel, its characters and situations, searching for an identity  in the tangled history of her Jamaican past and the crowded cultural stew  of her North London present. In Smith's words, capturing the essence of her  novel in a couple of sentences: &quot;It is only this late in the day that  you can walk into a playground and find Isaac Leung by the fish pond, Danny  Rahman in the football cage, Quang O'Rourke bouncing a basketball and Irie  Jones humming a tune.  Children with first and last names on a direct  collision course.&quot;  Believe everything you've read and heard about  this novel because it's true: this is the best first novel to be published  in a long time!	2000-06-01

US	38955473	R3P7S4MXM4KA4J	0822314452	289161002	Rimbaud and Jim Morrison: The Rebel as Poet	Books	2	17	18	N	N	An Interesting Memoir Padded with Derivative Commentary	Wallace Fowlie, a French scholar, translator and commentator on many French poets, has written this short book on the connections between the lives and writings of Rimbaud and Morrison, two symbols of youthful,  creative rebellion who lived more than a century apart.  Unfortunately,  while the short memoir of how Fowlie first came to connect these two  figures is interesting and worthy of a short journalistic piece, the bulk  of this book contains nothing more than truncated and regurgitated  biographical sketches of Rimbaud and Morrison and disparate commentary on  some of their writing.  Fowlie, who published an English translation of  Rimbaud's collected poems in 1966, first heard of Morrison when he received  a letter from him in 1968 thanking him for the English translation.   Morrison implied that Rimbaud was an important writer for him: &quot;I  don't read French that easily . . . I am a rock singer and your book  travels around with me.&quot;  Fowlie didn't know of Morrison until, many  years later, he heard some of the music and lyrics of The Doors and  recognized the influence of Rimbaud on the writing of Morrison.  Fowlie's  memoir relates how his discovery of these connections led to a series of  lectures on Rimbaud and Morrison, lectures which were (not surprisingly!)  received with enthusiasm and interest by his young college students at Duke  and elsewhere. Fowlie's discussion of Rimbaud's poetry, in addition to  being cursory, can only be understood with a copy of his poems close at  hand; without reading the poems in their entirety, Fowlie's commentary is  largely unintelligible.  With respect to Morrison, Fowlie does nothing more  than regurgitate biographical details gleaned from other authors and  discuss a few of Morrison's poems.  Again, understanding the discussion of  the poems suffers if you don't have the texts of Morrison's poems  available.  While Fowlie's prose is wonderful and his brief anecdote of the  way that Morrison and Rimbaud connected in Fowlie's own life interesting,  the bulk of the book in unremarkable and derivative.	2000-05-27

His parents, both raised in Jewish homes (one devoutly  orthodox and the other largely secular) by first-generation immigrants from  Russia and Poland, reach adulthood during the turbulent years of World War  II.  Both his father and his mother grapple with their Jewish tradition and  their personal religious beliefs and, ultimately, become converts to Roman  Catholicism.  Like many converts, the decision by Stephen's parents to  adopt a new religion is not made lightly and results in a deeply didactic  religious practice.  Stephen grows up in a home where devout Catholic  religious practice is the norm and where little is ever mentioned about the  Jewish tradition his parents have rejected.  As an adult, Stephen embarks  on his own religious search, inheriting the same &quot;turbulent soul&quot;  that had so deeply marked his parents' lives.  Dubner aptly quotes John  Henry Newman, the famous Anglican cardinal who converted to Roman  Catholicism, who says, &quot;who can know himself and the multitude of  subtle influences which act upon him.&quot;  He then explores, in  wonderfully clear and readable prose, the many subtle influences which  marked his parents' soul-searching religious struggles, as well as his own.   Dubner's exploration leads him to learn more about his parents and their  lives, the history of his family and its Eastern European Jewish roots,  and, ultimately, to an understanding and reconciliation with his mother,  who maintains her firm Catholic convictions to the end, even as Dubner  returns to the Jewish faith of his grandparents.  Ultimately, Dubner's  memoir has an important message--that every individual who has a  &quot;turbulent soul&quot; and seeks religious faith must be accorded the  respect and autonomy of his or her beliefs.  It is a message for parents,  for children,and for members of all faiths: do not become so certain of  your own religious &quot;truth&quot; that you alienate and reject the  sincere, but different, beliefs of others.  As Dubner says at the end of  his narration of the struggle of three turbulen souls, &quot;[i]f I am sure  of one thing about God, it is that our most brilliant ideas about Him are  sheer guesswork.&quot;	2000-05-17
