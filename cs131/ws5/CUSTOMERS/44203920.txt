(how convient.)<BR>i don't believe pagan is the only form of witchcraft and i think one could use this in witchcraft however  this book doesn't discribe any traditional practice of witchcraft it's just the author putting together a &quot;stewpot&quot; of magical elements into one single book	2002-10-06

NOT &quot;if you do anything not pretty and to my liking your throwing the entire religion out of balance.&quot;  <BR>if you want the &quot;look at me i'm a witch and pretty in pink&quot; get scott cunninghams &quot;wicca for a solitary practitioner&quot;  if you want the true wicca craft you need look no further. forget those who claim it looks satanic, this covers everything you need to know about wicca	2002-10-03
