Sugar Ain't Sweet is a novel about how some relationships start off with butterflies, roses and birds singing; then it all ends.  In the case for Bernard, the end was signified by his need to pursue his life long dream as a writer.  Bernard has loved his wife, Simone, since high school but after immersing successfully in his first career, he decided to finally write a book.  The writing of the book takes away a lot of personal time from Simone and she feels neglected.  Eventually the relationship appears to be over, especially when Simone meets a man more attentive to her needs as a woman.  Bernard also meets a woman, Kathleen, with the press, who is more attentive to his needs as a new author.  <br /><br />Because of the two newly developed relationships outside of marriage, coupled with Simone's and Bernard's stress with having a mentally ill son, the relationship totters on the realm of divorce.  But, through all of the mistakes made, the pain caused, a new beginning is made inside of Simone (baby) and love prevails. <br /><br />Sugar Ain't Sweet was a decent read.  The language was a bit corny at times and the dialogue wasn't unique but it did touch on the stresses that a couple can experience when the time for life long dreams need to be fulfilled. <br /><br />Reviewer: NM	2003-10-01

Dark Recesses is a novel about recovering your past family's history.  <BR>David Jackson is intent on discovering his family history before an upcoming family reunion. But, what he finds is more disturbing than he anticipated.  He always wondered where his fair complexion came from and upon arrival in rural Virginia; he notices that his southern cousins are darker-skinned, making him more curious.  The more he pondered questions towards distant relatives, the more he was confused by the anger and silence told by them to conceal the truth.  <br /><br />The book had a lot of boring moments and too much drama!   I felt that the author was over doing it with excessively trying to create why the family chooses to subdue in the \\"dark recesses\\" of their minds the family secrets. But, at the same time, before getting to the crux of the book, Beamon's dialogue was drawn out too much. -NM	2003-10-01

It involves a pre-teen girl growing up in a world without guidance at a crucial time in her young life when she really needs one.  Her mother cannot be there for her when she is dealing with issues because she is dealing with her own depressing life.  Tre's brother, who seems to be in search of the same guidance but on a different level, also isn't the one person she can lean on. Even though she knows right from wrong, the antagonist continues to reach out for love from anyone who will give it to her, just like her own searching friends.<br />Reminiscent of The Coldest Winter Ever by Sistah Souljah, Premature Pleasures was written in contemporary language where anyone, adults and youths, can relate to the situations, especially those young girls contemplating which way to go in life.  I really enjoyed this novel because of the realness of the problems teenagers are facing today.  Mrs. Rhone did an excellent job on developing the characters into people whom we can relate.  I, at times, sympathized with Tre because she had an innate leader-type quality within her but she didn't realize that her independence was all that she needed at times. Most importantly, I enjoyed how Trekela made it through all of her tribulations with issues of sex, trying to fit in with a crowd, reaching out for love, but yet, still found God in the end through her \\"angel\\" that saw herself in Trekela, Ms. Denise.  <br />-NM	2002-11-15

Hampton has missed the mark with her debut novel, \\"Like She Knows Single\\" (1stBooks, May 2002).<br />The premise of the book is about how a sister handles being almost thirty and still single. A great topic, which could have been enhanced by a better storyline and slightly improved characters. The main character who is only known as Nala, is as poorly underdeveloped as the going-nowhere-fast scenes that just seem to fall off the page.<br />Also, the huge inconsistencies made this novel a less-than-pleasant read. For example, when running down her list of attributes, Nala includes a high-profile job (the author fails to give a title or description of this job), simultaneously she's budgeting in a $12.50 cover charge to a comedy club and once even had to choose between paying the cover charge and buying gas for her Honda. HUH? Show me the money! Amongst other things, the sometimes-whiny Nala complains about having no time for a belly dancing class that she really wants to take, but she has plenty of time to lock herself in her apartment for days in a self-induced pitiful funk.<br />I will give Hampton credit for creating a main character that was as unlikable as she was unbelievable. Critical of almost everything and everyone-the abilities of a young preacher, an older woman's fashion, and even the unshaven legs of a female parishioner-I suppose this was Nala's attempt at being a snob, but her foul mouth and often uncouth behavior leaves her looking petty and maliciously critical instead.<br />This character was as shallow and dim-witted as any cynical person yielding a post-grad degree could be. She claims to be looking for a mature man with an education and professional status, money, good looks, material possessions-yet, Nala doesn't have much of this to bring to the table herself.<br />And of course, where is she looking for these poster-board men? At the hoochie-bumping, rump-shaking night clubs and washed up comedy clubs that she frequents. On more thana few occasions, I found myself yelling at the pages, \\"Girl, get a clue!\\"<br />And alas, finally she does. ...	2002-08-08

Paris enlists the help of his friend Fearless Jones to help him find Ms. Love and who burned his store.<br /><br />After, the first few chapters of the book the plot becomes very confusing and difficult to read.

Little did their friends and family realize that these two were on the verge of a divorce until Wes is killed in a tragic accident while changing a flat tire for a stranger. Before he dies Wes tells Madison that the child who was in the accident was his daughter and made her promise to take care of her. Hurt and in shock by Wes' confession she agree to raise little Manda as her own. With the help of Wes' friend Zachary Holman she struggles to put her life back on track and raise Manda. <BR><br />Madison was truly a strong black woman who put her anger aside to raise another woman's child after she lost her own baby. Although she was hurt and angry at her husband she did her best not to take that pain out on Manda who was just as much a victim as she was. <BR><br />Wes Reed was spoiled rich boy who got what he wanted. He used Manda's mother and Madison to get what he wanted not thinking how he could have jeopardized his own future with his wife. Its sad the way he confessed to having a child with another woman and expected his wife to just take her in. Even if Wes lived I think he would have went on using Manda's mother and probably would have never told Madison about his affair.<BR><br />Zachary Holman was Madison's hero in disguise. He was always there when she needed him no matter what. But his secret's almost cost him a future with the woman he loved....Madison.<BR><br />This book was an excellent read. Once you get over the shock of Wes' affair you cannot put this book down. The relationship between Gordon (Madison's boss and friend)  and Camille the social worker did not take away from the story. In fact it only makes you want to finish the story to see what happens with their May/December relationship.

It starts off with why she goes into the military, how she met the fathers of her three children, and her unsuccessful relationships with men. Although her character was easily led astray and she had a few undesirable friends she was good at one thing.... the military. Sandie's goal was completing Officer Candidate School so that she could make a better life for her children. Sandie had many things going for her until she met Drill Sergeant Romulus Caesar.   Roumulus was an unhappily married man with two children who pursues Sandie until she finally gives up and falls in love with him. Sandie actually believe Romulus was everything she wanted in a man.... until he finds out that she is pregnant. Romulus was nothing a dog. He thought of himself as a king who took care of his castle but wasn't man enough to stand by Sandie when she needed him. His character was extremely weak. He acted heartbroken and upset because he left his children to be with Sandie but didn't do much to when it came to getting custody of his children. He only felt guilty about how poorly he treated Sandie when he thought she was almost killed in an accident. In my opinion, Sandie could have done bad all by herself.  <BR><br />The book has potential to be better than it was. I didn't think of Sandie and Romulus as two people in a loving relationship but as two people who enjoyed good sex. Neither Romulus nor Sandie knew anything about \\"real\\" love.  <BR><br />This book also pulls you into too many places. It talks about her mother, her ill father, a brother who died with AIDS, and a sister who is HIV positive...what happened to Rom and Sandie's story??? If these other people were removed from the story and more focus placed Rom and Sandie, it would have been a better novel.  -JeT	2002-07-25

Ever After is a story about Nick a twenty something Seattle native who resides in New York. The love of Nick's life is Jasmine. Nick and Jasmine have been together for two and half in a somewhat good relationship. All this changes when Jasmine turns down Nick's marriage proposal leaving poor Nick sad and extremely hurt. Nick decides to move to Chicago after receiving a job offer fromHarris Bank. Angered and hurt after being rejected Nick moves to Chicago to start a new job and pursue his MBA at DePaul University.While there Nick tries to get over Jasmine by meeting the many women of Chicago. <BR>With every woman he meets, his thoughts are constantly on Jasmine, which makes getting over her harder than he ever expected.<BR>I think this book was an easy read once you get over being \\"upset\\" with Jasmine turning down Nick's marriage proposal.  Nick was one of the rare \\"good guys\\" you read about in so many novels. He wanted what I think what all of want: a loving relationship with someone from the opposite sex. Nick wore his emotions on the sleeve of his shirt. In the book it seems that Nick did everything thing right so my question is why didn't she accept the marriage proposal? Did Nick dog herin the relationship? The book did not answer any of this for me, which was a disappointment. (Hopefully her reason for turning him down will be revealed later in the second or third part of this series)  Every woman he was with couldn't compare to what he and Jasmine had which is probably why none of them lasted long. It was like Jasmine was PERFECTION and could do no wrong.<BR>Nick talks about his so called sex cardinal rules of dating....which he BROKE!!! What was the point of all that?  The best thing that ever happened to Nick was his friend Maya T.  Although Nick did not pursue a relationship with her I think his close friendship with her rallied him to get over Jasmine. <BR>What I wanted to happen the most in the book was for Jasmine to explain why she turned down his proposal of marriage?? Jasmine appeared to be the bad person in the whole relationship because when Mr. Jackson talks about Nick's relationship with her it was as if Nick did everything RIGHT!!! He was romantic, respectful, loving, and caring but I guess that wasn't enough for Jasmine.I felt like Jasmine didn't appreciate a good man like Nick and probably didn't deserve him anyway. But then you wonder maybe she had a reason for turningdownNick...whoknows.<BR>In conclusion on a scale of one to five I give this book a four because I thought Nick was little too sensitive and Jasmine's character could have had more dialogue. I think thisis agreatnovelfrom Mr. Jackson and hope to read more of his work.  -JaT	2002-04-17

Shattered Souls is a page-turning novel that I finished in two days! On the surface, the four main characters appear to be either ruthless sex-fiends, a passive beauty or a peer counselor who has answers for everyone but himself.  But soon the novels uncovers the core of the characters and then you understand why they have become what they are.  The \\"monsters\\" that they have created within themselves begin to churn deep in their souls, causing them to re-evaluate their actions so that they can move on in life.  One by one, they all answer to themselves for their past mistakes and find peace.  <br />Britton Landers runs away from his problems to the Dominican Republic but finally decides to face his past ghosts from childhood that made him begin to run in the first place.  Indera Fleet, my girl because she gave cheating men what they deserved, is true and real to everyone but somehow she lied and degraded herself with her vengeful nature. Now, I gotta admit, she gave some people what they deserved but she took it to the extreme.  We all know a Damascus Miles (well maybe some of us) but this brother finally realizes why he had to have one woman coming in and another going out the back door.  Chyna Littles character bored me until she got with \\"the real\\" and stepped up to her ungrateful, psychotic daughter only after her daughter scratched the surface of a festering wound within her by calling her white. <br />Definitely a must-read if you enjoy racy, suspenseful novels that have you laughing at one moment and surprised and disgusted the next.  -NM	2001-10-17

In His Ex-Wife's Shadow is a novel about a compassionate woman, Angela, who has reached her breaking point with her boyfriend/lover, Steven. Steven is a self-centered, arrogant doctor whom just can't trust women due to his mother's premature death and wife's manipulating behavior, in which he deserves. He finally finds himself alone after realizing Angela has left him for a more equal partner in life, Kenneth. In the meantime, a love affair develops between Angela's best friend, Pam, and Steven's best friend, Ben. Shadow is a bit encouraging for relationships because its other plot is about older Black women finally finding a deserving love in their lives.<br />The book ended with Angela finally telling Steven that she is no longer going to take his behavior or anything else from him. In fact, most of the book was about Angela coincidentally avoiding Steven to officially resolve their hurtful relationship. This should have happened a lot sooner rather than on the last page of the novel.<br />This book was a little slow at times, but enjoyable. From the title, I expected it to carry more of a twisted plot, but didn't. In other words, I kept expecting more to happen between Angela and Steven. Instead their was a game of &quot;dodge ball&quot; between the main characters and was rarely any direct communication between the two. I did enjoy how the author discreetly made the readers understand why Steven acts the way that he does-he believed his mother left him on purpose, his wife was a &quot;gold-digger&quot; looking for that prized doctor to marry and won, and his infidelity with Judy Edward, another gold-digger, that faked being pregnant for money. In fact, Steven's ways made him attract the wrong women like flies on sh...sugar!<br />On the other hand, Angela had been &quot;played&quot; by Steven but yet, she was a caring person, who gave and gave more to the people that surrounded her. She did not use being lied to or hurt as an excuse to make other people miserable. -NM	2001-09-05

Sunday Brunch satisfies more than the appetite, it's an opportunity for female friends to stay connected also to experience individual personal growth. I enjoyed the clear crisp dialect; the descriptive language paints a vivid picture for the imagination. This book is full of colorful characters and well as colorful designer fashion. I was able to see one woman's faith in God believe in five women and maintain the friendships. All women have a certain amount of confusion in their lives. Black women have their share of difficulties in career love and religious conviction. The author makes use of characters with real and diverse personalities. I see the meaning of true friendship in this novel. One woman who, not only shares guidance and encouragement but also shares hope, intended for friends to heal and move on! -VE<br />(Dallas Club selection: April 2001)	2001-09-05

I respect this brother for putting his heart and soul on the line.  His feelings are sincere and honest to a fault.  I am not used to a man showing his vulnerability.  I was told that to be in love means to be vulnerable at times.<br />I can say that I felt an array of emotions while reading Cooper's semi-autobiographical novel.  It was like being on an emotional roller coaster.  There were times when I felt a love/hate emotions simultaneously for each particular character.  This novel is not shallow. It has meaning and depth. The more you put into this novel the more you will get out of it.<BR> <BR>In my opinion, Mr. Cooper wants healing and the only way to find healing is to do some soul searching.  I pray that he finds healing and direction.  <br />Reviewer: VE	2001-09-02

It spans a 100 year time frame and does a good job of mixing in relevant pieces of real history.

The Shirt Off His Back was a wonderful novel that I would readily recommend to any book club for reading enjoyment. The story line consists of the protagonist, Terry Winston, with twins, in a profound relationship with a woman, Jacqueline Roger, who has twins also. The twins are the result of a relationship Terry had with the selfish and manipulative, Catherine, the protagonist, in college who did not want to proceed with her pregnancy because her future career and potential power were more important. Catherine moved to Spain and, indeed, became very successful but hit \\"the glass ceiling\\" only because the Spanish culture values family life. Catherine did not demonstrate her motherly instincts with her children living separately from her in the United States. Jackie stood by her man through it all, while dealing with issues of her weight.  -NM	2001-07-30

It was easy to see the authors style and personality in the main character and that added to my interest in the character since I met the author in person at his signing.  I also liked the ensemble cast of characters which made the story realistic.  The most interesting thing about the story was the fact that for a change the man was the one wearing his heart on his sleeve and pushing for a commitment and the women was the aloof free spirit who didn't want to be tied down.  This would be a good book club read - I think it would generate a lively relationship discussion.  -ES	2001-07-20
