She was actually a bit of a bitch and I cannot ever imagine a woman like that having the friends and boyfriend as described in the book. And, what is it about chick lit novels and the following identical plotline:<br /><br />Girl meets boy. They hit it off (at party/bumping into each other, etc)<br /><br />Girl doesn't see boy for a while but *thinks* of him.<br /><br />Girl's friends (or boss, or mother) 'drag' her along to 'weekend' or 'party' to meet this guy, who girl thinks is definately going to be a loser--he's a brother or an earl or a son of someone. Ugh.<br /><br />Loser turns out to be boy.<br /><br />Cue happily ever after.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but that doesn't ever ever ever happen in real life and i'd love a novel which depicts real life love stories for once (which are far more interesting)<br /><br />Good job but she misses the point way too many times.	2004-08-14

(I won't even go into how the church has treated women)<br /><br /> Its nothing new, yet Dan Brown has managed to put it all into a work of fiction to appeal to the masses. Personally, I agree with all of the theories but thats *not important* when it comes to reviewing this book.<br /><br /> The writing is nothing more than ordinary, and I dare say i'd have appreciated him just jotting all his theories down in document form rather than a hocking work of fiction.<br /><br /> The first chapter was well done but by the middle of the book I was bored, confused and aggrivated by his writing style--'and then, and then he smiled, and then she did this, and then they did that...' and dan Brown's obsession with naming &quot;Harvard&quot; every few pages made my eyes roll back into my head.<br /><br /> Saying that, however, my interest was kept piqued throughout the novel, and I managed to finish it, no more knowledgeable then I was before but definately enlightened. If only Donna Tartt had written this.	2004-08-07

I liked this book a lot--I read it in 24 hours, and  my mind was enraptured in Kate and Anna's story. However, there were too many characters I didn't care at all about, and some of the plot devices and skills Ms. Picoult used made me cringe.<br />I thought the character narratives of Campbell and Julia ridiculous--I didn't give a crap if they got together, slept together, broke up, she sobbed, they get back together...what? Who cares?? <br />I was more interested in *why* Anna wanted to file this lawsuit. I find that a sister rejecting to help her sister out as a doner intriguing--mainly because if my sister needed anything, I would give it to her in a heartbeat.<br />Anna's intent is explained at the end, but even then the readers aren't given enough to chew on. The pacing is good, the suspense is good, the emotion is realistic and the ending blew me away, but I felt this novel could have been fine tuned, polished and given a bit more guts. I read somewhere Jodi Picoult writes two novels a year, maybe this is why at times it felt rushed and contrived. <br />Good--but definately not, as Jodi Picoult so 'modestly' titled this book, 'this year's Sophie's Choice&quot; (As written on her website)	2004-05-07

Jodi's books have good plots, a twist, a nice legal battle and enough emotion thrown in to make for a great beach read. It aint literature, however, nor will it change your life. Second Glance was just that--good, but not great, it didn't flow that well (I could pinpoint structure and plot changes and character set-ups, sometimes it was like reading an example from an eleventh grade writing class) and the predictable love story was unbelievable and boring and just 'ugh' inducing.

I admire James Patterson for writing a completely different genre from the norm, that shows courage and talent, and he doesn't do a terrible job. <br />I was just unimpressed by the layers and layers of shmaltz and sugary sweetness and bitter sweetness (my teeth hurt) of the inevitable--woman has heart problem, has wonderful brave husband, beautiful gorgeous gorgeous child lives on perfect island, smiles, laughter, perfect, tears, happiness, friends who are perfectly placed to be *there* no interruptions, problems, and just descriptions of perfect apartments, pets, houses...<br />In one word: unrealistic.<br />I couldn't believe the world James painted here. Instead of writing about the simple, subtle complexities of true happiness and love (done wonderfully by authors such as Anita Shreve, Charles Frazier, Judy Blume or Barbara Kingsolver) he wrote a paper-thin story better suited for Mills and Boon type authors. There was no depth to ANY of the characters, least of all Katie and all the pop-culture name dropping she did. There was no *real* problem for Katie, or Matt (how many Matts were there anyway?) just the timely, perfectly situated Suzanne mystery (though not hard to figure out)<br />Has about the same contents as cheeze wiz, or popcorn. Not for the reader looking for something with a bit of oomph or a real display of love. I recommend the authors above for that.	2004-01-24

So does the rest of the literature world, it would seem. Her books capture me, make me emotional and I can't (usually) put them down. Practical Magic was no exception. But i've realized I can only take Alice in small doses before I start rolling my eyes. She lays on the 'beautiful descriptions' a bit, and lately, i've been picking &quot;Local Girls&quot; up and snorting at the ridiculousness of it all. I couldn't finish it.<br /> I *know* Alice has broken the 'literature fiction/women's genre with her mystical writing, but I think she could still manage to write in that way without making some of the characters and relationships so darn unrealistic. <br />I find offense that a man would just cry at the sight of a beautiful woman and ask her to marry him, without knowing if she was a total lunatic--men aren't *that* dumb. So, ugly simpletonoes with wonderful personalities aren't exotic enough to write about?<br />Alice's view of beauty is narrow-minded: what about beauty on the inside? Her heroines seem to grace an incredible beauty, but no brains and they're usually not very likeable or funny, (except for Gretel in Local Girls) yet men still fall at their feet. And all the sobbing they do when they 'glance at a violet bush' and the 'moon is so silvery it...' etc etc. I love most of her writing, but I do wish she wouldn't make it so ludicrously unrealistic. It feels like i'm reading a Mills and Boon sometimes with all the fawning over pretty girls.	2004-01-11

This book, like for instance Charles Frazier's \\"Cold Mountain\\" breaks a new genre--its hard to categorize, and for that alone it is wonderful.<br />A lot of people have complained this book is too 'childish' or 'boring' and I want to give them a slap! I digress, of course I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinions and I respect everyone's opinions, but sometimes I do think people overlook or simply just can't see the beauty and truth that lies in this novel by legendary childrens and teens author, Judy Blume. <br />First off, this is not a book for children--Judy Blume stated this quite clearly in many interviews, and it isn't. I wouldn't want my twelve year old reading it. Its full of sex but not in the 'romance book filler' kind of way, its real, its experiences most of us can read and reminince about.<br />I first read this when I was fourteen, and six years later I still not only relate to it but i'm still wrapped up in Vix, Caitlin, their families, friends and adventures. The genre is time-old classic, but I don't think it is really told very well by the authors who turn out 'women friendship' books fifty times a year.  <br />The story itself, two women, best friends (although certainly its not a healthy relationship) who compete with each other, who love each other, who are jealous of each other's husbands for having a part of them they can never have (but not in the sexual way) but who have grown up together and know each other better then they thought is a story every second woman can relate too if not entirely but partly. I have given a copy to two of my best friends, who in turn have given it to their friends or sisters or mothers. <br />This novel isn't just about sex and friendship. Its about family, college, growing up, death, loving a place so much you can't breathe, making choices, learning and growing from your choices and loving a friend who is intent on self destruction. It may seem simple at first, but it will stay with you, nurture youand grow with you, until you too find yourself thinking about Caitlin's stepmom Abby, Vix's crush Bru, ot Vix's disabled  brother Nathan, or the loveable Gus, and especially the mysterious Caitlin.<br />Read it on the beach, and let those feelings of nostalgia flow over you like water--and drift off to Martha's Vineyard and get wrapped up in Caitlin and Vix, summer sisters.	2004-01-02

It was readable--because of its simplicity and realistic tenure--but there was something missing--ahh thats right, the ability to like the main character. I hated Clare. I just hated her--cruel, vindictive, a 'user' of Sally (whom I actually liked) and Sally's lifestyle, Clare wasn't even likeable as the 'underdog' she was just...flat and boring.<br />By the end of the book I was quizzical why Sally and Clare were still even friends at all. I guess to that point it was realistic. But the book left a lot to be desired--there was no beauty, no emotion that tied me down. It was dialogue, this happened, that happened, I felt that... Clare narrated so that could have been the problem. I also didn't give a rat's about Sally's father's 'secretive' business. Who cares? Why is it Clare's business? <br />Basically, it was 'okay' but I will never read it again. <br />I fully recommend \\"Summer Sisters\\" by Judy Blume if you want to read a touching, beautiful, and very realistic account of two best friends and their two different lives and the ties that keep them together--instead of fake emotion about a fake friendship which never should have been written about.	2003-06-02

I read it the whole way through and it kept me interested I can give it that--largely because it was funny, juicy and I reckon most or all of the characters in the book are from real-life, in Candaces' drug induced New York life, but puh-lease, 'waaa poor me, so rich, so neurotic, so beautiful.' In the end this book is about mean, selfish, pig-headed men and women who rule New York society and I am so glad I think life is more than going to a cool bar, having sex with hundreds of men, taking copius amounts of drugs and stressing over which  bag goes with my new Manolo Blahink shoes.

(Emily Bronte) The author has admitted to basing \\"here on earth\\" on Wuthering heights and no, this isn't a `crime' of any sort. The fact she so cheaply based it on a beautiful, haunting love story about a weak man and a manipulative girl (Classic) and ripped the plot twists to oomph up her fickle story is [weak]. The characters are so NOT Heathcliff and Catherine...if you're going to copy an old novel  (Bridget Jones did it terrifically with Pride and Prejudice...and dare I say Clueless the movie with Emma) then at least make the character of the same bloody characteristics. Heathcliff was not a soulless monster; Kathy wasn't some pushover who lived for Heathcliff.  It's criminal. Hollis is a horrible man and March is a stupid woman who actually abandons her daughter. Who cares if it's `haunting' and set in New England and has phrases like, `the moon was full' and the plot is Wuthering Heights: 2000? It's awful!

The Greek Tragic comparisons (The five students in the book are studying the Greek Classics excusively) are actually very good--incest, deceit, greed, cold blooded murder... and the characters and the murder is creepy in a good way.

Tsk tsk Jackie	Jackie didn't even try!The so-called 'chemistry' between *anyone* was lacking (Especially main characters Lara and Joey) Joey was a stupid, self centred, rude, pathetic and 'usual' square jawed/romance novel 'hero' who thinks he's so hot, and i hated him. <br />Sorry to break it to you jackie, but there's a new breed in town, and it consists of being sweet, funny and at least a guy with a good nature if he's going to go and do all the stuff he did in the book. Lara was a snivelling wuss, all the men and women were boring and flat and the plot has been done to death in some of your stories. I wasted $12 on this book to which i regret. Read her better stuff, like 'hollywood wives'. give this one a skip	2001-05-06
US	45672854	R1CGWXCVM229N4	0316769487	862964341	The Catcher in the Rye	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Interesting	For a book written in the 50's--well, it's pretty 'goddamn' good and courageous. I suppose it was the first of it's kind--a realsitic view into the typical adolescent. after all, we aren't all perfect straight-a straight thinking kids. I liked it for it's honesty and it was funny, sweet and beautiful at parts, too.Holden Caulfiend is the biggest dweeb, though, oh my god. An interesting, vivid character, though. I recommend you read it...just to see	2001-04-30

I was sucked in from the first page and I felt as if i experienced everything she did, right up until the last page when I was finally released from the book's chilling hold...	2001-04-02

By the time i had finished, I had cried three times, giggled profusely, gritted my teeth in anger towards Willie Jack, smiled at Novalees naivety and her wonderful new friends, and laid frozen, transfixed and fascinated as the story rolled out. If you loved Summer Sisters, you will adore this novel. Brilliant.	2001-03-01

Sure, this may not be 'literature' but it's a nostaligc, romantic memoir about two women, Vix and Caitlin, both so different who are both very close until Caitlin comes up with a manipulative ploy which has Vix wondering just who is this girl? Fast forward eight years and Caitlin is marrying Vix's 'man'...what's with this? Sad, funny and poignant, i enjoyed this book immensely.	2001-02-25
