So... <br />I purchased this short western at a thrift store for 75 cents, and found it to be a pretty decent book for the price and the unknown author. While reading it, I looked for distinctions of Tom W. Blackburn's writing style. The writing is quite detailed and well put throughout, and is somewhat reminiscent of Elmer Kelton. However, the novel can be quite slow at times, and you might find yourself putting the book down and finding something more interesting to do. Eventually though, it does pick up and you will read on. I also noticed that Blackburn has an aversion to dialogue! Dialogue between characters is quite infrequent in this book, and when there is a small amount of interaction, it is only in one or two sentence phrases. It is also not very realistic dialogue. Besides these points, \\"Navajo Canyon\\" is a solid western work, captivating you at the action scenes and keeping the plot moving along.  <br />     The best way to obtain this book is to buy it used somewhere, or at least new for a low price. It is definitely not the best western book I have read, (far from it), but is a decent book and well worth a read. Happy searching! <br /> <br />	2005-08-30

This is a wonderful book containing hundreds of classic, vintage horror and ghost stories. The tension builds steadily in each story, leading you to gasp in horror or gulp in nervousness. These are examples of some of the work included in this book:  <br /> \\"Berenice\\"- This is a very disturbing tale of a young man driven to misery by an experience with a young woman named Berenice.

That is unfair judgement in opinion. A Case of Need is an excellent medical thriller that was written after Crichton graduated from medical school. The plot is very fast paced and the suspense is plentiful. The case is a very serious and heavy one, and is solved throughout the book as more clues are unravelled and revealed. <br />WARNING: SPOILERS*  <br />     The plot concerns a medical doctor, John Berry, who is working in his office one afternoon when he hears of a colleague that has been jailed for the murder of a young woman. Berry immediately takes action, and asks his friend about the situation. He denies to the crime. He also states that the woman came into his office and requested an abortion. He declines the request, and the girl is mysteriously brought in the following morning and dies of vaginal hemorrhage. John Berry attempts to clear his colleague, after a sequence of autopsies, clues, and more mysterious findings. I feel I should not reveal anymore of the plot to you. You need to read the book for yourself and appreciate it. By the national bestselling author Michael Crichton.	2004-11-24
US	35478205	R74PSRJZJEC2V	0060541830	694344232	Congo	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Average read.	Michael Crichton's Congo is a rather uneven work that he wrote in his earlier days. There is less character development than in most of his novels. At some points the book is exciting, then you go into a 2 chapter discussion on medical history, ape history, or what have you. During these discussion points, there is no dialogue, no excitement, and no character interaction. Beside these points, the book can be suspenseful and very fun to read. The plot is complex and will keep you wondering about what will occur in the Lost City of Zinj.      Synopsis: An expedition to the Congo is a failure. The entire archaeologist party has been murdered by a mysterious gray apelike creature. Scientists at a laboratory in Houston have watched the video transmission of this, and plan to send in another expedition to investigate the occurance. A scientist named Elliot and his specially trained gorilla, Amy, are also involved in the new expedition plan. While on their way to the Congo, the members of the expedition encounter other hazards, including the kidnapping of Amy. What goes on when the party reaches Zinj is far more eventful and terrifying than anything that has happened in the book so far.      Readers of this very slow novel require patience, which I do not have. Only recommended for hardcore fans of Michael Crichton.	2004-07-21

Reef Life is a field guide to reef dwellers and other ocean creatures by Andrea Ferrari. The photographs are both stellar and stunning, providing easy identification. The descriptions of the species listings are thorough, and very informative. A variety of invertebrates, fishes, Eels, and mollusks are covered. Dozens of species of: triggerfish, pufferfish, squirrelfish, butterflyfish, and other invertebrates are inserted into the text. I prefer this over the Audubon Guides for a single reason. Pufferfish are my all time favorite creatures, and Reef Life does this little known fish family justice. Many species of puffers are shown and described, including: Oceanic puffers, Starry puffers, Porcupinefish, Northern puffers, and last but not least, the giant Map Pufferfish. This is not all for the worshippers of other species, however. There are ocean creatures for everyone to marvel at here.  <br />     The binding of this guide is high quality cardboard. Paperback would have worn out within weeks of use. The illustration on the cover seems to be different, with a photo of a butterflyfish instead of a clown trigger. One of the best deals on the market.  <br />	2004-07-21

The Diabetic Cookbook for Dummies is a very essential resource for specialized dieters. Every mouth watering recipe listed in this book contains much nutrients and contents suitable for diabetic health watchers. My 87 year old grandfather owns this cookbook, and uses it on a daily basis to prepare meals and satisfy his appetite. Also can be very useful for gourmet chefs making meals in a fancy restaurant. The information content is overwhelming, which is typical of every &quot;Dummies&quot; entry. May overwhelm the casual reader using the book for recreation or last minute cooking preparations. The book is very large and bulky, and not the best choice to carry along with you on a vacation. <BR>     I daresay, however, that many Americans in this country do not particularly enjoy cooking, or don't have much expertise. (Not to make a generalization.) So, this heavy cookbook should only be purchased by diabetics or professional chefs.	2004-07-15

The Yorkshire Terrier Handbook is another magnificent entry in a very time deserving series. A very professional manual to dog: maintainence, feeding, behavioral issues, and several other categories. Since my grandparents own a male Yorkshire Terrier, this would be a recommendation for his training, health, and overall lifestyle. The series would serve any first time pet owner quite well.

The best guide to hamsters that we have found so far is this Complete Pet Owner's Manual. It also gave me the impression that the series had other successes besides this, after determining the quality of this one. The manual is most assuredly complete, covering: Maintainence, dietary supplements, dealing with the loss of a hamster, and specific behavioral signs. There are more sections in there that are also very interesting to know. These are very specialized and popular pets, and this covers the void for excited owners of their first hamster. If you already own other manuals about the hamster, this one is likely to be somewhat redundant. <BR>     Ranks much higher in binding quality also. The &quot;Happy Healthy Pet&quot; owner's guide series has very cheap cardboard binding, and will fall apart in a matter of months from heavy use. &quot;The Essential Hamster&quot; has pretty good paperback binding, but not as firm as this one.

Each reader will close the book with a new understanding of space and humans. The sequels following this novel are inferior, (exception 2010), and do not have the Clarke touch and creative wit of the original. <BR>     So, the story starts with the dawn of humankind, when man apes discover a black monolith one morning. Eventually as we see, this started us on the road to technology. Millions of years later, Heywood Floyd discovers the same type of monolith on the moon. This one is known as the &quot;Tycho&quot; monolith. A mission to Saturn is eventually sent, to investigate strange noises coming down from Saturn to the monolith. The &quot;Discovery&quot; spacecraft carries Commander Dave Bawman, Frank Poole, and the infamous HAL 9000 supercomputor. The computor malfunctions and disaster strikes when an enormous monolith floating adjacent to Jupiter is discovered. I cannot tell you the ending.

A field guide to coral, especially by Paul Humann, is essential to your collection of ocean field guides. Hundreds of coral species are listed, including: sea fans, hard corals, soft corals, and mushroom corals. The book also explains the many diseases that possibly afflict many species. The coral entries have excellent, detailed explanations beside them, concerning species depth, range, and abundance. The photograph transfers are above average, showing enough of the coral for identification purposes. The photographs are of course very beautiful, containing various, colorful hues of these animals. Buy the waterproof, annotated version of Reef Coral ID to bring along in the ocean on a scuba diving trip.

Clarke's original, 2061 offers much suspense and some enjoyment throughout. Our 7th grade class was told to read this for a Language Arts assignment. An average read, but very slow to finish. The story is about Heywood Floyd, now 101 years old in earth years, who has volunteered to ship aboard a spacecraft traveling to Halley's Comet. In his way, Floyd is embroiled in solving the mystery of a freak landing on Europa by the ill fated spacecraft \\"Galaxy\\". His son, Chris, also percieves to investigate the emergency, since nobody has landed on Europa since the warning in 2010. Heywood Floyd attempts to contact Dave Bowman for desperate advice. The result is very climactic with the monoliths and the Great Wall. <BR>    A slow paced novel, though a nice entry by Clarke. Takes a long time for the story to get going, the first 5 chapters or so. Do not read this before 2001 or 2010. Worth the very low price, which is about a dollar! The story has a nice twist, and Floyd meets an interesting fate here. Recommended for hardcore fans of Arthur C. Clarke.	2004-07-12

Still that difference is hardly noticeable, and buy this edition at good costs. This guide, (compared to the Petersons) will please a patient outdoor searcher attempting to identify any tree they find.

The redundancy of the Simon and Schuster system is indicated in the text, but this has never mattered, as the system is fine for expert field guide users. The underrated history of the book is unexplained, but should not have been so. <BR>     The two press editions of the guide are different in a couple of ways. The older, Nature Series Press, has aged photos, which makes the photo quality darker. However, the brand new, revised press, done by Simon and Schuster themselves, is the best yet. The photo quality is also pristine. Any edition of this contribution to field identification will prove useful for mushroom hunters and plant experts alike.	2004-07-10

No extraction information from purchasers or medical veternarians. (Not anticipated for this type of guide.) One of the more mediocre and sub par publishings on sale. This book is not overly technical in a matter, however not the basic lore a beginning purchaser may need to progress to the more advanced handbooks. The author has not likely obtained enough research for complexity to please most critics in modern day style. To put it rather briefly, the one manual worth the expense would be Nona K. Baur's guide, which contains better categorization, specifics, and overall quality. This is the only manual most definetely worth the expense and payment.	2004-07-10

S&S Guide to Rocks and Minerals is a very worthwhile purchase for experienced collectors. The usual Simon and Schuster system is here, but used in an excellent way. The descriptions are the best that could ever be in a Simon and Schuster guide. The gemstones and minerals pictured are beautiful and clearly photographed. There are hundreds upon hundreds of rocks and minerals listed, which makes it one of the best companions in the field. It isn't bulky, and the correct size to carry with you on a mountain trip or archaeological dig. The rarity and value is also given, including the luster, weight, and durability of a particular rock. <BR>     The two editions released on the market today do not differ noticeably, as in every edition of a Simon and Schuster guide. The \\"Fireside Book\\" press is less complete than the newly revised edition, but not in a large way. A serious collector should purchase any edition quickly along with the Audubon Society guide.	2004-07-10

Snorkeling Guide to Marine Life is a very handy truncation of three heavy, bulky, but excellent references. There are extraordinary photographs of fish, creatures, and coral taken by noticeable experts. The fish species covered are stunning, and carefully chosen for quality. The others are also amazing and excilirating. A favorite fish species of mine, the Trumpetfish, is included here, shown in a beautiful photograph. Other interesting fish, such as puffers, cowfish, and triggerfish, are also listed. The &quot;Creature Identification&quot; section of the guide is as carefully picked out as the &quot;Fish&quot; ID part. Beautiful crabs, shrimps, and others are shown in nice photos. All make to combine a short, but very helpful field companion.	2004-07-10

Simon and Schuster's Guide to Shells is beautifully photographed and the descriptions are top notch and helpful. The species of shellfish listed are admirable and quite a feast for the eyes, especially the &quot;Mediterranean Chiton,&quot; which is an unusual rock dwelling shellfish with a 10 inch carapace. Quite amazing. The photographs and descriptions earned this guide a four star rating. Now for the organization details: The shells are organized into groups that explain which type of surface they reside on, which is not as helpful as organizing them in families, genus, or the shape of the shell. This may displease a diver using this guide as a very quick reference, as there is nothing quick about the ID system used here. However, for the person reading this book at a beach, at home, or by a campfire, the organization will not matter very much. This guide to shells is strictly recommended only for the easygoing collector.	2004-07-10

This novel, written by Mark Haddon through another persons eyes, can be engrossing to people who enjoy amusing lore. Mystery and murder fans will not be as intrigued if they are looking for a heavy murder novel. This book chronicles the false accusation of Christopher Boone, who found a neighbors pet brutally mangled in the backyard. Haddon explains Boone's ability to decipher prime numbers up to 7500 or more. However, the book does NOT have much to do with animals at all. The entire story focuses on our protagonist, Boone. Though he attempts to solve the mystery of the killing, 50% of the book explains his life and how he lives it. Can be quite interesting and a quick read to particular people. For those who expect a horror/mystery novel, they should read Michael Crichton instead of this. <BR>     Though the hardback edition is more durable than the Vintage paperback, it is MUCH more expensive in some cases. If you are leaving on a long vacation and plan to carry the book with you, buy the hardback, but if you just read it quickly at home, the paperback &quot;Vintage Contemporaries&quot; will serve you fine.	2004-07-10

Another excellent Audubon guide focusing solely on the ocean. Since I am landlocked in the desert, this book assists me in remembering the saltwater sea and its inhabitants. The scope is not too wide at all, it covers the creatures that reside in the sea, including: mammals, fish, dolphins, Eels, and other fantastic creatures. This is the best of the three Audubon guides that cover the ocean. The reason for this is the coverage of freshwater and marine species. The photographs of these are also beautiful, showing enough of the animal for quick identification. None are dark and useless! To top it all off, the number of species listed in all categories is very impressive, coming off at 600++ entries. If you already love the ocean and its creatures, this field guide will further intrigue you!	2004-07-10

This Peterson Guide to Mexican Birds is very beautiful in the illustration category. However, it is not the most complete guide on the market. I would solely recommended the Western Guide to Birds, since it is the most complete bird guide yet. Birds of Britain and Europe is also needed to complete Mexican Birds. The authoritative highlight of the guide are the extensive listings of hummingbirds. This book covers at least twenty species. Other families and genus are mentioned, but many are lacking. The Western Guide to Bird Nests may also be needed to better explain and complete this.	2004-07-10

The contemporary edition of the Audubon Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians is decades old. Though it covers many species of snakes, salamanders, newts, etc., it is underrated because of the lack of updating. Some species names are known to be out of date, or invalid. However, even this cannot override the true quality of all the Audubon guides, including this book. Even though a newly revised and updated edition is way overdue, it still presents spectacular photographs of various species. The system is the same, with the description in the back of the book. The Audubon Guide to Weather has been revised and updated over the years and hopefully, this one will be also.	2004-07-10

Another average pet manual released on the market. The only guide released should have been Nona Kilgore Baur's thick manual on this particular Retriever. This delicacy breed has manuals written about it that required so little time by a less insightful company over the years. Cairns did not need to bother writing this material, as it has been duplicated already in superior guides. Our household contains two juvenile Golden Retrievers in the process of house and outdoor training. This guide did not prove to be any help since we had already purchased Baur's guide. The reason so many books have been written over the years was to trivalize the popularity of variable books on this very special pet. Do not buy this if you already own &quot;Golden Retrievers for Dummies&quot; by Nona K. Baur.	2004-07-10

For example: &quot;Reptilian Snake Eel&quot;, &quot;Lagoon Picasso Triggerfish&quot;, and &quot;Pink Snapper.&quot; These are a few of the thousands of uncommon and typical species identified. Every single category is described to the pinpoint in the front of the book, with the beautiful photos on the right hand side. This is not any annotated version of a field guide, and it seems to cover a wider range than Micronesia. Both editions of the guide are pretty much complete, but the hardback has more listings.

There are numbers of manuals released on this Retriever, which creates a serious dilemma. Purchase useless material, or the most useful and economical manual sold in modern day.

The Audubon Guide to weather is a one and only purchase for meteorologists. The photographs are simply spectacular, particularly the cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus, which are mysterious and somewhat intimidating at a distance. Since I reside in the desert, this guides causes me to long for cumulonimbus towers or even an occasional cirrocumulus formation. The content and system are convenient, as referring to the right back of the book for photo explanation is great organization. The photographs of impending thunderstorms are stunning. A very frightening and important warning cloud is the mesocyclone. This formation indicates a tornado later in the day. The guide could also assist in creating a Tornado Warning issue in a specific area. The whole Audubon series should be put into your private collection, as they are known for extremely helpful guides and environment contribution. <BR>     There a two editions which do not differ in very many respects. Economy Press, which edition is long out of print, lacks a few photos compared to the contemporary edition. The new press is superior anyway, and has very clean transfers. The very old Economy Press is not as detailed as the new edition. Since only one edition of this sensation guide is available, it should easily be purchased with an impressive price. The older version used to be hardback, and had a different illustration on the front cover, still mentioning the authors however. The new print is leatherback, which is easy to carry and not bulky. The Economy Press may last a bit longer, but the new edition is more helpful in cloud identification. <BR>     Many Audubon field guides are recommended, including their guides to butterflies, insects, and birds. Along with the Petersons, these guides should be sought out.	2004-07-09

The ultimate guide containing deep sea jellyfish photography. Providing scientific names only, for the marine biologist and deep ocean explorer. The pelagic jellies covered are mysterious and simply intriguing. There are several enormous surface water jellyfish covered, often in intimidating close up photographs. The mesopelagic species are bioluminescent and by far the most amazing in the entire guide. A few benthic species are covered, but this is a risky exploration, so we mostly view mesopelagic clips. By an author with expertise in the subject, and a deep sea researcher, combines detailed explanations of range, habitat and others. With some more commonly known jellies, such as the sea nettle, botanical names are given along with regular common names. Some photographs are in specialized black and white, since that particular species has not been seen since that photo was taken. The range is variable in many jellies, since some can journey from deep water up to the surface typically. If another company plans to equal this guide in numbers of listings or comprehension, they will have to go through extensive work, even for several years or more. Unequaled in this specific topic.<br />  Since this book has good binding quality and suitable price, it should be quickly referenced by ocean experts or interested marine biologists.	2004-07-08

If you are going diving or snorkeling in tropical or subtropical areas, this would have to be the incomparable choice, if you can find it. Be aware that it is out of print and can only be found in specialized stores, where it is expensive. <BR>     You will find shark species listed in here that no other guide has covered quite yet. For instance, the &quot;Nervous Shark&quot; is a very interesting species, and this is the only book known that lists it. (To my knowledge, since I own four books on sharks). The section on rays is also decent, as you will find unusual and poorly known species listed along with the common ones.

For those living out on the east coast or in the Caribbean, this is an excellent and very reliable resource. Also quite fun to read as a coffee table or easy chair book. <BR>    There is a catch however, as the book is bound in low quality paperback.

There are a few succulents, but the cacti are the MAIN part of this book. If you want a guide to local succulents, purchase &quot;Succulents&quot;, and &quot;Succulents 2: The Illustrated Dictionary&quot;. But, if you are seeking out cacti, whether to plant them in a backyard, or simply find them in the field, this a priority to purchase. <BR>     The photographs themselves are beautiful and DO show enough of the plant for field identification.

The Audubon Guide to Tropical Marine Fishes is used for identifying brightly colored fish that are most likely to found in the open ocean or on reefs. This guide is different from its predecessor, &quot;Audubon Guide to Fishes&quot; in many ways. First off, the range is quite different, containing a wider variety of fish. This book also takes up where &quot;Fishes&quot; left off. There were so many species to cover that there needed to be more explanation in a second book, &quot;Tropical Marine Fishes&quot;. <BR>     So, this is the correct field guide to take along on a scuba trip to the Caribbean, Bahamas, Florida, or other places that the guide covers. Since it is much smaller than &quot;Reef Fish Identification&quot; by Paul Humann, it is much easier to carry along in a smaller pack, and one does not have to worry about the  bulkiness of other guides. <BR>     Now for the content: There are over four categories of fish, including : bass like fishes, sharks &amp; whales, and Eels. The butterflyfish and damselfish are the most colorful part of the entire guide. There are a nice amount of frequently seen sharks talked about here, but not as many as in &quot;Audubon Guide to Fishes, Whales, and Dolphins&quot;, which is a follow up. So, if you basically want a straightforward guide to saltwater fish, take a look at this and the original Guide to Fishes.	2004-07-07

Audubon has certainly delivered their best in this marine life field guide! When I bought this, I expected it to be the usual good Audubon repeat of their previous field guides. I was quite impressed by the number of species inserted, and the special illustrations used along with it. There are a surprising number of families and subspecies listed also. <BR>     The whales and dolphins section is the best part of the guide, listing rare and endangered species. I don't suspect anyone has heard of the &quot;Tucuxi&quot; dolphin, have they? Rather than just listing commonly seen or normal species, Audubon has done extensive research on others, and has inserted dozens or more in each family section, making identification completely unmistakable. The seals and sea lions covered are no different in variety and number of listings. However, many of the seals listed are subspecies of 6 previous listings. <BR>     The binding is usual quality by Audubon publishers, making an excellent reading book, whether on a boat trip, in a car, or simply in an easy chair at home.

However, this book is geared more toward aquarium species than ones found in the ocean or freshwater lakes. For instance, the Asian pufferfish is a species that has never been mentioned in any field guide, except this one. Without a doubt, it is an aquarium hybrid. There are not very many species of betas, fightingfish, or goldfish covered here. A person looking for heavy coverage of that will be slightly disappointed. <BR>     The other fishes covered, such as puffers, triggerfish, or cowfish, have more species listed, and more details given. People interested in pufferfish (such as me), will find this guide useful. The only downside that takes away one star is that some species are hybrids, including betas and goldfish. Most triggerfish and cowfish are authentic species. <BR>     If you are looking for a field guide to take along with you on a scuba diving trip to the Caribbean, forget it. This is not the one. However, if you are searching for fish to put in your aquarium, this book is definetely for you..	2004-07-02

The Audubon Guide to Butterflies equals the completely perfect Kaufman Guide to Butterflies in every way. First, there are countless numbers of species listed, which is essential to identify a particular specimen. It is also very detailed in the description of the species in the back of the book. It is perfect for beginner naturalists and experts!<BR>     So, why is it so underrated? For one reason, many are too lazy to quickly flip to the back of the book and read the description. Anyone stating that this is for the very beginning amateur must have the wrong field guide altogether! Saying that the Golden Guides are for beginners is understandable, but saying that about an Audubon Guide is not. <BR>     This a &quot;stonewall&quot; entry in the long list of Audubon Guides, and may very well be one of the best!	2004-07-02

Simon and Schuster's Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians is one of the most beautifully photographed guides on the market, but also one of the most specific. There are not as many species of newts, salamanders, or snakes mentioned, as in the Peterson Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians. Though Simon and Schuster's pales in comparison, it is a solid contribution to field identification. This book contains the species you are most likely to see, as Peterson's contains rarer and uncommon species. <BR>     There are two editions of this guide, and one is newly updated. I own the decade old edition of this, and this is probably why it is so specific. Buy the new edition, of course, since it is likely that there are more species added to the original print.	2004-07-02

Common Poisonous Plants by Dr. Nancy Turner is the top of the line field guide to deadly botanical beauties you could come across while exploring the great outdoors. <BR>     This book is top quality in information, details, poisoning symptoms, and content! It is well worth the expense, which is a good amount. The book itself contains, plants, mushrooms, and fungi that could be hazardous to humans and animals alike. The main highlight, by far, is the toxicity section on each of the poisonous plants. The symptoms of ingestion, (contamination) are well described and could easily compell the reader to shudder. The symptoms are specific to every single plant, so that an infected person's life could easily and efficiently be saved. There is also a very helpful insight on treatment of potential poisoning. <BR>     The book is so specific, it even tells you the degree of toxicity! Unfortunately, this book is very expensive and going out of print. So, any hardcore naturalist or interested botanist should purchase this online ASAP!	2004-07-02

The Instant Guide to Weather is one of the best beginning guides for amateur meteorologists. It can also come in handy for advanced weather watchers. Since cumulonimbus clouds are some of the most fascinating clouds to watch, an illustration of this cloud is included on the cover of the jacket. <BR>     Now for the pinpoint details: The guide is quite concise and easy to use, especially for the beginning weather watcher. The pictures are beautiful, particularly the cumulus congestus and cumulonimbus ones. The authors should have drawn more pics of cumulus clouds. I feel must deduct one star for this detail, since the Audubon Guide has seven or more pictures of cumulus and cumulonimbus. However, this won't matter to one who has never seen the unabridged Audubon Field Guide. Don't bother wasting your money on this if you already own the full fledged Peterson, Audubon, or Simon and Schuster's guides to weather. It will make this Instant Guide look mediocre. <BR>     Otherwise, purchase this to get started on your exciting weather trip! It will prove useful.	2004-07-02

So far, this the best field guide for amateurs and advanced naturalists alike. It contains many more species than seen in other books I have purchased on butterflies. It is is excellent that Kaufman and Brock gave their efforts to photograph so many specimens, even some of the rarest species. One the rare butterflies, the best descriptions to identify them are given. If you think you've found an uncommon butterfly, consult this book. You will know, believe me. Stating that this is geared toward amateurs only is a complete understatement. Butterflies Through Binoculars is great, but this equals the other one, in specifics, photo quality, and field identification! Thank you Ken Kaufman.	2004-06-22

This field guide to hundreds of cacti and globular species is one of the best yet. I bought this guide at a nursury selling numerous species. I have 4 in my collection now, and am in the process of identifying them. I have three in the Mammilaria genus, and one completely seperate from that category. This book has so many to choose from so that you will never run out of ID choices when you need them. When these cacti flower it will be a snap to put identification cards on them! Unfortunately for the Americans, these are foreign cacti and we may never see them in their natural habitat, but this book makes them look just as glorious as real life!!!	2004-01-03
