It's a nice story, but something about it didn't click with me. The story is set in 1917, but some of the dialogue seemed more up to date than I was expecting. If the book would have been much longer I probably wouldn't have finished it. This isn't a book I would highly recommend, but if you're looking for something short and simple to pass the time, this might be a good choice. <br /> <br />	2005-02-14

I thought that Brichoux put a nice spin on the typicaly \\"chick lit\\" genre by introducing a character who is absolutely in love with (or maybe obsessed with) kung fu movies -  especially the ones that have Jackie Chan in them. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a fast, light, and fun read. <br />	2005-02-03

Each chapter is told from a different point of view, and the characters are wonderful. I do wish that there would have been a little more talk about the books that they picked for their bookclub, but it didn't make me enjoy the book any less. I would compare this book to something like \\"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\" just because the women in the book are so quirky and they have such a strong friendship. I definitely plan on reading more of Lorna Landvik's work in the future. <br />	2005-01-29

This book discusses the basic principles of Buddhisms, and although it does get a little confusing what with all the teachings (i.e. the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Three Doors of Liberation, the Three Dharma Seals ect.) it is very informative, and makes me very excited to continue to learn more about this religion/type of living! <br />	2004-12-22

It's a great and easy read with great characters and a wonderful story. The thing I liked most was that the story really comes full circle: it starts when Wang Lung is a young man and is getting ready to be wed, and ends with him living out his last years with his sons and grandchildren and everything in between. I was also really moved by the struggle of this family as they are extremely poor when the novel starts, but with hard work and determination become a very wealthy family.	2004-10-26

First off, I've never read Baum's books, so I was just comparing this book to the movie version. The book had a lot of political and religious concepts that I didn't fully grasp, but found interesting anyway. I expected this story to just be the Witch's perspective on the whole story...and it was, but Dorothy and the gang didn't even show up until page 332 out of a 406 page book. Overall, it was a little hard to get into, but it picked up, and was a fairly interesting read. <br />	2004-10-19

It's also a very quick read and can easily be read in one day. I suggest you pick up a copy and have a good laugh.  :)	2003-12-14

The story mainly centers around the girls when they are 18 and head off to college as they meet new people and go through the process of growing up.

This book is written in such detail it really gives the reader a great ideal of what the area is like. This book also includes recipes, which sound delicious, but I never intend of cooking :)<br />The one thing that I did not like about the book is that it did seem to jump around from topic to topic.

It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.<br />Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.<br />Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else.	2003-08-05

Although I loved this book, I couldn't bring myself to give it 5 stars. I think the book dragged a little too much and it took a little bit for me to get into it, as compared to the other 4 books where I was instantly hooked. Another thing that irritated me was Harry's attitude. I know he's 15 now and at that age where he's angry and stuff, but I think Ms. Rowling went a little overboard in places. <br />Other than that the book was great. All of the old characters returned, and some new ones added. There seems to be a lot more action in this book, and it's much darker. I was also very pleased to see that Neville got to join in the action in this one. I was also very sad about the surprise death in the book.	2003-07-14

I also found it frustrating to read about Ruby's relationship with Michael...it reminded me of young kids on their first date. They were akward and didn't know what to say. All in all, however, this book has a few good laughs and is pretty entertaining.	2003-06-17

This story is mainly focused about her, and how her little sister, Ramona is always messing everything up for her.  Beverly Cleary does a wonderful job of describing how horrible little sisters can be. Beezus feels like a terrible person because there are times when she doesn't love Ramona, but is reassured when she finds out that sisters don't have to love each other all the time. This book is a great read for children (especially those with siblings.)	2003-06-17

There were some funny moments, and I was so happy to read that she has a &quot;dumb girl&quot; too.<br />I do, however, have a few complaints about this book: the main one is her parents! Both of her parents are way too neurotic and made me so mad! Maybe I'm the weird one because i have a good relationship with my parents. I can't believe her mom and dad would act like that to their daughter (especially on her birthday) and that she would just sit and take it. The other complaint is that i don't really think she learned her lesson at the end. She says that she has finally figured things out, but that is what she says every year!<br />I thought that the concept of the book was very original, and if you can get past her crazy parents, it's not too bad of a read.	2003-06-14

I feel that some chapters really had nothing to do with their title.  The book was also somewhat repetitive, and I thought the ending was good, but a big cliche.<br />However, I grew up watching Seasame Street and really enjoyed hearing behind the scene facts about the show, puppets, and the people who worked on it.  There were also some very heart-warming moments in the chapters. It's a pretty easy read with short chapters. This is definitely a read for any Seasame Street or Jim Henson fan, but don't expect a lot of actual &quot;wisdom&quot;, just fun stories about the show and the puppets!	2003-06-12

My first opinion after I started reading this book was that Ms. Browne was obviously not in with the popular crowd in her school days.  Throughout the book she goes on about how her and the \\"Tammys\\" are superior and the \\"Wannabes\\" have to wait on them hand and foot and will never be an actual \\"Queen\\"....PUH-LEASE!!!  Get over yourself! I should have stopped, but no...i pressed on and finished the book.<br />Sure there were some humorous parts and some good recipes, but for the most part it was repetitive and sad rather than funny. I do give the Sweet Potato Queens credit for having lots of fun, (even though our definitions of fun are two totally different things)because having fun in life is so important! However, my lasting impression of the Sweet Potato Queens is that they are 30 and 40-somethings that are really 20-something wannabes, and act like trailer trash in the process.<br />If you want a real fun book (although dark at times) about true friendship, read \\"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\" by Rebecca Wells. The Ya-Ya's have fun too, but, unlike the Queens, they have class!	2003-06-11

I loved this book just as much as the first one. There are some new characters added, another mystery for Harry to solve, and some unexpected twists in the book.<br />\\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" kept my attention throughout the whole book, as did the last one. I couldn't put it down. I also found that Ms. Rowling gave enough details in the 2nd book to where one could read it without reading the 1st book and still be able to follow along; and it also wasn't too repetitive for the readers who have read the 1st one.  Yet another great book for readers of all ages!	2003-06-09

I finally decided to read the 1st Harry Potter book because of all of the hype of the 5th book being released. I had heard this book was great, but I wasn't too excited about reading it because i'm not into science fiction involving wizards and magic and such.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a fun, light-hearted read, and I think that is because the Harry Potter books are typically children's books. Of course there were dark moments in this book, but I loved every word of it!  The characters were so realistic and believable. This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I can't wait to read the others!  I would recommend this book to ANYBODY! :) I couldn't put this book down! It kept my attention the whole way through, and the ending was amazing!	2003-06-06

I didn't expect this book to be such a difficult read and contemplated stopping many times.  However, i pressed on and am glad i did.  <BR>        Virginia Woolf writes about several different characters; all on the same day which leads to Clarissa Dalloway's party that evening.  What made this such a hard read for me was that Woolf would jump from one character to another and I wouldn't know who she was speaking of.  <BR>        This story talks of the customs of these character who live in England, and also has some flashbacks into their past. There was one total shock in this book, which was when Woolf wrote of Clarissa and her friend Sally share a pretty passionate kiss.  <BR>        Although it was a difficult read, Woolf was right on track, and some of her themes in this book hold true in today's society!	2003-06-01

I feel like the only person in the universe who absolutely hated the movie. However, most books are better than their movie, so i decided to read it.  I thought this book dragged on and was very repetitive. I am happy to say that in the very last chapter is when a change occurred and made me think that i like the book just a little better than the movie.  <BR>I feel that Bridget gave other singletons a bad name, she was so pathetic rather than funny.  I am a single girl myself, and if i was so obsessed with weight, how much a drank, smoked, and how nobody loves me because i don't have a boyfriend...i'm sure i would have shot myself by now!!  If you really have to read it borrow it or check it out from your library, but i think it's a waste of money.	2003-05-04
