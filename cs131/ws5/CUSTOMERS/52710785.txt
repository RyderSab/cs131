US	52710785	R3VP1NVL6TGKSD	0060541490	451528647	Sexy	Books	3	7	10	N	N	Swimming at the Shallow End of Teen Sexuality Issues	I chose to read this book based on a memory of Ms. Oates powerful short story \\"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\\" since the description on the book jacket seemed to indicate that this would cover similar ground...only with a young male protagonist. <br /> <br />That older short story was an unsettling, haunting look into the world of emerging teen sexuality that produces an effect that only a great writer could.  That was Oates at the top of her game and she was able to connect with readers of all ages, creating a powerful impact. <br /> <br />This book however is a \\"different story\\" all together.   <br /> <br />While the writing is capable and the structure makes for a quick read, there is ultimately little of consequence here.  We are confronted with issues that should be taken seriously rather than touched upon lightly.  And it would have been very nice to have a little more depth to most of the characters. <br /> <br />Oates relies heavily on our understanding common types of people and situations -- presenting attributes and behaviors of these types rather than giving us fully developed characters.  This borders on stereotyping.  <br /> <br />In this book, we are presented with tragedy.  But the conclusion is sadly weak and soulless.  Great writing should be more than dumping a collection of \\"hot\\" issues on the reader -- even if you can do so in a seamlessly artistic manner.  It needs to call to something in our hearts and minds, and raise us up to consider our lives more fully. <br /> <br />To be confronted with superficiality in a book that deals with a main character who is troubled by people seeing only his looks and not understanding the person underneath.  That is ironic indeed.	2005-03-12

Call it a happy accident of browsing, but I found this book a week or so ago and picked it up and it had me laughing out loud in the book store.<br />Before and after reading it, I wouldn't categorize myself as a major fan of Lea.  But, it was a welcome tonic at the time for me.<br />Her various remarks are often provocative, crude...call them whatever you like.  This woman doesn't mince words.  <br />Yeah, she has an opinion.  Shouldn't you?<br />In a culture where people are so afraid to step on others' toes, it is purely delightful to read comic essays like these.  <br />Maybe more people should see the world like this -- with humor and with a willingness to knock a pedestal out of the way when the thing or person on it doesn't deserve to be there.	2002-06-11

And it was well rewarded.<br />But, to describe what I've just finished reading?  Nearly impossible.  This book has so many layers.  So many components.  So much depth and texture.<br />Definitely the most complex book I've read this year.  Without question one of the best I've read this year as well.<br />I think the most important or remarkable aspect will depend on who you are.  So, in telling what I enjoyed and admired, I'm not sure that I can speak for everyone. <br />First of all, for a debut -- or any other -- novel, this is a very accomplished piece of work.  It sprawls and doesn't always add up.  But there is reason for some of that.  <br />There are some who may say that the format is a clever contrivance for hiding the author's inability to hone his narrative.  I would disagree.  The multiple layers, the several angles from which information comes to the reader -- there is more art in this than artifice.<br />If Danielewski doesn't always make his point as successfully as possible, he as an author will ultimately have to decide.  And if his intention is to misdirect the reader's attention or create confusion by omitting details, I think it is used as a device to bring the reader to a point similar to that of the novel's characters.<br />The story of the Navidson family and their bizarre, shifting, maze of a house is itself enough of a puzzle and horror story.  However this is presented in such a way that we read about the enigmatic case of Zampano, the possibly fictitious author of a possibly fictitious unpublished manuscript dealing with analyzing the possibly fictitious documentary film based on the -- yes -- possibly fictitious Navidsons' experiences.<br />Our master of ceremonies for this excursion is one Johnny Truant.<br />Supposedly, Johnny found the manuscript and other related materials in his friend's apartment building after the mysterious disappearance of Zampano.<br />But, we can never know for sure.<br />While the character of Johnny has a way with words, he admits to having a way with more than just that.<br />If the story is true, he may have altered it for his own satisfaction.  If he didn't alter it, perhaps his attempts to piece it together have created a product distorted by his sense of importance.  Even if this didn't occur, we learn much about Johnny that makes him a narrator in whom we cannot place our full trust.<br />And maybe what we learn about Johnny isn't true...<br />The experience of this book goes beyond appreciation of a simple narrative.  It stirs emotions and ideas.  And definitely requires the reader to participate.  <br />You cannot pick this book up expecting it to take little of your time.  Nor can you expect it to be easy entertainment.<br />However, when there are unexpected developments, they are big. <br />I don't remember when I last gasped out loud or jumped in my seat while reading a book, but I did with this one.  Not many times...enough though to realize that I had been drawn far into the novel.<br />A substantial part of my appreciation for this book was increased by listening to the &quot;Haunted&quot; CD created by the author's sister -- Poe.  To me the two works will forever be intertwined even though I'm sure one could be enjoyed without the other.  The CD is by no means intended as a soundtrack for the book.  But it does explore related themes.<br />Since the book does deal with a documentary film, it leads to the question of whether or not it could be adapted for the cinema...something like the &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot;.  I think not.  The one -- a psuedo-documentary which does nothing but display a series of edited but very raw images -- fails to have anything to offer on repeat viewing.  This novel though is full of possible interpretations and could be moved to the medium of film in several ways.<br />I'd almost hate to see that happen though.  Danielewski's novel is such a wonder.	2001-10-25

But, this book -- while not as stunning as &quot;Fight Club&quot; -- is still remarkable.<br />Here we are confronted with the story of Victor Mancini -- sex-addict, con artist, drop out, would-be messiah, etc.  Definitely an interesting character.  And Palahniuk provides a voice for him that is totally believable.<br />The novel starts with Victor telling us that we shouldn't read it...which only makes us want to go ahead and read.<br />And it won't be the last time a reader is unwittingly manipulated by Victor's seemingly innocent narration.<br />From there it moves on to his description of telling scenes from his childhood and details of his relationship with his crazy mother.   Convinced that her relatively petty (mostly) crimes are situationist acts which will awaken the masses from their mental slavery, Ida Mancini definitely manages to impress Victor with an unique world view -- when she isn't doing time, that is.<br />Victor is a smart guy...even if he is twisted.  And, throughout the novel, his viewpoint and the opinions he expresses are interesting.<br />But the plot wears thin -- in spite of the fact that it deals mostly with Victor's concerns about his mother's failing health and what he could or should do to save her.  Pretty heavy stuff.  But this seems like something we've seen before.<br />We get a lot of information along the way about Victor's strange sexual predilections.  And have no trouble by novel's end imagining how this character could have gotten to be so far from normal.<br />Palahniuk's writing is first rate throughout.  Unfortunately, the ingredients of this novel seem to be assembled following a successful recipe.  <br />What's different here is not all that different from what we've seen before in Palahniuk's work.<br />At one point, Victor comments about &quot;jamais vu&quot; -- the opposite of &quot;deja vu&quot; -- seeing something again but feeling as if it is for the first time rather than seeing something for the first time and feeling as if it is oddly familiar. <br />Palahniuk can't expect us to forget his earlier work.  He'll need to work harder to make his future work every bit as good and ever more original.	2001-10-04

As tell-all autobiographies go, this one leaves out some important factors. <br />While Margaret Cho is frank and honest about her weight issues, drinking, narcotics, sexual promiscuity...she forgets to tell us much else. Unfortunately very little of her spirit comes through as she gives us a mind-numbing catalogue of the crimes she has performed against herself. And allowed others to perform.<br />Sure, it would be hard to joke when you're giving the details of some of these events.<br />But Cho has always been able to see the humor, satire, absurdity in life -- her own and others. Her comedy work is noted for crossing boundaries and delving into areas that make an audience initially uncomfortable but then break through and bring us remarkable insights and great laughs.<br />That so little of that perspective can be found here is disappointing.<br />Without that voice, she is nothing more than your standard celebrity giving us the sordid details of his/her shameful past.<br />Margaret has a better book to give us and I hope to read it someday.	2001-09-26

I absolutely loved this book.<br />McCarthy's theme -- wondering if you can feel a sense of belonging in a place where you never actually lived -- hit home with me.<br />Such a proposition seems very likely to be treated with wacky romanticism and foolish sentimentality, but McCarthy looks at the notion with admirable reserve instead.  He knows that this is the kind of idea that might make you go all warm and fuzzy after a pint or six....but which -- if to be considered at all -- deserves to be pondered in a state of clear sobriety.<BR> <BR>And his observations on the topic are amazing.  Never one to take himself or others too seriously, he explores his theme without running it into the ground and makes the story of his journey into a great reading experience.<br />While you might think he's mainly just out for laughs, take a closer look.  His writing truly has some artistry about it.  This is a book written by someone with remarkable skill. <br />Yes.  The laughs are great.  But there is much more to be appreciated here.<br />Definitely recommended.  This far outdoes the usual travel writing book.	2001-09-06
US	52710785	R3JBWHEAX8DDLU	1576737330	89800612	The Prayer of Jabez:  Breaking Through to the Blessed Life	Books	1	53	61	N	N	Flawed by Wrong Translation &amp; Poor Choice of References	The actual quote on which this book is based reads:  &quot;Oh that you would bless me and enlarge my border, and that your hand might be with me, and that you would keep me from harm so that it might not hurt me!&quot;<br />Not exactly the translation that Mr. Wilkinson gives.  Notice that last phrase -- it has nothing of the community-spirited wording we see mentioned in this book -- &quot;...that I may not cause pain.&quot;<br />After checking several translations of the Bible, I could find none which came close to Mr. Wilkinson's rendering.  In all of them, it was Jabez who was praying to avoid pain by keeping away from harm.  Not Jabez praying to avoid causing pain to others.<br />That's an important distinction.<br />The actual prayer of Jabez is a very self-centered request.  Not the noble self-protecting yet community-minded cry to heaven which the author would have us accept.<br />Why couldn't the message of this book be supported with a valid Bible reference?<br />The author has something to say -- even if it isn't a very original message -- and shouldn't have needed to start off on such unstable ground.<br />But being that the author wanted to share his views on the appropriate attitude for Christians to take toward material possessions, he might have considered using more familiar Bible passages and not one that is hidden deep in a section of the Bible that many people do not take time to read.<br />For instance, why not base a Christian attitude toward material possessions on the sayings of another person mentioned in the Bible?  Maybe -- and I know I might be talking nonsense here -- but what about examining the words of this one man who seems to have had much more to say than Jabez and has had a significantly greater influence over the centuries?  Jesus Christ.	2001-07-25

But then I heard about it winning the Pulitzer prize.  And a few favorable comments finally swayed my decision.<br />Ms. Lahiri's talent is undeniably fine.  With the opening sentences of the first story, I knew she had me.  Certainly, the setting was not that extraordinary.  And, the characters seemed like fairly average people.  But her choice of words, the selection of details to emphasize, the clarity of her authorial voice -- all of these elements hooked me in.<br />Each of the stories here makes a remarkable impression.  The themes underlie so much of our human experience and Ms. Lahiri's gentle telling never strains toward pontification.  She makes the telling seem so natural, so easy.  I am not one to think that reading should be a struggle -- an author should present a story so that one isn't puzzling out every detail.  So, I appreciate that this writer did her job.<br />In reading these stories, we are given a chance to interpret their meanings and attempt to understand the characters and situations presented.  There isn't anything which will change your life (that may be why some people are less impressed by this book -- they're expecting a lot since it has been a prize winner).  But, it will give you something to think about, some fine stories to enjoy.<br />That is what for me makes this such an excellent book.  The first stories I knew in life were ones which touched me and which I wanted to appreciate time and time again.  This collection is like that.  <br />It will definitely find a space on the shelf of books I return to.	2001-07-18

However both of these books are difficult to gush over.<br />These are dark gems.  And they lack the allure that the common reader expects.<br />When we are moved to feel joy or sorrow by an author, we have no trouble considering that genius is involved.  With Woodrell though, the emotions are more complex.  And he can stir up things which we might prefer to have left hidden and forgotten.<br />This is definitely genius.  Especially when someone such as Woodrell accomplishes this with a subtlety that is remarkably profound.<br />In this book, we are given the sad story of thirteen-year-old, overweight Shug Atkins.  His is about the furthest thing from an &quot;aw shucks&quot; coming-of-age tale you can get.<br />Shug and his mother Glenda live in a shack on the grounds of the cemetery they maintain.  Here they are plagued by the abusive Red.  Red may or may not be Shug's biological father -- he probably isn't but this has never been made clear to Shug.  Despite that, Red acts the father role and displays some of the most despicable ways possible for a grown man -- he is definitely an inappropriate role model. <br />Glenda has always relied on her looks even though they haven't gotten her very far.  She's about little more than sex and as age advances has little in her life but maintaining an anaesthetic level of drunkenness.  Far from being a perfect mother, she is still Shug's most likely ally -- a relationship that has all the possibilities for the perverse one can imagine.<br />Shug's world is full of dysfunction.  He has been exposed to drug and alcohol abuse, hardened criminality, illicit sexual behavior and all manner of wickedness.  But he doesn't know any better.  And in the course of this novel, things gofrom bad to worse.  In the end, the situation is beyond help.<br />Where &quot;Tomato Red&quot; impressed me with a story of what tragedy might happen when people fail to follow society's norms, this book shows what happens to people who live by the norms and meet tragedy by tangling with people who do not play by those rules. <br />I felt stunned after reading this book.  Honestly.  I sat and thought about it and couldn't shake it.  It was like having heard a bomb go off nearby -- too close to feel secure.<br />This is certainly a remarkable book.	2001-06-14

Unfortunately, most of her narration is nothing but a ridiculous collection of mixed metaphors and shallow, failed attempts at insight.<br />A character without depth does not usually work well as the central figure in a novel.  And it would be the job of an author with far more skill than Hornburg to write such a novel. <br />As for plot, this novel is dreadfully unoriginal and the story contains so many warmed-over plot elements and tired episodes that unwarranted attention is drawn to the author's lack of skill.  It is one thing to present a situation which we've seen before -- in fiction or in our own life -- but to do so without giving a fresh perspective or meaningful context?  Why should an author bother?<br />Hornburg's failure extends so far as to miss important elements regarding the locale of his novel.  Now, I'm all for poetic license...but when several other weaknesses in a novel are accompanied by a slip-shod handling of the details which are supposed to provide realism, my estimation of an author is not going to improve.<br />Certainly, as a resident of the Chicago area who is familiar with the setting of this novel, I may know some things that the general reader does not.  So, I'm not going to make a big deal about this.  <br />But even without regard to that, any reader who wants an intelligent, well-written novel to read should not bother with this.	2001-05-18

But having heard Sarah Vowell's radio work, I knew she was not a loudmouth, a know-it-all, or a brat.<br />And this set of essays contains some of her best and most interesting work.  Her ideas aren't always the most original, her insights aren't always on the cutting edge, but she is capable of bringing us back to familiar territory and giving us a viewpoint that is different than the usual.<br />When she talks about family, she is at her best.  She is candid but never maudlin.  Honest and unaffected -- these are the strongest qualities of her thoughts.<br />The only areas she and I disagree -- religion and punk rock.  As an atheist, she strikes me as someone who has gotten rid of a formal religious affiliation at the expense of her faith in a power greater than herself.  This is surprising in that she seems to be a very humane, caring, &quot;faithful&quot; person.<br />As for her views on punk rock, she mentions a few names during various essays -- people she'd classify as punk.  Unfortunately, at least a couple of these -- Nirvana, Frank Sinatra -- just don't fit.  It isn't really who she mentions though as much as who she fails to mention.  <br />But, I quibble.<br />Her writing is genuinely good.  And I would recommend this book to anyone who has even just a little curiosity about it.  You will be rewarded.	2001-04-30

Her ability to relate so quickly and meaningfully with Maurice in these letters makes it clear that she was a person of wonderful qualitiies, capable of simple yet extraordinary accomplishments.<br />The book also presents a beautiful picture of a life lived with reliance on faith...even when doubts occur.  In her last year, Therese experienced profound feelings of spiritual emptiness which troubled her.  We see no evidence of this in her letters to Maurice, but Mr. Ahern's lucid commentaries explain what was going on in her personal life and make it clear that she realized where her mission should be -- in helping a young man who needed encouragement, not in turning attention to her own needs.<br />That a person does not have to be built on heroic proportions in order to do good in the world -- that is the message I took away from this book.  And, I recommend tha others to pick it up and read it.	2001-04-25

It seems like a long time ago that I first heard about this book -- on NPR, a report about children's books that adults should read (this was at least a few months prior to the general public taking notice of the book). Even though so many people have become wild about Harry Potter, I can only share the enthusiasm to a certain degree after finally reading this one.<br />Who wouldn't appreciate a book though that is packed with amusing characters -- even if they aren't all that deeply developed? If that book also keeps the action moving, you can't help but like it -- even if it does play fast-and-loose at least once with explanations (for instance -- How did Hermione solve the &quot;bottle riddle&quot; as she did when one of the clues states specifically that one of her choices could not have been correct?). And of course, who wouldn't side with a poor little &quot;wiz&quot; kid who makes good even though the odds are stacked mountainously high against him?<br />This book does have a lot to offer children and adults who want some quick, amusing reading. But Ms. Rowling is not a great author -- nor would she class herself as one, I think.<br />She has done a great job in getting young (and not so young) people interested in reading and using their imagination. And, if this book and its sequels whet the appetite for other books like it, that is all to the good.<br />I read this after Philip Pullman's fine trilogy (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, The Amber Spyglass) and can only suggest that if you like Harry Potter and need something to read while waiting for further adventures, look for similar fantasy and adventure books by other authors. There is plenty of great reading to be had for people of all ages -- just look for it and don't be afraid of a challenge.<br />Harry wouldn't be!	2001-02-26

And, what action it is!<br />In this book Mr. Pullman introduces some important new characters -- Will Parry (a boy looking for his long lost father who ends up crossing paths with Lyra and joining her in her quest) and Mary Malone (a scientist studying &quot;dark matter&quot; who ends up being drawn into the perils of Lyra and Will).  He also expands the plot and reveals the central theme of the novels.  This was hinted at in the first...but here it is stated clearly and we begin to sense where all of the previous action is heading.<br />But, there is still plenty of intrigue and much more action ahead!<br />Pullman's ability to develop and advance a relatively complex plot is amazing.  This book had me reading page after page, feeling moments of jaw-dropping awe, heart-racing panic, and even a few moments of deep, aching sorrow.  Pullman can be surprisingly frank at times...still, his writing allows for tenderness and compassion.<br />The stand against formal religion expressed in these novels -- which has kept many people from seeing the true beauty of the writing -- is to me somewhat refreshing.  I am a Christian and I am set in my own beliefs...but I like to entertain possibilities and allow others to express their views intelligently.<br />Pullman has done this and created a fine work of literature.	2001-02-20

(I haven't read Harry Potter...so maybe I'll find something to compare in those if I ever read them...)<br />Here is one great story!  Full of adventure -- nothing short of classical mythology can touch it.<br />And, this book exceeds any expectations the first two novels may have created for the reader.   But these are more than entertaining books.  Mr. Pullman explores a view of formal religion that many would consider heretical.  Yet he should be given a chance to speak without being shouted down.  In proposing a view in which every creature works to make life better for others -- and concentrates on the present issues of existence rather than looking forward to a Heaven beyond one's own world, Mr. Pullman shares something that is more deeply moral and life-affirming than many would believe.<br />Indeed, his view is more truly &quot;Christian&quot; than much which purports to be so.<br />I began my review of the first book in this series by saying that I had given up hope of ever reading anything which inspired a deep sense of wonder in my mind.  And that I looked forward to seeing if the other two novels would be as wonderful.<br />Now, I can say, YES!  These books are amazing!<br />The only thing which would be more wonderful would be to learn what else happens after the conclusion of this trilogy.<br />Perhaps, Mr. Pullman will give us those books one day!	2001-02-20

I never expected to read a book like this again in my life.  Having felt deep awe and amazement when reading J.R.R. Tolkien's tales of Middle Earth and T. H. White's wonderful retelling of the Arthurian legend, I thought no author would ever give me that experience again.<br />How happy I am to be so wrong!<br />Philip Pullman's &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; is an amazing book.  It is full of intrigue and suspense.  But the greatest aspect of the story is how deeply -- yet deftly -- the author develops his characters.  Since the story takes place in a world like our own but with several interesting differences, this is even more remarkable.  It is hard enough to make human beings come to life on the page.  The skill to create a believable, admirable character when that character is a polar bear or a daemon (a person's spirit familiar in the shape of an animal) -- that's incredible!<br />Few authors would succeed where Mr. Pullman takes us.  This novel seems like the result of an act of divine inspiration -- far above the usual story-telling.  This writing is masterful. <br />Categorized as a &quot;Young Adult&quot; novel, this book should be appreciated by a wider audience.  The main character of this book is a young girl...but that shouldn't necessarilly indicate who the audience is.  Do only hobbits read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;??<br />This is a wonderful story.

But there isn't much here in terms of the quality of thought and subtle eloquence that I often find when reading his work. That is truly surprising when considering the topic of this book -- as well as the events of Mr. Price's recent life. <br />Here he is presenting a letter of consolation and condolence to a man who is suffering from cancer and the ordeal of treatment. And Mr. Price knows something of what this man is experiencing due to his own experiences with cancer. <br />But, despite these circumstances and all the best intentions, there is little hope or help provided in the pages of this book.<br />For someone who is struggling with doubts about God -- or someone who is persuaded fully one way or another about the presence or absence of a divine being -- this book gives surprisingly little food for thought. Mr. Price tells the reader that he has occasionally had a peaceful feeling of harmony -- an &quot;un-aloneness&quot; -- which to him indicates that there must be a God.<br />What help is that to someone who needs reassurance?<br />I do believe in a caring God...but hoped to find in these pages some ideas to share with others who doubt.

In this group of essays, he explores various related themes -- the difficulty of being unable to master the language, feeling insecure in an unfamiliar country, etc.<br />Sedaris isn't afraid to let us know who he is.  By opening up to us, we get to see the world his way.  And find the humor in situations which he tells us about.<br />The best thing about this book is that by allowing us to see things his way, we experience something like what he tells us he dealt with in regard to French encounters.  And, this opportunity to see from a new perspective is great!<br />Keep in mind though -- this is not a boring World Cultures book of essays.  This is first rate, intelligent humor.	2000-12-14

This year, I didn't want to give myself a major case of the creeps...but I still wanted something which touched on that area.<br />'Practical Demonkeeping' was just the book for me.<br />The story deals primarily with Catch -- the demon -- and Travis -- Catch's deceptively young keeper.  Catch and Travis -- in the midst of an interesting love-hate relationship (Travis hates Catch and Catch loves to be hated) -- arrive in the tourist town of Pine Cove where significant mayhem ensues!  It is all related in an enjoyable manner.  And the various occupants of the town are portrayed deftly without mean-spiritedness. <br />The author, Christopher Moore writes with the same type of wit which admirers of Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut and Tom Robbins will appreciate.  And, this novel -- his debut -- is admirable for giving us a wide variety of characters, dealing humorously with their particular quirks, and engineering a clever plot in which their paths cross.  Although the ending seems a bit rushed, I enjoyed just about every aspect of this novel.  I won't give anything away.  But, in the novel's last chapters, I would have enjoyed a more complete depiction of the characters' reactions.   Not because I expect every detail to be spelled out...but because so many unique, interesting and amusing characters are involved at this point.  It would have required significant authorial skill to relate all of that without bogging down the narrative but I think Moore could have managed it.<br />Without being macabre or morbid, this novel gives plenty of surprises.  There are a few scenes which provoke a squirm or two but Moore never indulges in excessive depictions of violence or gore.  <br />This kind of book works by keeping us intrigued about what will happen next -- not by dragging us deep down into depictions of cruelty and savageness.	2000-11-03

Despite a few ham-handed attempts to throw psychological jargon into his narrative, William March delivered a solid piece of literature when &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; was published.  In young Rhoda Penmark, he gave us one of the most accurately yet subtly drawn portrayals of simple, single-minded, self-interested evil that one could imagine.  And in developing the novel's other characters, he did equally fine work.  The story remains engaging even to a reader who comes to it almost 50 years after its initial publication.  The focus is never fully on Rhoda and this is what makes the novel work so well.  By showing us the actions and reactions of her mother, Christine and the other people around Rhoda, we see a more complete, realistic view of her world.  This broadening of the novel's perspective creates a more humane environment and puts Rhoda's evil deeds in context.  This is a much greater work of literature than many of today's popular murder stories.  There are no faceless victims in &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; and the effects of evil are not taken lightly.  In an interesting way, the ending is much like that of a classical tragedy -- but with a modern twist.  I'll say no more about that.  Just know that I recommend this book highly!	2000-10-25
US	52710785	R13E03ITKAAAHY	0684862220	435859494	American Skin: A Novel	Books	2	2	12	N	N	A Hero for the Small-minded	My initial inclination is to be very harsh about this novel.  It aggravated me at several points and infuriated me at others.  So, at least it made me react...but my reactions were always inspired by realizing that this story was far from original -- in contradiction to the orgy of praise which has greeted it.  The novelist creates in Alex Verdi a hero who is too small.  And then provides a hackneyed story during which this character travels a path of stock settings -- all of which are supposed to bring him closer to achieving &quot;great man&quot; status.  Sorry, but slaving in a factory, working as a bouncer, going to the military, settling briefly in a college town, spending time in prison...are these the passages in the life of a hero?  I don't think they are.  Becoming a hero isn't that easy.  But in this modern novel, diminished expectations are obvious -- heroism is simply about shaving one's head and getting a tattoo.  I'm trying to be less dismissive of this book than I might otherwise be -- because I realize that we live in a world where there are few legitimate heroes.  However, if we are to find them in our fiction, they need to be larger than this.	2000-10-12
US	52710785	R30X609LZDYCYX	0871138190	754092812	Four Blondes	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Field Guide to Modern Female (Cat:  Urban Social-Climber)	In 3 thematically-similar novellas and one short story, Candace Bushnell gives us some interesting studies of how the other half lives.  The tone is that of a modern day Anita Loos (&quot;Gentleman Prefer Blondes&quot;) -- an author more intelligent than but not condescending to her characters.  The tales deal with the moral challenges and manuevers of 4 women with the same hair color but widely different agendas.  The first wants to use her looks and charisma to get ahead, the second wants to use her brain, the third just wants to escape from it all, and the fourth doubts that what she wants exists -- a man who is worthy of her love and admiration.  Each woman finds that there are circumstances which she cannot fully control and she must deal with them...or let things happen for better or worse.  This book is quite entertaining.  A good ability to pace and a steady prose-writer's hand make Ms. Bushnell an author worth reading.  This may not be the deepest book you'll ever find, but it does manage to be moderately thought-provoking.  Pick it up for a change of pace and you won't be disappointed.	2000-10-10
US	52710785	R1LP8UMAL3C01G	1575665956	254951238	The World Of Normal Boys: A Novel	Books	2	37	77	N	N	The World of Normal Fiction	This book was a major disappointment to me.  Mainly because I  found it hard to suspend disbelief at several key points in the narrative.  In fiction, an author has license to present the events he or she wants to describe.  But this should be done in a way which agrees with other previously presented plot elements and characterizations.  I don't expect a mirror of my perspective when I read -- especially not in fiction.  However, I do expect characters to have believable -- or at least well-explained -- motivations, emotional reactions which are consistent with their (often complex) personalities, and progressive development which indicates that the author gave that aspect of his or her novel adequate attention.  I'll refrain from providing an example since this might spoil the novel for those who are less particular than I.  Another major problem I had with this novel had to do with it's presentation as a coming-of-age novel.  The protaganist here has experiences but none of these seem to change him markedly.  Life should be handled as more than the completion of a checklist.  The novel ends with the main character having put an 'x' beside:  first major family tragedy, first love, first sexual experiences, first broken heart, first realization of parents as people, etc.  And there is disappointingly little character development to show for all this.  In spite of all that, I did find myself pulled along by the narrative -- wondering how each set of circumstances would be resolved.  Unfortunately, this curiosity is what brings us back to the cheapest forms of creative art -- serial fiction (i.e. detective novels, soap operas).  Satisfaction of that curiosity is easy.  Giving us great fiction is far more difficult.	2000-10-05

Being patient brought me further into the story and I began to see where  Chbosky managed to be somewhat original while paying homage of sorts to  earlier, well-known, similarly themed writings.  All the same, there is not  that much new here.  This book is like a re-mix collection -- samples of  all the classics and a few more recent hits thrown together with a modern  beat.   A reader would be better off following the reading plan which the  character Charlie does.  Because, like all re-mix collections, its okay  sometimes...but the original tracks are better.  For me though, the major  problem with the story told by Chbosky comes near its completion.  Don't  worry!  I don't ruin endings for people!  However, let me comment that in  most troubled teen lives there is not one &quot;major&quot; problem on  which the feelings of being a misfit can be blamed.  In this tale however,  we are given a &quot;cause&quot; and once discovered, Charlie can then move  out of his role as misfit and into that currently glorified social role --  victim.  Due to this, the ending is a little too easy.  Teens and others do  not live in a world where one cause explains everything.  Their literary  counterparts shouldn't either!	1999-03-04

After finding out a little about it, I was hesitant to read it.  I worried it would be more depressing than comic.  Now that I've finally read it, I want to say  how touching it was.  Stein writes very well and this strange but wonderful  novel is a true gift.  It was one of those rare books that had me fighting  sleep because I wanted to finish one more page, one more chapter.  The  ending is a delight -- written with such clarity, it could stand on its own  apart from the novel.  Can't wait to read &quot;Touch and Go&quot; --   short stories by Stein!  I hope they will be much like this.	1998-11-16

So much is related in a matter-of-fact style and I was caught, unable to &quot;look away&quot; from these  scenes of disturbing violence.  Told by the narrator -- the strange,  destructive Frank Cauldhame, here is a novel of unique power.  What I  expected to be little more than a well-crafted thriller turned out to be  one of the most shocking novels I've ever read and one which had me  wondering how Frank came to be this creature.  I couldn't help wondering  what it all meant and how much I could trust Frank's view.  Still don't  know.  One thing I understand for sure:  even the mad have their reasons.   This novel caused me to examine a number of questions.  I didn't feel that  the author was attempting to provide answers for me but in creating a  realistic yet bizarre character caused me to think.  Regarding the  &quot;surprise&quot; ending -- I wasn't expecting it and I advise other  readers not to pay too much attention to it.  This novel must be evaluated  based on every page -- not just the last few.	1998-11-05

The main characters are  the down-and-outers and no-hopers born into the cruel urban world where  survival of the fittest is the law of the land:  Apollo the male  prostitute, Casio -- the injured bouncer, Baby Pop -- the streetwise kid  with big dreams and no way to realize them.  Minor characters are those who  exploit this class directly and live by a set of laws that is far from  civil and often more malicious than those they consider themselves above:   Mrs. Huxton -- the wealthy widow who makes big money from porn, Tina -- the  drag queen who has managed to get ahead by running bars and after-hours  clubs, as well as the several pushers, johns, and denizens who populate  this world.  This book works at times like a documentary and at others it  is nothing but great story-telling.  It gives us a look into the minds of  society's cast-offs and brings us to examine our own views and our  relations to these people.  It reminded me many times of  &quot;Querelle&quot; by Genet because of its simple exposition and  matter-of-factness.  And the scope put me to mind of certain works by  Dickens where we see many levels of society and their inter-workings.  This  is a well-written novel which deserves wider attention.	1998-09-18

And I guess I got it -- a  big disappointment!!!  This author writes as if words of more than one  syllable don't exist -- unless they're pretentiously cute inventions such  as &quot;slinkster&quot;.  An utter lack of rhythm is also displayed here.   Whatever happened to writing paragraphs as if one sentence related to  another?  And, what about developing ideas beyond the level of simplistic  platitudes?  This is writing at the most amateurish.  I hoped to step into  a world in which innocence is confronted with the hard truths of reality  and triumphs beautifully -- gaining experience without growing cynical.   However, this mess of hippy-dippy, shallow dithering left me feeling  cheated.  I don't expect all writing to be  master-class quality but this  stuff is simply dreadful.	1998-09-15
