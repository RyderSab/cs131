US	52704350	R20YV0QXUYUDH4	0486243532	775140194	The Logical Approach to Chess	Books	3	24	27	N	N	A book for neophytes	A person who already plays chess and knows a little strategy could benefit from this little book, but those seeking to truly master the game should probably look elsewhere. I see this as a good &quot;last&quot; chess book  for someone whose chess aspirations are simply to play a better game  against an irksome uncle or some pals they can't quite beat during lunch.  Euwe and his co-authors present chess as a sort of military exercise with  plenty of jargon an army veteran might be familiar with, but perhaps a  little too light on chess terminology. There are plenty of diagrams with  arrows, &quot;bridges&quot; and other odd metaphors and very little in the  way of variations or other dry, but often necessary, analysis.<br />A new  player who wants to become a strong, tournament player would do better to  look elsewhere for a beginner's guide. B.H. Wood's, Easy Guide to Chess;  Seirawan &amp; Silman's, Play Winning Chess; and Larry Evans', New Ideas in  Chess would all make better instructional guides (depending on how far  along the beginner is -- the former book is the simplest, the latter the  most difficult).<br />This book is not typical of Euwe's work, almost all of  which are leading examples of their genre. My Euwe favorites are; The Road  to Chess Mastery, Judgement and Planning in Chess, and The Development of  Chess Style. The latter has been updated and revised by John Nunn and I  highly recommend it.	1999-07-22

Several key lines are simply not covered, apparently deferring to Joe Gallagher's 1993 work, Winning With the King's  Gambit. McDonald's book is merely an update of what has been happening in  the KG in the intervening years since WWTKG was published and I would like  to have seen more original analysis like Gallagher's book had. Unlike  Gallagher, who plays the KG almost exclusively against 1...e5, McDonald  seems to have essayed the opening only rarely -- my database shows only  nine tournament KG games from 1991 to 1998. To be fair, I did like  McDonald's treatment in some lines, particularly the Falkbeer  Counter-Gambit. His analysis there is clearer than in the Gallagher book. I  can recommend this book only to those who MUST HAVE every book on the KG.  For those looking for more up to date info (and interesting ideas!) I  wholeheartedly recommend Thomas Johansson's, The King's Gambit for the  Creative Aggressor.<br />	1999-07-22

The text has been completely rewritten in algebraic notation and the  diagrams are now placed where their positions occur in the text rather than  in the middle of the page as in my old edition. The portion written by Euwe  has only been subtly revised by Nunn through the use of unobtrusive  footnotes. He completely rewrote the section on the Soviet school of chess  and added sections on Fischer, Karpov, and Kasparov (as well as a few of  Kasparov's most recent nemeses).	1999-07-22

This is a huge work -- some 540 pages in length and densely packed with  material.<br />Devotees of BCO will be instantly familiar with the column and  note layout which is absolutely identical. One thing they have improved  over BCO is that the openings have been place exactly in the order in which  they can be found in the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings. If you know, for  instance, that the Mar del Plata variations of the King's Indian Defense  have an ECO code of E99, then you know to go directly to the back of the  book.<br />Critics have made the point that modern chess opening theory has  become so advanced that a one-volume compendium just can't cover all the  major variations convincingly. This may be true, and with the advent of  databases and laptop PCs, NCO may be of limited usefulness to GMs, but to  those of us down here in Patzerland it is often difficult to separate the  wheat from the chaff and determine which among 1.2 million are the seminal  games in a given variation. NCO tells us and provides an excellent  starting-point for any db search.<br />If you are a serious tournament  competitor under USCF 2400, this book is for you. It's not inexpensive at  $30, but will almost certainly assume a front-and-center position among all  you chess reference works. I just hope that we do not have to wait another  decade for a replacement...	1999-03-14

The  descriptive notation would have to go, as would the old-fashioned diagrams.  The openings section would have to be completely rewritten to bring it  up-to-date. Fine's text gets a little wordy at times and the layout is  dense and haphazard. These quibbles aside, the lessons to be learned here  are outstanding! The syllabus for my summer chess camp for kids is almost  entirely based on Fine's ten rules for the opening, middle game and  endgame, respectively. Memorization of these thirty sentences (or short  paragraphs) and the ideas behind them will cause a quantum leap in one's  chess abilities. This is out of print now, but is still occasionally  available used. If you are a rated between 1000 and 1600 and want to  improve, this is the book for you.	1998-09-03

First, it provides excellent  instruction in the openings. Every game showcases a particular system and  illustrates ideas for both sides with thorough explanations, not just a lot  of variations. Second, it is an outstanding guide to the middle game --  particularly of the thematic positions and pawn structures that arise from  the illustrated openings.

I found  this book at a used book store for $5 a few years back and my investment  has been paid back a 100-fold. The Budapest is great for quick kills versus  weaker or similar strength players. A gross example: White N.N. (1600) - Me  (2000), 1998; 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. d5 Bc5 4. Bg5?? Ne4! and white resigned  after a few more moves and I was soon relaxing at Hardees while my  competition was grinding out four-hour games. Of course 5. Bxd8 loses  instantly to ...Bxf2#. Boryk's book is much more easily absorbed than  Tseitlin &amp; Glaskov's, Budapest for the Tournament Player, with its  head-spinning variations and transpositions. Instead, Boryk offers numerous  games with ideas and strategies for Black. Nevermind that this opening is  not popular with the GM set where they have everything memorized out to  20-25 moves. This is a great opening for chess improvisors and tacticians  out here in sub-master land that like to mix it up. If you can get this  book at a bargain price -- pick it up!	1998-08-28

He had a plus score  versus Fischer and his score versus past, present and future world  champions was commendable. If he had ever developed a knack for beating  Korchnoi his place in history might have been much different. This is a  series of annotated games arranged by opening. I've always liked this  arrangement (like in Tartakover &amp; DuMont's 500 Master Games of Chess  and the Informator series). It allows one to get a good feel for an opening  by playing through several successive annotated examples in one sitting  without searching around for them. One cannot help but learn by consistent  exposure to top-class games presented as Geller does. This is not a  &quot;desert-island&quot; classic, but a very worthwhile effort from a  strong and dynamic player. Buy it.	1998-08-23

The Sicilian is a bizarre animal: 1...c5 opens no lines for Bishops,  prepares no pieces for development and fails to place a center pawn into  play. Yet it is Black's most formidable defense to 1. e4. The authors do an  excellent job of explaining why and provide ideas for both White and Black  in a variety of settings: The Maraczy Bind, Sheveningen, &quot;Little  Center&quot;, Dragon, ...e5 systems and closed formations are all covered.  Only the Morra-Smith gambit (and other lesser gambits) and the c3 Sicilian  have been left out. If you are a 1400-1800 player and want to get a handle  on the Sicilian, this is the place to start.	1998-08-22

Timman has  selected absolute top-quality Grandmaster games from the 1970's and  analyzed them deeply. Originally, these analyses were intended for himself  -- an exercise in annotation for an aspiring International Master who  wanted to play like the players of these games. As a result, this book is  long on variations and short on prose explaining them. This book would be  of minimal use to average players but would be an excellent lesson in  annotation for &quot;A&quot; players and above. Highly recommended.	1998-08-22

This book is poorly written, inaccurate and misleading. I am not talking  about the occasional, minor inaccuracy, but incessant and blatant fallacies  page after page after page. At one point, the authors suggest that one  might buy a GH puppy, train it and then take it to the track and race it!  The reality is that dogs are raced by large kennels that have contractual  agreements with tracks to operate there. Unlike in some foreign countries,  individual Americans cannot operate a single dog or handful of dogs. No  distinction is made between the AKC Greyhound (a show dog) and the NGA GH  (the racer). The authors stated that GHs are usually a solid color. Yet if  one merely looks at the photos of the dogs in the book, it would be easy to  see that most dogs are a combination of colors, often brindled. At one  point, the authors say that Salukis are the swiftest of the sighthounds --  if that were true, then there would be Saluki racing instead of GH racing.  I have personally seen GHs and Salukis run side-by-side at lure coursing  practice and there is no comparison. This is an awful book that seems to  have been written entirely on rumor, heresay and supposition. Don't buy it.  If you did buy it, burn it.	1998-08-19

As he stated, Shereshevsky (the real author -- Mr. Neat was the translator) organizes the endgames by themes, but in a very instructive way: The progression from the apparently simple to the truly complex leads the student along in a way that is most productive. Unlike some tomes like Basic Chess Endings, this book is meant to be studied, not used as a reference. The fact that one can actually sense that he is making progress makes this a truly unique book. Jeremy Silman called it one of the three best engame books for the aspiring player (along with Soltis' most recent book on endings -- also excellent, and a book by James Howell that I have not yet seen). Silman thinks a thorough read of these three books could give the average Joe a 2400 player's understanding of the endings. Shereshevsky is more than an editor here -- he is a teacher, and a good one at that.	1998-08-06

Ludek Pachman is an under-recognized chess writer. He is one of thiose rare writers who is a grandmaster yet knows how to write to an audience of developing players. This book is long out of print but I have taken the dog-eared copy out of my local library several times. Instead of dividing up the openings by variation, as reference manuals do (MCO, BCO, etc.), Pachman uses opening analysis to illustrate themes in the opening like development, opening lines, pawn chains and the like. What one can learn here is HOW to play the openings, not WHAT to play. If you are not comfortable with your opening knowledge, this book, as well as Horowitz' How to Win in the Chess Openings and Fine's The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings will make you a player to be reckoned without having to memorize reams of variations.	1998-07-28

Buy this book and play through every few years. You will almost certainly gain new insights into chess with every reading. This book should be on every aspiring chess player's shelf alongside Larry Evan's New Ideas in Chess, Hans Kmoch's Pawn Power in Chess, David Bronstein's Zurich 1953, Bobby Fischer's My Sixty Memorable Games, Mikhail Botvinnik's 100 Selected Games, Mikhail Tal's Life and Games of Mikhail Tal, Alexander Alekhine's Best Games and Richard Reti's Masters of the Chessboard.

In the tradition of Fischer's My Sixty Memorable Games, Botvinnik's 100 Selected Games, Tal's The Life and Times of Mikhail Tal, and Alekhine's Best Games, The Test of Time gives one great insight into chess at the very highest levels. Unlike a lot of Garry's later work where he writes as though he doesn't want to give anything away to prospective opponents, this book is written as if his very life depended upon every word. The games are given with contemporary annotations and in many cases Kasparov revised them as he prepared the book for publication. The book covers the period from the mid-seventies when Garry was a teenage master through the candidates matches which led up to the first WC match with Karpov. There are a few games here that are worth the price of the book alone -- check out Kasparov - Portisch where Garry sacs two bishops and drives the Black Queen all over the board and e! ventually to checkmate. Unlike the books cited above, The Test of Time has not yet received its due, but surely will take its place among the classics.	1998-07-22

An assessment of each line is given in the familiar languageless plus/minus system. But, this is a awfully skimpy book for $20. I'm sure it was meant as a light-weight reference for the amateur player to carry with him to weekend Swiss tournaments, but I'm not sure the few ounces saved over BCO or MCO would be worth it.	1998-07-22

Instead of providing a specific repertoire (as Soltis does in his book on the Advanced French), Lane gives the latest theory in all the Advance lines from the Milner-Barry gambit to Kupreichik's 5. Be3. Each line is illustrated by an annotated game by practitioners such as Sveshnikov, Nunn, Anand, Torre and others. It's hard to belive that this 1994 book is out of print already. Nothing earth-shattering has occurred in Advanced theory in the past few years, so this is still a very useful book. Recommended for anyone put off by the reams of theory one needs to play the Winawer or the boring positions that often result from the Tarrash or Burn variations of the French.	1998-07-21

For the player that wants to learn a new opening system, this is a great place to start. The games are arranged by opening variation so all one has to do is play through the several examples of each line to learn the ideas behind it. Be forewarned, though, that this book represents opening theory fifty years ago so systems that are the rage today, such as the King's Indian and Sicilian Defenses are not covered in as great a detail as the Queen's Gambit and Spanish (Ruy Lopez). This book repeatedly makes Grandmaster lists of &quot;Desert Island&quot; books -- the only book one could take along if stranded for a year.	1998-07-21

Winning With the Kan would be worth three to four stars based upon its content, but at $22 it is too pricey. At 141 pages and 32 annotated games, WWTK does not compare to most other opening guides. Gary Lane's Beating the French ($16.95), for instance, weighs in at 160 pages and 44 games and Murray Chandler's The Complete c3 Sicilian ($22.50) has 232 pages of text and 70 deeply annotated games. Aside from the price, this is not a bad little book. It influenced me enough to take up this flexible line. Certain variations of the Kan may not be rugged enough for use at the very highest levels of chess (2700+), but for the rest of us patzers, the Kan (1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 a6) can be a workhorse. Mortazavi does a nice job of covering the ideas behind the opening moves with several game fragments that show both what to do and what not to do. He does less well at showing the head-spinn! ing transpositional qualities of this opening, especially Sheveningen set-ups and the idea of 6 g3 and Bg2 for White. If your Pelikan, Najdorf or Four Knights is taking a beating and you don't mind Maroczy Bind/Taimanov formations, take a look at this book -- but try to find it at a reduced price!	1998-07-21

When was the last time you heard that about a chess book? Schiller and Watson have created a great little battle manual for facing all the wild, weird and wacky openings that are popular among a certain group of players. The title is a bit of a misnomer, though. Not every line given is truly &quot;busted&quot; in this book. And some that are rather dubious, like the Philidor Countergambit are not exposed for the frauds that they are. Further, not all the best lines are given (an impssible task in any event) which makes chapters on such important and often-seen lines as the Morra-Smith Gambit in the Sicilian too short. But the unique symbology used by the authors and the overall tone of the book is a lot of fun and worth every penny of the asking price. If you are a regular tournament player you know how annoying garbage like the Grob's can be -- buy this book and be done with it forever!	1998-07-21

My copy of My System has been around. It is dog-eared, the pages have yellowed a bit and the price on it is marked $2.95. I recall many years ago that I had put a great deal of time into this book, but I'm not sure that I got a lot out of it then. Despite the smothering praise for this book given below, it is not without its flaws.      Firstly, the book is not easy reading. The formal and stodgy early twentieth century prose makes one feel as if he is wading through molasses just to get to the point. The writing is unnecessarily wordy -- younger readers will have a tough time with the vocabulary.      My System was revolutionary in its day but there are several newer books that I feel have ecclipsed it. Ludek Pachman's Modern Chess Strategy is an excellent book as is Jeremy Silman's How to Reassess Your Chess. If a &quot;C - B&quot; strength player were to ask how to get to 2000, I'd have him start with either of those first. Other excellent books of this genre are Lar! ry Evans' New Ideas in Chess, Michael Stean's curiously misnamed Simple Chess and almost any of Max Euwe's books.      That said, this is a great book to browse through. If I were planning to study isolated queen pawn positions, for instance, I would get out Nimzovich, Pachman, et al, and go through each chapter on the IQP in succession. The areas where there was common ground would serve to reinforce the learning and the areas where there were differences would broaden it -- a win-win situation.      Buy this book, but don't buy the &quot;greatest chess book ever&quot; hype.	1998-07-20

In preparation for an article I was writing, I recently asked a group of strong players (2200 and up) what book helped them &quot;turn the corner&quot; in chess when they were beginners. A Senior Master told me that as a freshman in High School he had been stuck at 1200 for some time and was making little progress despite reading books like Nimzovich's My System. A friend lent him Chernev's Logical Chess Move By Move and he said a light bulb went off almost immediately. Soon he was easily holding his own versus &quot;C&quot; players and a lot of what he had read in Nimzovich and elsewhere began to make sense.    In this book Chernev annotates several instructive games between masters and amateurs. The results are predictable, but the key is that he explains the thinking behind every move. One lessons this teaches the advanced beginner is that, right or wrong, there should be a purpose to every move. Especially important is the fact that the annotations use a lot of pros! e that fully describes the planning that goes into a move rather than some dry variations devoid of explanation. A classic! Suitable for players 1000-1400 (and stronger players will like it, too).	1998-07-20

This little book may well be the best 8 bucks one may ever spend on a chess book. The authors illustrate all the mates and their variations in well thought out examples and games. If you cannot picture Legal's, Anastasia's, Morphy's, smothered, Greco's (eyc., etc.) in your mind right now, you don't really know them. This is a great book for 1200-1800 strength players and stronger players will have a lot of fun with it, too. This is another great Dover chess book.	1998-07-20

At this price anyone can afford to get a good start at chess!	1998-07-20

Find a copy somehow, someway. This is Reti's magnum opus which has found its way onto nearly every master's &quot;desert island&quot; short-list. Reti analylizes the development of chess from the middle of the 19th century (Anderssen, Morphy &amp; Steinitz) through his own time (tragically, Reti died at 40 in 1929). Using particularly instructive games, he shows each of the great player's contributions to chess theory and gives the reader an insight into their style of play. The book is a huge 435 pages (in my Dover edition) and comprises 70 often deeply annotated games. As befits its date of publication, it is written in English Descriptive Notation. The quality of printing is rather poor -- many of the diagrams are dark and difficult to make out at a glance. There are also numerous translation errors as well. The German chess term for the Exchange (winning a Rook for Bishop or Knight) is Die Qualitat (umlaut over the a). In MOTCB,!  the exchange is referred to as &quot;the quality&quot; on several occasions, a literal translation that does not make any chess sense. Despite these problems, this is a keeper. Buy it. Study it. Reread it every few years as your chess skills improve and wonder at everything you didn't really understand the first time through. It's that good.	1998-07-20

When they run out of pre-learned moves, they are often at a complete loss as to how to proceed because they do not understand the reasoning behind those memorized moves. In this little book, the late Al Horowitz uses lots of clear prose to explain every move -- not reams of confusing variations that are gibberish to most of us amateur players. The book covers only certain variations of openings popular in the 1950's, so one will not see the King's Indian Defense or Benoni. But warhorses like the French, Ruy Lopez (Spanish), Giuoco Piano (Italian) and the Queen's Gambit are given good coverage. A good companion book is Chernev's Logical Chess Move by Move. HTWITCO is suitable for players class E through B. After a few run-throughs, keep it for reference! I still refer to mine from time to time.	1998-07-16

There isn't much I can add to the other comments above except that this is an excellent way to teach chess to elementary and middle school aged children (especially those that are not particularly good or avid readers). My middle school team won a trophy (4th in the state of Virginia in  1997) based almost solely on instruction from this book and Fred Wilson's little book, 101 Questions on Chess (that book, by the way, is only $1 -- I bought all 24 of my kids a copy and it surely had something to do with that trophy). I asked the parents to buy Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess and the kids that got them ended up as my better players.	1998-07-16

The c3 Sicilian has experienced an explosion of new interest in the past several years. I originally took it up because no one was playing it -- now everyone (and everything, ie., DEEP BLUE) is playing it! It was once easy to beat up on Sicilianites using Gary Lane's excellent book, The c3 Sicilian (the only other book on this line worth owning). But 1...c5 players have become more savvy since the 1990 publication of that book. To stay ahead, Chandler's book is a must. He uses 70 complete games and innumerable notes to illustrate the cutting edge of c3 theory as of the date of publication. But beware! Time marches on and some lines have already been reassessed -- the apparently promising idea of 6. Nbd2 in game nine has been torched (8...Qf5!) and the whole idea should be avoided.	1998-07-15
