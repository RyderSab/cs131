Dungeons and Wizards have always seemed a bit nerdy to me. I just can't bring myself to actually walk up to the counter at a bookstore and hand the clerk a book with dragons and sorcerers on the cover.<br /><br />As a teenager I was an avid reader of SF, though. By the way, why DO they lump Science Fiction and Fantasy together? Why not create a Western/Mystery category?<br /><br />Anyways, I've only recently gotten back to reading fiction again and found this book on a list of the supposedly \\"greatest SF/Fantasy books of all time.\\" It was ranked number one ahead of Dune, Foundation, etc. Being skeptical I bought it (I mean, DUNE?...c'mon)<br /><br />Things start of a bit slowly, the series will span thousands of pages, after all, but once you get well under way you will find yourself increasingly engrossed in the very detailed world that the author has created. After finishing the first book you will probably want to run out and buy the second--Clash of Kings.<br /><br />For those of you like me who didn't play Dungeons and Dragons in the library at lunch in high school and are therefore a little unsure if this book is for you, let me just reassure you that it reads more like historical fiction from the middle ages than actual fantasy. There is VERY little in the way of magic and mythical creatures running around. There will be some of these things but far less than, say, the Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />And, as far as I know, there aren't any shadowmancers on the cover.	2005-09-27

After all, I've always been a big fan of Newton and have taken all of the calculus sequence. I find the origins of calculus to be fascinating. This book, though, was not. <br /> <br />The characters, if we can call them that, have absolutely no personality. The plot...oh, wait there really isn't one. So I can't really comment. <br /> <br />When I was younger, and had lots of time, I would finish every book I started. Now my reading time is scarce and precious. I just couldn't keep reading this book after about 300 pages of sleep inducing tedium.  <br />	2005-08-14

I am in something of a unique position to critique this book. You see, I have, due to the fact that I attended different schools and therefore had different teachers for Calculus I, II, and III, been forced to buy three different ... calculus textbooks. <br />I feel that this book in many ways is the best. Keep in mind, however, that this isn't saying much. For the most part, calculus (and math in general) textbooks are somewhat difficult to learn from. This stems from the fact that we students like to see lots of worked out example in order to \\"get\\" it (buy Schaum's outline or REA's Problem Solver for lots of worked examples). In many cases, a calculus book like this will give you, perhaps, one example for a given procedure and leave it to you to deduce the rest. <br />Still, I like the fact that this book contains the material for Calc. I, II, and III. If nothing else, it saves us some money. <br />One final comment: as another reviewer on amazon has already noted, the binding on this book is quite poor. I have seen many other students in my class with books in which the pages have started falling out. Perhaps Prentice Hall should provide us with a better binding for a hundred bucks.	2002-10-02

I am in my second semester of physics at a Cal State school and have used this book for both mechanics, and now electricity and magnetism. <br />This book excels at forcing the student to develop problem solving skills. As others have pointed out: there is little theory. Each chapter starts with, maybe, a few pages of the basic theory (these sections can be quite interesting) and then immediately gets into the equations. <br />I love the conceptual side of physics, having read about the subject since I was a kid. But there is nothing interesting about calculating the electric field around a cylinder, or, better yet, the force of friction on a box sliding down an incline. But hey, we need to learn this stuff. And with this book, you WILL learn it. <br />In all honesty, I don't think that a physics book for science and engineering students could be written any better. Tedious, thorough, and forces you to learn the material no matter how dry it is. Thank God I'm not a physics major.	2002-10-02

The problem that I have with this book is the difficulty level of the excersises in the back of each chapter. They are, I think, a bit too challenging for the typical student.<br />Don't get me wrong: of course there should be some difficult problems to challenge us. But there should also be some easy ones along with a few of middling difficulty. This book, though, pretty much slams you with some very tricky stuff right away.<br />I highly recommend using one of the Schaum's outlines (Basic Circuit Analysis) to supplement this book. They seem to provide a more gradual approach to learning the material--giving you tons of practice problems to drive the point home.<br />Overall, a good book. But maybe a few &quot;confidence builders&quot; to start each problem set would improve things a bit.	2002-10-02

If you are planning a trip to Europe, then this book will be essential. After two such trips myself I have come to regard Rick Steves as a kind of personal friend. He has yet to let me down. On our first trip to Italy my girlfriend and I started referring to him as Saint Rick. He's always right.  <br />Most books in this genre aim to provide the reader with a great deal of detailed listings of restaurants, hotels, and sights. But if you have, say, one week to spend in Italy, you may feel lost in trying to prioritize your time. WHICH sights should you see (you can't see them all), which restaurants should you eat at? Where can you go in Sienna for a magical evening? It is in answering these questions that Rick Steves really shines. <br />Yes, you should still buy &quot;Let's Go,&quot; but you will also need a book such as this to find out where to get the best gelato in Florence. I prefer mint.  <br />Thanks Rick.	2002-01-05

Books	2	16	46	N	N	The Evolution of Sophistry	This book takes aim at a FEW of the Archetypes of evolution, then, in straw-man fashion, shows that they are false, misleading, or out of date, and implies, almost by sleight-of-hand, that all of evolutionary theory must therefore be wrong. This will elicit &quot;holy hosanahs&quot; from the believers, and leave those with an intellect and an education laughing. This is akin to saying that Newton should be rejected because he did not include the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics in his works.<br />Aristotle told us that when we have the correct facts, then all data should harmonize. Here are the facts:<br />1. The Earth is about 4 billion years old. This is supported by findings in geology, geography, astronomy, chemistry, and physics.<BR>2. There are simply too many species that seem to have once existed, but are now extinct. Why? What happened to homo-habilis, homo-erectus, the neandertals, or austrailopithecus? (if you don't know what these are, then please go back to Dr. Seuss) Did they not get a ticket on the Ark? <BR>3. Individuals within a species vary. Therefore, we can expect some variations to produce advantageous traits. Over time, these advantageous traits will become more predominant in a species. This is called &quot;Natural Selection.&quot; Insects, due to their shorter lifepans, can be observed to miraculously become &quot;immune&quot; to pesticides. Man has &quot;Artificially&quot; selected many, very different, traits within the domesticated animals. Just look at the difference between a chihuahua and a great dane--and this was accomplished in a relatively short time. <BR>4. Separate some members of a species from the rest for a very long time and you will end up with completely different animals due to different selection pressures in their respective environments. These animals now, due to their now very different genetic makeup, will no longer be interchangeable. This is called &quot;speciation.&quot; It is quite easy to imagine that ourchihuahua and great dane, if separated for another million years or so, might come to be so different that they would no longer be capable of, or even have the mechanical ability, to mate. Their genetic paths, then, would diverge. <BR>5. It is quite unlikely that good old Noah could have fit, two by two, all of the millions of species on the planet into his Ark. And what happened to the dinosaurs? What did the predators on the ark eat when they got off? <BR>6. There was no tower of Babel. We can easily see the &quot;evolution&quot; of English from Old-English to Middle-English to Modern-English. Furthermore, we can easily see the basic similarities between French, Italian, Spanish, and Potuguese. It's interesting to note that languages seem to evolve in a way that is very similar to the way in which we believe organisms evolve. How interesting. <br />Darwin did not have all of the answers. He acknowledged this himself. He believed that his theory would one day be a small cog within a much larger, more complete, theory. I myself am a kind of neo-Lamarckian. That is, I think that somehow need or usage DOES have an effect. But if I could prove that, then I would win the Nobel Prize. Anyway, I think that evolution is the natural order of all things: cars, businesses, computer software, languages, scientific knowledge, even religions. Who says that God did not create this? Darwin never refuted God. Perhaps God is intelligent enough to have created such a beautiful system. That would be the true miracle. I do believe in God. By the way, I was raised in a very christian home, read the entire Bible cover to cover at 14, but ultimately found too many inconsistencies therein and sought the truth elsewhere. I choose to use my God-given intellect and curiosity, thank you very much. For now I'll leave the fairy tales, along with this book, to the kids.	2002-01-01

Some would argue that it's more of an intelligence test than anything. I disagree. I believe that with sufficient study one can significantly improve one's score on this test. <br />For one thing, the single most difficult part of the LSAT has to be the &quot;Games&quot; section. You know: &quot;There are 6 businessmen seated around a table: Jacobs, King, Lewis, Meyers, Nathan, and O'Connor. <BR>O'Connor always sits between Jacobs and Lewis<BR>Nathan cannot sit next to King....etc.<br />Unless one is a member of Mensa, and enjoys these kinds of puzzles for pure recreation, one is unlikely to score well on this section of the test. BUT, having said that, the Games section of the test is probably the one area where you can most improve your ability. The authors realize this and devote more of &quot;Master the LSAT&quot; to this section than any other. <br />There is one point on which I disagree with the authors. They recommend that you create a kind of shorthand for the conditions of each game. I think that this is a foolish waste of time. After all, as you are not allowed to bring any scratch paper with you for use during the test, you will have to use the test booklet to draw any diagrams to aid in solving the problems. Therefore, since you will be writing on the same page as the question and conditions are printed, there is no need to add the additional step of rewriting the conditions in shorthand,IMHO. <br />As for the rest...It is presumed that we have all taken a course in critical thinking and composition, so we should have some proficiency in analyzing an argument and reading comprehension. Still, the authors do a great job of pointing out where the creators of the LSAT will attempt to trip you up through obfuscation, strange wording of conditions, etc. <br />My advice, like so many others here on Amazon, is this: Buy this book at least two months in advance of your test date, buy the &quot;10 Actual&quot; book from LSAC, and study at least two hours per day. One attorney told me: &quot;If I had known how important that stupid test was, I would have begun studying a year in advance.&quot; <br />One other trick: When you first attempt the practice questions DO NOT observe a time limit. Then, little by little, try to improve your speed. Why? Well, I'm a guitar player, and I've never mastered a difficult song by first attempting to practice it at its normal speed. You begin by playing the passage so slowly that you cannot make a mistake and only then do you increase the metronome. Get the idea? Well, I've already said too much. After all, on a percentile basis, I'm competing with all of you, right?	2001-12-24

That's 5 semester units of hard-core math in 5 weeks. The schedule was 4 and a half hours of class per night, 4 nights per week. To make things even more difficult, I had to work full-time. Our instructor even said: &quot;If you work full-time and take this class, you have to be a genius.&quot; Gulp. <br />But that's not all. I forgot to mention that I skipped geometry, trigonometry, and pre-calculus (I had to go to the math dept. chair for permission to take the class). <br />The point of my relating all of this is to show that I needed all the help I could get. I bought this book, &quot;Schaum's Calculus Outline&quot;, and the big green &quot;Problem Solver&quot; Calculus book. Additionally, I read Thompson's &quot;Calculus Made Easy.&quot; <br />Of the three books, &quot;How to Ace Calculus&quot; was by far the least helpful. It provides only the most superficial treatment of the subject, leaving the reader no better off than before. Maybe I had a difficult teacher. He did seem to delight in giving us the most ridiculously difficult questions, chortling mirthlessly at our futile attempts to solve them. He would even yell at the students in his heavy Russian accent: &quot;YOU VIOLATE ALGEBRA HERE!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS CLASS??? TAKE IT BACK! WRONG!! ALL WRONG!!!&quot; Half of the class dropped before it was over. I myself thought of doing the same every day. After the particularly hideous 5 and a half hour final I went home, my brain fried, thinking that there was no way that I had passed the class. I got a &quot;C&quot; (yay!)<br />Now I head into Calculus II in the more merciful 15 week semester, and I will not bother with &quot;How to Ace the Rest of Calculus.&quot; Instead, I will stick with the &quot;Problem Solver&quot; and &quot;Schaum's&quot; stuff.	2001-12-23

After all, writing a calculus text is no small feat. The authors of these books have to try to include every possible concept for fear that a math department or instructor will reject the book because it omits something or other. This means that you will get a little bit of everything, with a paltry few examples for each section. If you have a sadistic professor (aren't they all?), you may feel lost in trying to grasp calculus concepts from this book alone.<br />Math texts are full of assumptions, often skipping steps along the way in the examples. Packed with lots of &quot;Thus and therefores,&quot; this book will be a mystery to all but the few geeks who were members of the math or Star Trek club in high school.

The authors are, after all, academics. They have attempted to provide a &quot;composite&quot; picture, based on extensive research, of the average American Millionaire. What they have found is that such an individual is difficult to identify. In general, though, they are self-employed, hard-working, thrifty, etc. They do not drive expensive cars, live in mansions on golf courses, and wear a Rolexes. <BR> <BR>One of the biggest contradictions in the book is this: The authors have found that most millionaires will die rich. But they have also found that most people who inherit great wealth end up as good-for-nothing parasites, rarely accomplishing much in their own lives. My tongue-in-cheek analysis, then, is that these millionaires shoud try to die broke. <BR> <BR>The book is filled with statistical information about the habits, professions, and lifestyles of millionaires. At times, the reader will feel somewhat bored as a point is driven into the ground. Overall, though, the book is worth reading. We can all benefit by adopting some of the implied suggestions of this book. Work hard, plan for your retirement, live within your means. Just don't get carried away. Stop and smell the roses from time to time; strive to be rich in experience. When you're on your death-bed, I seriously doubt that you will say, &quot;Gee, I sure wish I'd spent more time at the office.&quot; Ask a dying person what they would give for another year or two of life.

Without a doubt, Milton Friedman is the most important and influential economist to emerge in the past half century, and is only surpassed, at least in terms of influence, by Keynes when one considers the entire 20th century. <br />As we all learned in macroeconomics, Friedman is best known for his &quot;monetarist&quot; movement. That is, the belief that inflation is always caused by excessive monetary growth and that changes in the money supply directly affect aggregate demand both directly and indirectly.<br />In &quot;Capitalism and Freedom,&quot; Friedman argues that politics and economics are practically impossible to separate. Therefore, one can not have political freedom without economic freedom, and vice-versa. However, Friedman does acknowledge the need for government as a &quot;rulemaker and umpire,&quot; as well as to control externalities.  <br />While this book was written in the 60's, it covers some surprisingly contemporary issues: public schools, international trade, corporate social responsibility, etc. Friedman even suggests a school system that is publicly funded but privately administrated. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the population (cattle) are too ignorant to ever allow such a thing. Last year, a voucher system that would allow parents to choose a private school instead of a public one for their children was placed on the ballot. It was rejected by the voters. <br />Of course, conservatives will love a book such as this, while the something-for-nothing types will cry foul. I suppose that I am neither. I just know the truth when I see it regardless of the package it comes in.	2001-07-27

Though I've never met the man, over the years I have come to regard him as a kind of trusted advisor. <br />When I screw up (and that happens a lot) I can always pick up &quot;Looking Out For #1&quot;, Ringer's previous book, and see why. Invariably, the cause of my failures can be easily traced to my lack of adherence to the &quot;Universal Truths&quot; found in Ringer's books. <br />These &quot;Universal Truths&quot;, however, are found in just about every other book on success ever written. What makes Ringer special, then, is his humorous, no b.s. style of writing. He goes out of his way to relate his own failures in life--something few success authors do--with such self-effacing humor that you won't mind when he slaps you in the face to point out where you need improvement. <br />With &quot;Million Dollar Habits&quot; Ringer somewhat rehashes his earlier material--thus the four stars. He uses the time-tested technique of all successful authors in fluffing up a spin-off to his earlier works. Indeed, you will find that &quot;Million Dollar Habits&quot; feels surprisingly familiar to &quot;Looking Out For #1&quot;, and it is. <br />Nevertheless, I will likely buy and read just about anything Ringer publishes. I need to hear what he has to say from time to time. We all do.	2001-07-21

What one fool can do, another can.<br />Or so goes the introduction to &quot;Calculus Made Easy&quot; by Silvanus P. Thompson. He's right, of course. I should know because I'm a fool myself. <br />One of the great things about this book is Thompson's surprising sense of humor. I just wasn't expecting a math text, written nearly a century ago, to be so irreverent. In fact, the author goes out of his way to slam the math professors of his day and their methods of teaching. Some things never change.  <br />Speaking of fools. I flunked out of pre-algebra in the 8th grade, dropped out of high-school at 15, and did not return to college until I was 28. I had my sights set on a computer engineering degree; however, I knew that in order to achieve my goals I would need to go back and slay those math demons from my past.  <br />After completing the algebra stuff with surprising ease, I now venture into &quot;the calculus&quot;, as they call it. Just those words &quot;the calculus&quot; are enough to strike fear in the hearts of millions. Isn't calculus for nerdy, Cal-Tech types? Can mere mortals, fools even, understand how to integrate a simple funtion? It's telling that a rather large percentage of those who enroll in calculus every year end up dropping the class. What a shame, because as it turns out, according to Thompson, the real fools are the professors themselves. <br />Thompson's book will demystify much of the material from a first-semester calculus course. You will learn differentiation, integration, lengths of curves, etc., all quite painlessly (well, you'll have to put in the practice time). <br />Of course, one will need to be comfortable with algebra in order to pick up a book such as this, but trig and geometry are also helpful as some of the functions are trigonometric. I should point out, though, that you don't absolutely NEED trigonometry to do calculus. What little you do need can be picked up rather quickly from a book like &quot;Geometry and Trigonometryfor Calculus.&quot; <br />My advice: if you are about to enter a calculus 1 course (as I am), then spend some time with this book. It will give you a great head start on the class and is surprisingly readable.	2001-07-12

Zen. <br />It's a word that is greatly misunderstood, yet heard all too often in American pop culture. <br />Jane's Addiction sings about the &quot;Pigs in Zen&quot;, and Pirsig's &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance&quot; is a modern classic. Pirsig, however, named his book after the even more classic &quot;Zen in the Art of Archery.&quot; <br />Now it seems that the &quot;Zen and the Art of&quot; title is a cliche. I have another book on career guidance by Laurence G. Boldt titled &quot;Zen and the Art of Making a Living.&quot; But wait, there's more! British rock band &quot;Bush&quot; had us all humming along to their hit &quot;Everything Zen&quot; a few years back, and I've even found a web page called &quot;Zen and the Art of Web Design.&quot; <br />Golf superstar Greg Norman admits to practicing it, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Jedi stuff was based on it, but what the heck is Zen anyway?<br />In &quot;The Three Pillars of Zen&quot;, author Philip Kapleau succeeds at paring away all of the nonsense and provides the reader with an insight into what, exactly, zen really is: a meditative discipline with the ultimate aim being enlightenment--in the rinzai sect at least.<br />In its pages one will discover how to meditate (zazen), what really goes on during &quot;sesshin&quot; (a meditative retreat), and the actual experiences of several individuals at varying stages of their development. <br />To his credit, Kapleau is very careful to not put across any of his own opinions about either Buddhist philosophy or zen practice. Instead of intellectualizing and telling you what he thinks, he allows you to formulate your own opinion based on reading the words from the masters themselves, along with the experiences of other individuals. In this way the Kapleau is more narrator than author. <br />Personally, I found the section in which the actual &quot;enlightenment&quot; experiences of modern, everyday, people are related to be the most fascinating. These are notancient sages, but people like you and I. People who have jobs, families, and other commitments. Yet each of them have experienced &quot;kensho&quot;, enlightenment, to some degree; after hearing what they have to say, you will find yourself wondering if it's possible that you, too, might have the same experience. <br />It is important to note that Zen practice, as presented here, is somewhat non-theistic. That is, it doesn't really matter what one's religious backround is when it comes to practicing zen. You will not need to abandon any of your current beliefs about God or your particular religion. <br />Recommended	2001-07-03

Will we see a &quot;Data&quot; or a &quot;C-3PO&quot; in our lifetimes? Or how about something slightly simpler like the &quot;HAL-9000&quot; from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;? My personal opinion is that, someday, these things will be possible--though I don't see them appearing in the next 50 to 100 years.<br />With &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;, author Steven Pinker endeavors to show us just how complex our brain (hardware) and the &quot;software&quot; that runs on it truly is. He does this by illustrating how incredibly difficult it would be to create a machine that could duplicate even the simplest of human mental tasks.<br />Take the simple act of seeing and recognizing an automobile. Such an event is so commonplace for us that we hardly even think about it. But try to create a computer that can do the same and difficulties immediately arise.<br />When you see an automobile, your mind must reference a kind of &quot;object&quot; library (computer programmers will see what I'm getting at here). An object such as &quot;CAR&quot; must have certain traits and characteristics associated with it--for example, has four wheels, carries people, has an internal combustion engine, travels on streets and highways. In this way, even when you see a new, one-of-a-kind, vehicle you will immediately recognize it because it has the traits and characteristics of the &quot;CAR&quot; prototype stored in your mind.<br />Now try to imagine a computer that can do the same thing. What if I were to show this computer a toy car? an abstract painting of a car? or a non-street-legal dune buggy? But this is just the beginning of &quot;How the Mind Works.&quot; There's much more.<br />After establishing the amazing complexity of the human mind, Pinker goes on to explore how and why the brain evolved into its present state. It is this, second half, of the book that I found most fascinating. Borrowing from the fields of Anthropology, Psychology, Sociology, and heavily from the pioneering work in &quot;Evolutionary Psychology&quot; conducted at U.C.

If you are preparing to take the A+ exam, then the \\"All in One, A+ Certification Exam Guide\\" by Michael Meyers is definitely worth your while. Why only four stars, then? Well, to be honest, I was hoping to learn practical techniques that would make me a better potential pc technician. In this regard, the book falls short. <br />Looking back, I now realize that I was somewhat naive about A+ certification. Having only had personal experience with computers, installing cards and drives, I truly believed that in the process of studying for the A+ exam I would gain the knowledge and troubleshooting skills necessary to become a professional technician. What a joke.<br />After passing the A+ exam I thought, \\"Great! Now I'm ready!\\" I quickly realized, though, that none of what I had read in this book, or had been tested on, had anything to do with real-world troubleshooting. I simply encountered problems that I was in no way prepared for (missing .dll files, PCs that wont start, PCs that will start on the occasional full moon, plug-n-play devices that neither plug nor play). I felt like an idiot. It has taken me a couple of years to REALLY learn what I needed to know in order to fix these more common software problems.  <br />The bottom line is this: if you already know what you're doing (unlike me) and are just looking to earn A+ certification for the heck of it, then Meyers' book will prepare you for the test. But, if you think that you're going to study this book, pass the exam, and then be ready to take your first service call, then you've got another think coming....	2001-06-30

Being such an individual, I had struggled with the Christianity of my parents. It seemed that I could not be both intellectually honest AND a christian at the same time (sorry Mom and Dad, but I KNOW that the world was not created in seven days, I KNOW that life evolves continuously, and I KNOW that there was no tower of Babel).<br />Zen, though, does not ask one to throw aside one's scientific knowledge in order to practice it. In fact, while the advance of science has caused other religions to continually change thier dogma--the Earth is flat, okay, no it's round; the Sun goes around the Earth, okay, okay, the Earth goes around the Sun-- Zen doctrine has not been refuted in any way by science. <br />Despite my rationality, however, I still believed that there may in fact be more to life and death than our feeble primate brains can comprehend. There must be some absolute TRUTH to everything. But how can one find it? How does one have the &quot;mystical experience&quot;? <br />Well, I had just such an experience at the age of 15. I've told only a few people about it as I am quite sure that most would believe that it was just my imagination--believe me, I wish that I could &quot;imagine&quot; it again. At the time, I thought that it was God speaking to me or...something. Now, though, I am quite sure that it was a mild &quot;Kensho.&quot; Why? Because, although I had no idea what zazen was, the experience itself was precipitated by a deep and profound questioning during prayer (I was still trying to be a christian then).<br />The purpose of zen training is to reach &quot;kensho&quot;, to become &quot;enlightened&quot;, to come to true self-realization. Moreover, zen training provides one with a method to accomplish these objectives. One can be buddhist, jewish, christian, or an atheist and still practice zen. <br />Years later I read Steven Pinker's &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;, an excellent book. Soon, the idea ocurred to me that a cognitive scientist/psychologist like Pinker should do research on Zen. Such research, I believed, would certainly shed a great deal of light on the &quot;mystical experience.&quot; Hey! Maybe I could write such a book, I thought. Well, wouldn't you know, one day, while browsing through the shelves at my local bookstore, I see a book titled &quot;Zen and the Brain.&quot; Darn! Another one of my great ideas shot down. <br />&quot;Zen and the Brain&quot; is that book. It was written by an M.D./ Neuroscientist.<br />James H. Austin practiced zazen under a zen master and, considering his backround, is in the best position possible to explain what is really going on in the brain when one has a &quot;mystical experience&quot; such as kensho. <br />This book can be both fascinating and tedious. Some of the sections on brain physiology can get a little dry. Overall, &quot;Zen and the Brain&quot; seems to have been written more for academia than the lay person--it was published by M.I.T. press, what do you expect?<br />If you have an interest in both zen and cognitive science, then you will enjoy this book. Feel free to skip around a little as there are over 100 chapters and each is somewhat self-contained--somewhat. Also, check out &quot;The Three Pillars of Zen&quot;, and &quot;How the Mind Works.&quot;	2001-06-29

It has been my experience that those who wholeheartedly agree with Rand's philosophy LOVE this book, while those who do not believe in free-market capitalism hate both Ayn Rand and her books. So much for objectivity!!!<br />All too often people rate a book such as this based upon the philosophy it espouses, and not its literary merits. Well, I'll try to do both. <br />As a philosopher, Rand is for the most part dead-on. However, there is nothing very original or groundshaking offered here. Two hundred years earlier Adam Smith said very much the same things in &quot;Wealth of Nations.&quot; <br />Yes, self-interest is good for everyone. Why? According to Smith, an individual operating in a free-market who seeks to further his or her own interest must inevitably serve the interest of the market (other people); therefore, selfishness is indeed a virtue. Money, then, is only a measure of the value contributed to others (the market). So, if a person is wealthy, and did not acquire that wealth in some fraudulent or criminal way, then that wealthy person must therefore have contributed more value to society. Again, all of this requires a free-market. <br />In &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, all characters are in fact caricatures. They only exist on the extreme ends of the producer/parasite spectrum. Rand does this to make her point, but I've already seen &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and prefer a little more subtlety. <br />As the book's literary merits... I won't lie to you. Reading &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is about as much fun as a trip to the dentist--particularly if you already agree with its philosophy. I am an avid reader, given to long bouts of reading very boring, technical material. Still, I found it incredibly difficult to finish &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot; It's best taken in small doses.	2001-06-29

George Clason's &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; is just as much a revelation today as it must have been over half a century ago when it was first written. In its pages we are admonished to save, invest, work hard, and continually better ourselves by increasing our ability to earn.<br />Much of &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; may seem like good old-fashioned common sense, and it is. What makes this book so special, though, is the beautiful and inspirational manner in which it was written. If you are a fan of Og Mandino's work then you will be right at home with &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon.&quot;<br />Very few books are still in print and widely read more than 50 years after they are first published. When they are, it must be for a reason. I seriously doubt that anyone will be reading &quot;Rich Dad/Poor Dad&quot; in 50 years.<br />Buy this book, it's inexpensive and easily read in one day. Give it to your children and grandchildren. By doing so, you will be giving them something far more valuable than gold: You will be giving them knowledge. As Benjamin Franklin once said: &quot;An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.&quot;	2001-06-23

Clearly, Robert Kiyosaki has struck a goldmine with his \\"Rich Dad\\" series of personal finance books. Millions buy them in the hope that they will learn something useful about acquiring (sp)wealth. To that end, I think that \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" is only partly successful. <br />Kiyosaki begins with the assumption that most people are financially ignorant. Therefore, the vast majority of the population produce children without the financial know-how to succeed in life. On this point the author is dead-on. In my family, money was simply not talked about. In the families of my Israeli friends, however, money and business are the primary topics of discussion at the dinner table and just about everywhere else. And these Israeli friends of mine are all well-off, owning businesses and real estate--none of them came to the U.S. with a nickel in their pockets. So, yes, it's true, all of us need to develop a certain mindset about money and success in order to make it to the top financially. Moreover, we need to do more to teach our children these principles as well. <br />Where Kiyosaki falters in not in the \\"what\\" but in the \\"how\\". All through the book he is \\"begging the question\\". His reasoning goes something like this:<br />     If you want to be rich, start your own company, buy and sell real estate, and invest in good stocks.    <br />This is akin to telling someone that if they want to be a world-class athelete to \\"win the olympics, the heavyweight belt, and the world series.\\" That's great, but how? And you will be asking the same questions as you read \\"Rich Dad\\". <br />I can personally realate to much of the philosophy in \\"Rich Dad\\" as I was a high-school drop-out with a disdain for working for someone else. I started my own company at 24 and am still making my own living at 30. Far from rich, I would work for myself for minimum wage before working for someone else for $50,000 a year. The point of my relating all of this is that I agree with Kiyosaki's main thesis: most people have what I call a \\"job mentality\\" and need to snap out of it if they are ever to be successful. J. Paul Getty said that the only way for a young man to be rich was in a business of his own. He was right. <br />Overall, Kiyosaki is a relatively poor author--thus the three stars. He meanders and belabors his main points to absurdity. It's hard to beleive some of the stories in the book. I am quite sure that the majority of them are fanciful embellishments. He points this out himself when he says, \\"I am not the best-writing author, but the bestselling author.\\" Or something to that effect. Hey, at least he's honest and he's making a lot of money. Good for him. <br />But he doesn't need your help so save your money for another book. I recommend \\"The Richest Man in Babylon.\\" Much more readable, fun, and is considered a classic decades after it was written...	2001-06-20

I'm sorry, but I found this book to be somewhat banal and simplistic. I feel bad saying this as I normally don't post negative reviews; however, I do feel compelled to write one for \\"7 Habits\\". <br />Covey, who I truly beleive is a good human being with the best of intentions, has taken 7 relatively simple concepts and intellectualized them to the point of ridiculousness. I'm guessing that Covey is an academic--academics are great at this. <br />Think win-win, begin with the end in mind, seek first to understand. etc. Good principles, but they could easily be articulated in a pamphlet. <br />All of this has prompted me to write my own book. It's going to be called \\"7 Habits of Bestselling Authors\\". So far, I have ideas for four chapters ready. They are...<br />#1 Think catchy title: This is extremely important. The title must be short, sweet, and grab the potential reader by promising to make a complex subject easy to digest and apply. In this area, \\"7 Habits\\" does quite well. I am reminded of titles such as, \\"Spanish in 10 Easy Lessons\\", or \\"Sams Teach Yourself Java in 21 Nanoseconds\\".<br />#2 Make simple ideas seem complex: This will be necessary to convince readers that it is really worth their time and money to read the book. Philosophers and Academics are great at this. I'll never forget my first philosophy course in college. We were instructed to read Kant's writings on morality. Kant took 20 pages to say this: Do what you think would be appropriate for everyone else to do. Just remember those research papers you had to write in school. Fluff, fluff, fluff. <br />#3 If you already have a bestseller, fluff up a spin-off: Covey has done this wonderfully with \\"First Things First\\", and \\"Principle Centered Leadership\\". Kiyosaki did it with a slew of \\"Rich Dad\\" books and makes a ton of money. Remember, just take one chapter from your bestseller and whip up a whole new book. Presto! Two bestsellers! <br />#4 Use lots of pretentious diction: Why use a simple word whena more sophisticated polysyllabic one is available? Just practice these words over and over and you too will soon get a key to the executive restroom: paradigm, intra-enterprise, value-added, internal customer, human capital, intellectual capital, b2b, b2c, globally leverage, principle centered, deliverable, etc. You can put all of this together and write a mission statement.<br />\\"We are committed to globally leverage our human and intellectual capital by interactively providing principle-centered, value-added deliverables throughout the enterprise\\".<br />Get the idea? If you do, then don't buy this book. Just read the table of contents and, if you're reasonably intelligent, you'll understand the rest.	2001-06-18

I say that this book is a &quot;Roadmap&quot; to success because the terrain itself is quite familiar. It's all been said before: set goals, replace bad habits with good habits, build a mastermind group, etc. However, unlike other books of this genre, the authors of &quot;The Power of Focus&quot; have charted a course for the reader to follow. Instead of just telling you &quot;what&quot;, they also tell you &quot;how.&quot; It doesn't get any simpler than this--I'm still waiting for a book that only requires that you read it and then suddenly money just starts appearing out of nowhere. <br />At the end of each chapter, the authors have provided action steps for the reader to take. I personally really needed just this kind of systematic, organized approach to mastering many of these principles--I'm an amazingly creative procrastinator. The book, therefore, is kind of like a personal coach, available at any time. If you truly apply all of the principles--and it will be easier for you to do so if you actually follow the action steps at the end of each chapter--then you will likely succeed in your endeavors.	2001-06-16

During their adventures, this messiah teaches the author about the truths of life, the universe, or whatever. <br />The message is fairly clear: we can make whatever we want out of this life. Life is like a movie, and we are the director, writer, cameraman, actor, producer, etc. <br />Read this book.

Adam Smith, a professor of moral philosophy in 18th century Scotland, was, perhaps, the World's first &quot;economist.&quot; One must remember that during Smith's era, there simply was no such thing as the formal study of economics, and it is this fact that makes &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; so interesting as it represents the first attempt, as far as I know, by an individual to explain the intricacies of money, capitalism, profit, etc., in a scientific manner. Truly, &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is to economics what Newton's Principia is to physics. It is not perfect, but considering the time in which it was written it was an amazing accomplishment.<br />The reader will find discussions on a great many topics, but what is especially fascinating is the insight into 1700's Britain that is provided. Remember, this book was published in 1776. Smith even discusses the &quot;recent troubles with the colonies&quot;--America.<br />It is emminently readable, though it becomes less so in certain sections--the digression on silver, for example. However, if one takes it slowly, then one can easily digest this feast of intellectual achievement in a relatively short time. Afterwards, the works of Ricardo, Marx, Keynes--to name a few--should be tackled.<br />Again, highly recommended.	2001-05-29

Over the years, I have purchased and read many books on the subject of success. Countless times, while browsing the shelves at the bookstore, I have passed this book by because of the ridiculous sounding title. I figured, &quot;right, another book about getting rich...&quot; What a shame, though. For the principles contained in Hill's work are truly powerful.<br />The premise of the book is simple and rests on two basic assumptions:<br />#1 There are certain characteristics, or traits, that are common to the ultra successful.<br />#2 These traits can be discovered through research and analysis of these super-successful individuals and disseminated to the general public.<br />Hill's research, spanning more than 20 years, focused on just such objectives. What he found is that, yes, the greatest successes that the world has ever known have certain common characteristics: they know, exactly, what it is that they want; they have a very clear picture in their mind of their desired outcome; they are persistent; they proceed through life as though failure is not an option.<br />Single-mindedness, persistence, faith. Did Hill invent any of these concepts? No. He was simply the first, to my knowledge, to articulate a method for success based on virtually scientific research.<br />True, one can use these principles to acquire money, but one can equally well use them to acquire just about anything else one desires. It comes down to this: every book you have ever read on the subject of personal achievement undoubtedly borrows from this book.<br />Think and Grow Rich must be one of the very first, if not THE first, books to provide a method of achievement. Hill was way ahead of his time in writing about such things as visualization, the power of the subconscious mind and how it can be programmed for success, etc.<br />Like all books of this kind, the reader will only benefit to the extent that he or she applies the principles on a daily basis. It will do no good to simply read the book and continue business as usual. I can affirm first-hand that these principles work. If you have any doubts, just read the other reviews on this site. We can't all be wrong.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-05-24

Being new to programming, and wanting to get off to a good start, I agonized over which book to begin with. Should I start with Deitel's &quot;Java: How to Program?&quot; Or how about Horton's &quot;Beginning Java 2&quot;? Or maybe Schildt's entry level java text? It was all so confusing! Then I happened upon this excellent book, and I knew immediately that this was the one.<br />Let's face it, in today's programming world the OO paradigm is where it's at. Unfortunately, however, many introductory books focus on code first and object oriented thinking second. This is completely wrong! <br />As children, we learn the concepts of words first, and then later, in school, we learn how to properly organize those concepts into prose. Should it be any different in learning a programming language? I think not.  <br />The fact is that one must have a solid understanding of the object oriented paradigm before one can really be an effective programmer, and this book provides the reader with just such an understanding. It is very readable--fascinating, even--and will allow one to better understand what the many fine &quot;introductory&quot; java books such as those mentioned above are really taking about.	2001-05-22
