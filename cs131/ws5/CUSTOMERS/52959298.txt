Indeed, this is kind of \\"Bubba Ho-tep Meets Norma Desmond.\\" Campbell bite the hand that more or less feeds him as Campbell imagines himself encountering the A-list -- Mike Nichols, Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger, Elizabeth Taylor -- and turning their movie by increments into \\"Evil Dead 23.\\" Although his prose sometimes cut corners, the episodes in this book are routinely hilarious, particularly in Campbell's repeated, unfortunate series of events involving Colin Powell. A real sleeper, complete with a chuckle-filled chase through the Paramount backlot. The illustrations are as funny as the book; what did Doug Coupland start?	2005-07-11

Rattawut Lapcharoensap's stories look lives lived in the shadow of the United States - they serve tourists, make U.S. exports or are half-American. Others try to navigate the ups and downs of the Asian \\"tiger economy\\" and differences in class, from rich kids avoiding the draft to prostitutes. The longest (and best), \\"Cockfighter,\\" builds a slow drumbeat of dread as a teenager tries to navigate between the destructive obsession of her father and the threats of the local bully. All the stories reveal the author's keen observations and humanity.	2005-03-09

The story begins violently with a rape and sets the stage as time magically flows over the hamlet, taking a priest, a town leader and various families with it. The sad conclusion -- perhaps the only one possible -- brings with it a remorse. The best characters are Donald, a silent child who grows into a silent confidant, and Tom, a would-be leader haunted by an incident in the woods. The story picks up its tempo when a teenage girl raised wild comes to town and draws the town -- priest, woodcarver, Donald, Tom, the lot -- to their destruction and exile.	2005-01-11

David Hart's essay on religion in America is the most cogent as he argues that a certain Dionysian form of Christian relgious fervor is holding sway over the country as liberal religion recedes. Robert Bork's essay on the imperial judiciary, which has ignored the Constitution to form judgments based on the thinking of the elite, is well written and exciting as well. Essays on architecture and poetry are better at showing us what isn't up to snuff rather than what should be happening (I rather like ornament in architecture, even if it's done ironically), and Mark Steyn's Jeremiad on the U.S. educational system, while true to a point, probably overstates the crisis in the classrooms. Finally, Hilton Kramer's summary of modernism is helpful for the lay reader seeking enlightenment of art, but as in his other work his attempts to draw a clear line between modernism and postmodernism, other than one is sincere and one isn't, just doesn't work. I, an uninformed reader, just can't see the difference between splatter and maggoty meat, although I admit that lots of excellent art has been brought forth over the last 50 years. These essays, however, make for engrossing reading, particularly the essay on military strategy, which attacks the Bush-Rumsfeld Defense Department, appropriately, from the right.	2004-12-02

A young woman comes into the employ of a 1930s German refugee family who are being supported by a mysterious and peculiar benefactor. Coincidences abound as the novel moves toward its bittersweet but satisfying conclusion. You need to stay with it, but you'll be fascinated by the details of upstate New York and the Bronx as well as glimpses of prewar Germany. I was left wondering what happened to these characters, particularly to the children and to Rose. Certainly their fates were better than the benefactor's or the gigantic scholar's -- and couldn't the scholar get a job teaching at a rabinnical school? The fact that he has more options than he gives himself kept nagging at me. But perhaps his fate was sealed in this godless new world the Mitwissers find themselves in.	2004-11-23

Even as Reed's text is a little lighter on characterization than her beautiful \\"@Expecations,\\" this one makes up for it with the sheer fun she has exploring a future in which thinness has become gospel, and anyone who can't shape up (either obese or anorexic) is expunged. It's a roadtrip through an America caught between the strip-mall-fueled urge to consume and the advertising-fueled desire to look younger and prettier. The best character of all is the Rev. Earl, whose preaching the \\"afterfat\\" hides a bizarre and ultimately distructive secret. The open-ended finale is challenging as well.	2004-08-10

That head leads us back into his life, through his parents' failed but intriguing marriage, his best-friend's love life, a rich, beautiful ex-girlfriend and &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (paging Daisy, anyone?). The wry humor that fills the book (think of using gloves when handling baseball cards or arriving uninvited at a fabulous Hamptons house) makes up for a plot twist that you'll see coming. What is love? Security? Physical attraction? And why can't we love each other the same amount at the same time? And isn't one person's love enough? Occasionally the prose reaches for a false profundity, but overall it's a good, concise read.	2004-07-08

Like all her narrators, Gavin finds that all his self-deceptions explode until all that's left is ready for the redeeming love of Jesus Christ. This is an explicit book, but Howatch has never flinched from sex -- after all, sex is a part of our life with God, and what can keep us from God. I was spellbound, Followers of her work from the Starbridge series will be delighted with the ending -- will the loose ends still dangling from the smash-up ending of \\"Mystical Paths,\\" hinted at in \\"The Wonder Worker,\\" finally be tied up? Anyway, Howatch combines the narrative inventiveness of a potboiler with characters we've come to love, particularly Nicholas Darrow, Carta Graham and the rascal Lewis Hall. One key plot point is a little obvious for people who have read her previous books, \\"The Wonder Worker\\" and \\"The High Flyer,\\" but we can forgive her for that -- in a way it adds to our delight and enjoyment as we wait for the other characters to figure out what's going on.	2004-05-06

Elizabeth Graver explores what it means to be a mother (Anna) with a suppressed self-destruction streak who home-schools a child with XP, a disease that makes sunlight toxic. She has a husband and older child; together they head to a camp run by a rich guy whose daughter also has XP. They frolic at night and sleep most of the day. But Anna, an artist, whose husband, Ian, is drawing away from her, finds herself attracted to Hal, the camp's owner. Anna, in reaching for an emotional and poetic voice, tends to repeat herself, which makes the reading more slow-going than it should be. She's also rather annoying; yes, her situation is bleak and one I wouldn't wish upon anyone, but she's so self-obsessed that you want to shake her by the shoulders and tell her to lighten (ha) up. Still, the story is compelling, and Graver draws well Anna's relationship with her two sons, especially Max, the one with XP.	2004-04-23

Here he traces Paul's theological development as he confronts new issues in the church, particularly how to unite people of diverse backgrounds and attitudes toward the Christ. His essential suggestion (it's not really a premise) is that we can take Paul's growing sense of inclusion toward Christians of both Jewish and Gentile background (starting in his harsh condemnation in Galatians and ending with the hymn of Philippians) and extend it to consider people of other religions. Do I agree with this? Not really -- Paul's inclusiveness extended to those who experienced Jesus and no further (consider his hatred of idols). That proved no stumbling block, however. I learned a lot from the book. I particularly appreciated his examination of Philippians, placing the writing of the letter at the end of Paul's ministry when he was a captive in Rome. What's more, it's a book on the New Testament that didn't put me to sleep.	2004-03-17

Alas, the era Chapin remembers is as far gone to us as the era &quot;Follies&quot; intended to evoke. He rarely pauses for breath as he takes us through the thrilling rehearsal period of a musical with cast that mixed young and old and a range of temperaments. The parts where he talks about Yvonne DeCarlo are both fascinating and a little weird.<br />Unintentionally, Chapin puts his finger on what exactly was wrong with &quot;Follies&quot; 33 years ago -- the creators never seemed to have a clear, hit-your-head-with-a-hammer conception of what it all meant. The musical seemed to create itself, and the result baffled as many people as it pleased. The creators even sought out a Harvard undergrad who had written an essay on the show during its Boston tryout. (Read the book to find out who the undergrad was, but rest assured it wasn't Ted Kaczynski.) I was too young to see it, but I really, really wish I was there.<br />The characters of the actors and creative team come through, with the possible exception of Jim Goldman, who seemed to have distanced himself from the cast. Some surprises: Hal Prince gave line readings to the actors, and even stars making a lot of money for the time could routinely make mistakes. Nevertheless, Chapin has a profound sense of decency and understanding, and he never paints any of these people in an overly negative way.<br />Another thing that comes through in Chapin's memoir is his audacious efficiency. Based on this account, Chapin was a dream gofer, coordinating the demands of a script that just kept spinning out of control. I could never have done it. Hats off. <br />While reading the book, I often found myself singing the &quot;Follies&quot; score aloud; it is brilliant, and I'll never understand why critics of the time dismissed Stephen Sondheim's music. Neither, I suspect, did Chapin. For theater buffs, this book will make you yearn to head to your local little theater group and jump right in.	2004-03-06

He identifies the problems with labeling one form of worship &quot;traditional&quot; and another &quot;contemporary.&quot; For one thing, both are based on an Enlightenment paradigm that shied away from ritual and mystery. For another, many people find both kinds of services lacking in depth, and if done without the Spirit, both fail to praise and honor God. His solution, similar to the &quot;convergence&quot; worship advocated by Robert Webber, is to take many styles of music and mix them in a service that reflects an emphasis on &quot;bath, book and meal&quot; -- baptism, the Word of God and the Lord's Supper -- in a joyous and reverent manner. It's also a service that moves beyond tons of words or superficiality to build community and to praise God. Although I disagree with some of his solutions (a pastor splashing her hands in a baptismal font seems irreverent), I find his candor refreshing and his focus on celebrating the Risen Christ a boon.	2002-11-27

The book doesn't go into a lot of depth; it's aimed at a general Christian reader. But his words lend assurance to those of us who search Scripture for truth and for a guide to our faith journey -- a journey that tries to navigate between the contortions of literal readings and the iconoclasm of liberal theology. He is especially cogent when he proposes how the Lambeth Conference should have approached searching for meaning in Scripture -- a love-inspired, serious approach other denominations grappling with issues of the day could learn from. I look forward to reading more of his work.	2002-09-05

But what a great journey! He weaves stories from old Budapest, filled with tragedy, horror and sadness, with the bizarre neuroses of a group of expatriots who flood in to take advantage of post-Communist Hungary. Phillips is extremely cynical when he looks at his GenX profit-seekers, would-be writers and health nuts, but we find ourselves rooting for them. At times laugh-out-loud funny, &quot;Prague&quot; makes you wish you were in Budapest.	2002-09-05

Since then, I've enjoyed reading his reviews both for their soap-opera quality about his life and his unbridled, geeky love of movies. His scatalogical \\"Battlefield Earth\\" review made me laugh out loud; his \\"Toy Story 2\\" review made me weep a little. He and Web site compatriot Moriarty keep me abreast of many of the films I care about.<BR>So I ordered his book off the Amazon link from his Web site, and I finished it in about three days (this isn't heavy reading). I was troubled by the two co-authors -- why does someone who writes for a living need help? Nevertheless, the book is a reasonable facsimile of his singular writing voice. Essentially, the book is half-memoir, half-rant. The memoir part, especially the chapter about his bizarre, sad mother and grandmother, is fascinating. I just wish there had been more of it. He lets us in to how movies affected him in his childhood, but I wanted more detail. Maybe I wanted too much -- another \\"Ghost Light,\\" Frank Rich's marvelous exploration of what it is to love theater. I did enjoy, however, the rundown of his Web site \\"spies,\\" whom he cares a lot about and owes a lot to. His blow-by-blow account of the growth of his Web site is a little sketchy and self-congratulating.<BR>The rest of the book is a jeremiad about the sorry state of Hollywood. The rant is long, windy and not all that original. What's more, his reviews undercut his arguments. In the book, he rails against badly plotted, unoriginal explosion-fests, yet he's liked some of the worst culprits -- \\"X-Men\\" for one. He does hit on one big factor -- how many people feel shut out of movies. I go through weeks during the summer when there simply isn't anything for me to see. I remember going to the movies with my parents when I was in elementary school to see big-screen epics that could entertain adults and kids -- \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" \\"Ben-Hur,\\" the original \\"Planet of the Apes.\\" Now movies are either gross or dumb or both. Harry Knowles wants better movies, but I'm not sure we want the same better movies. Certainly there must be room for both of us.<BR>So do I recommend the book? Sure, why not. It's fun spending three days inside Harry's head. For his next book, perhaps, I'd like to see him explore movie themes the way he does in the back -- his top 10 and bottom 10 movie lists are absorbing and insightful.	2002-03-02

The prose has youthful vigor, and Hollander captures the quality of life on Long Island -- unless you're rich and well-educated, Long Island is a dead end; hard to get off of, yet easy to leave. The central romance between the lead male character, a budding, if lazy, bureaucrat, and his girlfriend is affecting. In one hilarious bit, a group of characters finds a car stereo predicting the group's immediate future. These works are certainly promising, but Hollander needs to marshal his talents and focus them to greater literary effect; his themes here -- yeah, modern life's a drag if you don't have an education and your parents were abusive or stuck -- are shallow. But I'd buy his next book.	2001-07-05

The novel really glides along, and the prose is precise and clever. You get a real sense of what it was like to grow up in L.A. But this is light fare, lighter certainly than the duck recipe that does one character in. These lives don't have great meaning; like the city they inhabit, they're mainly surface. But for debut fiction, it's assured and clever. I enjoyed spending time with these people, particularly Fanny, the matriarch who seems to surf through her life.

The collection begins with Cheever and ends with Perlman, which pretty much sums up the golden years of the magazine. The pleasures here range from a story of lingering urban dread by William Maxwell to a hilarious tale of an intellectual loser by Jonathan Franzen. Updike's story both paints a true picture of New York in the snow and returns to his favorite theme -- infidelity. Philip Roth has a hilarious entry about a famous writer hounded by a game show contestant -- even funnier if you've seen &quot;Quiz Show.&quot; The collection made me homesick for New York. It's one of the best books I read in 2000.	2001-01-02

Many authors are using playlands -- Las Vegas for Tim Powers, theme parks for George Saunders -- as metaphors for contemporary society. Thus the bizarre casino land in which Henry is raised, and the makeshift families he moves between, are something he may need to escape from but can't. And Reuss perhaps says this is a good thing. What is this novel saying about gnosticism and faith? And what's that whole zoo thing? Of course, in every novel there's a supreme intelligence hovering over the action -- that of the writer. Here the writer's hand seems to be forcing the action into the form of an allegory. Don't get me wrong; it's an enjoyable read. Do the good guys win? Not necessarily.	2001-01-02

Father Urban, exiled to Garrison Keillor's prairie,takes his lumps and does the best with what he's dealt. And in two courageous acts late in the novel, he discovers, almost by accident, the meaning of Christianity and of his priesthood.

The lead story, &quot;Pastoralia,&quot; repeats Saunders' obsession  with fake theme parks.

The prose is sleek, the images  are precise and the characters are people you've known if you grew up in  this milieu. Self-absorbed? Somewhat. But don't let that get in your way.  The ending is actually pretty funny, in an odd way.	2000-06-16

Susan Howatch's books chronicle people for whom spiritual matters are life and death. In this book, a young candidate for the priesthood follows his psychic powers in search of a man whose supposed death has left a vacuum in  many lives. It's at times hair-raising, surprising and utterly involving.	1999-04-13
