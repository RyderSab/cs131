Training dedicated to a specific application & color correction- like my FCP training DVD by Digital Film Tree is much better because it teaches the theory AND the tool - so you cover both angles while this was just the theory. But that may be what you want - or your NLE may not have a book about color correction dedicated to it. If you're a FCP user, there's a book called 'Advanced Finishing Techniques' in the Apple Training Series that I would recommend over this one.	2005-03-01

I have in fact read the whole book cover to cover and I own a $1000 digital camera and a $200 inkjet printer and I have as a hobbyist done a tremedous amount of printing using this type of middle class printing. So I thought a book on the subject would help fill in some holes in my knowledge. In a nutshell my problem with this book is that it is without a doubt not meant for someone like me using this \\"middle class\\" tools. I found the book incredibly elitist, the only thing I really learned was I must buy more & better equipment to be a real artist - what I have isn't good enough apparently. For example apparently you need at least 8 megapixels to print an 8x10? My other main issue is that after having read the entire book, when I go to print an image nothing has changed at all - I still do everything exactly the same simply because none of the information in the book applied to me unless I buy thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands dollars worth of additional gear - and in general there was no info on how to use this gear specifically either - just you should have it. I've read an enormous amount of technical books over the years and on average most are great in that they strive to empower the reader with the skills and knowledge to achieve better things - but this book seems to achieve the reverse - unempowering the reader with lists and graphs and photos of things you can't ever possibly obtain. It's quite unique.  <br /> <br />So honestly if you're a regular human being who has a camera and printer then this book is really not intended for you. The book's title and back cover do indicate otherwise, there's a photo of a consumer digital camera and nice write up that sounds like it'll apply to you in the same way a fortune cookie is vague. The experience level is also listed at beginner to expert in an attempt to net as many potential buyers as possible.  <br /> <br />Who would this book be good for? Perhaps if you are working or beginning to work in a professional print shop that has many professional fine artist clients - this would be a good buy. Or if you're rich and can buy anything you feel like, this would serve as a good catalog.  The other advantage if you're rich is you get to be a \\"real\\" artist. There were a few parts I did like, one section of 5 pages had a really good overview of the steps to take in color managing your system - if you have the gear of couse, but nonetheless it was useful to know. Unfortunately many chapters just feel entirely useless, the author seems obessed with print permanence which is how long prints will last, he goes on and on about it, always avoiding specifics and generalizing and stressing the importance of performing your own permanence tests and although it is useful on one level it could of been 4 pages not 35. At one point he suggests if you don't have time to perform your own tests you can contract out your permanence testing - does this sound like you? If so I recommend this book to you.	2005-03-01

The book is definately good, and the DVD that includes video instruction and extra tutorials is great. Having read a great many other Photoshop books, I'd say this book did a decent job of covering the standard tools, but not a great job. That would be my only negative comment, and don't get me wrong, the book is very worthwhile. It's great to have a book focussed on preparing material for video. Methods of importing graphics into an NLE are covered quite well, and there's an appendix section that covers the best method for each NLE application.	2003-08-26

I'll confirm that the book had errors, sometimes annoying ones. The technical mistakes divide the book's useful customer base in half. If you feel you have enough software/Adobe experience to recognize when the book is wrong, then I'd still recommend this book, as the format of CIAB is great. If you're newer to professional software, and think you'll be thrown into disarray when the book instructs you to do something that doesn't work - then this may not be a good purchase. I'm glad I bought the book, as I now know how to use InDesign.	2003-02-23

This turned out to be a poor reason to buy the book, and I was disappointed with much of the content.<br />I suppose technically speaking this book does cover techniques that professionals use, but it doesn't really cover them to a professional extent. You can buy whole Photoshop books dedicated to things like restoration or color correction. In this book, they have brief chapters. Maybe this book is supposed to be an introduction to professional techiniques?? <br />Even then, I found some of the approaches to be questionable. On many occassions there was definately a more flexible, less destructive approach to the presented problem (ie. a more PROFESSIONAL way). Books I've read that I thought were good professional photographic technique books would include 'PS Artistry', 'PS Master Class', 'Photoshop Color Correction.' I gave it 3 stars (cause you can't pick 2.5), and because it might be useful to someone else; as well it didn't strike me as a hit n' run scam book. Maybe it would be alright for an intermediate user, but check out other books too.	2003-02-23

What I liked about this color correction book over the other leading one (Dan Somebody's &quot;Professional Photoshop&quot;) is that this one is RGB centeric. There's correction examples done in CMYK and Lab, but RGB correction is considered by the author to be the master working space -and rightly so, well at least for me with RGB sources and RGB output. It's important to understand that this is not a beginner book, nor even an intermediate level user book, it'd be best for someone who is already very good at using photoshop, but wants to know more specifically about color correcting photographs.<br />There are some wonderful techniques in this book for mixing channels, and luminosity and cool contrast tricks. There's a good chapter on sharpening too.<br />My problem with the book was with the included CD, the images are way too low rez to even bother working on. It's best to use your own images anyway, but there are times when I would liked to have tried his example (and sometimes the example image isn't even present on the CD). But don't let the worthless CD discourage you from the book, which was otherwise very informative.	2003-01-01

But I did learn more. I learned tricks to be more efficient, and now know more techiniques and shortcuts. So it was worth the time spent reading, in time saved later.<br />Many chapter are dedicated to non-editing stuff, like titling and compositing, which he explains are now important for editors to know. Another reviewer or 2 seemed to think the author was a poor teacher, I didn't seem to have a problem with the text, which was generally well written and logically presented.	2002-12-25

It covers everything of relevance to digital photography including things that many books skip like copyright infringement, & shooting etiquette. Scanners, monitors, software, computers are all covered and explained as to how they relate to photography. The text is aided with tons of great pictures, and diagrams explaining key concepts.<br />A large section of the book is dedicated to digital manipulation, but instead of giving specific instructions on how to execute photoshop commands, the general problem is explained and the general solution is given. Like if the background is too distracting, try desaturating it. For me this was great, I appreciated the ideas and suggestions more than what could have been wasted space on beginner photoshop tutorials. So the book doesn't teach photoshop, good for some, bad for others.<br />Generally the book is full of a lot of technical information and creative ideas for taking & making more interesting photos. I thought it was great.	2002-12-25

I really struggled through the first chapter, but after that is stared to make more sense. This book is very technical, and many topics like 10-bit logarithmic color are definitely complex concepts, but generally the author does an excellent job of explaining them as simply as possible. <br />Explanations for what is happening 'under the hood' of a lot of compositing tools are explained, as well as how to achieve them manually. Stuff like keying, despill, unsharp mask, and defocus operations. I've read the 2 other main compositing textbooks available on Amazon.com, I would say this is definitely better than \\"Digital Compositing In Depth\\", and slightly better than \\"The Art & Science of Digital Compositing\\". It's definitely the most detailed and technical of the 3 books. <br />I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner, it'd be more suited to someone who has composited for a few years and wants to better understand the underlying concepts of their compositing software.	2002-12-24

Scan the titles and note the number of stars his past books have received. He has five 1 star books, twelve 2 star books, and two 3 star books. Surprisely he has no 4 or 5 star books. Shamms has a repuation for writing books of extremely low quality on topics he knows nothing about. He's also infamous for his 'max-the-parameter' style teaching in which he instructs the reader to crank an option to its highest setting to see what it does. He's really a horrible teacher, because he doesn't know the material, doesn't have any artistic ability, doesn't know how to write, and doesn't care about the end product. He also doesn't seem to care about ripping off his fellow man.<br />So enough about him, how was the book? It [stinks]. If you like to waste your money, there are much better ways.	2002-10-20

Based on the books style, I believe it's intended for someone who knows photography well and is just moving to photoshop. It's definately not supposed to be an advanced photoshop book, but the problem I see with it, is that it's really NOT a great introduction book to photoshop either (even for a photographer). Some advanced concepts are dealt with too quickly, and some basics expanded more than nescessary, not to mention some bothersome bad habit techniques he instructs the reader to do. For example Levels are skipped in favour of brightness/contrast. I realize that he wanted to keep the book simple, but for photographers, the basics of Levels should be covered properly.<br />There is some useful and interesting information in the book, but a lot of the times it feels like the author is trying to achieve the proper word count for the chapter. There's also a cheesy advertisement chapter on a particular 3rd party plug-in set that the author &quot;recommends&quot;. He claims they are quite useful to photographers, but they are obviously tasteless, and are all effects that could be achieved manually with a better knowledge of the base version of Photoshop.  <br />I've always liked Adobe's Classroom in a book for learning the basics. And then if you want to pursue the photography angle, I'd recommend following that up with either 'Photoshop 7 Artistry' or 'Photoshop Master Class&quot;, both are fairly advanced but they teach how to make nice images.	2002-10-15

Not these guys. This is a completely new book, that is everything that their old book wasn't. 'Creating Motion Graphics' was a thorough textbook for all the main features of the program. This book takes a different approach, offering 12 varied tutorials that help the reader master managing and problem-solving a project as well as learning version 5's new features.<br />Version 5 features are covered very well. The examples of parenting and 3D and expressions are good pratical real world examples, not just -this how you can warp someones face digitally- like some authors do. There's also a case studies section at the back that focuses on projects from other graphic companies, which is great also. I particularly enjoyed the lesson on using After Effects to export a Flash Animation.<br />If you don't have 'Creating Motion Graphics', I'd recommend that first, as all of its teachings are still valid (just no v5 features are covered). This book assumes a certain amount of experience, so if you're a beginner, classroom in a book would be more suitable.	2002-02-04

Mr. Mortier has a strong reputation for his great quantity and consistency low quality/high price computer books. Please understand, this isn't your ordinary computer book - this one has been written by Shamms Mortier.<br />Shamms idea of teaching is to point out the onscreen buttons, and make the reader crank the parameters to their maximum settings to see what they do. Rarely does he explain the underlying concepts of the program or show the reader how to combine concepts to make something useful. Not to mention that his 'art' is of extremely poor taste and quality. This book is BAD. I have a couple working theories as how a book of this low quality was written. First of, Shamms Moritier must have left it to the last minute, the weekend before it was due. I also believe that his monitor must have broken down this weekend, or maybe he doesn't have a monitor, either way he sat down to write this book without the convience of a visual representation of the text. After typing up as much stuff that he could think of off the top of his head, he emailed this text off to the publisher.<br />This is the only explanation that covers all the facts, unless Shamms Mortier is a con-artist.	2002-01-19

This book is loaded with information. Reading the 'basic' chapters will reveal tons of new information about tools you've used hundreds of times before. I was extremely impressed. For a beginner, this is too complex, who wants to learn about velocity graphs right off the bat? Also in order to appreciate all these time saving tips, you must have done things the wrong way for years. It took a very long time to work through this book, if you work at the computer, you will end up putting the book down every paragraph to test something out, if you read it away from the computer, every paragraph justifies a note *try this. Plus this much information is very taxing on your brain; new information = new possibilities. I consider this a 'heavy' read.<br />There is no filler, in fact, it seems because the authors could not pack everything they wanted into the book, the CD includes 12 more TechTips chapters, and 22 in depth tutorials; if you print this stuff out, you've got a 2nd After Effects book. Is this book still relevant with After Effects 5 out? Yes, it would be a waste of the authors time to update this, all of the information still works -just no v5 features are covered that's all. Suberb!	2002-01-04

The author has created a book with techniques and info that are not likely to become dated anytime soon, which is a good thing, but to do this he had to completely avoid application specific information. So the book will work regardless of your preference of software, but this can be frustrating too. Many times I wanted him to confirm that the tool he was describing was 'just like the ______ tool in Photoshop.' Overall the book is solid, what it really is, is a book of compositing techniques that are universal. How and why to achieve certain things.<br />There are chapters on motion tracking, matte creation, formats & aspect ratios. Sections on lighting, shadows, atmosphere, curve editing. There's a interesting 'case studies' section in the back, which breaks down and explain certain composites from movies like Titanic, Star Trek, Independance Day, and a few others. Definately a worthwhile book.	2001-12-20

Topics range from navigation, modelling, and texturing; each topic is introduced and taken to an intermediate understanding. There's lots of shortcut tips, and changing preferences tips.<br />The concepts never go much beyond combining several shapes, or never into building a real world project, but that is for other books. This book gives you the concepts and fundamentals that are required before you can do something really cool. This 3D Max book helps you understand those other 3D Max books.	2001-12-09

Rarely does the author show you how to make a style, most of the time you are instructed to use a default, or worse use one from the CD-ROM -this isn't learning!! <br />The book is well formatted and look's good on a coffee table. The cover is nice, the layout is nice. But they book's content is very shallow. The first 4-5 lessons were pretty good in my opinion but after that the book became very redundant. Every lesson starts with applying a style to slightly different shape, and ends with creating a SLIGHTLY different gif animation in Image Ready. Any half intelligent human would only need 1/4 of this examples. Do you really need someone to show you how to animate a blue sailboat across the screen, then follow that up with how to animate a green sailboat, then a yellow one. Hey Mr. Foster what happens if I'm ever am confronted with a purple sailboat, I won't know what to do?! There was no sailboat lesson really, but my point is the book teaches the same concepts over and over and over. 15 of the 21 lessons are slight variations of the exact same concept.<br />The quality of the end result in most cases is also fairly low. Gif animations are ugly and annoying enough usually, but if you use the authors examples... well, please don't. Examples include, the old text 'Sale' in an exploding star shape animated to fly at the viewer; animations of text dripping and twisting and bending and twirling (all different lessons of course), and looping over and over again. <br />There seem to be 2 types of Photoshop users, those who want to press a button and be immediately sastisfied with an instant 'magic' result, and those who want to understand how the program really works. I would like to think that users with experience (which is this book's target) would not fall into the instant result category, but based on the number of 5 star reviews of this book,this is not the case. I suspect some of these reviewers haven't finished the book, I liked the book when I was on chapter 4.<br />The book should be really be called 'PS 6 Style Application Gimmicktry'. This is not a 5 star book. There are so many great photoshop books available that it would be best to get another one with more insight and less gimmicks. Generally the magic books are a good series, but this one's an exception.	2001-11-26

Like all of Adobe's classroom in a book series, it starts at the basics and works towards more intermediate concepts. &quot;Creating High Impact Motion Graphics&quot; by Trish/Chris Meyer takes over from the intermediate stuff and takes the reader to and beyond the advanced parts of the program (without a doubt, the best book on AFX available -but too complex, and not intended for a beginner).<br />Anyway, back to this book, step by step instructions let you follow along at your own pace, and the CD-ROM provides you with the material. The book is not a reference book, and will only benefit you if you read it (ie. show up for the classes). But definately a good way to start learning After Effects.	2001-11-25

It instead assumes you have some non-linear editing experience. It's intended at getting an experienced editor up to speed with Final Cut Pro. Coming from AVID and Premiere, this book was great for me. Having said that, it could be possible for a beginner to learn Final Cut Pro using this book, possible, but not the book's intention.<br />The book doesn't have tutorials, but you can still follow along on your computer, or, because they're lots of screen captures you can read it away from the computer and simply imagine you're at the computer. The writing is clear and concise, and the topics are organized well. And the book is cheap!! Recommended.	2001-11-23

The book however turned out to be much better than the course I'd taken for a number of reasons, including: you can work at your own pace; you can stop to experiment; you can re-read any part that is causing you confusion. Many of the lessons I re-did 3-4 times just to make sure I'd mastered the techniques. This book is also much cheaper than a course. <br />For con, as another reviewer commented, the book after instructing you to perform a feature, often does not explain the 'why' behind that feature. This is unfortunate, but considering the techniques taught aren't the most complicated aspects of photoshop, the reader in most cases will be able to deduce 'why' a feature worked a certain way.<br />This was the first Photoshop book I've read, and I've now read 6 more. I was quite happy with the foundation it provided for learning Photoshop. A good first Photoshop book.	2001-11-23

Even though this book was written for Photoshop 4, nearly all of it's content still can be applied to the newest version of Photoshop. I suspect in 200 years this book will be just as valuable. What it teaches are extremely advanced technigues that are and always will be at the core of photoshop. This book definately changed the way I use photoshop and even the way I look at an image when I first import it in. In brief it covers channels, calculations, transfer modes, and selections/paths.<br />I've read 7 different photoshop books, and some 30 other computer software books and this is by far the best computer book I've found. If you want to know about plug-ins, filters, and the new liquidify feature, then this isn't the book, nor would it be a good book for an beginner.

The lessons are well thought out and advance the reader from basic concepts to intermediate, and some advanced concepts. I liked this book over a lot of reference-type books in that it forced me to press the buttons and understand the concepts by doing them (&quot;Learning by doing&quot; -quote from back cover of book)<br />There was a chapter on HTML which isn't a prerequiste for learning dreamweaver, but useful. There's also chapters on javascript behaviours, layout, typography, and using GeoCity to put a website online. The book is a decent reference, although its strength is in its tutorials, and as reference it is unable to cover all of Dreamweaver's features. It also only covers the standard version of Dreamweaver, and not UltraDev. Overall, the book is a good purchase if you need to learn dreamweaver 4 and plan to actually read it through.	2001-10-25

In fact, I read it more like a novel. He passes his knowledge, and experience to the reader through stories of things he's done, and has seen in his many years recording, producing and creating sound for motion pictures. Some is fact, some is opinion, but his opinions are clear and are backed-up with his own unique style of logic. <br />There are also more technical areas of the book that cover topics like mic placement, how to record cars/explosions/dialogue, how to catalogue your own sound effects libary, etc. This book would also be useful to directors and producers who want better sound in their films. There's definately lots to learn about sound, and the author has done a good job giving the reader an idea about what motion picture sound is all about.	2001-04-27

The 1st part is the technical part which familarizes you with the techniques the author uses most. The 2nd section focuses on his art,his vision, and the technical details of how his images are accomplished. <br />The Technical section was superb;in the other 4 or 5 photoshop books I've read, I've never had Curves explained to me so thoroughly. His larger and more 'artistic' section is very interesting also, although at times he feels and sounds like a crazy artist, his superb techical skills make the book informative and worthwhile regardless of whether you connect with his work. <br />This book isn't for beginners. Like Bert Monroy's Photorealistic Techniques book, the author shares with the reader his hobby, passion, and years of experience. Those working with photos as their chief source material, especially those combining photographs, will benefit the most from John Caponigro's expertise.	2001-04-07

I found it was superb at getting me up and started with Illustrator. Many other reviewers accused this book of being a rehash of the manual; this is true. The book in fact contains less info than the manual, and is much less of a reference, BUT unlike the manual, it has tutorials which start with the fundamentals and work towards more advanced techniques (much like a CLASSROOM course would). I am a normal person who learned Illustrator using this book, and was never upset by any aspect of it. I'm not sure what everyone else expected their copies to do, they won't take out the garbage or mow the lawn, it's a book, try reading it.	2001-03-28

But from a learning point of view these 2 CDs are great. Video instruciton is just a great way to absorb information. The CD can be used as a reference (to find a particular topic) or as a beginning to end kind of course. The advantage of CD training over some of my VHS trainging tapes is that it is easy to see the fine detail of Final Cut Pro's options and text boxes. In terms of content, all the preference options are covered, all the trimming and editing types are covered, as are all the menu options. It's a briefing on the whole program, althougt there are no tutorials.<br />If you go to the VTC web site, you are allowed to view 7 or 8 movies movies to see what they're like. Also available is a single Final Cut Pro Advanced CD intended to follow up these two.  I would definately recommend this to someone switching from another non-linear editing program to final cut. These 2 CDs do not teach you how to edit, they teach where to find Final Cut Pro's buttons, and why or when to use them.	2001-02-23

The title is extremely misleading, as there is no complexity at all to what author teaches. I also question the authors experience using this program. If you want to stunt your learning, and expose your mind to a gallery of medicore art then you will enjoy this. If you want to learn something about 3D, there are plenty of good 3D max books available. This one should really be called 'please buy my bad book.'	2001-02-09

For me, I never would have thought of covering my scanner with sand, or tinfoil to create backgrounds. He suggests using compositing tracker data to capture the motion of a natural object like a feather falling, and then applying that motion to your own animation -again I never would have thought of this. The book is full of creative tidbits. It's a &quot;wow, if that's possible, than I could also do this&quot; kind of book. It gets you thinking about all the possibilities and potential that exists for your videos.<br />The book is well formatted, short, and easy to read. Took me 4 days to read. Recommended.	2001-02-04
US	50279995	R33BFKX7XDGOH4	1576104311	408575031	Digital Compositing In Depth: The Only Guide to Post Production for Visual Effects in Film	Books	2	7	7	N	N	There's a lot of wasted paper here	I can't say the book doesn't have any useful information within its pages, because it does have some. But considering its size, it doesn't have much. The author could have written 2 seperate books, one on compositing, and one on Digital Fusion, and still used less paper. At one point, he spends 15 pages showing the reader how to preform a simple time-stretching feature on every piece of compositing software. Then he uses 15 pages to show you how to reverse footage for every piece of compositing software. I found the book very frustrating to try to read from cover to cover. He also tells you constantly to refer to the manuals of programs that are not Digital Fusion. I wouldn't describe the coverage of Digital Fusion are truely 'in depth' either. But someone who uses Digital Fusion would get more out of the book than I did.<br />This book could have been much better, I'm surprised so many people actually like it.	2000-12-23
US	50279995	R3SJRKQL7QN4V2	0201354020	622938519	Real World Digital Photography	Books	4	17	17	N	N	Well organized overview for an intermediate level person	It is very diffucult to write a book useful to absolute beginner's and to professionals who work every day with digital camera equipment. A true professional would probally only find a few chapters worth reading, and a beginner would struggle through the Photoshop lessons. The book in my opinion would be most useful to anyone in the intermediate range that is interesting in learning more. I read the book cover to cover, and found that it filled in a lot of holes in my knowledge on the topic. Overall the book provides an excellent overview of digital photography. <br />And like the reviewer who gave the book 2 stars said, specialized books on more specific topics would be more benefical. For example there's a chapter on Quicktime VR; if you really want to learn about this topic, you're better off buying a book on it specifically. For photoshop, a book like Photoshop Artistry 5.5 would be far superior. But if you're looking for an overview of digital photography, this book is great.	2000-12-12

It is not for the creative person, and offers little to nothing on the how to make dynamic layered audio in post. It's about notch filters, and VITC timecode. Very techincal, very non-creative. Maybe that's the point, but is wasn't for me.	2000-12-12

This book contains a staggering amount of information. An unbelieveable wealth of information on Photoshop. I became 100 times better, and 100 times faster at using photoshop after having read this book. <br />The amount of time one must spend working their way through this book is also quite staggering. It's quite a commitment of time. But worth it.	2000-12-12

If you're unfamiliar with it, it is entirely tutorial based. And excellent. This book includes 15 tutorials, all of which are worthwhile. The amazing part about the book is that is it is easy enough for beginners to follow, while providing plenty of tips, and techniques for the more advanced user. Definately beneficial to beginners and intermediate, and possibly some advanced users too. If you read the book, you'll know the program well.	2000-11-08

The authordemonstrates, at no point in the 500+ pages any insight, or knowledgeof After Effects.  Even if you accept that this book is a plug-in guide, it fails at that too.  There are no tips or examples of how to use any of this plug-ins tastefully.  Mr. Mortier simply grabs a random image, and warps it into an ugly mess.	2000-04-04
