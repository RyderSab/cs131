US	49946398	R383LQMMKC1OO2	0762409843	455460502	Runner's World Complete Book Of Running (Runner's World Complete Books)	Books	3	47	56	N	N	This book is basically a hodgepodge of collected articles.	Despite what the title and subtitle suggests, this doesn't <br />provide everything you need to run for fun, fitness and <br />competition. While it probably a 3 1/2 *** to 4**** book, <br />in terms of content, there are more comprehensive books <br />on the subject of running. This is a good book for getting <br />a base understanding of running, and it only offers  <br />training programs for one type of road race, namely the <br />marathon. If you want something that covers training for <br />shorter races, forget it. That doesn't mean the book is a <br />total loss for those who purchase it. If you are looking <br />for a tome on the sport, look no further than Dr. Timothy <br />Noakes' Lore of Running, which is nearly 1000 pages of <br />information from a physician who is also a runner. It <br />doesn't discuss specific training exercises with regards <br />to weights like other running books, or it doesn't even  <br />mention which exercises to do in terms of stretching/flexibility, nor is there any mention of <br />pylometrics, which is used by some competitive runners.  <br />The book is fairly narrow in scope, geared more for  <br />road racers of the marathon persuasion mostly. If you <br />want to run some track race or cross country race, this <br />book is probably of somewhat limited value to you. Another <br />problem is the book is fairly expensive consider the amount <br />of information is provided in the pages, considering this  <br />is basically a rehash of topics already discussed in  <br />Runners' World, along with other running magazines and  <br />books. <br />  The book is organized as follows: <br /> <br />CONTENTS <br /> <br />Introduction.................................................xi <br /> <br />Part 1.

US	49946398	R2309WWTW3A9JM	1579547419	428859174	The Principles of Running: Practical Lessons from My First 100,000 Miles	Books	4	12	13	N	N	This is a  pretty good basic book on running.	If you're an advanced or intermediate runner, you probably <br />understand most of what is covered already. In my opinion, <br />this book is more for the beginner runner, or the runner who <br />is returning to the sport after a long layoff. However, even <br />respected runners such as Frank Shorter (1972 Olympic Gold <br />Medalist Men's Marathon), Joan Benoit Samuelson (1984 Olympic <br />Gold Medalist Women's Marathon), and Jeff Galloway have  <br />endorsed the book. The author himself is the winner of the  <br />1968 Boston Marathon. However, that is not the point. The <br />point is that this book is compact and easy to read. Someone <br />in elementary school who is starting out as a runner could <br />benefit from this book, even though it is probably intended <br />more for high school runners and older runners. <br />  In the introduction, the author says the book is only to <br />cover the basics. If you want a tome on running that is <br />comprehensive, I suggest Timothy Noakes' book The Lore <br />of Running, which is nearly 1000 pages.  The Principles <br />section is essentially a summary of what the topic he is <br />discussing. It is written in a nice sequential order,  <br />even though you can use it as a reference guide. I am <br />deducting a star because it is brief, and doesn't contain <br />everything you need to know about running, but then again <br />that wasn't the point of this book, since it would be  <br />redundant. I would recommend getting additional books on <br />running if you're a serious runner and are looking for <br />something more comprehensive. It lacks training schedules <br />for anything besides the marathon in this book, and getting <br />started towards running if you're not running already. <br /> The breakdown of the book is as follows: <br />Introduction  <br /> <br />Part I: The Joy of Running <br />        For The Health Of It <br />        The Real Runner's High <br /> <br />Part II: First Steps <br />Getting Started <br />         It's Okay To Go Slow <br />         Motivation <br />         Aches and Pains     <br />         Blisters <br />         The 10-Percent Rule <br />         Running and Walking <br /> <br />Part III: Women <br />          Safety <br />          Menstruation <br />          Pregnancy  <br />          Menopause <br />          Special Concerns <br /> <br />Part IV:  Equipment <br />          Shoes <br />          Apparel <br />          Heart-Rate Monitors <br />          Treadmills <br />          Indoor Exercise <br /> <br />Part V:   Nutrition <br />          Carbohydrates <br />          Fats <br />          Proteins <br />          Vitamins and Minerals <br />          Before and after a Run <br />          On The Run <br />          Drinks, Bars and Gels <br />          Vegetarian Diet <br /> <br />Part VI:  Warming Up and Cooling Down <br />          Hard and Easy Workouts <br />          Progressive Training <br />          Hills <br />          Cross-Training <br />          Groups <br />          Long Runs <br />          Tempo Training <br />          Max VO2 <br />          Speed-Form Training <br />          Burnout <br /> <br />Part VII: Weight Loss <br />          Running Works Best <br />          The Running Diet <br />          A 24-Hour Program <br />          Maximum Weight Loss <br /> <br />Part VIII: Weather <br />           Heat <br />           Cold <br />           Dark, Snow, Ice and Rain <br />            <br />Part IX: Injury Prevention and Treatment <br />         Overuse Injuries <br />         Stretching <br />         Ice <br />         Pain Relievers <br />         Shinsplits <br />         Knee Injuries <br />         Achilles Tendinitis <br /> <br />Part X:  Racing <br />         The Decision To Race <br />         Goals <br />         Mental Preparation <br />         Tapering <br />         The Start <br />         Pace <br /> <br />Part XI: The Marathon <br />         Commitment <br />         Building-Up <br />         Essential Element <br />         Yasso 800s <br />         Taper <br />         Carbohydrate-Loading <br />         Final 24 Hours <br />         Early and Middle Miles <br />         The Wall  <br />         Recovery        <br />        <br />Part XII:  A Lifetime of Running <br />           Slowing Down, Feeling Great <br />           Use It or Lose It	2004-08-30
US	49946398	RPYE5VB2JG7HZ	0071383085	970110427	Alberto Salazar's Guide to Road Racing : Championship Advice for Faster Times from 5K to Marathons	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Great resource book for all road runners:  beginners &amp; elite	Since Alberto Salazar was a former world-class runner <BR>himself, before retiring from competitive running, this<BR>book is definitely worth checking out. It also helped that<BR>elite runners like Bill Rodgers and Mary Decker Slaney also<BR>had positive comments regarding this book. <BR>  This book is useful because it takes you from preparing<BR>race, the race itself, and the post-race routines. It also<BR>discusses injuries, and how to deal with them, and other <BR>associated topics, like the psychological aspect of running,<BR>and basics like weight training, crosstraining and nutrition.<BR>  If you're a beginner or even a veteran runner, you will<BR>find useful advice, because there was a few things I picked<BR>up in this book that I don't recall seeing in other running<BR>books, and viceversa. If I had a complaint, is that it only<BR>had a sample training schedule for someone training for their<BR>first marathon, not including his own elite schedule when he<BR>was running 120 miles or more weekly. This schedule was not<BR>of any use to me, because my weekly training mileage already<BR>exceeds the highest weekly mileage suggested in the book.<BR>  However, despite this, it is well worth the investment,<BR>if you plan to enter a road race at some point in the future.<BR>The topics are logically organized in a chronological fashion<BR>that makes the book easy and simple to read. FYI, if you want<BR>a sneak peek, here's a look at the Table of Contents, and you<BR>can decide if this book is for you or you can take a pass and<BR>look for another book that will fit your goals more suitably.<BR>  <br />CONTENTS<BR>Acknowledgements                                        ix<BR>Introduction From the 100 Yard Dash to                   1<BR>the Ultramarathon      <BR>    <BR>Part 1.

The Rock and Kurt Angle had hardcover books that were<BR>much broader in scope and depth, even though they were in the business a shorter period of time.  <BR>  He does talk about his Horsemen days, his relationships<BR>with Ole, Tully, Ric, and others. He talks about various<BR>bookers, and doesn't hold back on what he thinks about<BR>Bill Watts, Vince McMahon Jr., and others. Arn Anderson is<BR>probably one of the most underrated pro wrestlers, <BR>considering his technical proficieny. The book mostly<BR>centers on his life outside the ring, especially his <BR>family, like his deceased grandmother, his wife, and his<BR>kids, and also his life on the road as a pro wrestler.<BR>  I had to deduct one star for the fact it is under 200<BR>pages, and another star because he talked to the readers<BR>as if they were marks. I'm not saying don't buy it, but<BR>this should be a lower priority in terms of books, when<BR>compared to such books like Sex, Lies & Headlocks, Bobby<br />Heenan's book, Fred Blassie's book, Owen Hart's book,<BR>Stu Hart's book and Roddy Piper's book. These books are<BR>a few examples that give more bang for the buck in my <BR>opinion. It's not a bad book by any means, but not an<BR>outstanding must-read, which is a shame, considering<BR>the great career the man had as a pro wrestler.	2003-11-24

The language<BR>is very simple to understand, and provides useful <BR>charts with regards to times in age-class groups, and<BR>how they would rank in a field of runners, from your<BR>back of the pack runners to your elite runner. It also<BR>accounts for clothing, warming up, cooling down,<BR>and everything imaginable related to running.

Bob and<BR>Shelley-Lynn really know what they are talking about,<BR>and even the seasoned veterans might find it useful.<BR>I have been running off and on since 1983, but I <BR>didn't have any real ideas of how to train and eat<BR>right until I read this book with regards to <BR>competitive running. This book is highly recommended<BR>if you intend to race competively in the 5K, 10K,<BR>1/2 marathon and/or marathon. This should be your<BR>Running Bible. If you haven't ran in a while, I<BR>suggest consult your family physician before you<BR>begin training, especially if you're really out<BR>of shape, overweight, and a smoker or drinker.<BR>It's probably best to use it as a reference guide<BR>if you don't have the time to read through all<BR>the book at once.<br />This book is<BR>broken down into sections and chapters as follows:<br />Introduction: Challenge of Competitive Running<BR>PART I: Basic Training<BR> 1.

It's about Stu Hart, patriarch of the most<BR>successful family in pro wrestling. If you're an avid fan of<BR>pro wrestling, or a casual one, this book is for you. Last<BR>year, Stu's youngest daughter, Diana, released a book about<BR>her family, called Under The Mat: Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family. <BR>  Amazon, didn't carry the book, and it turned out <BR>that decision turned out to be the correct one, as the<BR>book has been recalled by the publisher, HBFenn, and is<BR>no longer available. The book was the source of bitter<BR>animosity, and led to a lawsuit being filed by Owen's<BR>widow, Martha, about content in that particular book.<BR>Needless to say, this book doesn't delve into the murky<BR>side and shouldn't be a source of controversy like the<BR>aforementioned book was. I am one of the lucky ones<BR>who has a signed copy of this book (author and subject<BR>both autographed the book).<BR>  This book describes Stu Hart's upbringing as a poor <BR>Prairie boy, and his subsequent journey into the world of pro<BR>wrestling. He was born in rural Saskatchewan in May 1915. <BR>  He endured hardship with his family when his father was<BR>in charge. Jonathan Wong's review for this title provides <BR>an excellent skeletal framework of the book itself. <BR>   It does cover his early athletic career as an Olympic<BR>hopeful for Canada's wrestling team, which was cut short<BR>by World War II, and also his days with the Edmonton <BR>Eskimos professional football team in Canada. There is <BR>also discussion of the events that led to the formation <BR>of Stampede Wrestling, and predecessors like Wildcat <BR>Wrestling and Big Time Wrestling, as well as programs, <BR>like Mat Time, which was a preview show shown on Fridays <BR>before the news, and a Sunday TV program as well. It <BR>also discusses the tactics rival promoters used to <BR>try to buy him out. Eventually Stu bought them out.<BR>  His relationship with Helen is discussed in vivid<BR>detail, from the courtship to his mother-in-law's<BR>disapproval at first. She felt Helen deserved better.<BR>  However, eventually Stu was able to win over Helen,<BR>whom he affectionately referred to as Tiger.<BR>  This book talks about the good times and lean times<BR>of Stampede Wrestling, as well as the pivotal role of<BR>a man who would play an integral part of the history<BR>of the promotion, Ed Whalen. Ed Whalen, was originally<BR>considering a career in medicine when he was in <BR>university, but he eventually ended up in journalism,<BR>and his nasal twang and unabashed support for the<BR>babyfaces over heels every time made him a legend.<BR>  Discussion of the Bret Hart-Shawn Michaels 1997<BR>Survivor Series match itself, and the circumstances <BR>involved surrounding the aftermath are brought to <BR>the forefront. There is also detailed discusssion<BR>surrounding the events of Owen Hart's death, which<BR>occurred during a May 1999 WWF (as the WWE was <BR>known at the time) PPV, and the ensuing legal <BR>fallout is discussed, as well as Stu's decision to<BR>shut down Stampede Wrestling in 1984. <BR>  As Jonathan has pointed out there is friction in<BR>the Hart family. Bruce, Diana, and Ellie are part<BR>of one faction, while Bret heads up an opposing<BR>faction. These factions are with regards how to <BR>deal with Vince McMahon and family after Owen <BR>died. It is also thought that Bruce, who wanted<BR>to revive Stampede Wrestling, was upset at Bret,<BR>who didn't. There is discussion about when the<BR>WWF (as the WWE was known back then) came to<BR>Alberta in 2001 for Monday Night Raw and <BR>SmackDown!, and the 10 minute ovation Stu<BR>received when he was announced in his hometown<BR>in Calgary. Bret opposed his father going to <BR>RAW, based on the bitter animosity.<BR>   Other topics discussed include Stu Hart's<BR>legendary Dungeon, and how he made grown men,<BR>many bigger than himself, howlin pain when <BR>undergoing training there. It was also an<BR>effective discipline tool for rearing his <BR>children. Stu is from the old school of <BR>pro wrestling thought...so he is a bit on<BR>the conservative side with a strong moral<BR>fibre. He didn't complain very much even<BR>though he knew he was getting cheated, as <BR>in his dealings with the City of Calgary,<BR>regarding his parcels of land. The Hart<BR>House itself is a topic for discussion.<BR>It's a grand mansion located on the <BR>outskirts of Calgary and sits on an <BR>attractive parcel of land.<BR>  Another interesting topic that is discussed is<BR>his relationship with other sports superstars, <BR>especially heavyweight boxers like Joe Louis, <BR>Muhammad Ali, Jack Dempsey and Rocky Marciano, who <BR>worked with him in some capacity or met him.<BR>The boxer-wrestler debate is brought up again in <BR>this book, but I will let the reader decide in his <BR>or her own mind what would happen.<BR>  I would recommend this book over Diana <BR>Hart's book for several reasons. This book is <BR>more accurate, and doesn't really air the <BR>family's dirty laundry, like Diana's<BR>tell-all book last year. Finally, you will<BR>be able to get this book, while Diana's book<BR>has been recalled.<BR>   This book delves into Stu Hart the man<BR>at all levels: promoter, wrestler, husband<BR>and father, and distinguished recepient of<BR>the Order of Canada. The book ends with<BR>discussion of Helen's passing and the <BR>memorial service, and how Stu and Helen's<BR>cat deal with it after she died. It's a<BR>pretty fitting end to the book.	2002-08-15

This<BR>book is very explicit in content. She tells about her<BR>impressions of the various promotions she worked for,<BR>various promoters, and wrestlers. She doesn't hold anything<BR>back, like her feud with Lori Fullington, inside and <BR>outside the ring. Fullington is the wife of the wrestler<BR>better known as The Sandman, especially to ECW and WCW<BR>fans. This book also talks about her sexual encounters with <BR>Jason Hervey, Sting (the ex pro-wrestler, not the rock<BR>star), Jim Kelly, Rod Brind'amour, Bill Fralic, Tom<BR>Zenk, Eric Watts and others. She also talks about her relationship with her ex-husband Eddie Gilbert, and how <BR>much it hurt when she received a phonecall from Paul E. <BR>(Paul Heyman) about the tragic circumstances surrounding <BR>the death of Hot Stuff. She also talks about Ted Turner <BR>and Vince Mc Mahon.<BR>  It details how she had a WWF contract and taped segments<BR>of Missy's Manor, but how she left the organization shortly<BR>afterwards to be with Gilbert. This book is pretty graphic<BR>in content, but I don't know if I would give it five stars,<BR>only because while the information revealed is shocking, <BR>  I feel it could have been written better. This isn't a<BR>book for a young child, but some of the accounts she tells<BR>would make good copy, or sell well on a daytime TV talkshow<BR>like Jerry Springer, Ricki Lake, Jenny Jones or something<BR>along those lines, or perhaps even Howard Stern, or even<BR>daytime TV soap operas themselves. I'm glad she's trying<BR>to get her life back on track. Also the rumors of former<BR>valet Dark Journey and her sexual relationship with Dick<BR>Slater are briefly discussed, as are the women of ECW she<BR>had contact with (Francine, Lori Fullington, Beulah, <BR>Kimona, and others).	2002-01-03

It starts out chronicling<BR>his life in a town just outside of Pittsburgh, and his <BR>life with his siblings and parents. It says his family<BR>was athletic, and a priority was placed on sports. He<BR>became quite gifted in football and amateur wrestling.<BR>He had offers from quite a few colleges, but decided<BR>Clarion College was the best place for him. <BR>He also discusses the rigors behind training for the <BR>Olympics, and what he had to do to train and prepare<BR>himself for that, and how, he was an undersized <BR>heavyweight wrestler in college. <BR>  He also discusses the way he handles his father's<BR>death. He is basically content with life in the WWF,<BR>but he has a few complaints. All in all it was a well<BR>written book. It is definitely more in depth and more<BR>interesting to read than The Rock Says or If You Only<BR>Knew by Chyna in my opinion. Chyna's book left me with<BR>the feeling that she is a miserable person, and she has<BR>a lot of issues to deal with. It definitely had a very<BR>negative vibe surrounding it. The Rock's book was more<BR>positive and upbeat in nature, but I question the <BR>decision of releasing a book when he had wrestled only<BR>2 years in the business at the time of the book's <BR>release date? Of course Angle's book was only two years<BR>as well, but his book seems to have more depth to it.<BR>Kurt Angle is a talented wrestler, but he isn't too bad<BR>as a writer.

This book is more about Ted's personal lifestory as it<BR>is about pro wrestling. This book gives us the account<BR>of how his father died in the ring, and his ambition<BR>towards football in his teen years. He also discusses<BR>the tough times he had when he was starting out, and <BR>his faith in religion. He also talks about his time<BR>spent away from his family and how he wanted to spend<BR>more time with his family and less time on the road. <BR>This book is more like an autobiography than just <BR>about pro wrestling, even though it is mentioned.

This is a great introduction into Mick Foley's world. <BR>Even though I read this book in December 1999, I think<BR>it is possibly one of the best autobiographies/biographies<BR>ever written by a professional wrestler. This was his <BR>first attempt at being an author, and he did remarkably<BR>well.<BR>  He discusses in the book the matches he and his friends<BR>had as kids, and the crazy stunts they did (jumping off<BR>the roof of a house for example) to mimic their favorite<BR>stars. He also discusses how he spent weekends training<BR>at Dominic DeNucci's pro wrestling training camp, while<BR>he juggled going to school. DeNucci was an ex pro wrestler,<BR>who was in the WWF. He also talked about sleeping in his<BR>car as well.<BR>  His discussion of the life on the independent circuit<BR>and in Japan is very interesting, as are the numerous<BR>types of matches he has been involved in his career.<BR>He isn't called the King of Hardcore Wrestling for <BR>nothing. This book also discusses his stints in ECW<BR>and WCW, and how poorly he felt he was treated by them.<BR>  He also discussed with Vince the creation of the<BR>Mankind character and his return to the WWF. His first<BR>stint there in the 1980s was as a jobber, or a guy that<BR>is supposed to lose, or JTTS (Jobbing To The Stars).<BR>  He also touches on his wife and how they met and his<BR>children. He also discusses the tragedy surrounding the<BR>Owen Hart death. It is a bit on the salacious side with<BR>some of the content, but all in all, it's a very <BR>entertaining read. The man isn't the stereotypical <BR>wrestler as portrayed by certain members of the mainstream<BR>media, who are fairly ignorant about the pro wrestling<BR>industry and what really goes on. He has proven in both<BR>of his bestselling hardcover books that he has sharp wit,<BR>and a sense of humor and is a charismatic personality,<BR>inside and outside the ring. I have known about Foley<BR>since the late 1980s when he was Cactus Jack in WCCW,<BR>or World Class Championship Wrestling, which was one of<BR>the many casualties when the WWF began its' national<BR>expansion campaign into other territories in the 1980s.<BR>  What I didn't know was about Mick Foley the man, until<BR>Have A Nice Day!: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks was <BR>released in 1999. The book is a must-have for the mark,<BR>or the knowledgable wrestling fan who knows what is going<BR>on behind the scenes, or the smart mark, a.k.a. the smark.	2001-11-23

After all I have seen Total Sports encyclopaedias which <BR>are much heavier and more comprehensive, sans high gloss<BR>paper and virtually no pictures sell for the same price.<BR>  This book is a collectors' item, and I realize the DVD<BR>is part of the reason the book is priced the way it is,<BR>but I haven't had the opportunity to view the DVD yet,<BR>since I don't own a DVD player, but I plan to view it<BR>next month or in January, since I have a friend who has<BR>one.<BR>  This book is an illustrated history of Wrestlemania,<BR>along with descriptions of the matches themselves and a<BR>concise capsule summary of what occurred during each one.<BR>  If you're a WWF fanatic, then you're probably going to<BR>want to get this.

It's true females watch<BR>pro wrestling, but the majority of pro wrestling fans are<BR>still likely male.

My<BR>first chance to see Dynamite Kid was when he wrestled<BR>for Stu Hart's Calgary-based Stampede Wrestling in the<BR>early 1980s. This book is his biography, and where he <BR>started his career in England. He also talks about the<BR>Harts, Davey Boy, and his stints with the WWF and <BR>various Japanese promotions.  I knew something about <BR>Davey Boy's problems in the past, but I never knew him<BR>to be that much of a problem. There seems to be some<br />bitterness on the part of Billington as to how his life<BR>turned out in the end because of pro wrestling. On the<BR>other hand, he did have some classic matches in Japan<BR>in the early 1980s with Tiger Mask, and was arguably the<BR>best worker in the business in the early 1980s, based on<BR>his work in Calgary and Japan. You would be hard-pressed<BR>to find a better technical wrestler in the world at that<BR>time. If you want to learn more about his Stampede <BR>Wrestling days and the Hart family, people should probably<BR>want to pick up the book by Diana Hart, the daughter of<BR>Stu Hart and Helen Hart. It's called Under The Mat: <BR>Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family. I'm not sure if Amazon<BR>has this title currently, since it may be only available <BR>in Canadian retail bookstore chains. I'm sure if you want<BR>to buy it through Amazon, Amazon can make arrangements. <BR>I'm reading this book right now, and what Diana has to say<BR>about her family, Dynamite, Davey Boy and other wrestlers<BR>is very revealing. You learn what they are truly like. She<BR>should know, since she was married to Davey Boy, and <BR>Dynamite is Davey Boy's cousin. This book is a must-have<BR>if you're a true fan of the industry itself, not just the<BR>entertainment aspect that is dominate in North American<BR>wrestling.	2001-11-22

Unfortunately it did not contain any information or tributes to  Dick Murdoch or Adrian Adonis, which was my only gripe. Each  tribute is a collection of pictures, career history and the  behind-the-scenes look at what took place. It mentions not   only the death, but the circumstances that led up to the death.  It is more than just a standard obituary. This book is actually  a collection of mini-biographies about each wrestling     personality. We learn about the politics behind the business  a little bit. Dave Meltzer is best known for his Wrestling  Observer newsletter, and for being one of the best pro wrestling  journalists in the world. This book is a must have on any  wrestling fan's to buy list.

I knew that high school and in some cases elementary school athletes in sports like basketball and football that are extremely gifted can get free perks, but I didn't think it would go as far as it did. The fact is there is a lot of fingerpointing at the athletes, but very little at the others involved in the game. Let's face it, no one would care about these sports if there wasn't a relatively high standard of quality players available. Everyone involved in the game makes money off the players, from the coaches,universities,athletic apparel companies,broadcasters, etcetera, you name it. It's about time that college athletes and high school athletes receive fair market value for the money they generate. The point is many schools would be probably be in a lot worse financial shape if it weren't for basketball and football. Yes, it exposes the greed behind the players, but it's human nature at work. I don't agree with the tactics employed by the agents and companies involved to get players, but I do understand the motivation for doing so. If they don't get these players, some other competing agent or company likely will get their services. It's no different than when univerisities engage in recruiting practices, and some of these universities can get put on probation for recruiting violations. All in all, this was a realistic look at what goes on  in youth basketball. I enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to explore the dark side of amateur basketball. An excellent companion book to this would be the book Money Players, which looks at things from the NBA perspective.	2001-02-24

It follows the coffeetable book format of the NBA at 50 book, which was released in 1997 I believe celebrating 50 years of NBA basketball. The common link is the author is Mark Vancil. Now, on to the book itself. The layout,photography and organization of the book is exceptional, and first class. This book is sort of unique from other books about Michael for the following reason: It is a coffeetable format type book, and there is photography on every page as he tells the story. I disagree with some of the things he says, like Wilt would not be able to score 50 points per game in a season in the modern NBA, but the modern NBA doesn't have the depth the 8 team NBA has. Expansion dilutes the talent level. Also, it's unfair to compare eras, because the modern athletes of today's NBA had access to modern sports medicine techniques with relation to diet,training,and mental preparation as well as modern coaching philosophies. It starts off with his college career and ends with his leaving the game. He has more input into this book than some of the paperbacks that have come out about him,or hardcovers. Originally the retail price for this book when it came out was a whopping $50 U.S./$65 Canadian, but I managed to pick up the book for a 20% of the original price. The high price turned me off when it came out. For example,the NBA at 50 book, which covered the NBA's top 50, was something in the neighborhood of $39.95 U.S./$50 Canadian, and it was probably roughly the same number of pages, and was probably a better buy. A basis synopsis of the book is he talks about his father said how his life will change after he made a game winning shot to win the 1982 NCAA Championship. He also breaks down season by season everything in relation to the Bulls when he played,like the decision by Jerry Krause to sit him out duringthe 1986-87 season. In the book, he also breaks down the NBA Finals and his performance versus the other team's leading player statistically. Scottie Pippen's emergence as a superstar was one of the key factors he mentions in helping the Bulls get to the next level. He also discusses how the Detroit Pistons helped him learn what it took to win. He got stronger as a result. He also said how Dennis Rodman truly became a Bull because Phil Jackson gave him free rein to do whatever he wanted as long as he did his job on the court. Phil would tighten the reins if the players weren't doing their job. I say it would be a good time to purchase the book now, because the price is lower. I think at $50 U.S. the book is overpriced,but at around $20 U.S. or lower it is probably a fair price to pay for the book. If you're a Michael fan, or you're not, but just curious, like I was, I would recommend it. The photography is first rate.<BR>If Ruben Roberts is asking me that question of who is better than Michael, then one Wilt Chamberlain comes to mind. Wilt held over 50 individual NBA records when Michael retired in 1998, while Michael held only four. The source is none other than the 1998 NBA Official Guide by The Sporting News.	2001-02-12

He had an injury riddled pro career, so we will never know how good he could have been. One thing is certain, his place as one of the greatest centers in college basketball history is assured. Also, he was one of the greatest sixth men in NBA history when he helped the Celtics win an NBA championship.	2001-02-12

This book mixes his life from the time he was a child to the time he was an adult with memories of his beloved Knicks, past and present. It was cool to hear about Monroe,Barnett,DeBusschere,Reed,Frazier,Russell (Cazzie, not Bill, but he mentions Bill too I think) and others as well. He also talks about stars of previous eras and comparing them to ones in more current eras. It's really two books in one, combining his life (an autobiography) with his love of the Knicks.

People who slam the book are biased. MJ has a good and bad side, and the people who whine are probably his fans or have shares in his company. The problem is players from different eras can't be compared. How do you compare Oscar Robertson to Earvin Johnson? You can't...but you can compare them relative to the players in their era, to players they played against, and compare their relative greatness to the relative greatness to the players from other eras. Compare Michael to others relative to his contribution of others...don't just compare scoring, or Dominique Wilkins would be surely better than Bill Russell...only a misinformed or ignorant NBA basketball fan would think something as preposterous as that. Kudos for Sam Smith and taking off the kid gloves. If the book is all trash journalism, why didn't Michael sue for slander or defamation of character? There must be some truth to it.	2001-01-11

A pretty interesting book, but as a previous reviewer mentioned, it chronicles the author's frustration to get access to Michael. Michael's baseball experiment was probably fun for him, and granted it didn't go too well, but at least he enjoyed himself trying to be a pro calibre baseball player, which clearly he is not. I think MJ just wanted a break from hoops to do something else and come back when he was  upset about the Major League Baseball lockout in 1994, which I think played a major factor in his decision to return to the NBA.	2001-01-11

US	49946398	R2E0KXMQG0R4N3	0316277126	388824894	A March to Madness: A View from the Floor in the Atlantic Coast Conference	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Life in the ACC revealed.	I guess if you're an ACC basketball fan you will probably enjoy this book. If not, but you're curious about what a season is like in typically one of the better basketball conferences in NCAA basketball,this is the book for you. You get an inside look at the nine teams that comprise the ACC. You get to learn about the  coaches of each team, and a bit about them. Of course, the Smith- Kryzewski (sp?) rivalry is talked about in depth. It also talks about how NC State and UNC are public, while Wake and Duke are private schools, and the fans who support them. I found it an interesting read, but not as good as Feinstein's A Season Inside, which chronicled the 1987-88 NCAA basketball season.	2001-01-11

It was pretty indepth, and is a nice overview of his life from the time he was a legend in Indiana to coming full circle by coaching there. It also mentions his daughter, who has a distant relationship with his father. If you're a Bird fan, even if you're not, but you enjoy reading about basketball, this is worth the price. It paints a very balanced portrait of Bird. I like the fact that it isn't slanted one way or the other. It portrays the good and the bad. I'm a Bird fan, but I like objective journalism, which this seems to be. No schlock hero worship journalism here, nor is there any railing against him. Even though I like Bird, I will not condone his actions if they are perceived as wrong or controversial.	2001-01-11
US	49946398	RIZRJN3W39ZSH	0312962215	955502285	Howard Stern: King of All Media	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Howard Stern : King of All Media.	It pretty much is a factual account of Howard Stern's life from his childhood days to his days in Detroit and WNBC radio. Nothing risque is really discussed. I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a viewpoint of Howard's life other than Howard. The author neither supports  or chastises Stern, but presents the facts without any bias one way or the  other, and that's nice to see in journalism. It's definitely worth checking  out.	2000-03-04
