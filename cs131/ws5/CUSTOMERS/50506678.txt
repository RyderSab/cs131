I'm all for growth and change of an artist, but I was looking for the same brain candy I've gotten from other Keyes's books. This book had some of the same rollicking good fun as the other Keyes books I've read (\\"Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married\\" and \\"Watermelon\\"); however, I didn't enjoy \\"Last Chance Saloon\\" nearly as much. I felt like Keyes tried too hard to get deep and philosophical by addressing the issue of Fintan's health and focused too much on sending out the moral of 'carpe diem'. If you're after the latest misery of the month choice, stick with Oprah picks. If you're looking for fun and giggles, look to some of Keyes's other novels.	2002-10-21

I'm giving this book three stars--three stars being an average rating dependent on who you are and where you're at in life. Are you in your (very) early 20-somethings wondering where to go in life and how to get there? Then this book deserves 5 stars for giving you lots of tips and advice that most women don't fully appreciate until a few years post-college. The book is divided into chapters that are written in a dishy, girl-talk, cosmo-article type style that make for quick and easy reading. If, on the other hand, you're geting closer and closer to 30-something than 20-something with each tick of the second hand on your watch, think long and hard about buying this book: when you read advice you already know just from becoming a member of the &quot;real world&quot; (i.e: eat a minimum 5 servings of fruits and veggies a day, re-establish an adult relationship with various family members, promptly leave a relationship with an abusive partner, exercise 30-60 minutes 3 to 5 times a week and invest at least the matching maximum in your employer's 401k plan), do you enjoy nodding your head and feeling wise for how far you've come in the last decade? Then by all means, buy this book and enjoying feeling so intelligent. If you'd rather embark on new and more exciting literary endeavors, then pretend this review rated the book a one star effort and go find a fun novel or page through this month's cosmo instead.	2002-06-02

I had had the impression this book would have more text addressing the spiral and its spiritual symbolism, with illustrations throughout. Instead, the book had a brief 30 page introduction with page after page of various artworks that feature a spiral somewhere in their design. I found the pictures to be poorly notated and wished that each photo had a more in-depth discussion to accompany it.	2002-05-21

Delightful is the only word I can think of to sum up this novel! With newfound freedom, finances and family, the recently widowed Miss Julia takes on adventures of all kinds. The characters are lively and interesting, to say the least, and the reader is taken along for the ride as one unbelieveable event after another unfolds. It's great fun to watch Miss Julia go from 1950s housewife to proud single woman. During the first few chapters, I was starting to wonder if I had somehow mistakenly picked up some kind of lovelace pulp, but I'm glad to have stuck it out until the last scene unfolded!  This book would be an excellent choice for airport or car reading.	2002-05-21

Perhaps the only topic she knows is the magical and medicinal attributes of herbs and plants. Perhaps she had her own 'Nick' (a minor in this novel, Nick is the pushy publishing rep who tries to convince the main character, Jay, to hurry his follow up novel through the presses). Who knows? But this book just didn't have the panache of \\"Five Quarters of the Orange\\" and \\"Chocolat\\". The plot struggles at times and characters from the other novels make cameos with no apparent purpose other than to remind the reader that this book is by the same author. Sigh. Just like Peter Mayle, Joanne Harris has strong sophmore efforts that are well worth reading but seems to fall flat in this subsequent attempt. If you haven't yet read \\"Five Quarters...\\", I would highly recommend it for it's complex yet well crafted storylines. If you've already read it, read it again and pass on \\"Blackberry Wine\\".	2002-03-31

After scanning the book (which I plan to purchase used) and Myss's website, I found that a lot of her philosophies fit in very well with my own belief system. Myss purports that, whatever god(dess), myth, tenet, fate or degree of freewill you believe in, every single person has a sacred contract between his/herself and that higher power which sets said individual on a path/lesson to be learned this lifetime. Everyone, according to Myss, has 12 different archetypes (strong characters) that define/determine one's path. The book describes dozens of these archetypes and gives guidance in picking those that are applicable to oneself. There are also questions suggested to be used in interviewing the archetype/self. Both the book and the website detail how to cast your individual archetypical wheel. Similar to an astrological wheel, there are segments that represent different areas of life (ie. house of personality/ego, house of creativity, house of relationships, etc.). During the casting process, one assigns one's archetypes to the different houses. Again, introspective questions are suggested to examine how one's archetypes relate to these aspects of one's life. I was amazed at how accurately my casting was in relation to my life and being. Although I personally ignored many of the religious analogies and personal testimonies within the book, I found the self-interrogation process to be highly worthwhile and enjoyed Myss's guidance.	2002-03-13

It is impossible to read her tale of abuse and terror without reflecting on the tenacity with which children hold on to their optimism. However, after the first hundred pages or so, though, my thoughts were along the lines of \\"All right, already!

This book kept me engaged from page 1 which is amazing because I have never held a special place in my heart for the great western or cowboy poetry both of which permeate the story. Leif Enger writes beautiful prose that incorporates these elements along with mysticism, christian miracles and literature into a novel that defies categorization. Read it expecting a great novel--not a christian parable, not a meditation on miracles, not a modern-day western--and you won't be disappointed!	2002-01-03

I have enjoyed Thich Nhat Hanh's other books because (the translation of) his writing makes Buddhist thoughts and practices clear and accessible; not too simplistic and not too academic. The guided meditations in this book are no exception. Ranging from very simple to rather complex, each meditation is written in poem like phrases, or stages, with the key words of each in the border off to the side. I have been memorizing the key words and saying them to myself while I run--it makes me much more aware of myself and my surroundings than listening to earphones and makes me concentrate on my breathing, all of which makes the experience more enjoyable.	2001-12-26

They leave me wondering why the author didn't think the character or the plot significant enough to explore in the greater detail of a novel. That said, I really enjoyed Sedaris's &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;. The first half of the book, &quot;One&quot;, was filled with stories about Sedaris's family. Stories of the sort that every family retells around the kitchen table when gathered together again as 'grown-ups' (Remember the time Amy came home in the fat suit and dad thought she'd REALLY gained all that weight?!? Mom and Dad love that new dog more than they EVER loved us kids when we lived at home!). Amusing and fun to read. &quot;Deux (Two)&quot; recounts Sedaris's time as an &quot;ex-pat&quot; in France. Having struggled through French, German and Spanish myself and watching my own ESL students learn to untangle reflexives made this half of the book particularly amusing. Fun, witty, loony and irresistibly funny: just like the reviews say.	2001-12-17

Basic plot: small town sheriff comes across an accident involving his small town's elementary school principal and a young girl fresh out of high school; he creates a story to protect both victims' reputations that ends up creating unexpected results. Although I thought Watson's highly descriptive prose was impressive, the book did drag at times as Sheriff Jack Nevelsen's thoughts went off onto seemingly unrelated tangents. I hadn't read any previous reviews and wasn't expecting the surprise finale. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3 purely because of the creative ending.	2001-11-23

When I was told that this month's book club selection was 624 pages long, I was a little bit daunted. Luckily, reading Marian Keyes' novel is just like gossiping with a girlfriend. I only wish I'd opened up a bottle of wine to enjoy while reading this fun, though slightly predictable, novel. From dealing silently with bouts of depression to the typical woes of a single 20-something to the drudgery of an entry-level position, any female reader is bound to identify in some way with Keyes' character Lucy Sullivan. Brain candy perfect for the bathtub, the beach, or reading in bed.	2001-11-19

As his mother has abandoned him and his father died in Vietnam, the majority of his youth is spent in virtual seclusion with his grandfather at the old family manor, visits from old doctor connor and spying on the neighbors his only outside diversions. When his grandfather has an accident, Billy is sent briefly to live in foster care and has his first brief taste of the outside world and his life begins to change in various ways. Great writing with many imaginative characters and events (the grandfather was financially ruined in the late 40s when he invested the family fortune in ostriches), this book is definitely worth reading. I greatly enjoyed the first 95% of this novel and raced my way to the end only to be mildly disappointed in the rather bland ending.	2001-10-10

I volunteer in an ESL program in AZ and have found this book very useful in several ways. The book is divided into topics (ie Finding a hotel, Let's order some food, etc.) and the vocabulary is often introduced in a short English story with 'difficult' words translated into Spanish below. As a non-Spanish speaker, this has helped me to be able to nod my head when students are discussing the meaning of a new English word amongst themselves. There are many pictures in the book to accompany new vocabulary. The majority of the exercises are done in English without translations provided. The directions, however, are given in Spanish. Although it is not a text we use in class, it has been helpful for creating additional activities and I would quickly recommend it to any student looking for support materials for independent practice.	2001-10-03
