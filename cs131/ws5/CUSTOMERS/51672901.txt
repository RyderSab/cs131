The Adventures of the Second Mrs. Watson by Michael Mallory<br /><br />The first thing that I must point out is that this book is most definitely non-canonical. It has been argued among Holmes scholars as to who was Watson’s second wife, and indeed, if he even married twice.<br /><br />The indispensible Mr. Baring-Gould in his Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street states that Watson’s first wife was Constance Adams, whom he married on November 1, 1886. This would make Mary Morstan Watson’s second wife, not the first. Further, Baring-Gould has a third Mrs. Watson, but experts are divided on who she was. Two suggestions havr been Violet de Merville (The Illustrious Client); and Lady Francis Carfax. Baring-Gould states in the footnotes in chapter 23 that both have been squashed by most Sherlokians.<br /><br />The Mrs. Watson in this case is Amelia Pettigrew Watson. She has quite a different feeling about Holmes and the audacity to investigate on her own.<br /><br />Now Canon aside (Mr. Mallory uses the same quote from “The Adventure of the Blanched Solider” that Baring-Gould uses to justify a third Mrs. Watson to make a case for Amelia as second) the stories are pretty good.<br /><br />I came across Michael Mallory when Murderous Intent Magazine where these stories first appeared honored me by publishing a poem I wrote called “He Escaped.” I liked the stories (I got a free one year subscription for my poem) and my copy of the book is personally signed by Michael Mallory.<br /><br />Here’s a complete rundown. Any spoilers are totally unintended.<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Left-Behind Wife:” is a letter to a friend describing her tense relationship with Holmes.<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Other Woman:” Watson is kidnapped and Holmes has to team with Amelia to solve the case.<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Ripper’s Scrawl:” An man is found ripped up in an alley with Jack the Ripper’s  famous Goulston Street Graffito scrawled above him. Great twist ending on this one!<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Damsel in Grey:” A young woman confined to her room by illness dies from head trauma, and is found in the yard fallen from a window. Was it accident or murder? Amelia is on the case!<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Glass House:” Watson being away on a case, Amelia runs into an old friend. There are valuable diamonds at stake.<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Illustrious Patient:” Doctor Watson takes on a very special client at the request of Mycroft Holmes.<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Bramley Court Devil:” An Inspector Laurie comes looking for Amelia, as a supernatural demon has apparently decided to haunt Bramley Court.<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Retiring Detective:” The Woman Irene Adler returns in mortal danger.<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Disappearing Coach:” Amelia’s friend Harry Benbow is in trouble again, accused of kidnapping…<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Nefarious Nephew:” Watson is a witness at a murder trial, and Amelia impersonates the Prosecutor.<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Japanese Sword:” One woman is murdered and another in danger from someone who kills with a katana.<br /><br />“The Adventure of the Three Verners:” Amelia Watson is shaken by leaves from her family tree…<br /><br />All in all, while I like the stories, I find them a little sophomoric at times. Canonical continuity is not only missing but parts of the canon are questioned or simply declared to have never happened.<br /><br />But it is a lot of fun, and Mr. Mallory did sign the book for me.<br /><br />Three stars out of five.<br />Quoth the Raven…an confined to her room by illness dies from head trauma, and is found in the yard fallen from a window.

This story is an Allan Quartermain adventure, and a excellent one, so the author need not be ashamed. Mr. Miller might be said to possess the spirit of H. Rider Haggard. Let him come forth and loudly proclaim that our hero is not dead! And Holmes appears as well, to those who have eyes to see, and ears to hear. Remember the Great Detective's own words wile reading this story: \\"You see, but you do not observe.\\" A true Sherlockian will do both.<br /><br />But the works of H. Rider Haggard have never inspired the type of pastiche that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes have. (I correct myself-- some are mentioned in Hunter Quatermain's Story-- but hardly the best sellers some pastiches of Holmes have become. Raven) And Holmes sells books. It's too bad, really, because Allan Quartermain is a hero with his own set of accolades. New tales would be welcome.<br /><br />Now for the weak points of the story. It would have been much better to not try to mix religion and fiction so heavily.<br /><br />Other than this point which a less picky reader can overlook, it is a extremely good Quartermain story, (as good as the originals) and The Raven encourages Mr. Miller to write more novels-- on Quartermain. I have yet to read The Great Detective on the Roof of the World. The Raven withholds comment on that book until then. Quoth the Raven...	2005-08-22
US	51672901	R3OEX8WUYD4WZ7	0060778970	142631692	Zorro: A Novel	Books	4	4	6	N	Y	Zorro, the first Latin-American hero!	I have read with mixed emotions the different reviews by my fellow readers. Now, The Raven is known for a picky review. But bear with me on this. I found the story at times very exciting, at times full of scenes I felt were not really necessary, and somewhat overwhelming in details. So then, why do I rate it four stars? Because the book deserves four stars!<br /><br />1. Notice the title page. See the words, \\"Transalated from the Spanish by Margaret Sayers Peden\\"? Allende wrote for her intended audience. And I remembered reading Don Quixote, Cervantes' classic, and encountering the same problems. Therefore, the fault lies not in the writing, but in Anglo failure to appreciate the same things Spanish people cherish. It's a cultural thing. I then could enjoy the story, as I did Don Quixote, by trying to understand cultural differences. Expand your horizons. Don't be narrow-minded.<br /><br />2. When Johnston McCully created Zorro, he worried more about the heroic character, not historical accuracy. As a student of old West history (which you don't find in most history books!), I agree that Allende's Spanish California is more accurate.<br /><br />3. Zorro became more than a fictional character, he became legend. Did you think that Zorro entered the world in full costume, sword in hand, already astride Tornado? All heroes have to have a birth, parents, and a point at which they decide to become said hero, and a cause for which to fight. Allende finally gives us the true tale, and wonderfully done. Bravo! Ole!<br /><br />One last point, Senorita Allende. Nice artist conception of yourself as the Isabel of the story! Or did you really think we were all loco, and would fail to catch on, eh?

I actually purchased this novel with a certain amount of trepidation-because I have one Mrs. Hudson novel (not by this author!) on my shelves, and try as I may, I just can't seem to get into it. But I liked the write-up on this novel, and as this was Mr. Davies first attempt, I felt I should at least give him a chance. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The story is told through the narration of a young girl named the unusual sobriquet of \\"Flotsam\\", called tenderly \\"Flottie\\". She has came along with Mrs. Hudson to keep house for two unusual gentlemen: Sherlock Holmes & Dr. John H. Watson. Flottie has a past with a rather disreputable man, alias for the moment, Maurice Orlando Fogarty, AKA, Melmoth. He seems eager to have the young girl let him know how Holmes is doing in his latest case, which seems to involve a Sumatra Curse. (My only ding: Sorry, Martin, but the Giant Rat Story IS getting old. The one in Resurrected Holmes, by Paula Volsky will always be my favorite. On the plus side, this is a new twist that I will guarantee is original, and not bad. )<br /><br />But Mrs. Hudson has her own ideas about the case, and they don't exactly square with The Great Detective's own. One thing is certain-murders are being committed by strange devices, and SOMEBODY is not what they seem. Is the client lying? If so, why? Why is Fogarty so mixed up in this that he tries to bribe Flottie by telling her he has found her long-lost brother, but he's a dope addict and will die if she doesn't cooperate? And does Mrs. Hudson REALLY beat Holmes at his own game?<br /><br />Tell you what. Are you looking for a really good reading experience? Then buy the book, read it, and find out! This is one book that The Raven has very little bad to say about. Martin Davies, my hat's off to you. Quoth the Raven...	2005-07-12

I'm trying to be less caustic in my reviews since I offended a writer enough to e-mail me and complain that my review was hurting his sales. However, this story is not quite up to the usual Holmes pastiche. I mean \\"Jonathan Watson?\\" Both Homes and Watson ACCEPTING a knighthood? I don't think so.<br /><br />However, it does raise an interesting point: The name of Watson's second wife. I see no reason why Mr. Fullenkamp shouldn't be taken as seriously as anyone else, since she was never named in the canon. (Actually, come to think of it, are we even sure he HAD a second wife in the canon? Maybe all the reference is to Mary, as Watson was never good with dates...)<br /><br />You can't miss the character of Moriarty even if he is never named. Who else would Holmes call \\"Mephistopheles\\"? Remember, despite the Chinese, this is Holmes, not Sir Dennis Nayland Smith. London will be destroyed by the Dragons, which read to be sub-nuclear missles, there are underwater bases, submarimes, etc. A kind of Holmes meets James Bond sort of thing.<br /><br />Not bad. But not really Holmes. Quoth the Raven...	2005-07-10

The last book of the trilogy, The Search for Excalibur winds up what the Raven has to regretfully call a tangled mess. Moriarty comes to Holmes to ask for his help in retrieving Excalibur, and holds Mary McBride's life hostage for it. He will cure her of her fatal liver disease if Holmes does as he says. To prove he can, he produces medicine. Next, he saddles them with his \\"brother, Tyler Such\\" (quotes mine), and Buffalo Bill Cody and Annie Oakley as well. And there's a werewolf, or is it two?, on the prowl as well.<br /><br />Sound exciting? It sould be, but the action drags a bit. (Note to Fullencamp: work on your Wild West accents! They didn't talk like the movies!) It would all be very good, and a nice wrap-up, except for three things:<br /><br />1. Watson would never give up helping Holmes with his cases for any reason. It would be to him the unpardonable sin. His first wife had to put up with it, and Emily, even though they have the little boy to consider, would have to get used to it to.<br /><br />2. Holmes, even if he got married (as I said, I've no objection, I like the Holmes/Mary Russell novels) would never quit his job. Retirement didn't stop him (see His Last Bow) Nothing ever could. Besides, Mary McBride was \\"picking up the trade from Holmes.\\"<br /><br />3. How in the heck did we get Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde into this mess? Moriarty with three idenities due to the same drug potion of Jekyll-- the meek Tyler Such, the evil Moriarty, and a full-blown werewolf? Jekyll, Hyde, and a partial werewolf? Too confusing.<br /><br />Oh, and then there is the fact that after Excalibur is finally found, it just vanishes without a trace-- or a explaination. What up, dude? Quoth the Raven...	2005-07-10

I continue my review of this trilogy as the kinder, gentler Raven-- I hope. The problem is, the story hasn't improved all that much. \\"Mephistopheles\\" is now revealed as Moriarty, armed with a ruby-laser cannon mounted on a submarine, built with knowledge stolen from The Book of War the Chinese had in The Three Dragons. He also has Excalibur. But he needs two other artifacts to make the magic blade work-- the sword stone and the prayer stone. (Note to Fullenkamp-- Excalibur wasn't pulled from the stone, it was given to King Arthur by The Lady of the Lake.) These artifacts are under the prtection of the last of the Kilcarens, Mrs. Mary McBride.<br /><br />I'd don't mind Holmes falling in love with Mary. I also find the explanation for Holmes' adversion to women sound. But if Watson had called his gun \\"Mildred\\", don't you think he'd of mentioned it before? I don't discount telepathy, by the by, so no dings on that. But things get pretty sappy until the final battle. Don't read this book unless you're gonna read the whole trilogy. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense. Quoth the Raven...	2005-07-10

This book is great, a brilliant tale of Holmes (although he is never named you cannot miss the clues!) in his old age. A young boy, a Jew, appears at the old man's door in 1944 with a African Grey parrot on his shoulder. The boy appears to be mute, but the parrot spews a jumble of numbers in German that seem to be a type of code.<br /><br />The boy and parrot have found shelter with a black Cleric and his white wife and somewhat rebellious son. Before long, others come along who show an unhealthy intrest in the parrot. Murder ensues. The old man investigates, only to be ordered off the case by the government. But he is not so easily put off. He has promised the boy his parrot back, and he prides himself on always having kept his promises.<br /><br />The Raven wishes Mr. Chabon would have contacted the Conan Doyle estate and received their blessings on this volume. I feel it is one Doyle would have been proud of. The Raven must also chastise Mr. Chabon for the two ugly and completely unnecessary words in the novel. Bad form, Sah!<br /><br />That said, this is the best Holmes story The Raven has read in a long time. It truly reflects the hand of Conan Doyle. Quoth The Raven...	2005-07-05

The Secret Notebooks of Sherlock Holmes by June Thomson<br /><br />Early in the book we learn that a distant relative of Doctor Watson has sold the legendary tin dispatch box to a Doctor John F Watson, who is a Doctor of Philosophy, not medicine. When this Doctor Watson could not back trace Miss Adeline McWhirter , the relative of Dr. John H Watson who sold the dispatch case, he decided not to publish the cases, but he did do extensive research and scribbled notes in the margins. He then died and left the box to his niece, Doctor Aubrey B Watson, a Dentist. Thus the stories were finally released for publication, along with Dr. John F Watson's footnotes...<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Upwood Scandal\\"<br /><br />November 1888. Mr. Godfrey Sinclair visits Baker Street with a new problem for Holmes. Sinclair is the owner of the Nonpareil Club, a gambling establishment in Kensington. Mr. Sinclair believes that a Colonel James Upton, in association with a Mr. Eustace Gaunt, has been fleecing wealthy young men of good family by cheating at whist.<br /><br />Holmes and Watson go undercover as a Mr. Robinson (Holmes) and a Mr. Carew (Watson) to visit the Nonpareil Club as gamblers themselves to spot prospective victims of the Upwood/Gaunt twosome.<br /><br />This is a fair story, but it starts out the book on a kind of slow note. Four out of five stars.<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Aluminum Crutch\\"<br /><br />Lestrade's visit to Baker Street informs Holmes that a criminal named Whitey Johnson is dead. It reminds Holmes of the case of the aluminum crutch. This time he decides to actually tell Watson the story.<br /><br />Late 1870's. Holmes is still in Montague Street and has not yet met Watson. Lestrade needs Holmes' help with a pair of jewel thieves. A man and woman invariably enter a jewelry establishment at the perfect time. As the woman tries to select a ring, the man does a snatch and grab and runs from the shop.<br /><br />Whitey Johnson, who incidentally a real cripple, forms a third part of the team; tripping up the shop owners as they give chase to the male thief. He is also the receiver of the stolen goods.<br /><br />This story is perhaps a bit predictable in solution. I can only give three stars out of five.<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Manor House Mystery\\"<br /><br />Mr. Edward Maitland has made an appointment with Holmes concerning his great-uncle Sir Reginald Maitland, a man so successful at business that his nickname is \\"Midas.\\" He was not so fortunate in his own life, he never married due to a broken engagement; he fought with his brother, Edward's grandfather; and he flatly refused to have anything to do with Edward's father.<br /><br />However, towards Edward himself the old man has been kind and even generous--until now. His Uncle has sent a letter banning Edward from his home and accusing him of sending anonymous letters threatening the old man.<br /><br />Edward suspects interference from a man named Adams, who has been the old man's chauffeur the past four years. Adams has risen to Manservant upon the dismissal of Sir Reginald's manservant Jordan for stealing a pair of gold cufflinks.<br /><br />Now Edward finds that Adams has been canceling his great-uncle's Doctor appointments--in fact the last four.<br /><br />This story begins to show the side of June Thomson that caught our attention so well in her previous book. The echo of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle sings in this story. This is the first five out of five stars story in this volume!<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Cardinal's Corpse\\"<br /><br />March, 1895. Father O'Shea, a Catholic Priest, arrives at 221B to consult with Sherlock Holmes on a matter of Church Affairs. The day before Cardinal Tosca of the Vatican, while in London on private business, vanished without a trace.<br /><br />Inspector MacDonald had suggested O'Shea seek Holmes for aid. The Priest has received permission from none other than His Holiness the Pope for Holmes to act in this case.<br /><br />Thevisit had to do with a routine that the Cardinal has practiced for the last twenty-nine years. He would come to London and stay at St. Christopher's House for a week. While in London he never wore clerical garb, but dressed like any other man in town.<br /><br />When the Cardinal is found dead in Paternoster Yard, Spitalfields, Holmes is thrown in to an investigation that uncovers a lot that cannot be released to the public.<br /><br />The echo of Conan Doyle becomes even clearer in this story, definitely a five stars out of five tale!<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Arnsworth Affair\\"<br /><br />The death of the Dowager Lady Edith Arnsworth of Arnsworth Castle in Surey reminds Holmes of one of his old cases while still in Montague Street. Holmes had handled a case involving Gilbert, the son of Lady Edith ; Gilbert having inherited Arnsworth Castle and the family fortune upon the death of his father Sir Richard Arnsworth.<br /><br />Gilbert was a bit of a rake and rogue, and accidentally strangled a young woman of the street in a hotel bedroom. Having fled the scene, Lestrade suspects that Gilbert has gone to ground at the family fortress. However The Dowager Lady Edith is adamant that Gilbert never returned home. Lestrade turns to Holmes to trace down the wayward Nobleman, fighting The Dowager Lady all the way.<br /><br />This story is pretty good, if the solution is a bit obvious. Still there is enough of the voice of Conan Doyle for me to award it four stars out of five.<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Vanishing Barque\\"<br /><br />April 1889. The tale of the British Barque Sophy Anderson is related to Holmes and Watson by First Mate Thomas Corbett.<br /><br />The ship was \\"sank\\" for the insurance money, repainted and renamed the Lucy Belle. Now Corbett relates another secret about the insurance fraud that is even worse--a murder! Having borne the secret of the fraud and murder for four years, Corbett wants the murderers to pay at any cost.<br /><br />This is a truly great story and the investigation is handled in true Doyle-style prose. I give this one five out of five stars!<br /><br />The Case of the Gustaffson Stone\\"<br /><br />A Nobleman giving the name Count Erik von Lyngstrad comes to Baker Street on a errand for a man whom he will not name except for a pseudonym. It seems this \\"Herr Braun\\" had an Uncle who owed a debt of honor, and sold a fabulous jewel in order to pay his debt. He then had fortune turn and was able to reclaim the stone. Yet the stone he received back was a fake!<br /><br />The money-lender in the case was one Baron Kleist. According to Holmes' unique filing system, Kleist is also suspected of blackmail and forgery as well as theft and usury. He deals in currency, jewels, and objets d'art.<br /><br />Much like A Scandal in Bohemia, Count Erik is not who he seems and has no client but himself. In Baron Kleist, Holmes finds a adversary almost the equal of Professor Moriarty.<br /><br />This story wraps up this collection on a strong note, a crescendo of investigation truly worthy of Conan Doyle himself.

The Raven was pleased to see this book come out. Short stories about Allan Quatermain are finally released! Rider Haggard wrote something besides novels about his hero! Bravo to Mr. Peter Haining for taking time to select and edit the four stories and the novella Allan's Wife.<br /><br />The stories are exciting for their tales of adventure and danger in The Dark Continent. They are takes of danger, hardship, and love and lost. Quartermain is a tragic hero, eventually becoming wealthy, but always at a great loss-- his son, his wife, and eventually his own life in the Africa that he loved with all of his heart. Shadows of this lie in all of the stories, and Mr. Haining has thoughtfully added a chronological list of the Quatermain stories.<br /><br />Also, Rider Haggard made something of an enigma himself. He writes of the African people as most British writers of his day, in a somewhat prejudiced manner, even using the ugly \\"n\\" word. (To the British of that period, ALL colored races were inferior and generally refered to thus, such as Natives of India, China, and North and South America.)Yet Haggard praises the nobility of the black races, and one short story Magepa the Buck, tells of a black man who gives his life that his grandson might live. In the front of the story, Quatermain states that such a man makes him proud of the human race. Hardly the words of a truly prejudiced man.<br /><br />The Raven has always felt that Rider Haggard was a writer truly ahead of his time in accepting that all men were worthy, none inferior. Kudus to Rider Hagard and to Peter Haining for this most excellent book! Quoth the Raven...	2005-07-01

This book sat on my shelf for two years because I bought it by mistake. Well, the mistake was not reading it sooner! It's great! I am disappointed in my fellow readers who obviously haven't checked the FACTS of the book.<br />#1. The suspect in the story (read it yourself, Mac!) is a genuine Jack-the-Ripper suspect, and considered by many to actually BE the Ripper. He had murdered his wife and was an escapee (or more likely let go) from a madhouse.<br />#2. The Ripper murders have always been claimed to show some religious or occult symbol, authors vary on what. Me, the ol' Raven is like The Great Randi, skeptic unparalleled, who points out that any pattern is only possible if you connect the dots that way.<br />#3. Pink. Yes, that was her nickname, and her name as given in the book is her real one. But no one remembers her by that name, since she is world-famous under a pseudonym. I won't say what it was, but if I did all of you would slap your forehead and say &quot;Oh, yeah! I've heard of her!&quot; You probably think Mark Twain was his real name too.<br />As for the story ending midstream, do you really want an 800 page book? There's just too much to tell in one story.

Let's see: Holmes and Moriarty are flip sides of the same man brought out by cocaine addiction used to combat ennui. Interesting, but already covered and much better by Nicholas Myers in The Seven-Percent Solution. Holmes is unable to solve the Jack the Ripper murders because he, or rather his Moriarty personality is The Ripper. As good a theory as any I've read by several so-called \\"Ripperoligests\\". And I've devoured every one I can get my hands on. The sad truth is, he got away with it! They didn't catch The Ripper, and it's ridiculous to try to solve murders over 100 years old now. Holmes commits suicide and Watson becomes a cocaine addict. One word: unthinkable. The whole book is a farce masquerading as a serious novel. I never read a worse interpretation of the great detective.

This takes place conveniently during \\"the great hiatus\\", when Holmes is supposed to be dead. The only problem is that if the uranium ORE was mutating the rats, then Holmes himself would have died of radiation poisoning MINING said ore, much less during the refining process.

One thing that Ms Cornwell has in her favor is that she is certainly qualified to evaluate the evidence forensically. I think she does make the following points<br />1.) Sickert no doubt did write most if not all of the Ripper letters based on paper, ink, and watermark evidence, as well as the DNA evidence discovered. But why not prove it by exhuming Sickert's mother and comparing DNA?<br /><br />2.) The police COMMISSIONER, not the general force, was incompetent. Surely no policeman worthy of the title would destroy evidence as he did twice, once with the bloody trousers and once with the message in chalk which he wouldn't even allow to be photographed. I suspect he got his job based on who he was as opposed to whether or not he was the best man for the job.<br /><br />3.) The Ripper was NOT left-handed. This man had to disappear into the night, once within a few minutes of the police arriving on the scene. Could he have done this if he were covered in blood? i.e. worked from the front, left-handed? No. He worked from behind, right-handed, well out of the way of the spurting blood.<br /><br />The handwriting analysis, which Ms Cornwell seems to dismiss, certainly seems to be the same hand to me. But then again, I am hardly an expert on graphology.<br /><br />Does all of this prove Sickert's guilt? Not hardly. Just that he enjoyed deviling the police. Was he the Ripper? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But by definition of a serial killer, Martha Talbert may have been the first, but Mary Kelly was certainly not the last unless the Ripper died shortly after. They kill early in life and continue to do so until caught. Bottom line, Ms Cornwell, you need more evidence. But you could definitely be one the right trail...<br /><br />Quoth the Raven...	2003-11-29

This book captures the heart and soul of Sherlock Holmes quite well except for the last story. There is no way that Holmes would deliberately expose Watson to such danger. Holmes often did not take Watson into his full confidence, simply because Watson was an astutely honest face that was poor at any form of deception. But as Sherlockians may recall in The Adventure of the Three Garridebs when the villian wounds Watson, Holmes coldly informs him that if Watson had been killed the villian would never have left the room alive. So having Holmes expose Watson to deadly danger and then be caviler about it is unthinkable. But the rest of the book is a solid four Sherlock stars! Good work!

The Holmes of this book could have never visited forbidden Tibet, because his bumbling would have given him away. And that's not the Holmes I have grown to appreciate.

Sherlock Holmes and the Tomb of Terror by Val Andrews<br /><br />This is one of Val Andrews’ early Holmes stories and this one contains a “how I discovered this lost adventure” chapter, in which the case is discovered in a used book that belonged to John H Watson, MD.<br /><br />***Minor Spoilers***<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes is approached by Abdul Faziel, rightful heir to the Sheikdom of Marrafaze. The Sheikdom is in danger, for the Sheik is old and in poor health. Abdul’s brother, Mustapha, and the Grand Wazir plan to keep the Sheikdom in the dark ages. Already they have driven Abdul, who was educated at Cambridge, out of the country.<br /><br />Holmes eventually agrees to take Abdul’s case. Then comes the shocker: Mycroft Holmes wishes Holmes and Watson to go to Marrafaze on a mission for Queen and Country. There is said to be a mineral in this country that most of the world think is a myth that could be used by the war department. The clouds of WWI are already on the horizon.<br /><br />Holmes and Watson make the pilgrimage, even though they are on their own for much of the trip. The discovery of Marrafaze and how it has gone unnoticed to the world, I will not spoil.<br /><br />Holmes and Watson reach the country and begin to deal with the Sheik. Thankfully, he has been taught English by Abdul. Holmes and Watson are actually made advisors to the Sheik.<br /><br />The Sheik intends to keep them there for life. He also states that they will continue to do so in death. When the Sheik suddenly dies, Holmes and Watson learn their fate. They are to be walled up in the tomb of the Sheik alive!<br /><br />The story is not as good as Val Andrews more recent Holmes stories. I will give it three stars.<br /><br />Quoth the Raven…	2000-09-09

Watson	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Millett needs to stick to Shadwell, not Sherlock	The story comes off well, and I have read it at least three times. But it's not a great Sherlock Holmes story, it's a fine Shadwell Rafferty mystery. Sadly, Holmes gets left out in the Minnesota cold. Maybe Millett  should develop Rafferty...? I second the motion of waiting until the other  book comes out in paperback. There's too little Sherlock in the Ice Palace  Murders to justify paying for a hardback book.

I stayed up late and finished all in one night, then reread it to see if I'd missed something! The insight into what goes through a deranged person's mind while committing horrible crimes  was facinating. It lent a touch of reality to the story. Every horrible  crime, including Jack the Ripper, was commited by a person, however  deranged. I liked the emphasis on the reasons for the Monster's crimes. The  abba clue was also great. Worcester captured Holmes & Watson, and  indeed, London, perfectly. Great book! Quoth the Raven...	2000-06-02

And, not to contradict my esteemed fellow readers, but the follow up, The Blue Angel, is worse. There is entirely too much shift of focus. Too bad, really, because Iris Wildthyme  could be such a great character. Her TARDIS also breaks the pattern by not  being dimentionally larger on the inside than out. All in all, a poor read, or poor handling of a great character. Quoth the Raven...	2000-04-04

They should have stuck to the Celestis and future Time Lords. The Eldar Ones was a bit too detailed. Going into so much description of the villans (or what appear to be villans) took away from a better view of  the Celestis/Time Lord battle. The details of Mictian were good and the  authors should have kept with the imagery throughout.	2000-03-24

Once you start with this book any true fan of the Holmes stories cannot easily put it down! They are great! Each story somehow manages do outdo the other, no matter which is read first. And that is the greatest praise any  writer could ever recieve! Hurry, Watsons! The game is still afoot!	1999-03-18
