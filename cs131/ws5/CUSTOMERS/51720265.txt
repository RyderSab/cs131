There have been several books covering Japanese pop culture from films to Japanese dramas but I've found one book that literally I just didn't want to put down. \\"The Couch Potato's Guide to Japan\\" by Wm. Penn is the book that followers of Japanese entertainment have to read because it's full of information and tidbits of Japanese television which I didn't know about.<br /><br />Many people know Wm. Penn's work from her \\"televiews\\" columns for the Daily Yomiuri and pretty much bought a television in 1982 in Japan and what do you know, started writing about what's on television since 1987. What I enjoyed about this book the most is the connection it makes to the Japanese entertainment fan. For those in the United States or outside of Japan who have followed Japanese dramas, the variety shows, comedy shows, news shows really will get into this book.<br /><br />Those little things we think about when we watch Japanese television, Wm. Penn does a good job covering them. Plot devices such as food.<br /><br />For example, in chapter 2 titled \\"Japanese TV Sociology 101\\", she talks about the importance of food in Japanese culture and how symbolic it is on television. She uses dramas as examples such as the 1996 series \\"Hakusen Nagashi\\" in a part of series when character, Sonoko is making obento for Wataru and his jealous ex-girlfriend confiscates the obento and destroys it. Another example is the drama \\"Campus Note\\" where Haruka (Uchida Yuki) attracted to a student who needs to pass a bar exam to become a lawyer decides not to bother him during his studies but her rival always visits him with a carefully wrapped obento. Who succeeds in getting the male student's attention?<br /><br />The book is not entirely about Japanese dramas, Wm. Penn also covers variety shows featuring comedians that many of us know about and enjoyed watching. From learning about Tamori-san (who we watch on \\"Waratte Itomo\\" or on \\"Music Station\\"). How she felt about Ninety Nine's \\"Mecha Mecha Ikitteru\\". There is also a chapter on news shows, variety shows and explaining shows like \\"Denpa Shonen\\" when duo Saruganseki, Drones and others did that hitchiking segment and my all time favorite feature on Denpa Shonen featuring Nasubi.<br /><br />Also, explaining who Monta Mino, Tetsuko Kuroyanagi and Hiroshi Sekiguchi are. Wm. Penn also goes into Johnny's Jimuosho and Hello! Project talent such as SMAP and Morning Musume. Also chapters on Wide shows, TV Tourism, cooking shows and so much more. Also articles on American shows that did or didn't do well in Japan and reality shows like \\"Survivor\\" which didn't do so well in Japan. The final chapter goes into Websites and magazines to check out if you are into Japanese television and this book offers so much more. For those who are expecting negatives, I think there are a people who may be bummed that there are no photos in this book (and she goes into explaining that) and to tell you the truth, it doesn't really detract from reading the book because the book is truly fun to read.<br /><br />There is no book like it (in English) that goes into Japanese entertainment like Wm. Penn does. This book is all about Televiews and Wm. Penn's observations of Japanese television that many of us Japanese entertainment fans will definitely understand. I really enjoyed it and I highly recommend all Japanese entertainment fans to check this book out!u\\".

But when we take a step of faith and trust His leading, we may find that what looks risky often yields the greatest rewards. The Odyssey gang has had its share of challenges too, and they've made some life-changing discoveries. From a desperate flight for freedom to respecting authority to accepting God's will you won't want to miss a single story!<br /><br />Episodes:<br /><br />1.

I enjoy watching and learning from Carson Kressley and the other members of the Fab 5 on QEFTSG and the group's book was very well done.  So, at first I wondered if I should buy this book because I was wondering if the same information from the Fab 5 book will be the same on \\"Off the Cuff\\".<br /><br />I found \\"Off the Cuff\\" to be a very enjoyable read with a lot of humor and also learning more about fashion than I have received from other men's fashion books.  Kressley does a great job of explaining why and why not with articles of clothing and things I really didn't know about until I read this book.  I was really impressed!  From the shoes and the explanations of certain shoes and clothing was very much appreciated!<br /><br />I am stoked that he also spoke out against toe socks that to my chagrin CARGO magazine said was \\"in\\"....NOT!<br /><br />Anyway, I'm a straight man who appreciates the advice that Carson gives.  One thing he makes sure that this book is not to dress like him, but for you to take the tools mentioned in his book and integrate what you learn for your personal life.<br /><br />\\"Off the Cuff\\" is an enjoyable read and currently ranks in my top 3 of books that deal with style for men.  You won't be disappointed!	2004-11-30

I remember during a surf comp in France, he was against his idol, Tom Curren and Slater won.  There was a lot of talk about him but you knew inside this kid from Cocoa Beach was going somewhere.  He is multi-talented but during his interviews...print or on television, you kind of see something through his eyes.  Stoke when he wins a comp.  But I don't know...you sensed somethings at times that you wonder how life is going for Kelly Slater.  \\"Pipe Dreams: A Surfer's Journey\\" was so captivating that I couldn't even put the book down.  This book is not a how-to-surf book.  It's about the life of Kelly Slater and he talks about personal things that occured in his life that I must say...it takes a lot of courage and probably is therapeutic in a way to get everything out into the open for him.  From his childhood, his father leaving his family and getting involved with alcoholism, insight on competitions and what was on his mind and how he actually gets pissed off (which I really couldn't imagine because he seems always calm) if he's losing a match.  He also talks about his relationships with Bree (if you read any of the surf mags...you always saw a photo of them together) and the problems with that relationship as well as with Pamela Anderson and others.  Also, the \\"Baywatch\\" situation and how Kelly and his co-star David Charvet got into a fight because Kelly didn't like being on the show and that was interesting.  How he amassed a lot of money early on in his surfing career and then blew it all and it took a hard realization to manage it.  Also, about that French stalker woman and how he almost got jumped by several guys.  How he wanted to be like Tom and leave his sponsor to be soul surfer. His reunion with his father and him being a father which he kept secret from the public for two years and so much in this book that you start to learn more about Kelly Slater.  Like many sports icons, you tend to see the good things.  With Slater, I thought...champion, dates fine women, on the cool magazines and in the spotlight....what a life?  But when you read the book, you realize that Slater really never asked to be a star, he just wanted to surf and the things that went on with his life, like most celebrities or sports icons, they can manifest to something negative but he was able to stay right in between, he never goes into a ....I'm doing so well with my life but that he made some f-up's along the way and he's making sure that he doesn't do again (or try to anyway) and continues to improve himself and try to make better decisions after learning from difficult and heartbreaking decisions.

I appreciate design from Japan and upon purchase of this book, I was really hoping this book gives me something to be excited about and I was literally in visual shock because a lot of my favorite designers and works that I have seen but wasn't sure of who created them, were featured in this book.  WOW!<br /><br />If anything, this book was meant to be looked at than read in my opinion.  Actually, there isn't much to read but what is there to read, it's actually quite humorous and interesting (also informative) at the same time.<br /><br />I really have to give Ramon Prat and staff some props for the designers they covered.  Delaware, Level 1, groovevisions, oh... if you love Japanese design and how they incorporate it to their medium or have knowledge of it, you are just going to love this book.<br /><br />Ok, plus and negatives:<br /><br />+ Featuring the most influential designers from Japan and the designers chosen are among the top designers from Japan.<br /><br />+  Book is beautifully done and definitely a visual book that may provide designers inspiration.<br /><br />- For those looking for biographies and full written on the behind-the-scenes and what inspires the artists and a lot of copy, this is not the kind of book that you are looking for.  (otherwise, if this doesn't bother you..then this book is perfect).<br /><br />You can find this book at book stores but it will be shrink wrapped.  So, if you are wondering what kind of book this is, it's a book featuring the works of popular designers.  Again, I emphasize, if you are looking for in-depth interviews with the designers and behind-the-scenes, this book does not offer that.<br /><br />Otherwise, what this book was meant to be and its presentation alone is just spectacular and of the plethora of design books that I own, this one is definitely a must have if you are fan of Japanese design.  I love this book!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2004-08-04

This is the book that Japanese drama fans have been waiting for.  As a fan and also a creator of the online J!-ENT Japanese Dorama Database, it is a real pleasure to see a book not only covering Japanese drama but also sentai and including anime references for the anime fans who have discovered Japanese dramas.  Within the last five years, there has been a significant Japanese dorama boom in many countries thanks to the growing popularity of anime, Japanese music and Japanese/Asian entertainment.  Although Japanese drama is not readily available as Japanese animation or Asian cinema on DVD, there is a growing fandom for dramas thanks to the International channels, Japanese rental stores, fan-trading/subbing, BT and VCD's.  What I like about this book is that it has something for everyone.  For fans looking for information on trendy Japanese dramas, the very long duration NHK and TBS dramas (especially those samurai/historical dramas), sentai and of course, dramas within the last fifty years, I was very impressed how the authors handled and included them in this book.  What I worried about the most was the translation or the titles that would be used for the drama because what other countries have used as their English title for a Japanese drama has nothing to do with the translated title and thus, I was happy by the way this book handled that.  One thing that also impressed me is the author and Stone Book Press's dedication to update the encyclopedia (there are dramas missing and a few errors but they are not as numerous and can be fixed in the next version especially with the input from readers).  For a freshman book, it actually surpassed what I was expecting and I highly recommend the purchase of this book.  So, may you be the trendy drama fan like me or the fan who just watched the live version of GTO or You're Under Arrest and are hooked and want more!  This book is THE ONLY SOURCE that you will find this much information on Japanese dramas.-KNDY	2003-12-29

The artists featured in &quot;The Japanese Experience: Inevitable&quot; are artists that I have come to enjoy from seeing their art in magazines such as &quot;Giant Robot&quot; and other publications.  As a purveyor of art in Europe and especially in Asia, the art presented in this book is quite amazing.  The book features fine artists in Japan and the copy is featured in English and Jerman.<br />As much as I enjoyed looking at the book, reading the book is a different story.  As much as I enjoy cultural literacy and learning new words, upon reading this book, I felt that Gregor Janse may be a bit too cerebral in the words and the way he writes.<br />The book, while informative, reads like one of those cerebral college books that you just don't want to read.  I own so many art books and this book has to be one of the most cerebral and for me that's fine but for others...<br />By the cover alone, this book is going to attract anime fans and fans of Japanese pop culture but is this book targeting them or the art afficionado?<br />A book with so much potential and what could have been a fun book to read is more like a scholarly thesis.	2003-09-09

(4 stars)	&quot;Illustrator 10 - Mastering Art Design&quot; is a very good training book.  Similar to the Adobe Illustrator Classroom in the Book which is for beginners, this one is for those in the intermediate level.  The book comes with a CD like most training design books.<br />I was really impressed by the type of projects you learn and some of the things you create are really stylish and cool!<br />I highly recommend this book but for those with at least some knowledge of Photoshop.  This book is intended for the intermediate level. For instance, in the first project, you will need to make ruler guides and rotate the guide to an angle.  Also, you will be dwelving into meshing and blending colors.  This is not a beginner book to explain what meshing and blending is about.<br />So, if you are a beginner, check out the Illustrator 10 bible. Then with a bit of knowledge you can dwelve into this book because you will be making really awesome things with this book.<br />As for the book, it is easy to follow but it really asks a lot from you especially if you are good using the pen tool.  I've used Illustrator for years and to this day, I'm not good with the pen tool.  So, for this book on certain projects which asked to make something with the pen, I switched to the pencil tool, used a Wacom pen on my tablet and drew it (if you have good control with your mouse, use a mouse)<br />Otherwise, it's a really good book.  The type of projects are very glamorous and stylish compared to other Illustrator books with projects/training.<br />Check it out!	2002-12-25

I remember when I first saw this book at the bookstore and turning the pages, read a little about how artists have gone digital and showing the kind of art they have created digitally and also how they did it.  I was really amazed by it.<br />But I guess if anything, I was more or less inspired by buying the book because of Peter Max's foreword on digital art.<br />I really enjoyed learning about the digital artists and why they went digital, that was awesome.  The bonus is a certain artwork shown and then how they created and what type of hardware/software they used and I'm just very passionate about this book because no other book at this time on digital art comes close to this one.<br />Price may be a little steep for some but for those who dreamed or have a passion for digital art, think of it as a worthy of investment because this book is indeed a rare gem.<br />Highly recommended!	2002-12-25

I have invested in many books for my company and for myself for \\"idea\\" inspirations but for those in a very tight budget, design books and magazines can be quite expensive and there are many out there that some may feel a bit confused.<br />What I like about \\"The Big Book of Design Ideas\\" is that it takes several of those different books ...and condense it all into one book.<br />So, in a way, for those who can't purchase many books, I highly recommend this one because it shows visuals for annual reports, books, catalogs, calendars, exhibits, self-promotions, logos, letterheads and a few dozen more.<br />For those who do own many books, you can look at this book as something to glance in one setting from creative people throughout the world and instead of looking through many books, perhaps this book may have what you are looking for.<br />A very good visual resource for designers looking for a design \\"ideas\\" book.	2002-12-16

September 11th was a day that many of us will remember.  Some would like to forget but for many, they will not forget this day because the truth is, this day has charged our lives forever.<br />With several books on the market about September 11th, &quot;What We Saw: The Events of September 11, 2001 - In Words, Pictures, and Video&quot; by CBS News, Dan Rather has one thing going that pushes this book up as one of the primary purchases for those looking for books on 9/11 and that is this book includes a 2-hour full length DVD.<br />The book focuses the experiences of individuals, individuals from other publications and people working for CBS.  Dan Rather mentions in the beginning how people like to ask one another, what were you doing when you first heard of the first attack on the first tower.  This book features those articles and interviews.  The book shows black and white photos that many of us have seen on newspapers and other publications and it is definitely an interesting read.<br />But of course, the highlight is the DVD.  The DVD features in documentary style round two dozen chapters focusing on the first report with Bryant Gumbel talking to people near the World Trade Center and the shock when the second plane hit the other tower.  The DVD features footage from the Pentagon after it been hit.  CBS reporters who were near the WTC when it hit, reporting of their situation and how they were saved and to the rescue operation of Ground Zero.<br />This DVD also features something for everyone.  Analysis of what has happened, the heroes of 911, the children who lost a parent, the search for survivors, the NYFD pipers who have been playing everyday for a funeral for their lost brothers, people who survived the WTC, how flags were selling out throughout the US, business owners who lost their business and are in agony of wondering what happened to their employees and so much more.<br />I have watched this DVD several times, showing it to friends and family and the events are still fresh in our memory even though we approach the one year anniversary of 911.<br />I highly recommend this book/DVD.  While books do help to refresh our memory of the dreadful events of the day but also the American spirit that lives, by seeing it via DVD and in video...it makes this item worth purchasing.e events are still fresh in our memory even though we approach the one year anniversary of 911.<br />I highly recommend this book/DVD.

Have you read about the story of a designer who went for an interview with a design company and was not considered because they didn't know terms such as \\"gutter\\" or the difference between \\"seriff\\" and \\"sans-seriff\\".<br />Sure, many of us should know those terms but if you are an individual who wants to continue to learning these terms that printers or professionals tend to use and you are asking yourself in yourself \\"what the heck are they talking about?\\".  Sure, no one will blame you if you were nodding off in your graphic design class or didn't really read that chapter on print terminology or just plainly forgotten the terms but the thing is, if you really want that job, don't want to look ignorant in front of certain people or if you don't want to continually badger that professional, printer or broker of terminology, then \\"the designer's LEXICON\\" is the book that you will find quite helpful.<br />The book is broken down to chapters for terms such as:<br />· Computer Terms<br />· Internet Terms<br />· Photography Terms<br />· Typography Terms<br />· Prepress Terms<br />· Paper Terms<br />· Printing Terms<br />· Finishing Terms<br />· General Terms<br />And to find these words, you are provided with a word finder which helps finding that word in a jiffy.<br />You know paper but you are asked by a client about satin laid paper, a printer wants you to ad a bleed, a designer asks you about glyphs or asks you about a pica size for print where you usually are working more with pixels, it's important to know these words and it's good to have a book that you can look to and get the definition quickly.<br />There are a few reference books that I highly recommend which include popular books such as \\"Artist's &amp; Graphic Designer's Market\\", \\"Pantone Guide to Communicating with Color\\" to name a few,  \\"the designer's LEXICON\\" is one of those books that is worth owning.	2002-08-12

So, to see his way of doing certain tricks definitely helps. You see, I'm not a manual reader and as<br />much as I would like to sit back and learn every new feature of Photoshop 7, I don't have the time and maybe I'm just too hard headed that would rather learn on my own. And if you are like me, then you will definitely love this book.<br />Anyway, for those who are not familiar with his books. You don't have to read it like a usual book, just peruse the pages and if there is a trick you like, you can learn it. He explains step by step how he creates the trick and on each page at it's sides, there are tips for Photoshop 7 users and how to utilize the best image for print or web work.<br />Kelby takes a look at the current Photoshop trends that he sees in magazines within the last year and incorporates it into his book. From metallic effects to 3D effects to advanced shadow techniques and many of the popular effects you see on print and the web from popular fad/tricks such as the tv scan lines, Matrix text, halftone pop dots effect, glassy reflections and so<br />much more. Kelby's &quot;Down &amp; Dirty Tricks&quot; has never disappointed me and has only been a big positive to adding his techniques to my print and web work but also to learn to do certain techniques quicker.<br />An excellent Photoshop reference book!

Every designer likes to challenge themselves to making great designs with typography usage and using unique designs to catch one's attention.<br />I believe that to also catch attention, a designer needs to train themselves in the use of color.  Understanding color.  It's not as easy as it sounds but if you have the right tools and the right people teaching you, you can pull of awesome designs.<br />Also, when it comes to color...it's hard when over the phone, a client or agency wants an ad in a certain color.  \\"I would like a color between burgundy and red\\", \\"I want a dark forest green but not too dark or too light\\" and with your color booklet, you can either take it to the client or agency and have them pick it out and then what's next?<br />Your client wants an orange ad, a red ad, a neutral ad, something energetic, something playful, something... But what other colors would go with that orange, that red, that neutral, etc.<br />For many years I have heard and read about Leatrice Eiseman aka the color guru and the presentations she has given to different groups about understanding color and how color can make a big difference in one's life.<br />I have to admit that my head was spinning in the last few weeks because although I felt I was good with color, I've been given work which used colors that I would not normally pick for ads.  But as a designer, you need to make it happen and thus knowing Eiseman's role and how she has help many people understand color, I looked toward the \\"Pantone Guide to Communicating with Color\\".<br />I have spent a lot of money on color booklets but this book literally... let's just say that I'm happy and has brought new life to my work.<br />Not only does she break down the colors and certain moods, for each section is a section for color combinations.  She goes into the choices of colors and why they are appropriate and why the work.  On the page before it are magazine ads that used those appropriate colors and I was just amazed.<br />Before I would stick with certain colors for certain moods and most of the time, they were the same Pantone colors but now thanks to this book, I'm not afraid to take the step in utilizing other colors for different moods and I can quickly reference what other colors combinations would work for my ads.<br />I don't know how I can emphasize how useful this book is as a tool and reference book.  It goes beyond to what I expected.  If you want to understand color and help your designs to make up a certain mood, this book is highly recommended as the first book under the $50 range!  In fact, this book does even better than some expensive color books are able to achieve.  Check it out!r />Before I would stick with certain colors for certain moods and most of the time, they were the same Pantone colors but now thanks to this book, I'm not afraid to take the step in utilizing other colors for different moods and I can quickly reference what other colors combinations would work for my ads.<br />I don't know how I can emphasize how useful this book is as a tool and reference book.

I own several Visual Quickstart Guides and have enjoyed Sandee Cohen's books for several years now and &quot;InDesign for Macintosh &amp; Windows&quot; is a good reference book to have.<br />As mentioned, I'm one of those that try to not visit a bookstore because I end up coming out with too many design books (and yikes, you know how much those books can cost).<br />With InDesign 2.0, there is anticipation for the upcoming Real World InDesign book by Olay Kvern which will be released in September 30th and of course there is Adobe's InDesign 2.0 Classroom in a Book which has been receiving bad reviews due to it's rush release with text omissions and typos galore.<br />But with this book (which is the cheapest among the InDesign books out right now), Sandee Cohen does a great job.  Actually, what made me enjoy this book compared to her other books that I have purchased is that she goes into how she makes books with InDesign and from reading her sidenotes, she has passion for the software even though she has taught Quark for over 15 years.<br />When the writer shows enthusiasm about the software and also gives 100% in helping the reader understand in preparation for the print side of their work in InDesign, you can't help but enjoy this book.<br />Many of us who switched to InDesign 2.0 are learning every moment with each product about how cool this software is and this book helps appreciate InDesign even more.<br />She tackles everything from color, styling, layers, pen and beziers, text effects, pages and books, libraries, tabs and tables, automatic text, typography controls, color management, output and so much more.<br />Anyway, for those who want an great reference book for InDesign 2, check out this Visual Quickstart Guide.	2002-08-12

I have been using Adobe Photoshop 7 on MAC OS X for several months now and the upgrade has been wonderful.  The actions, styles and patterns have been really great for the work I have done so far BUT there were plug-ins that I used on previous versions of Photoshop that I miss such as Extensis PhotoFrame and pretty much once you use 7, you don't want to use the previous versions of Photoshop especially in Classic Mode.<br />Well, on many projects, especially building advertisements, I'm always craving for something that can run on the latest Photoshop.  Also, to save me time in making the ads.  That's why there are downloadable actions that help speed that time up BUT unfortunately, I don't have the time to jump around websites and look for certain actions, styles, gradients, etc.  If I need to create a marble background, a plastic, glass icon, etc. I would have to do it manually and it does take time.<br />With \\"Photoshop 7 One-Click Wow!\\", this book/CD has eliminated that extra time in creating backgrounds, gradients or special effects.  Also, you would save a lot of money compared to software plug-ins that would cost you close to a hundred bucks, you're saving a lot of money with this book/CD.  The CD comes with over 800 one click makeovers for brushes, tool presets, patterns, gradients, actions and rollovers.<br />Sure, for some purists, it's fun to challenge oneself to seeing how quickly you can do an effect but if you are a designer who has to deal with many deadlines and multiple projects, you need to eliminate as much time from creating these effects, so you can get some good night's sleep (sleep, what sleep?) or that extra hour to go to lunch or dinner.<br />Pretty much install the WOW! Folders to the corresponding Photoshop folders and append them and it's all one click which you can adjust frame sizes and more.<br />Jack Davis & Linnea Dayton have provided us with an awesome tool for designers.

As a designer that purchases more design books than what he needs (or has time to read), it is suffice to say that I have purchased many books on letterheads, business cards, etc.  In these books, you see how design companies created letterheads and business cards for their clients.<br />And there are good books out there but have you ever wondered what the letterheads and business cards for design agencies/firms look like?<br />What \\"Designers' Stationery: How designers and design companies present themselves to the world\\" does is just that.<br />When I first saw this book, I just had to purchase it because there is nothing like it out in the market.  Every book is again about the designer's clients and this book shows you the innovative letterheads, envelopes and business cards created by these companies.<br />I would have given this a five star rating but one thing that I didn't see that is important to me when buying books on stationary is the paper stock these design companies used to print their stationery on.  Sure, it's nice to see special features listed but for most books on stationery, it's useful and nice to know the paperstock used.<br />If you don't mind spending [money] to checking out how international design companies putting some flare into their stationery, check this book out.  You really see some innovative ways they are able to attract attention.  It might even make you want to redo your own stationery.  Check it out!	2002-08-12

My wife and I first heard this book being promoted on television and as avid readers of entertainment publications and books, I figured that I would give Richard Roeper's second book on &quot;Urban Legends&quot; a try.<br />Once I received the book and started reading a few pages, I was instantly hooked. Next thing you know, I read the book completely. It's that entertaining.<br />The book covers mostly urban legends relating to movies and television and a few on music.<br />Without revealing too much what's in the book, here are a few urban legends that some of you may or may not know:<br />* Was John Wayne a draft-dodger? Can America's movie icon who was portrayed in many movies as a military hero be a draft-dodger in real life? True or False?<br />* Did Monica Lewinsky actually tell Larry King, &quot;I've learned not to put things in my mouth that are bad for me&quot;? True or False?<br />* Did Tom Green really attend a Bar Mitzvah dressed as Hitler? True or False?<br />* The reason why the Little Rascals is no longer on television is because Bill Cosby purchase the rights of &quot;The Little Rascals&quot; and he didn't want it shown anymore because of the shows portrayal of Blacks? True or False?<br />* Did Mama Cass of the Mamas and Papas die of a ham sandwich? True or False?<br />* Did Jane Fonda really betray P.O.W.'s during a trip to Hanoi? True or False?<br />* Is the children's song &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot; by Peter, Paul and Mary about Marijuana? True or False?<br />* Was Lucille Ball a communist? True or False?<br />* Is there a curse among the actors who were on any of the &quot;Poltergeist&quot; movies? True or False?<br />Roeper does a great job setting up the urban legend and gathering and analyzing the facts necessary to prove the urban legend right or wrong.<br />As a person who never really cared too much for urban legends or followed many of them, I found the book very interesting and informative. I mean, how would I ever know that Chachi of the TV series &quot;Happy Days&quot; was popular in Korea because his name literally translated to &quot;penis&quot;.<br />Of course, for many people who have followed these legends, this book may be of no use to you because it may be a rehash of old legends that you may have known about already.<br />But nevertheless this is one entertaining book that I wouldn't mind sharing with friends.<br />Recommended reading!achi of the TV series &quot;Happy Days&quot; was popular in Korea because his name literally translated to &quot;penis&quot;. <br />Of course, for many people who have followed these legends, this book may be of no use to you because it may be a rehash of old legends that you may have known about already. <br />But nevertheless this is one entertaining book that I wouldn't mind sharing with friends.<br />Recommended reading!	2001-10-17

Lawrence Grobel is a brilliant entertainment interviewer.  I have admired his work and by reading &quot;Above the Line: Conversations about the movies&quot;, his work inspires me even more.  As an entertainment writer, I've always wanted to conduct my interviews like Grobel's.  One thing about Grobel's style is that he's smart, he's a man who does his research and although I have never met the man, his interviews are intelligent, informative and it leaves me complete.  Where magazines tend to have the typical questions that are becoming so damn repetitive in many entertainment publications (and also to short), when you read this book you can tell by his conversations with people like Harrison Ford, Sharon Stone, Oliver Stone and more that they have a certain respect for this man.  I can't wait to read the next book from Grobel (which I hope there is another one) and I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves reading entertainment interviews and to those who are interviewers as well.  &quot;Above the Line&quot; is deserving of the five stars.	2001-06-17

Whether you are a filmmaker who has been in the field for many years or one who is anxiously ready to do their first film, I highly recommend reading &quot;Rebel Without a Crew&quot; by Robert Rodriguez.  The book is literally reading Robert's journal and almost like being with him every step of the way as he gets the film &quot;El Mariachi&quot; created and more.  From beginning to his next project, you can't help but keep reading and not wanting to put the book down.  It's that good!  If there is one thing I truly appreciate is that he writes without the B.S. and he tells you how he feels from the people he meets, the dinner he has, filming a movie with $7,000 and more.  After buying and reading this book, please pick up the &quot;El Mariachi/Desperado&quot; DVD to further enjoy his work by watching the film, how he made the film and also to watch the popular short film he made, &quot;Bedhead&quot;.  Last, borrowing Robert's sentence that he emphasizes quite a few times through the book and DVD.  &quot;First step to being a filmmaker is stop aying you want to be a filmmaker&quot;.  You are a filmmaker.  Thank you Mr. Rodriguez for the inspirational book and proving to Hollywood and those in the industry that things that may have seemed impossible is possible.	2001-06-17
