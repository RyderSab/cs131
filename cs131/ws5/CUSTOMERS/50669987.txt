If this book is faithful and accurate in terms of setting forth the spiritual exercises and theology of Orthodox monks and what Orthodox Christianity is all about, then this book is must reading for all Christians - Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox. (I must leave it to persons well-versed on Orthodox Christianity to judge the book's accuracy and faithfulness, but my 5 stars are based on the assumption that it is faithful and accurate.) Even if one disagrees with the Orthodox goal of Theosis = divinization = union with God, this book will nourish one spiritually because of the many truths it teaches about Christianity and spiritual growth.	2005-08-30

(I think)	This is a great book. At least I think it is. After all, I haven't read it yet - just like all the people here who attack this book HAVE NOT READ IT YET! <br /> <br />They attempt to smear it and the author with false charges, but Klein objectively and non-sensationally gives us The Hillary Story from the perspective of one who has been a non-political, non-partisan journalist/reporter/writer for some of the most respected news sources in the country, including \\"liberal\\" publications like The New York Times. (In other words, this book is NOT an attack from \\"the right wing,\\" even though Hillary and her machine continue to use the \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" mantra to attack her critics.) <br /> <br />Perhaps only Hillary and Bill know the truth about Hillary, but this book gives enough information and perspective to make one think soberly about the unnerving possibility (and danger) of a Hillary Rodham Clinton presidency. <br /> <br />So what if I haven't read the book yet? That doesn't make my review invalid, does it? ;^) Or if it does, then the charges of \\"libel\\" and threats of lawsuits that have come from Hillary's office are also invalid. :D After all, they haven't read it, either. :rolleyes: <br /> <br />Bill O'Reilly should be ashamed of himself for prejudging Klein and refusing to interview him. Is it not possible that Hillary's motives need exposing, and is it not possible that someone other than a right-wing Hillary-hater could write a serious book that does just that? Fortunately, the publicity will ensure that the book is widely read and bought by many. <br /> <br />THEN we can judge whether Klein has made a case that we should \\"Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid.\\"	2005-06-21

But I have reason to question Viorst's accuracy, knowledge, and statements because of the following:<br />P. 79 (Re: Yochanan ben Zakkai and his yeshiva at Yavneh) \\"His yeshiva ... also contributed to compiling and editing the books of the Bible, and presided over the Greek translation of what has since become the Old Testament.\\" I assume he is referring to Aquila's translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek, but \\"the Greek translation of ... the Old Testament\\" began a few hundred years earlier, and many NT quotations of the OT were from this earlier Greek translation (or others). Whatever Viorst means to say, he doesn't say it clearly.<br />P. 87: \\"The word 'Torah,' which means 'guidance,' is absent from the Bible, and appeared only in Talmudic times.\\" Huh???? The word \\"Torah\\" appears 220x in the Hebrew Bible, beginning with Genesis 26:5. How can Viorst mean what he writes here?<br />Thus, while I find the book an interesting history of the way rabbinic Judaism came to be, statements like the above make me wonder if what I'm reading is accurate.<br />The \\"Advance Praise\\" on the back of the dustjacket from Letty Cottin Pogrebin (\\"exhaustively researched\\") and Balfour Brickner (\\"a rich knowledge of Jewish history to produce a brilliant, accurate ... analysis\\") supports Viorst's veracity -- but the above two quotes undermine it, and there may be others that I won't recognize, due to being ignorant of these other matters.<br />Having written the above, however, this book is eye-opening and fascinating reading for those like myself who have never read about this dark side of Jewish history. And it is dark.<br />If the author is basically accurate (his endnotes and bibliography support him being accurate), then this is a troubling book that merits reading.	2004-01-19

Reinman (Orthodox) is by far the better arguer, and Hirsch (Reform) apparently \\"thinks\\" he's responding to Reinman's statements, but he consistently avoids the issues and just moves on to new topics. It's almost humorous how every time Hirsch cites the Talmud to prove his point or make a point, Reinman rebuts him with the full citation and a more valid interpretation, to which Hirsch responds with ... nothing. But what can he say? Reinman defeats him at nearly every twist and turn. <br />My background is Jewish, though I am a Christian now. Reinman makes a pretty solid case (perhaps indirectly) that there is Judaism and there is ... everything else. Yes, Hirsch is still a \\"Jew,\\" as are all Reform Jews and non-believing Jews (like my parents), as Reinman states, but to call them \\"Jewish\\" is I think being generous and even wrong. Also, Hirsch's religion or philosophy is logically bankrupt. It makes no sense. You have to read the book to see the illogical arguments that he makes to support the kind of religion he practices and leads (he is a Reform rabbi). If you don't believe in the Torah except as something to argue with and disobey; if you don't believe that God and His will can be known, but that it's the journey and the multitudinous efforts to get around the plain teachings of the Torah, rather than knowing God or anything sure about Him and obeying Him, that counts; if that's what one's so-called \\"Jewishness\\" consists of (at least at the theological/philosophical level), then what's the point? Why even bother to call yourself \\"Jewish,\\" especially if you DON'T believe in the divine nature and revelation of the Torah and that God actually appeared and spoke to the ancient Israelites in such a way that what He said and did was faithfully recorded and passed on to the descendants of those who stood at Sinai?<br />On the other hand, after reading WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THIS PEOPLE? by Michael Viorst, \\"orthodox\\" Judaism and its claims re: the \\"oral law\\" and that it and it alone are \\"true Judaism\\" are also somewhat specious, and Reform (and Conservative) Judaism have some justification in their favor. Unfortunately, Hirsch showed himself to be totally inadequate for the task of defending Reform Judaism to Reinman. And Reinman, obviously, did not go into details re: Orthodox Judaism's checkered past.<br />The book is a good, if combative, way to learn the views of these opposite ends of the Jewish spectrum.	2004-01-14

The beginning cites the faulty and now-disproven Torah codes as proof of the inspiration of Scripture. Maybe the rest is better, but what I read did not impress me.

That Upton Sinclair would write the forward, and say that the book is \\"a well-researched and well-written book; a work of scholarship and discernment,\\" says more about the worth of this book than anything I could ever write.<br />Kelsey himself went off into strange theological and spiritual places, which disheartened and concerned his former admirers and friends like LeAnne Payne, and I would not endorse some of the other books he's written (his book on Christian healing is good, though). But I say -- if you can find a copy of this book, GET IT. Read it. The \\"Charismatic Movement\\" somewhat officially began in 1960, and it's had its ups and downs, but the reality of the Holy Spirit and the Charismatic manifestations continues to change peoples' lives today.<br />For another good book on the subject, read John Sherrill's THEY SPEAK WITH OTHER TONGUES, also first published in 1964.	2003-11-08

After reading the first two chapters of this book, I was beginning to despair that it might ever make sense, or that the author might have anything of lasting value to say.<br />Reading it is definitely a struggle, as it has to be one of the most confusingly-written books I have ever read. Think FINNEGAN'S WAKE with real words.<br />(Okay, maybe not that bad, but we used to have a guy at church who talked on and on and on in a confused succession of sentences -- which did carry on a theme and make a point of sorts, but at the end of the largely one-sided conversation, you wondered exactly what he had said and what was his point. Reading Moody's book brought back memories of conversations with that guy.)<br />Moody may indeed have an intriguing and valid model for the Parousia and its relation to the Kingdom and Jesus's real and/or spiritual presence and/or absence. He discusses the flaws of the major schools of thought on this subject -- Futurist, Liberal, Preterist -- and posits an understanding that incorporates the valid aspects of all of them. At least that's what I think he's doing here. As I said, this book is one tough read, and it's not because I cannot read. Rather, Moody's writing style is, in my opinion, not very good, and is in fact quite awful for this kind of thing, as this subject matter necessitates the author being clear and precise, lest he lose the reader in his juggling and comparison of scheme after theme.<br />Following is an excerpt from pp. 113-114. Imagine 240+ pages of this turgid prose, and you'll have an idea of what reading the book is like:<br />\\"To describe this mystery, we have previously defined God's methodology of revelation as the simultaneous presence of the 'already' and the 'not yet.' We have used the word 'paradox' for lack of a better term, as one of its Webster definitions is, 'a statement that seems contradictory, unbelievable, or absurd but that may actually be true in fact.' Having arrived at a rather unconventional hypothesis, derived from a widely-accepted model of God's revelatory method, we are left looking back over a landscape scattered with decidedly precious gems of insight. It will be our task to arrange those gems, all of them building blocks of major eschatological schools, into a pattern that supports the hypothesis. Failing that, we shall hopefully have demonstrated that one can at least experiment with the 'view from the top' without losing hope, the essence of the Kingdom, or Jesus' intent in the Olivet Discourse of comingling (sic) the destruction of Jerusalem with His Second Advent.<br />\\"On the other hand, if the pieces should come together to make the hypothesis of this treatise plausible, the task is by no means complete. There will always be the debate over literal versus figurative interpretations of Scripture, as there will be endless opportunities to refute the construct as well as the logic at every level. That is as it should be. However, there is much more at stake here than just another theory. The nature of the Parousia pales into insignificance compared with the need for all of us to stand in awe, not only of what has happened in the past, but of what will happen in the future, understanding, of course, that neither can be divorced from the other.\\"<br />The author is a pastor of a church and has a Ph.D. in theology. Lord knows what listening to his sermons must be like, if he teaches and preaches the same way he writes.	2003-07-18

Judging by the rest of the book, though, I would assume that he is correct in what he writes.<br />This book is a cry for help, a call to attention, and a sober and prophetic warning. To me, it's must reading for Evangelical pastors and churches. I intend to give a copy to our pastor (a large and largely White church) for him and the elders to read and see if it gives them insights on what's the right thing to do in reaching the minority members of our town. I gave my copy to a Black friend/pastor I know and am looking forward to discussing it with him.<br />It's also must reading for ANY White Christian who wants to begin taking steps on the road to racial partnership* with Black Christians.<br />* Note that I did not say \\"racial reconciliation.\\" After reading this book, you will never use that term again, if you have been prone to use it.<br />Bravo, Clarence Shuler!<br />He counts as one of his closest friends Gary Chapman.

Primarily I want to address the other reviewer's comments about cessationists being cautious about subjective or personal testimony in this area. While I don't want to belittle the need for adherence to the Scriptures in these matters and the need to check these things out by the Scriptures, and to study what the Scriptures teach about these things, much of the Bible IS personal experience. It's what men and women experienced of God. And though &quot;these things have been written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have Life in His name&quot; (John 20:31), New Testament faith is also based on subjective and personal testimony to these things in our lives (Galatians 3:5). As one who does NOT believe that God stopped doing these things with the passing of the apostles or the close of the canon, nor that the Scriptures teach such a doctrine, I expect believers to be able to give subjective and personal testimony to these things as a sign that &quot;God is among [them]&quot; (I Corinthians 14:25). As Philip said to Nathanael: &quot;Come and see&quot; (John 1:46). Keener provides both Scriptural arguments and personal testimony to the validity and reality of this theology.	2003-03-30

Reading the Early Church Fathers and the New Testament caused me to believe that the Early Church did not hold a merely symbolic view of these things, but I was not convinced by Catholic arguments for transubstantiation -- and other aspects and teachings of the liturgical, orthodox churches (Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox) were problematic such that to leave Protestantism to join them for the sake of a \\"more meaningful\\" Eucharist was not an option. Almost two years ago I had a quasi-mystical experience of the Lord's presence during communion that increased my desire to know what to make of this \\"ritual\\" or \\"sacrament\\" and what it signified and how Christ's presence (or lack thereof) at the Eucharist should best be explained or understood or taught. No specific answers were forthcoming, nor additional \\"illumination.\\" Then I came across this book and it rekindled my interest in the subject. (Interestingly, for the last 3 years we have been attending a \\"Bible Church\\" whose pastor is strongly Calvinistic in his beliefs and teaches a purely symbolic and \\"memorial\\" view of the Eucharist -- the very thing the author of this book critiques and rejects as being non-Calvinist and foreign to historic Christian teaching). This book could create some serious theological disturbances in denominations and churches which hold to a purely symbolic or memorial view of communion, and even if they choose to reject the author's position, I think every such church should read this book. This book is NOT just for reformed churches or Christians, but for every Christian like me who has asked \\"Why bother with communion or baptism if they're just symbols ... and if they're NOT just symbols, then what are they?\\" My personal experience was of Christ being present with us as we broke the bread and drank the cup, diningwith us in His Father's Kingdom, at His table. Mathison's book doesn't present this view, but he does seriously present the argument that Christ is present to the believer and that the believer truly does (by faith) eat and drink Christ at the Eucharist.	2003-03-11

I also read a number of other similar books, including Surprised By Truth and Born Fundamentalist, Born Again Catholic. I even listened to Scott's testimony tape, and bought and read his books on Revelation and Mary.<br /><br />(I also looked seriously at the Orthodox church. It, too, has its famous converts from Evangelicalism - e.g., Peter Gillquist, Franky Schaeffer - and their testimonies, books, etc. EDIT Update: In fact, from 2005-2008 we attended and eventually joined the Orthodox Church - but then left for various theological and Scriptural and ecclesiological reasons.)<br /><br />But the more I read, the less convinced I became. Upon reading the Hahns' book a second time, while I was again stirred by the emotions that reading it can raise, later reflection made it clear to me just how much emotion was involved. Kimberly's conversion seems to be nothing but emotion-driven and emotion-confirmed, though she does document her reading and studying to answer and explore the questions and doubts she had.<br /><br />Despite my best efforts to be convinced by the Hahns, or even to convince myself (because I have definite problems with the present-day Evangelical and Charismatic Protestant church(es), even though I have been attending them for 26 years), there are just too many things that they distort or gloss over or simplify or pretend aren't issues to convince me. For example, a big deal is made out of their discovery (contra sola fide) that our salvation is not by faith alone, but by grace alone. Yet, Paul's argument in the early chapters of Romans seems to contradict this Ephesians 2:5,8 gospel the Hahns are preaching.<br /><br />I gave this book 1 star to offset the many 5-star ratings it's being given. I would actually give it 1-1/2 or 2 stars, because it's not a bad book, and may do so later if I edit my review or change my rating.<br /><br />If you think this book has convinced you, as an Evangelical, to become a Roman Catholic, please do some searching on the Internet and in bookstores to read the other side of the story, the things the Hahns oversimplify or don't even address.	2003-01-22

While breaking the other commandments would be known by outward acts of disobedience, the commandment against coveting was the commandment that preceded and underlay the breaking of the others, yet remained hidden within a man's soul (and sometimes even hidden from himself) until it manifested itself by the breaking of one of the other commandments. James also lays the blame for man's sins on coveting (James 4:1ff). Freedman is right to single out this commandment from the other nine, as it's the scarlet thread (Freedman's oft-used term for his thesis) that ties the other nine -- indeed, man's whole fallen nature, INCLUDING the cause of the Fall (Eve's desire/coveting of the forbidden fruit) -- together. Recognizing this leads one to the Apostle's cry (and solution) in Romans 7:24-25. Failing to recognize this leads to the abortive attempts at righteousness that the Apostle also describes in Romans 10:3.<br />But back to the book: This is so well-written, so accessible, that the most ill-educated (biblically) layman or laywoman can read this with pleasure and understanding. Bravo, David Noel Freedman! Even if you don't agree with all of it, it's worth reading all of it.	2002-10-29

His/her comments that Alfred Marshall is not a Greek scholar and that he is/was in cahoots with Zondervan to promote the NIV translation is ... nonsense. Marshall's interlinear was done in 1958, long before the NIV was in development. Read the preface/introduction. <br />That said, this is a good choice in interlinears, as it gives you a formal equivalence (NASB) and a dynamic equivalence (NIV) translation to compare with the interlinear, to see how different translation approaches render the Greek text. Personally, I don't use an interlinear much, as I can read NT Greek, but I recommend this to those who want an interlinear.	2002-07-30

Using this one can go straight to the Greek-English concordance in this Zondervan series and study the usages of the word, and armed with the Kohlenberger-Goodrick/Strong's number, one can use number-keyed lexicons like Thayer's, Vine's, etc. (though these are not the most recent and accurate lexicons).<br />However, the Greek word order in the Greek NT is a very significant part of the author's style and meaning, and because the Greek text here has been rearranged to fit the English translation (NIV) word order, the user of this volume will not be working with the NT Greek text as it was written.<br />This volume makes it much easier for the non-Greek reader to be able to find the corresponding Greek word and then do further research. And, the parsing information is very useful -- it eliminates the need to buy an analytical lexicon, and saves a step in one's word study, i.e., one can go straight from this volume to the Greek-English Concordance and then, armed with the lexical form of the word, to a Greek lexicon like BAGD/BDAG. But one should also have a regular interlinear at hand to see the actual Greek text word order, to see which words/elements the author has \\"fronted\\" or emphasized.<br />Also, I think that a more literal word-for-word translation might lend itself better to this kind of reverse interlinear than the NIV, but I know this volume is part of Zondervan's complete student library of Greek language tools based initially on Mounce's popular grammar (which I learned from). Since Zondervan owns the rights to the NIV translation, all their Bible study tools in this (and other) series use, by default, the NIV text.<br />I am looking forward to Mounce's book on GREEK FOR THE REST OF US (due March 2003), which supposedly complements this book.	2002-07-18

It needs to be proven that different people would pick the same word groupings and phrase/clause limits that Washburn has done (e.g., on his Web page with examples, he explains which relevant or distinct words he limits his target phrases to, even admitting to omitting words as not essential to the thought). Otherwise, Washburn could be adding or subtracting preceding or following words to achieve the numbers he seeks.<br />2. The Greek New Testament text is replete with textual variants. No modern Greek New Testament text, or even any book within the text, is based on the reading of a single manuscript. Rather, the text is a patchwork of readings from the thousands of extant manuscripts, and is created by textual critics who have been trained how to determine what is probably the best reading when manuscripts differ. Get a copy of the Nestle-Aland 27th edition (the latest critical text of the Greek New Testament) and you'll see how frequently the manuscripts vary. Sure, it's often only a word or two, or a letter or two, but since Washburn's thesis is dependent upon calculating the values of the letters that are in the text, a change in even single letters will often alter his results. I know he explains in his first THEOMATICS book how he dealt with this, but it doesn't solve the problem. NO ONE can precisely say what the original manuscripts said on a word-by-word basis.<br />3. It needs to be proven that other pieces of literature do not show this same apparent numerical consistency between related topics. E.g., if one could show that phrases having to do with velociraptors in JURASSIC PARK exhibit a common mathematical relationship (e.g., by assigning numerical values to the letters of the English alphabet to make it correspond to how the Hebrew and Greek alphabets use letters for numbers), that would likely nullify Washburn's hypothesis.<br />NOWHERE in his books, to my knowledge, does Washburn provide answers to the above -- i.e.,show that these objections to or questions about his theory can conclusively be demonstrated to be invalid, and that his theory stands the test of examination and comparison.	2002-07-11

I don't know what Jesus this Dr. Stewart reads about in the gospels -- perhaps the Jesus of \\"Happiness is a Warm Fuzzy Jesus.\\" She should read People Of The Lie by M. Scott Peck. All people don't deserve open unconditional entry into your life or unconditional accepting love. There is an ENEMY, folks, and he/it will wreak havoc with your life if you don't discern what spirit(s) people are operating under. And there is also the FLESH controlling what some people say and do, and just as we are to make no provision for the flesh and its lusts in our own lives (Romans), we need to be careful about feeding the carnal appetites and destructive behaviors of others. Jesus cast out demons; He told people to repent; He met people on the terms on which they should be met. Paul turned a believer over to satan because of his misbehavior. \\"Let's be a doormat for Jesus\\" is not spiritual -- it is just as fleshly as being hateful and putting up WRONG boundaries. Jesus's God authored the Old Testament, and Jesus endorsed its teachings, and the book of Proverbs has much wisdom that can be applied today, too. It speaks of fools and sluggards and liars and evil people, people who misuse others, etc., and tells how to deal with and respond to them.	2002-07-08

Zondervan confirmed for me that they make only one edition of this CD set, it's not abridged, and it has a 48-page booklet.<br />This is a useful tool for learning vocabulary. The pronunciation is clear, though the recording volume could be a bit higher/louder, I think. It's the best, if not the only, of its kind of thing out there.<br />I would have liked to have had him give aorist and/or future forms of verbs where the stem differs from the indicative - e.g.: &quot;ERCOMAI - I come, I go; future: ELEUSOMAI; aorist: HLQON&quot;. This is the reason I do not give it four or five stars.<br />My suggestion for a follow-up CD set would include alphabetically reciting verbs with all their principal parts as found in the New Testament, and if he's really adventuresome, reciting the complete verb conjugation paradigms (regular, liquid, contract, MI verbs, etc.) and noun declension paradigms, and maybe even lists of words related by roots.<br />Still, despite my personal quibbles with this set, I would recommend that any first-year or second-year NT Greek student get it.

Hence, she doesn't come to the easy answer of \\"If only Blacks and Whites (or Jews and Gentiles or Hispanics or American Indians or Palestinians and Israelis, etc.) would understand each other better, these problems wouldn't exist.\\" She won't be that simplistic, and for that reason, SOUL SISTER raises (or should raise) larger issues in the readers' minds than the subject matter might lead one to expect.<br /><br />Read it.

US	50669987	RTG02PF8MSKDX	0964958805	463991269	Twisted Scriptures: A Path to Freedom from Abusive Churches	Books	4	61	66	N	N	A valuable book	I have read this book, and I would say (not being too familiar with the field of \\"exit counseling/abusive church counseling\\" literature, though I read Steve Hassan's book (Jew former-Moonie) - COMBATTING CULT MIND CONTROL - years ago) that it's a pretty good book. If you deal with people who are or were in controlling churches (a lot of the book focuses on the Shepherding/Discipleship movement), or if you yourself were a victim or member of such a group, or even any abusive church, then you should buy this book.    In fact, this book is good to read if you're involved in most conservative Christian denominations/churches/movements, even \\"good\\" ones, as it will prompt you to continue to \\"prove all things [and] hold fast that which is good\\" as the Scriptures teach us to do, and not just accept leaders' statements or teachings. If you are discipling someone, or if you yourself are being discipled, this book has many good checks and balances and insights that should help you discern between good discipling and abusive or poor discipling. If you are in a small group that is designed to help you and others grow spiritually, this book will also be of value.    We were in a church that had some serious problems, and we finally left it. Skimming through her 6-page checklist at the back of the book of abusive characteristics, I would say that for us at least (I can't speak for the persons in our church who lived together at the \\"Bible School\\") we experienced few of these things, at least not in as overt a way as many controlling groups, but I would bet that if I sent Ms. Chrnalogar all my documentation of the things that happened that led to our decision to leave, she would agree that we were in an abusive church situation. She used to be a member of an abusive church or sect or cult (she never names the group) and was rescued by family intervention. She has helped rescue people for 17 years (as of 1997 when the book was written).    She only mentions a few names. She explicitly criticizes several items from the book/workbook EXPERIENCING GOD by Henry Blackaby, a very popular book that my wife and I studied from for a time. She seems to criticize Campus Crusade for Christ, as some of the items she comments on are from their literature (based on the footnotes). One comment, I think, criticizes Navigators literature. She criticizes YWAM at several points. She is apparently now a Catholic, which may explain these criticisms of Evangelical Protestantism. I couldn't tell if she is Charismatic.    The Appendix on the history of the Shepherding/Discipleship Movement is fascinating. A particularly relevant item for us these days, as the \\"Five-Fold Ministries\\" and \\"New Apostolic Reformation\\" movements are continuing to gain adherents, is this one:    \\"During this same time [i.e., late 1960's and early 10970's], former leaders of the aberrant 1950s Pentecostal 'Latter Rain Movement' taught that the proper church governmental model was the 'Five-Fold Ministries.' The phrase refers to the presumed hierarchical ordering of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers found in Ephesians 4:11-13. This group taught that the ultimate purpose of these ministries was to unite all believers, and to acquire a divine nature. The Five-Fold Ministries doctrine also held that there are living apostles who are to rule the church and eventually the world.\\"    Chrnalogar's book is such that you could give it to a person in a controlling group and, if they read it, they would be challenged, but not harshly or forcefully or stridently, to examine what their church does and why, and they would be led, if they allow themselves, to do an objective (if that's possible) evaluation of what their group does and teaches - which could result in loosening the hold their group has on them. This book is said to be the foundation of her exit counseling program.	2001-03-18

In his book Grady often quotes from the Kroegers' book (I SUFFER NOT A WOMAN: RETHINKING 1 TIMOTHY 2:11-15 IN LIGHT OF ANCIENT EVIDENCE) and a book by Rebecca Groothuis (and others as well), but shows no indication that he has read or interacted with the well-written critiques of their positions in WOMEN IN THE CHURCH: A FRESH ANALYSIS OF 1 TIMOTHY 2:9-15 by Andreas J. Kostenberger, Thomas R. Schreiner, and H. Scott Baldwin (Editors), 1995. Had Grady done so, he and his readers would know that, e.g., the Editor's response to the reader in the February issue of Charisma that \\"This word in the Greek, authentein, denotes a violent overthrow\\" has very little merit, as this book's meticulous grammatical and exegetical study of \\"authentein\\" shows. Though the book by Kostenberger, et al, is not the final word on the subject, it is a solid work, reflecting a very high level of scholarship. Grady does his readers a disservice -- and perhaps misleads them -- by not making them aware of this book which must be responded to by any and all who promote the full equality of women in positions of authority in the church.	2001-03-06

I have to agree with the reviewer who asks for a transcription of the original text. This book is good and valuable, though not too many earthshaking surprises so far - but I have found some fascinating alternate readings. Many of us already have access to the MT and the LXX in Hebrew and Greek, respectively, but not to the DSS biblical texts in Hebrew. This book (or future editions) would be greatly enhanced if the Hebrew of the DSS reading that differs from the &quot;traditional&quot; text - indicated in this book by italics - were included, either in the text itself or in the appropriate footnote. I suggest showing the Hebrew for an entire verse, not just for the words in italics, as this makes reading such things in context much easier. Listing the Hebrew would also show what is meant by words that are only partially italicized. Without this feature, I cannot give this more than 3 stars, though for those who do not read Hebrew, this is a unique book that they would want to have, and four or five stars wouldn't be unwarranted. For those of us who can read or deal with the Hebrew text, though, there is a constant and unsatisfied &quot;itch&quot; to read the Hebrew behind the italics! Put this feature in and raise the price of the book by $10 - and I'll sell my &quot;English only&quot; copy and buy the new one!	2001-01-21

Renner continues to send his ministry supporters and fans \\"Sparkling Gems from the Greek\\" as part of a daily e-mail (available upon request from his Web site), and these \\"gems\\" contain the same kinds of errors. This book does NOT demonstrate \\"expertise in biblical Greek\\" and neither do his daily \\"Sparkling Gems.\\" For information about the meaning of the Greek, I would advise you to look elsewhere. If you continue to think that Renner exhibits \\"expertise in biblical Greek,\\" I have a simple test for you: Subscribe (on his Web site) to his daily \\"Sparkling Gems.\\" After you've received about 2 dozen of them, print them out and take them to a New Testament Greek professor at a nearby seminary, or a friend or pastor you know who has had several years of schooling or reading in NT Greek, and ask his or her opinion of Renner's statements. You'll have your answer and you won't have to take my word alone for this.

I believe in salvations, healings and deliverances, and rejoice when they occur. I was present and involved in the early moving of the \\"Toronto Blessing\\" in the Dallas Metroplex churches, and have seen and heard many of the major players (K.C. Prophets, et al). As I noted above, I had email exhanges and telephone conversations with the author about his Greek teachings. Mr. Stout is misrepresenting me.
