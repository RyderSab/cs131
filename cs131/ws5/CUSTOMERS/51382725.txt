US	51382725	R1L7PO6F6UOAR1	0671003755	785191741	She's Come Undone	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Impressive	I never thought I would ever read an Oprah's Book Club entry, but after reading the first few pages of the copy I had      bought my mother for Christmas I was sucked in, and ended up buying one for myself. This is the  story of forty years in the      life of Delores Price, who begins  adolescence at a whopping 257 pounds. It's a story of heartbreak,  redemption, love, triumph      and tragedy, and told with such intimacy  that the fact alone that Wally Lamb is a man makes this novel a standout.  (I have read      numerous reviews by women that can attest to this.) After  finishing this I feel as though I have lived alongside Delores,       sharing her thoughts, her dreams, and her pain. I can absolutely guarantee  I will read his next, This Much I Know is True.      Don't miss this one if  you want an emotional read.	2000-02-24

A computer hacker in England breaks into a government file and discovers a list of persons inflicted with a rare brain disorder which identifies the  individual as a potential serial killer. Imagine his shock when he  discovers his name on the list. He takes it upon himself to track down  these potential killers and... Well, that's all you'll get out of me. Don't  miss this!	1999-12-01

I read the novel just as the movie was released in the theater, so I already had Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster pictured as I  was reading  it, which worked very well for me. I later saw the movie and  it really succeeded in bringing the novel to life. You've probably already  seen the movie, but it does miss out on some brilliant dialogue between  Clarice and Lecter. An absolute must read for psychological suspense fans!	1999-12-01

The Poet is a departure from this series, this time the lead character is a crime reporter...Connelly's profession (write what you know,  right?). This novel is about a killer who leaves clues referring to Edgar  Allan Poe. There's also an extremely creepy pedophile and his network of  Internet buddies and his photography methods are enough to give any parent  nightmares. That said, Connelly is a masterful writer, and his novels are  not to be missed.	1999-12-01

Wrong. If Thomas Harris spent the last ten years meticulously  writing this latest installment, I'll eat my liver. Now hang on, I don't  mean to say this is a bad novel, in fact it will make a tremendous movie.  That's the problem...it read like a screenplay. The characters I grew to  know in the last novel just didn't seem real enough and I didn't really  feel anything about anyone. The writing seemed rushed, and as a whole  rested on the laurels of Silence of the Lambs, of which there were many  references. On the other hand, the story is pretty darn good. So this is a  mixed review...great story, disappointing writing. To be frank, I first  smelled trouble when the highest accolades came from Stephen King, whose  endorsements I take with a truckload of salt. I recommend you read it, just  don't set your hopes as high as I did and you'll enjoy a good story. And be  sure you have an Italian-English dictionary on hand for those annoying  non-translated passages.	1999-12-01

What a find. This is the  novel that the movie of the same name is based upon, starring Robin  Williams. In the introduction, Matheson explains that the only fiction in  this story are the characters and their relationships. The rest came from  intensive research on the subject. The end product makes so much sense and  seems entirely believable. The story is about a man's journey beyond death  to rejoin his wife. It's the ultimate love story, but beyond that the  meaning of life, yes, The Meaning of Life is revealed here. Now, I'm  hesitant to admit that this novel has changed my life, or absolutely  convinced me of life after death, but it has inspired much hope. It really  makes sense, and I challenge anyone to read it and not be affected by it.	1999-11-29

Patterson does have a terse writing style, but it didn't seem this bad before. It's bad here. All through reading it I was feeling like  Patterson just hacked this one out of the word processer in one draft  without a second glance. For a guy who writes so sparsely, he sure is  repetative throughout the story....'Was Jack up ahead? Was Hawkins Jack?  Was this Jack up ahead? Could this be Jack up ahead? Had we just been that  close to catching Jack?'....This within 3 pages. Who is this guy's editor,  anyway?  Another thing that bothered me was so much pop culture was thrown  in in an obviously contrived effort to authenticate things (Simpsons, ER,  Pulp Fiction, MTV). Now you're wondering, if I hated it so much, why did I  finish it? Well, I have to admit, the story itself was quite good, and I  pretty much had to see it through to see how things turned out. Given the  right director and screenplay, this would make a terrific movie. As for  future Patterson efforts, I'll wait for the movies, thanks.	1999-11-29

This is the followup to Ishmael and if you've read Ishmael, you must continue with this. This is the story of a Laurentain priest who is assigned to investigate a man known only as B, who is spreading the word.  The Laurentains  have a special mandate: to identify and suppress the  Antichrist. The story is fine but is secondary to the message of saving the  world. What was revealed in Ishmael is brought into blinding clarity here.  We're in big trouble folks. We may not realize it but I can guarantee after  reading this you too will realize things must change regarding population  growth or we will extinct ourselves. The increasing rates of population  doubling over the past 10,000 years stunned me. Please please read this and  pass it on to others. This is the most important novel you will read.	1999-11-29
US	51382725	R3N7NGKF5WCHA2	0451180410	215863794	Mortal Fear	Books	5	21	23	N	N	Wow	This is the best suspense novel I have read in ages. If you like psychological suspense and you're familiar with the Internet (of course you  are; you're here, aren't you? ) you will eat this novel! Harper Cole runs  EROS, an online sex chatroom service, and begins to suspect foul play when  women customers begin to disappear from the service but haven't cancelled  their expensive subscriptions. He discovers one of the women has been  brutally murdered and suspects the killer is also an EROS client. The  dialogue is excellent, the storyline makes it almost impossible to put  down, and the characters are well defined. And some of his descriptions of  emotions and human nature were enough to make me stop and marvel at how  good this guy is. And this happened about every 10 pages. Greg Iles has two  previous novels, Spandau Phoenix and Black Cross, both with Nazi Germany  themes. They are definitely on my list now!	1999-11-29

If this novel was half as good as the raves (from such literary giants as People and Kirkus) suggest, we'd be talking Pulitzer here. However, I wasn't impressed. I found the dialogue tedious, and at times downright  stupid. Our hero, who heads an investigation firm picked the most absurd  times to decide his investigation would end. And my God, he had a CRUCIAL  piece of evidence that he carried in his pocket and neglected to get the  damn thing translated from Italian or just plain forgot about it!  It was  so frustrating. And his inane questions...please. Oh, and the  &quot;shocking ending&quot;? Like I couldn't see that coming. But I'm not  going to spoil it for you. I will tell you that there is another novel I've  read that has a similar premise and is a far superior read. The only  problem is I can't reveal what it is because the concept is actually a  spoiler for this novel. Send me an email if you want the title.	1999-11-29

Jeffery Deaver obviously puts a lot of research into his novels. A Maiden's Grave enlightened us on the lives of the Deaf, and now he enlightens us on  the plights of the paralized. Lincoln Rhyme is a bitter quadrepalegic,  formally one of the nation's top forensic criminologists, whose expertise  is called upon to solve a rapid serial killing spree. It's a real page  turner with suspense, surprises, and a few dashes of wit to boot. I also  love it when an image is printed in your mind from the most bizarre of  descriptions. Here he describes a terrified little girl: &quot;Her tiny  chest rose and fell and tears streamed down her face. Her mouth was open  and the dot of her pink tongue seemed glued to the right arc of her  lip.&quot; Man, how original is that? My only knock against the story was  that I felt the evidence seemed to come just a little to easily towards the  end. But what do I know? I'm not a detective. I'm sure luck comes into play  in reality as well.	1999-11-29

A friend sent me an email a while back telling me she would mail me a copy of this as she had received it from one of her reading pals. I finished it late one Sunday afternoon and realized the weekend was lost...I could NOT  put this down. It's one of the most disturbing serial killer novels I've  read, and from my reading experiences that's saying something. My  expectations were high and I try to be cautious about this as it's  inevitable to be disappointed, but I almost stood up and applauded when it  was over. Dylan Jones is most certainly on my must-read list now and I'm  amazed that this novel was published five years ago without my knowing  about it. It deserves every bit of recognition Silence of the Lambs gets.  Incidently, this once again reaffirms my belief that St Martin's Press is a  can't-miss publisher. Every novel I've read published them has become a  favorite of mine!	1999-11-29

Talk about self-destructive! I've always believed interesting characters is the most important key to hooking a reader to a  story. And it ain't a bad story either! A reporter is assigned to cover the  story of a prisoner condemned to die that day. If I say more, I'll ruin it  for you. Just read it.	1999-11-29

The Weatherman has the most interesting cast of characters I've come across in a while. It's also a hell of a story. Someone is committing a murder once a  season before a major weather event. Very well done, keeps you guessing  until the end, and the suspense is relentless. A MUST READ! I can't wait  for Thayer's second novel!	1999-11-29

This is the second in Lehane's series featuring private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro and it really packs a whallup. The first novel, A Drink Before the War, did  a fine job of introducing these characters, along with an adequate story.  This novel digs deep into the relationships of these people, and all the  while we're being pulled through a harrowing serial killer mystery. Lehane  has pulled out all the stops here. Sure, there are many authors who will  try to shock you with gruesome details, but in this novel it's the sense of  the helplessness of the victims that stays with you long after you leave  the story.  If you're like me, and have already read dozens of rave reviews  about this, you'll be about 100 pages into it and will be wondering what  the big deal is. Trust me on this: the novel is so well structured and  timed that it very slowly begins to build up, as if you're treading water  just at the edge of a whirlpool. Slowly and gently the current begins to  tug at you, and before you know it you're caught in its grip and being  pulled to its depths......God, I'm beginning to sound like a Kirkus Review.  Sorry. But the novel is that good and the characters are incredibly well  drawn and complex. Here's a  quote from the story that will stick with me  forever: &quot;We're human, so we're messy.&quot;	1999-11-29

This is set in swealtering Houston where a female police officer is investigating a series of murders. All the victims were upper class ladies who had paid for S&amp;M services. I could not put this down. I've  recommended this novel to three female friends and they all enjoyed it very  much. A great cast of characters, I can't recommend this highly enough.

This is one of those few  pieces of work that will undoubtably change the way you view mankind, and  how we came to be. Your thoughts on the starving of the world will be  challenged and if you accept these views you will question your humanity.  The entire premise of Ishmael is what it is to be human, how humanity came  into being, and why we are rapidly self-destructing. It opens with a  newspaper ad: &quot;Teacher seeks pupil. Must have an earnest desire to  save the world. Apply in person&quot;. The teacher will surprise you. A  word of warning: Don't even think about discussing this novel with people  who haven't read it. The views are not popular and these people simply  won't get it.	1999-11-29

This is another one of those novels that has been on my reading list for years but could never find it well what do you know I found it in the that same clearance book store what a stroke of luck I don't know if I liked  this or not you see the writing was a little hard to get used to you see  it's written in the first person by a very disturbed Irish boy and the  sentences tend to run on with sparce punctuation and no quotation marks for  dialogue but what starts off as annoying becomes easier and puts you inside  this disturbing little mind if you can put up with this kind of writing for  200 pages go for it it's not bad after all it was short-listed for the  prestigious Booker prize and it's truly a unique reading experience  although if this were a 600 pager I couldn't have done it.	1999-11-29

It's huge, over 900 pages, and dates back from Nazi Germany to present day. In a nutshell, it's about a small group of people  with the ability to completely control the actions of people using  telekinesis. For those who have read the novel, this little tidbit will  interest you: I saw an interview with Dan Simmons...the inspiration for  this story came from a dream he had of an old woman in a nightgown being  pursued through a forest by a helicopter.

Earth is part of a dominion of five  other  worlds, and the only one unaware of the others. This novel is about the  reuniting of  Earth to the other four worlds.

I knew Quentin Tarantino was a big fan and was heavily influenced by Leonard. So, after much surfing and  emailing, I determined Get Shorty was likely the best novel to start with.  It was pretty good, but a really light read. What makes Leonard's writing  shine is the dialogue; you've heard the overused &quot;dialogue  crackles&quot; rave? Well Leonard really delivers...this is why his novels  make such successful movies; they read like them. This is a novel perfect  for those who typically prefer movies over novels. I prefer the depth of  Michael Connelly or Greg Iles or Dennis Lehane myself. But this is an  entertaining story and certainly holds your attention, and before you know  it, it's over. Just like a good movie.	1999-11-28

Since trying to stay awake through Insomnia and loathing Regulators,  I've decided to give the rest of his  novels 100 pages before I decide to trash it or stay  with it. Life is just  too short to waste time when there are so many far superior authors out  there. If I didn't keep getting these Stephen Kings as gifts I probably  wouldn't bother at all. On to the review: I have to admit, by page 80 I was  very hooked. Everything went along quite nicely until around page 300, when  the patented Stephen King-stupidness kicked in. You know what I mean: the  villian starts spewing that gawd-awful  baby-talk....&quot;Anna-Anna-bo-Banna,  banna-fanna-fo-Fanna&quot;. Give me  a break. When is King going to grow up with his readers? He's writing for  16 year-olds. I've lost all desire to read any more King.	1999-11-28
