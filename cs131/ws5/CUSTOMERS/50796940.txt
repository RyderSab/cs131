You know, I really hate to say, I don't like a book by a fellow Texan...But I just didn't like the book....So there you go...<br /><br />The characters were not warm and fuzzy, hard to get to know. I would almost say empty of feeling.....I think the end of the book was the best part...not saying it to be mean...it really was a pretty good ending...<br /><br />  I needed reading material for a lot of hospital sitting, and this one took everything, just to get through it. Was good enough to keep reading, you know, like one of those movies, you watch in the wee hours of the morning..and its just awful, but for some reason you keep watching it, mesmerized, and it haunts you for the whole week, in your tired brain.<br /><br /> But you never watch it again, and you keep wondering, why did you keep watching it.	2005-03-08

The other girls in the series will have more depth, Annabelle was the one with the looks, so her story is not as deep. The American girls, will be hell on wheels, when their story comes out..I cant wait for the next book. I see Ms Kleypas reaching out.... and trying something new..and I say...you go girl...she never uses fluff  ***Ever*** so she can take me with her anywhere..I love her writings....and all her books, including this one...were keepers..and read in one sitting.

My kind of book, the kind you cant put down.  First book I have read by Cathy Maxwell, and tomorrow, I will look for her others.<br /><br />  Their loss of breath, got a bit old after reading that line many times during the book... but it was still a very enchanting book.

Got over half way... and it just started dragging. Once the sex started, the pages just started filling up with mostly sex..Fluff fluff and more fluff...... I didn't think I had a modesty level, (what one reviewer noted) but I guess when it comes down to it...I just might have one after all, wanting more  a story and less steamy sex or fluff.....I love Stephanie Laurens, but the Bastion series, has been my least favorite so far. This is the third in the series...and it was not worth keeping for me. On a romance meter....it was very low.<br /><br />  However, on a different note....if you are looking for a book that makes you hunger for sex...this is it!!! The heroine shatters and screams many times. I got to page 324... And those words I was so sick of seeing...I finally screamed and shattered the book.<br />Sorry Ms Laurens, I still love you though... and hopefully the future is not so shattering.	2004-10-10

I know I am late reading this book, I see it was written 1994, but better late then never, I always say.<br /><br /> I LOVED this book, I see one reviewer said rape, was in the book, bodice tearing.(truthfully Gabriel could tear my bodice anyday, he was hunky, and Cassie did not mind, silly girl if she did, it was sizzling, love making, not rape.)  What I saw was passion,  and a love that was always hidden. It reminded me of the older Rosemary Rodgers type of books, I had loved when I was younger. With the man taking forever to see his heart....instead of the independent woman, clinging to her Independence, which I have to say,  I am growing sick of.<br /><br />  I LOVED LOVED LOVED this book, read it in one weekend, and thought it was profoundly romantic to the very end..and even shed a few tears. *sniff*<br /><br />  I salute you Samantha James, very fine read indeed.

I rate my stars by how hungry I am, and Im stuffed... =) Meaning, I put the book down way too much.<br /><br />  Story line was good, and I loved the Duke, but Rebecca the heroine, was as dull as she could be (might be the age 17/18).

The ending was dreadful, I mean a romantic ending of course. But I wanted to tear out Eleanor's hair by the end of the book. I hated how she was such a blabbermouth. The one deep secret she had ..I don't think a soul in the book didn't know by the end. I would have tossed on her ear myself.... if I was Simon.<br />  Candice Hern, is a very gifted writer..and I know somewhere among her books, (this was my second) I will find a keeper, just not the two I have read so far.

I usually Love Quinn, but feel the same way as the other reviewer felt...she has been writing different lately. I lost interest in her books, after the story about To Sir Philip, With Love. All her other books were soooooooooooooooooo 5 star good. She needs to rest and recharge her heart. I did enjoy the Lady Whistledown's comments..they are always enjoyable and fun to read...He bought a brown hat ...to match his brown suit yadda yadda yadda...too funny..Mya Ryan is not known to me..but the story was OK enough to look into her other work.<br /> Not a keeper but worth reading.

I loved how Ms Bradley, made the character, Philippa Atwater,  pretend to be a man. Was a fun read. James Cunnington is just right in romance, and the son he adopts Robbie makes the story flow nice.<br />  I think Celeste Bradley, is a wonderful writer. I love the spy, romance themes of her books. They are all worth reading..this one especially.  The only reason it gets only 4 stars, is they don't hold me long...they all take me a while to read, not the kind of books that make me not eat...not clean the house...not sleep ..wanna play hooky...5 star kind of books. But they are all worth a peek. Not keepers... but getting there.	2004-07-09

The story was good, but the romance in my opinion took forever. Its not until the middle of the book they finally get together, and when they do get together, It still seems to take forever.  It was a little rough for me. To wait that long and then have it that fast without much kissing, was a bit much, and later it was even rougher.<br />  But I loved the spy story (was a tad bit drawn out but not to bad), was a very different read, taking you this way and that, with it changing all along the way. It is a page turner, you will read this one fast. I skimmed over the sex parts myself, except the fruit parts. What they do with fruit is pretty sizzling. Its not a keeper for my library, but it is worth reading.	2004-07-01

I was waiting for this story for a long time, and it was just as great as her other books....It had a slow beginning, I didn't like Christine at first. After reading all the other books, I thought this book would be about his Mistress..... that he had from all the other books, and was a little disappointed how she changed that story. I always felt she would be the one that would melt his cold heart.<br />  But after a few chapters, I snuggled in to a very fine read, and didn't put it down until I finished the book. I LOVE that kind of book.<br />  The story reminded me so much of Pride and Prejudice(my personal favorite book of all times )..Wulfric reminded me so much of the cold Darcy ....and Christine, was so much like Elizabeth Bennet, the way she was playful. Was soooooooooooooo very romantic...I was just more disappointed that it was such a short book, being the last of the series, it should of been nice and fat, and kept me reading all day, and night, and the next day.<br />  I salute you Mary  Balough... once again for a very entertaining day.	2004-06-23

Was expecting good old fashion she-devil kind of book. What you get is just a normal story... of a divorced lady, dealing with divorce, like all divorced people do. No pizazz, no drama, no revenge in sight.<br />  It read slow, it was back and forth, present and past...and when she was writing in the present, it was a fast wonderful read (a little like Daniel Steel), but it would drop when she flashed back, and she flashed back often. Most the flashbacks were drawn out and boring.<br />  I have to agree with some of the reviews, I never saw much of a change in her, I was hoping for a metamorphosis, a moth to a butterfly. What I got was maybe... a grub to a June bug.	2004-04-13

The story was very sweet, and a great idea, but I usually get into my books, and never put them down, once I start a (good) book...and I have to say, I took a week to read this one.<br /><br />  I read the above reviews, and expected more in the book. I was waiting for more detail in her schooling, but that is where it dried up for me. Not enough detail about the sailors teaching her. It was more about her feeling sorry for herself, almost every page of the book. And that got very old... very quick.<br /><br />  If you want to  read a better Susan Wiggs, choose Hostage and that series of three books (they are the only ones I have read so far, until The Charm School, and read all three ....in 4 days) They were so entertaining.<br /> I think the story of the Ugly Duckling, she used in reference... with her pages in this book were more heart felt. I loved reading the sayings she had, before each chapter.	2004-03-18

Mary Balough writes original material, every single time she picks up her pen. The  Bedwyn family is so interesting..each sister and brother so unique. I have to say she is one of my favorite writers, with so much story, you don't want to put the book down..and just enough sex that it is never even close to a trashy book. You just get consumed by her  storie...<br /> At first I was worried about reading Morgan, she is only 18, and I usually hate reading about girls right out of the school room. But Morgan is different and the story she has taken us to, is the battle of Waterloo, so its a little Gone with the wind type romance....and how can you not love that kind of romance.

The story never quits... and the beauty of the forest was vivid and wonderful. I never got bored not for a minute.<br />  The sex left me breathless ...making it feel normal and a wonderful part of the story, not all trashy like some books can do. The animals were entertaining, almost like a Tarzan movie. However, this is not a Tarzan... this is romance and creativity at its best. It is worth keeping, and I will definitly read more books by this author.	2004-03-01

Pam Rosenthal is gifted; I just do not know why her books become so nasty, and sexual.. and unromantic.. half way through them.<br /> This is truly, what people call a trashy romance. I just do not like them. I love sex in my books, but when it gets so descriptive and the words become porn and not romantic. It just turns me off. I threw this away in the trash half way in the book.<br />  I do love the exotic, and Pam Rosenthal is truly exotic. I just do not like trashy. Take the F words out and every position known to have sex in and there is no story anymore. It starts out wonderful and just come to a complete halt.. When the sex starts.	2004-02-24

I am glad the review will be a good review. And that it is...a good review.  Sabrina Jefferies has never let me down.  I just grabbed it from the shelf of the drug store, not knowing it was by Ms Jeffries, I just read the back, it looked ok, and bought it in a hurry. I was so happy when I settled down with it, and saw it was from one of my favorite authors. And even more thrilled... when it turned out to be as good ...as her other books. Romance and a good story. My kind of book. Thanks Ms. Jeffries.	2004-02-24

I love Ms Kleypas, books, and this one is just one more book that I will not lend out. I only lend out books, I know I will not get back..And this is one I will not lose. I loved this book, so romantic, I actually cried in this book.<br />  I picked it up this morning and never put it down. Husband asked for dinner, I stuck out my tongue and pffffft him. He was on his own today. =) I had a wonderful day Lisa Kleypas, thank you, for yet again, another wonderful romance, with so much story you cant put the book down. My kind of book.	2004-02-02

I loved the story, about the rich (Chase) having to come down to earth, and EEK actally work on  a farm, with the wonderful, Ward Family..you will fall in love with this Walton like family. Its so funny and heaped with entertainment...<br /> Talisman Ring books are the very best romance. I just grabbed this one..not knowing it was a Talisman ring book. Ive read all the series so far, and NOT One has let me down. Im ready for the next story..Devon's, I believe...I salute you Karen Hawkins for a great book romp once again.	2003-12-16

Most of Ms. Laurens books are usually filled with wonderful romance and story...but this one starts with a zest, but it gets dull quick, and I was speed-reading over the sex.. To get to the story. I hate that in a book..sex is fine, but not 75% of the book. It is almost a sexual  guidebook.<br /> You have such talent Ms. Laurins, you do not have to fluff your books with sex to sell them..They sell on their very own with your name and wonderful talent....	2003-12-16

After a long absence from reading (10 years), I have been catching up like crazy...One of my favorite authors is Stephanie Laurens...she writes and my heart soars. She is very romantic/descriptive ..My kind of writer ..<br />I will have to say, and I see (by her reviews) most people have liked her new stuff more, I think her older books are more romantic..I also have found her recent writings more sexual, I see her old writings more heart felt and thought out more.  I do not think sex in a book is all there is for romance, and I sure hope making romances more sexual and less romantic is not a future trend.<br /><br />... In addition, I hope Ms. Laurens you remember... there are I am sure ... many that buy books for enjoyment.... for the artist of words...and you are that an artist. Hopefully that woman that grabbed those books, wont get published. She seemed to think woman just read the romance for sex..and thought I was crazy when I tried to show her my favorite authors.<br />  Back to my review, I loved this book, only thing that I didn't like was her age, when I saw she was 18 I thought, oh lord she is a baby....there is no way I am going to get into this book (I like my heroines older)  but it was not to bad....I would give this book a three and a half star..However, you never get half stars on here...*sigh*	2003-12-11

I fell in love with them all.. In addition, after reading every book she writes ...I look at that /sweet/smug smile of hers on the back cover and smile back at her ...and think...life is still good, I still get my romance ... and it is even better then before. Cant judge a book by its cover or um back cover that is. *wink*	2003-12-11

And read them all in a month's time. SHE IS soooooooooooooooooooo romantic and I feel like I am a little girl watching Cinderella, every time I read an Amanda Quick book. They make me feel that magical....I salute you Ms Quick you are such a talent. Your books I will not even lend out, I do not want to lose them. However, umm do not worry, I tell everyone about you.	2003-12-11

Her writings are witty and warm, and I am so happy when I get to meet my heroes again in the next books, granted I do think I am reading them backwards. =) But I do know I will be seeing them again, I will be reading  all this wonderful authors books.

This is my first Victoria Alexander book, so I am not sure how she normally writes.<br /> I gave it four stars because it was very entertaining and so funny. The stars are all for the laughs in this book. I do not think I have laughed so much in a romance before.<br /> I love the story and the characters were very suited, I also loved the sisters, and Thomas's friends.<br /> The part I did not like, was how dumb Marianne was at times. For a woman who was suppose to be such a bookworm and intelligent...she seemed to much a dreamer and silly at times. I wanted to smack her. I understand independence, but she just did not seem very independent to me.<br /> It was fun to read, and I really laughed hard at how hard poor Thomas tried to win her heart....my four stars are all for you Thomas Effington.	2003-12-08

The first book I ever read by Mary Balogh, Was * A summer to remember* in which you meet the Bedwyn family, in which I met Freyja ...and thought she was mean, most unromantic girl in romance fiction. Then this book took all those thoughts... and shoved them out the door...Freyja is written where you see her soul... and understand her tomboyish ways. Only a great writer can change the way you see someone and make her loveable. This book brought a couple of tears, and I never cry in romance books. (At least not often) You fall in love with her energetic... and want to do everything better then a man (You go girl). She is so funny and Joshua is dream come true (pant pant)<br />  I recommend it highly...I salute you Mary Balogh!	2003-12-03

This was a flook,  I never knew it was 2 books in one. What I loved most about this book, is its ALL Romance and not almost all sex. I love how Ms. Laurens writes, so detailed... and you just drift right in her books.<br />This was pure Jane Austen kind of romance. The kind I love the most. The kind that makes your heart float. My kind of romance. I liked both stories. It is slower to read, but that is only because she writes with lush details, that make you enter the book as you read.<br /> I hope Ms Laurens you keep writing like this.	2003-10-21

From the beginning to the end, I was never bored once. She is very romantic, and the sex is not as important, as other romance books. So what you get is more of a  STORY to read, not a bunch of sex  to take up half the book, so  you are wide eyed, involved, to the very end. I even looked up on the internet more information about the great fire of Chicago 1871. It was such a good read,  I bought the other two books of this series, and I am snuggled and happy right now. This is romance at it's best.	2003-10-02

Because you wont be able to put it down, I started late yesterday, and at 3am I was still up reading, only put it down, because I couldnt keep my eyelids open anymore...got up this morning, and finished it by noon..THAT my romantic readers, is a GOOD book. 5 stars from me. First I have read of Gaelen Foley and sure wont be the last.	2003-09-22

Even with this book being slow, I just love how she writes. It is like your right in the book with the characters. Her sex scenes are never dirty and astound you. And she is truly romantic. This book starts and stops, starts and stops. It is not the kind of book you cannot put down, but it is the kind of book you keep picking up, just because you get addicted to it and have to read it all.<br />  I liked devils story better, this one is to much the same, and for a second book in a series, I thought it was to soon to have a repeat of the first. However, I will not give up on this author. She is very gifted.	2003-09-21
US	50796940	ROWWY31WCWL1J	038079456X	386673452	Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)	Books	4	8	8	N	Y	A very good read	This is my second time reading Stephanie Lauren's. I bought All About Passion, first. I did not know it was a series of books, and after enjoying the story of Chillingsworth, I bought Devil's Bride.<br />  Devils Bride was a great read, usually, I get bored, and cheat and look ahead to see what will happen, but this book totally entertained me that I never once, skimmed ahead.<br />  The sex leaves you breathless, the love is not mushy, and she puts a good story in it, so you will not grow bored. True, you do know who did it from the beginning, but what the hey, it was still entertaining, and a great love story.<br /> Buy a mystery if you want a who dunnit book. I buy these books for the romance... and it is romantic. I loved Devil, and his clan, and I am ready to read the next book.<br /> Four stars, only because half way I got a smidge bored, but it picked up again, and I was happy.	2003-09-16
US	50796940	R3P54DQ6GP58VK	155166657X	260814457	Secrets Of The Heart	Books	2	4	6	N	N	Slow read	I read the first 2 books, in this series, and LOVED them both. And even though I love the charactors in this book, the story was so slow, I found myself skipping pages just to finish the book. The story was a good idea, Michael and Rachel were great together as strangers, she should of kept playing with that story line, but it got to boring, with to much information and not enough story ...I completely lost interest half way, and couldnt  get my interest back. I  do love the first two books, if you bought this one before the other two..then go back and buy them, you wont be disappointed with them.	2003-09-01

This book was so romantic, I want to read it over and over and over again. It reminded me for some reason, of The King and I. He was rough around the edges,no manners, filthy rich,  and the heroine was a true Lady, hired to make him a gentleman. I think it stands out all on its own, and seemed very original. I loved, loved, loved this book. It touches your heart with every page from page 1 to the last page.	2003-08-16
