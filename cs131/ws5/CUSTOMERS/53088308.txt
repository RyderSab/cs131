Books	5	8	8	N	N	Great message, great book	This book tells the story of a young soccer player named Mia who quits the game when things don't go her way.  It's through her friends, her brother (sweetly named for the author's late brother), and ultimately herself that she realizes that it's not about winning, but rather about just being in the game.  In fact, on the last page, she's going for a goal, but the book doesn't say whether or not she scored, just that she was there playing, and that's what counts.  There's no better message for a young person that that, as it pertains not just to sports but to life itself.  I bought this for my young daughter who is just starting soccer.  She doesn't know who Mia Hamm is, but I certainly do, and can't wait to read it to her.  Even if she doesn't stick with soccer, the lessons in this book will be ones we talk about for a long time.  Mia doesn't disappoint in this book - she proves yet again what a role model she is for all of us.  I highly recommend this book!	2004-09-22

This is the real deal	I just received my copy of &quot;Windows XP: Top 100 Simplified Tips and Tricks&quot; and I can honestly say that I have never learned so much, so fast.  I've been using XP for about a year now, and consider myself comfortable with it.  But I always felt there were some things that were right within my grasp to do, but I couldn't figure them out intiutively.  Well, this book has them all.  Want to organize your documents or photos better?  Configure XP to work as you want it to?  This book has it.  It's organized in a logical manner, unlike Windows XP Hacks.  Finally, I just love the &quot;Visual&quot; approach.  It's much easier to see what I am doing, rather than reading about it.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to get the most out of XP, fast and easy.	2003-11-03

After all the annoying hype Leo gives this tome, you would think there would be something special in here.  Instead, it's rehashed filler that you can find just as easily on the web for free.  If you are fan of Leo's (for whatever reason) buy this book.  If you're looking for a way to learn PC tips, tricks and in-n-out's, there are a million other more worth books with title worlds like &quot;tips, hacks, steps&quot; etc.  If you are looking for a gift for the geek in your life, sadly, this is not worth the price of admission.  You'd do better to look at the Amazon bestseller list here and see what people here really want.	2003-10-24

I've had this book for about 3 days, and I've been able to gain more useful and helpful information about my computer than you could possibly believe!  I know I'm supposed to read it day by by, but I can't help myself - I want more information on improving my digital photos, connecting new peripherals to my system and configuring my personal firewalls and this book has it.  I've been reading PC Magazine for years (who hasn't?) and I really trust these folks to provide me the best and most up to date information.  Another plus - the &quot;page a day&quot; thing makes it a great holiday gift for anyone in your life - from the friend starting out with a new computers, to the geek you love.  This book will allow them to have fun while learning new things - who could ask for more?	2003-10-08

But my mother and mother-in-law are both novices.  They're always bugging me with, \\"What's this eBay thing?  What can I get on there?  My friend completed her discontinued china set on eBay..\\"  All with the gist of \\"How can I do this too.\\"  As soon as I saw this book was coming out, I picked up two copies of it (mother in laws are rarely great sharers) and gave it to them. Finally!  They get what eBay is all about.  They know how to set up their user accounts, how the \\"store\\" is laid out, how to uncover the best deals and, most importantly for them, how to stay safe when buying on eBay.  Now, they're ready to get off and running.  In fact, they picked up so much great information, they even taught me a few things (no more staying up late waiting for an auction to end in order to swoop in with the best bid!)  This book is great! It's an easy read, and you can jump around to find the points that are most relevant to you.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become an eBay power shopper.	2003-06-13

It doesn't offer enough coverage on the topics I really want to know about (getting the best price for my items, trusting your buyer and seller) and too much on areas that are pretty self explantory (seller rankings for one). The tone of the book is lacking as well, with a dry, almost hokey presenation. I found myself talking back to the book at times, in frustration. All in all, this is not the best eBay book out there - eBay The Smart Way or one of the EBay dummies books get that nod.	2003-06-09

Too often, this book punts on difficult subjects and information is not provided in an intuitive order. I greatly prefered Christopher Negus's Red Hat Linux Bible - it's got more true to life examples of what someone like me would go through in day to day use of Linux, as well as more extensive network security information.	2003-03-27

I'm fairly experienced with eBay, but even so, I know I have a few tips and tricks to pick up.  That said, I bought this book and another one, &quot;Starting an eBay Business for Dummies&quot;.  I found the Dummies book to be a much more well organized and thought provoking book.  &quot;eBay the Smart Way&quot; was much more like, duh, I know that already, tell me something I don't know so I can profit from your knowledge or experience.

This book will make you think	I went into this book thinking I knew a fair amount about security in general.  You know, don't leave your network password on a post-it on your bulletin board, be aware of strangers in your office, that kind of thing.  Then, I finished reading the book, and realized that it challenged all the assumptions that I had about the way I react in these situations.  Mitnick's right - we as human beings are conditioned to be polite and trusting, and as horrible as it seems, that's not always right.  But you don't have to become nasty and distrustful, just aware.  That's what this book is talking about.  The examples are wonderful - they really do read like a mystery thriller.  And the advice is really sound.  It doesn't mention it here, but there is a great flowchart in the back of the book that I've copied for everyone in my office.  It details what to do if someone calls you for information that you are not sure they need or should be getting.  All in all, The Art of Deception is a must read for many of us.	2002-10-09

Then, 3 weeks ago, we came back from vacation in Maine, and she searched through ALL of her books to find it (she's almost 3).  Now, we have to read it every night.  I don't know whether the ocean theme inspired her, but she really enjoys it.  The story of a young boy bear not quite sure that he is ready for school is one that many kids can relate to.  My little one had much separation anxiety when she first started.  Now, she can read this book and look back on those times from a new perspective.  The illustrations are charming - who wouldn't want to live on Nantucket?  It's a very empowering message to give young kids.  School, like other hings in life, isn't easy to get used to, but you can with the support of those around you.  My only gripe is that the friend Barnaby makes is just like him, but female - a little diversity would have been welcome.  Another gripe - we need more Barnaby books!  The author needs to get some new ones done (easier said than done, I am sure ;-) ) and the older ones need to come back into print.  Here's to my little one's newest friend - Barnaby!	2002-07-19

In a surprisingly well written and balanced tone, author Christopher Byron tells the facinating story of a woman who we think we know, but in reality don't know jack about.  In the end, I realized that she projects an image that is a perception, but not reality.  It made me think about media manipulation, and how we really are in a cult of celebrity.  I couldn't put it down, and I bet you won't be able to either.	2002-04-09

I picked up this book thinking the idea of it was pretty sound.  Well, you would think I completed a 2 year internship in France to hear how my friends and family talk.  Don't get me wrong - not all the recipes are the proverbial piece of cake.  The author assigns a star system to each one, 1-3, with 3 being the most difficult, mostly yeast products and puff pastery concoctions.  I do think I will try some of them soon, however, because she really walks you through everything and helps you complete your projects, successfully!  I made a couple of recipes already, and have been astounded by how complex the flavors are in the finished product.  In the carrot cake, you taste the pinapple, the coconut, the carrots, all as if they were in an intermingling mosaic. The recipes are pretty easy to follow and the results are well worth it.  I highly recommend this cookbook!	2002-04-09

So many books in this area don't tell you how to *do* anything - it's all very much like being back in Econ class in college.  This book shows you how to put agile modeling into practice, also in the context of XP and UP.  Any software developer looking to increase their productivity could do no worse than to start with this book.	2002-03-29

While neither can claim to be 100% comprehensive, CISSP All-in-One actually claims to be.  It isn't, in fact, it's almost overkill in some senses.  I'm busy, studying for this exam in whatever spare time I have.  I much prefer the CISSP Prep Guide - it's very to the point and gives me just the right amount of questions, background on the domains and so on.

Gamma and the rest of the GoF didn't invent patterns, and I bet if you talked to them, they would say the same thing.  Their book is one way to look at them.  A LOT of other people do books on patterns, from different points of view, and they (for the most part and to differing degrees) are valuable contributions to the literature.  Some good ones include Pattern Oriented Software Architecture (or POSA) in 2 volumes, and Core J2EE Patterns.  I think this book is a great disection of patterns methodology in Java.  It's not GoF, but I don't think it has to be.  Judged on it's own merits, it's really a good book, and I get very tired of people saying it has to be GoF.	2001-11-13

It's packed with case studies, best practices, and load of practical information - enough to give any engineer something to start with.  But it's greatest value (for me, at least) was as a \\"bargaining tool\\" for my manager.  It enabled me to say, \\"Look, someone else is doing what we want to do.

This book is more of the same.  But how can you live up to the genius that is &quot;Olivia&quot;? Simply put, you cannot.  That book is magic.  But don't be put off, this book is a wonderful read in it's own right.  I have a 2-year old with very Olivia-like tendencies, and it was a great joy to have her back in our lives again with a new book.

The Hellers should not be roped into the &quot;high-fast, low carbohydrate&quot; camp and dismissed.  When you actually read one of their books, you'll see they aren't saying no carbs, they're pushing for you to  eat &quot;smart carbs&quot;.  They're not bacon and cream freaks like  Atkins, or saying the only starch you can eat is oatmeal, like the Zone.   They're saying the majority of your calories should come from lean  protiens, healthy fats like olive oil, and, yes, carbohydrates like  vegetables.  Sounds OK to me!  You can actually have whatever carbs you  like, whether they be fruits, pastas, or breads, in limited portions, every  day through reward meals.  I, like a lot of others, have changed the way I  look at food because of the Hellers.  I'm slimmer, my cholestrol is down,  and, most importantly, I feel great.  And I'm eating smart, like the  Hellers have been saying all along. <br /> But, what about this book.  Well, I  love it!
