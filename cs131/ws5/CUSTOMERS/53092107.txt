He says of this book, &quot;Darwinists will be outraged,&quot; and he's right about that. That's because the book is so doggone smart and funny. Darwinists, in my experience, can't stand being made sport of.<br />This novel is a mix of history and fancy (though the line is sometimes obscured), but the really important point is that it is about what really is the heart of hard core evolutionary thinking, and that's a fear of being wrong. Because that might mean God really does exist!<br />I recommend this novel to all who are interested in the creation-evolution controversy, at the very least because it's different from the normal, dry, academic tones. I think high school students would especially like it.	2003-07-08

This book is no exception. It has a great setup in the idea of a liberal supreme court judge suddenly having her whole life changed by God. What's that going to do to all the political calculations people have made?<br />There are some great plot twists and the characters are true to life not stereotypes. The book also has some great insights about the legal system and the way the supreme court works. I liked the subplot, which pits a young African American lawyer against one of the biggest law firms in the South over what happens in abortion clinics. It made the book two legal thrillers in one!	2002-11-03

Add to that the dozen or so great \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes he wrote, and you have the basis for the cult following he enjoys.<BR> Unfortunately, with this new book, Matheson has besmirched his reputation. <BR>Hunted Past Reason is your basic chase story. Two men on a backpacking trip, one descends progressively into evil and we end up with a \\"game,\\" where the bad guy is after the good guy, trying to kill him. Wrapped up in this is a metaphysical puzzle about whether there is life after death, and what happens because of the choices we make in this world.<BR> <BR>All well and good, if not terribly original. But Matheson chooses to take the low road in his portrayal of the villain, with the most pornographic (yep, Matheson would have been arrested for this stuff in the 50's) and base images imaginable. The frequent use of four letter words and gross sexual commentary grows quickly tiresome, and reads like some fifteen-year-old's first attempt at \\"adult\\" storytelling. Or what he imagines is adult these days.<BR> Which is the major disappointment here. Matheson, in his mid-70's, should be better than this. He should be giving us something more than juvi-porn-violence. Using the skills of a writing lifetime, he ought to be trying to reach for something that is great and lasting. Instead, he has merely penned a piece of fast-moving garbage. <BR> If he believes, as his hero in the book, that we have to pay for the \\"bad\\" we do in this life with some sort of penance in the next, I'm afraid Matheson's going to be doing some hard time. He has tossed another trashy novel into our midst; we surely did not need any more of them.<BR> There is some sloppy writing, too. (\\"Doug, let's continue with our hike, he imagined saying to Doug.\\") He has a character much too young to have been in Vietnam talking about killing people in Vietnam.<br />Matheson also piles on information about backpacking, so it seems like he's just copied a whole backpacking book. It's just clumsy. But I could have lived with all that. What I can't stomach is the story, and the way it's told.	2002-07-26

But it is presented more clearly elsewhere. I suspect he writes in such a prolix style to foster the impression that he sees what other do not. This, of course, is good marketing.<br />With regard to the oft mentioned Syd Field, he was there first, and with Chris Vogler you have  stuff that is of equal or greater value, especially for the beginner.<br />I sold screenplays before I took McKee's course, and have written fiction bestsellers afterward. Of all the books I've read on the craft, his was the least accessible. I think I really only learned one thing from his course that I use (it is a good thing, don't get me wrong, but stands alone). <br />If you're an experienced writer, you might find something of value. If you're just getting started, I'd be very wary. Hollywood is filled with McKee acolytes. Be an original instead.	2001-10-15

There are two things he does, both of which are found in this book, that keep him from greatness. <br />The first is his continuing overuse of foul language. I mean, even in this book on WRITING he can't restrain himself. It seems like a holdover from his geek days in high school, when smoking and swearing were easy ways for a dweeb to increase the masculinity level. But King is a middle aged guy now. Get over it. It just seems silly and off-putting.<br />The other thing is his advice on endings. He tells writers just to write and not worry how the story will end, trusting that a way will be found.<br />Well, that's his weakness as a novelist. His endings. Especially in the biggies, like It and The Stand. The build up is great, but then he finds he's in a corner and the ending seems like a bolt from the blue (what they call deus ex machina in literature classes). <br />As good as King is, and there are few better, a little more pre-planning of plot, and a lot less coarse language, would have elevated him into a higher rank. <br />Still, this book has a few insights for aspiring writers. It does not have a lot of the nuts and bolts found in, say, a Writers Digest book. But it's worth looking at for a little insight into the mind of near great writer.	2001-09-30

Behind the tight smile is a man who, admittedly, is \\"full of himself.\\" That's his blessing and curse. If you believe that building business empires is the sole aim of life, and it's worth sacrificing a marriage for, Welch is probably worth this saintliness being bestowed on him. But if you believe there is more to our existence than work and golf, this book is not for you. <br />There's some business wisdom in the book, but one must slog through a lot to get it. <br />Welch reminds me very much of the Frederic March character in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (based on Sloan Wilson's novel). Yes, he built a great business, but realized too late that he had lost much more than he had gained. This was a common profile in the post World War II American economy. Welch fits it to a T (or a W). And while his devotion to his mother's memory and teachings is touching, Freud would have had a field day with this book. <br />The book is not horrible by any means. But I could have done without the golf stuff. There are about half a dozen photos of Jack golfing in one place or another (including with that great American, Bill Clinton). It all comes off like a twenty-year-old's showing off (he has reproduced a score card from a golf round with Greg Norman!) than the reflections of a mature business leader. <br />There's a touch of this throughout, such as when he divorces wife #1, and suddenly observes: \\"Being single and having money was like standing six feet four with a full head of hair.\\" As Chris Farley might have said when he played the motivational speaker: \\"Well Lah-De-Freakin'-Dah!\\"<br />I can see a whole new generation of baby MBA's lugging this book around like the Bible. If you are one, my message before you buy this book: Try the Bible instead, especially the book of Ecclesiastes. There, the Jack Welch-like king who built up all this wealth and honor for himself found, at the end of his life, that it was all meaningless, a \\"chasing after the wind.\\"<br />Windy is a good word to describe this book. In fairness, Welch's co-writer (John A. Byrne), who was responsible for the prose, does a good job. The book is quite readable. But they gave Welch what, $8 million for this? I'd rather read the reflections of a successful elementary school teacher in the inner city, or two average people who value their marriage over their career plans, or a good philosopher. Not worth $30 bucks, or even $15 with various discounts.	2001-09-24

There are a few obvious reasons why. First, the style is a bit over the top. The strain to appear poetic sometimes overtakes the story. Another stylistic quirk that got tiring was his use of non-specific grammar. For example, instead of saying &quot;He heard the sound of her feet on the stairs,&quot; he will write something like, &quot;He heard the sound of foot on stair.&quot; Doing this over and over, it becomes the sound of pretentiousness on page.  Next, the characters are a bit thin and rather cliched. The two youngsters sometimes appear as children, sometimes as much too wise beyond their years. The nasty Davis is all black, no gray. And that's how it is for all of the principals. There is a lot of lip service paid to &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;believing&quot; in this book, but in these politically correct times that cannot have anything to do with traditional religion. In this story and setting, the most authentic thing would have had the main character, the great grandma, be a Bible believing Christian. .... He makes the only Christian, a Bible thumping preacher, the typical fire-and-brimstone but money-grubbing stereotype we've seen out of Hollywood for the past couple ofdecades. .... So the &quot;miraculous&quot; ending (very predictable) is tied to some sort of wishing well, not, say, prayer or faith in God. That makes the ending coincidental and manipulative, a deus ex machina without the deus.  And speaking of manipulative, the treacle is ladled on a bit thick at times. Especially dense is having the characters say &quot;I love you&quot; numerous times. For a writer, that is the weakest way to show love and the easy way out. Having characters say &quot;I love you&quot; is always a bad choice. .... Finally, the use of the omniscient viewpoint--hopping around from character to character, even within the same scene--takes away focus and intimacy. Sometimes, we're not sure whose story this is. Compare this choice to, say, To Kill a Mockingbird. In that novel, we stay inside one character's head, the narrator, Scout. That's what makes Harper Lee's tale a classic, whereas Wish You Well, unfortunately, comes off as a miss. Once again, Baldacci is to be given credit for attempting to grow as a writer. That he has a ways to go is no shame. Here's hoping the next time he'll delve a little deeper and keep the cliches at bay.	2001-01-06
