The book ends  with the word &quot;life&quot;, referring to her baby boy.  I oft en wondered what happened to that baby and was hoping for a sequel.  My  February issue of CHILD just came to me and I was so delighted to see that Suzanne Finnamore has a regular column in this  charming magazine.  The saga of  her boy continues - he is now five years old, a funny, loving, joyful, treasure to his  family.  Little Pablo is indeed full of &quot;life&quot;.  Not quite a sequel to Zygote the column is ,however, a happy  progress report on a little boy whose birth was a difficult and dangerous journey toward a life  that culminated in a happy ending.	2004-01-20

Within five minutes of reading it I knew that I had spent wisely.  It was gripping, incisive, honest, and uniquely drawn.  Some of the phrases and dialog were astounding.  I was interested in all the characters.  Can hardly wait for the author's next book.	2000-06-08

Women are getting married in their mid thirties with more frequency and I think this book reflects the huge mental transition it  takes to go from being single to married. I know from being married that  you cannot really know someone until you have been engaged/married AND have  had children (the acid test).  I think this book sheds light on some of  these discoveries many joyous, some of them dubious.  I applaud honesty in  literature and I loved this first effort by a talented author...plus she  made me laugh out loud at least once a chapter.	2000-06-08

This is a multilayered book- like a spiral it starts with great humor and slowly you find yourself still laughing but crying too.  This is a woman who has  earned her position, nothing was given to her and yet through pain and a  compassionate spirit she triumphs.  It is not what it may appear at first -  a delightful fluffy read - it has substance and bravely explores all the  fears and agony of loving unconditionally.  A brave and complete testament  to a gutsy woman's year of engagement.	1999-05-27

Suzanne Finnamore has written a first novel that is a brave, witty and honest look at a sucessful woman - this is a woman who has, through talent, guts and hard work,  carved a career in  advertising where even brave men &quot;break&quot;.  She meets and falls in  love with &quot;Michael&quot; an older man ...&quot;between us we are  almost a hundred years old&quot; What follows is a searingly honest, funny  and penetrating journey into the heart and soul of a fascinating and  compassionate woman.     I found myself cheering &quot;Eve&quot; on as she  finally finds herself walking toward &quot;Michael&quot; on her wedding day  &quot;when the wedding guests standing in small rows in the sun, like  wheat..turn around at once, to look at me.  Their faces are pure  hope.&quot;   Otherwise Engaged is a  contemporary yet old fashioned love  story.  I loved it!	1999-05-12

Eve has to deal with previous marriages; children; AIDS,  violent death of a much loved father and friend and all this as she is  planning for the most important moment of her life - her wedding.  Eve is  not a powder puff of a woman, rather she is someone is on the &quot;firing  line&quot; in a demanding and competitive job - not to mention a biological  clock ticking louder every moment. How she manages to finally &quot;bring  it all together&quot; in such a funny, compassionate and real account makes  Otherwise Engaged a total delight and education in what it feels like to be  a woman who lives her life without apologies.  She may not always do it as  others might, but she does it her way and this makes this book a totally  honest and intriguing read.	1999-05-07

I found that it is really not about &quot;catching a husband&quot; but of recognizing the enormous responsibility, self-instrospection and compassion to prepare oneself for  marriage.  Even though it is presented in a very modern day mode - it  really is an old fashioned tale of love conquers all.  A valuable and  &quot;must read&quot; book for all those who are seeking &quot;true  love&quot;. For those of us who are already married, it serves as a  reminder on how to &quot;keep the love alive&quot;  Never preachy, never  boring and consistently entertaining as well as wise this is a terrific  read. A perfect gift.	1999-04-15
