It was the factually-based story of Rebecca Galloway, a pioneer girl who actually lived. Amid the love story of her and Tecumseh are woven details about the Galloway family and pioneer life in Ohio. At the age of seven, she met Tecumseh, an Indian chief and family friend. He was quickly charmed by the \\"little straw hair girl\\". He visits the Galloways many times over the years. As a preteen, she falls in love with him. Her feelings grow with her, although he's old enough to be her father. When she's 16, he asks for her hand in marriage. Her dream has come true. But can Rebecca abandon her pioneer life to live in an Indian village? Read the book <br />I loved the book and couldn't put it down. I liked the author's style and word choice. Rebecca's growing passion for Tecumseh was described especially well. (we teenage girls know the feeling, don't we?) In a way, I felt as if I were falling in love with him too. One of my favorite scenes was when he gave her a canoe he'd made for her birthday and taught her to use it. He told her not to row to the second bend in the river without him there. This second bend was a good symbol for their progression to the romantic stage in their relationship. He didn't want her to fall in love with him until he was there again to show her his own love.<br />Overall, this book was enthralling and I'd reccomend it to any historical romance buff.	2001-05-23

Finally I got around to reading it and finished it in a short time. It is the traditional love story of a bad boy redeemed by the girl he least likely expects to fall in love with. (since the plot is predictable, I'm not giving much away) Here the boy is Landon Carter, son of North Carolina's governor, and the girl is Jamie Sullivan, daughter of a Baptist minister. Although they've known each other all their lives and been in the same classes at school, they are very different from each other. Landon is mischievous and spends time eating boiled peanuts in the local graveyard with his friends. He also finds pleasure in making fun of Jamie's father, among other people. Meanwhile, Jamie is well-known for contributing money and time to orphanages and saving wounded animals. Other teenagers shun her, believing that she's a goody-two shoes. Landon thinks the same way until he gets to know her better. Gradually he realizes that he disliked her before because her own virtuousness made him feel guilty. Influenced by her example, he cleans up his act. He learns that what they have in common is strong enough to draw them together in romantic love. But their near-perfect happiness is too wonderful to last. Jamie is harboring a devastating secret. What is it? And how will it affect their relationship? <br />Here is a three-word description of the story: sappy, but sweet. Who could fail to be moved by Jamie and Landon's romance? Beaufort, North Carolina in the 1950's provides a nostalgic backdrop for the tale. My favorite scene was when their drama class performed the Christmas play. <br />However, there were some details that I didn't like about the story. Although Landon changed, he still seemed like a shallow youth. And his 57-year-old man voice was not greatly different from his 17-year-old boy voice. The book read more like young adult fiction than an adult novel. But I will give the author credit for creating a poignant, Christian love  story. Unlike most books out on the market today, it contained no immorality and very little coarse language. And Jamie and Landon are truly in love, not just lusting after each other like couples in many novels. The story fulfills its purpose: that is, to arouse our emotions and entertain us. <br />Overall, don't expect to discover earth-shattering revelations in this book. But if you are a hopeless romantic and don't mind reading a book for pure pleasure every once in a while, &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; might just be a book you'd enjoy.	2001-01-09

My mother bought the book for me some years ago because she thought it would be good for me to read classics. Thinking that it would be boring, I didn't read it for a long time. But a couple of days ago I was bored and picked it up. Soon, I fell under the same spell Rebecca cast over nearly every person she met. Around the age of 10 or 11, she was forced to leave her home, Sunnybrook Farm, to live in a brick house with her spinster aunts in Riverboro. Her aunts Jane and Miranda weren't used to young people, but they let Rebecca stay with them in order to help out her poor widowed mother who had 6 other children to care for. Rebecca charmed nearly all the citizens of Riverboro, Aunt Jane, and, in time, her strict, austere Aunt Miranda. <br />There were many things to love about the story. In fact, it has become one of my favorite books of all time. (and I am a voracious reader) The characters were all realistically and richly delineated. Rebecca especially came alive for me. She was such a talented, imaginative, caring girl. She was the kind of person that anyone would love to have as a friend. Actually, I would want to be her. I didn't want to stop reading about her adventures. The events played before my mind's eye like a movie. I traveled back in time, to 100 years ago. This is considered a children's book, but it has truths and insights that people of all ages can learn from. Several of the passages, the literary allusions, and Rebecca's poems were so beautiful that I had to reread them. The language was eloquent. As another reviewer said, the vocabulary wasn't &quot;dumbed down&quot; like the vocabularies of modern children's books, and there was a protagonist one could love. <br />The only part about the novel that I didn't like was that there isn't a sequel. I would love to find out what Rebecca's career turns out to be. I believe that she marries Mr. Ladd (a.k.a. &quot;Mr. Aladdin&quot;),but I wish we could know for sure. <br />Overall, I highly reccomend this book to readers of all ages. If you like books with wonderful supporting characters and an unusual, loveable heroine, treat yourself to &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot;.	2000-12-30

It tells the story of an &quot;invisbile princess&quot;, Elizabeth I. She is 3rd in the line of succession, after her beloved little brother Prince Edward and her seemingly pious, insane older sister Princess Mary. She is the victim of her father Henry VIII's capricious love and Mary's cruelty. The royal court stays in different palaces throughout the story. (which at times could be confusing) Sometimes Elizabeth was even exiled. She had many worries, such as her father's health, fear that Mary might be Queen someday, and struggles with the fact that her father willingly executed or divorced many of his wives. (he even had her mother beheaded when Elizabeth was just a toddler) There are also people in foreign countries and even in the royal court who plot against the royal family. In spite of this, she still manages to have fun with her friends. Some of their antics are amusing, such as when Elizabeth and her brother try to teach their pet monkeys to play tennis. Others are more serious, such as when she and her friend Robin help save the life of one of her family members. <br />Overall the book was very interesting and informative, and I learned a lot about medieval life and traditions. The diary format helps the reader imagine what the early life of this very famous monarch was like. The epilogue and photos at the end give more background information on the royal family and England. Plus, the book itself is beautifully hard bound and has gold-edged pages. There are very few things I didn't like about this book, although one of them was that the language was a bit too contemporary. (but this did help make it easier to read and the language wasn't too anachronistic) I reccomend this book to history buffs who want to learn about royalty. It was at least as equally good as the Cleopatra book in the Royal Diaries series, maybe better.	2000-12-05

Almost six years ago, at the age of 10, I first read this book. I didn't enjoy it much, but the second time around at age 11 I loved it...and gained access to a whole new world. Later, I occasionally picked it up again and never grew bored with the tale. It's so exciting to read how Claudia and  Jamie, two siblings, made careful, detailed plans to run away to the  Metropolitan Museum of Art. They survived by taking baths in a fountain,  sleeping on a royal bed, and taking tours with school groups. Their  vacation from normal life became a quest when Angel, a sculpture rumored to  be done by Michaelangelo, was brought to the museum. Will they solve the  mystery? Read it to find out. <br />There are very few things I disliked about  this book, and there is everything to love about it. Claudia and Jamie  allowed me to vicariously experience running away from home. (but don't  worry parents, your kids will probably not run away because of the book) I  felt like I was right there with them. I wish I could live with Mrs.  Frankweiler. The story is so realistic and timeless that it sounds as if it  could occur today. It is full of edge-of-your-seat suspense and mystery. It  also inspired me to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the future.  <br />Overall, you can't go wrong with this book. It will delight and resonate  with people of all ages. I strongly reccomend it. Treat yourself to  &quot;Files&quot; right now!	2000-07-23

But later I got bored and picked it up again. Soon, the story hooked me. I finished it in two days! It was about two high school sweethearts,  the gifted football player Luke Muldenhower and beautiful, smart Julie  Ellis. They seemed to have the perfect teenage existence until the day Luke  discovered that he had cancer. Julie was his cheerleader throughout his  illness, refusing to accept defeat. This crisis strengthened their love,  but would it break their hearts? <br />The book is excellent. It was  true-to-life, if somewhat predictable and mushy. It taught many life  lessons. My favorite parts were when Julie and Luke went to California to  visit Luke's uncle and the discovery Julie made at the end.(I won't give it  away, you'll have to read it and find out yourself!) <br />However, there were  a few things I didn't like about the book. First of all, Julie was too  obsessed with Luke. Unlike him, she had no other interests in her life but  their relationship. Also, Julie's mother was a very flat character,  appearing mostly to hound her daughter about finding the right college. But  overall, this was another great Lurlene McDaniel novel and I reccomend it  to all romantics at heart.	2000-07-21

Although it was less enjoyable because we were forced to read it, the book was still good. Studying it in class also helped me interpret the symbolism  and archaic language better. Most Christians can probably relate to  Pilgrim's odyssey. Often in my daily life, I'm involved with people who  remind me of characters from the allegory. I reccomend this book to almost  anybody on a spiritual journey.	2000-07-05

In it, a pandemic killed all adults and teenagers on earth, leaving preteens and younger children to fend for themselves. The world was thrown into chaos. One town in America  was in the same predicament, until a ten-year-old girl named Lisa became  its leader. She created a fortress for the denizens of her city to live in  and had to defend it from an enemy attack. Will the city be saved? Is  Lisa's learning that the civilization partly belongs to all the children  and not just her the key? But you'll have to read it to find out. <br />I  mostly enjoyed this book. It has a unique plot. It was intriguing to read  about how Lisa rose to power and began to restore order. However, there  were some elements I didn't like. For instance, the heavy-handed stories  Lisa made up. The author could've communicated his message without so many  of those. Since I happen to be a teenager, I was sad that no adoelesents  survived the plague. <br />&gt;&gt;Trivia: Did anyone else notice that Lisa's  family had the same last name as the author's?&lt;&lt;<br />Overall, I loved  the book and can't wait for its promised sequels. I'm eager to see how the  kids will probably learn to turn the electricity back on, fly planes, and  find more ways to get food.	2000-06-11

Summer had an unconventional home: she lived with her great-aunt and uncle. She was content, until her aunt May died. Suddenly, Summer and her uncle Ob were  wraiths of their former selves. Cletus, an eccentric classmate of Summer's,  began visiting them and took their minds off May. But Ob was slowly losing  the joy of living. In a quest to find closure, Summer, Ob, and Cletus went  to find a spiritualist to help them communicate with May. Unfortunately,  the medium too was dead. Somehow, though, they found a way to carry on. I  liked the writing style, except for many run-on sentences that got annoying  to read. The characters were pleasant people with pleasant names and  sounded real enough to live next door. However, I didn't understand what  brought back Ob's will to live as quickly as he had lost it. But I guess  that happens sometimes in real life, on the roller coaster called grief. I  reccomend this book to almost anyone, especially those who have lost loved  ones.	2000-06-06

It's about a strong teenage girl  named Jessie who was searching for her father that abandoned her family years ago. She had a mostly good life otherwise- a loving mother, aunt, friends, and a boyfriend- but she was  missing that one important person. This problem affected her other  relationships, for better or worse. I liked the book, except for two  problems. First, Jessie went steady with her best friend's crush. I really  felt for Meadow on that one.  Second, the eventual reunion between her and  her father wasn't as I'd expected. But everybody makes mistakes, and we  know she'll find her dad again. Overall, I reccomend this book to other  teenagers who love to read.	2000-06-06

It was a colorful, emotional tale about Takiko, a samurai's daughter in feudal Japan. Since it was wartime, she had to move from place to place (including  a palace) to escape the adversary. On the way, she met a handsome young  enemy warrior named Hideo and they fell in love. Would she choose loyalty  to her dead father's cause or to forbidden romance? The choice she made  affected her entire life. I wanted to love the story, but it was too  tragic. Many of Takiko's loved ones died throughout the course of the  novel. Hideo abandoned her, as did her beauty and wealth. However, it's a  tribute to Mrs. Paterson's skill that a fictional story could arouse so  much feeling in me. However, the ironic ending confused me. Why did the  events turn out the way they did? Still, I reccomend this book for its  vivid descriptions of feudal Japan and its skill in plucking one's  heartstrings.	2000-06-06

It's about a teenage girl named Rachel who had many difficult situations to deal with. First of all, she had elderly parents and brothers old enough to be her father.(her niece was 3  months younger than her!) Second of all, she had just gotten a new  boyfriend, Lewis. Most importantly, her catankerous grandfather was dying.  How could she handle these situations? <br />I enjoyed this book. I found  pieces of myself in Rachel. I'm an aspiring writer, and 7 months ago I lost  a grandmother who was difficult to get along with, but whom I still loved.  I wish I had grown closer to her before her death as Rachel did with her  grandpa. &quot;After the Rain&quot; showed that although life and any kind  of loving relationship often bring pain, in the end the experience is  worthwhile.	2000-06-05

His mother and father were fugitive radicals, so they had to send  him to live with his uncle at the age of 8. With a different name and  identity, Pete began a new life. It seemed great, but he always brooded  over his past. Now he's 16. Can he confide in his new girlfriend Cary? Will  he ever be reunited with his parents? The ending is a sad but realistic  cliffhanger. I'd love a sequel, but it's also interesting to speculate for  yourself about what happens to Pete. I greatly reccomend this book to teens  who feel lost in the search for identity.	2000-06-05

Her parents would never divorce  like Julie's. But was her family really what it appeared to be? A visit  with her emotionally distant older sister Martine provided surprising  answers. Toni struggled to get along with her parents when she went back  home. Later in the story, Julie returned to a changed friend. Will Toni's  family and friendship ever be the same?

This was among the first Lurlene McDaniel books I read as a child. Then last summer, at age 14, I discovered it again at my local library. The second time around, I loved the story even more. Deanne Vanervoort's mother planned for her to spend the summer hanging around the country club with a  snobby rich boy, Judson Cortland III. The two teens couldn't stand each  other. Thwarting her mother's hopes, Deanne took her father's suggestion to  volunteer at the hospital were he worked as a surgeon. There, she fell in  love with a cancer victim named Matt. His family accepted her the way her  mother didn't. She enjoyed being with them and Matt. But is time running  out for him? You'll never know unless you read the book! It reminded me of  a later Lurlene McDaniel book, &quot;Let Him Live&quot;. I highly reccomend  both novels, they are very romantic and touching.	2000-06-02

Her wealthy family owned a ranch, and she was falling in love with one of their ranch hands. But during the summer of her 15th birthday, her beloved father began acting  very strange.  She tried to identify his problem, but he shut himself off  from the family. Unable to deal with tragic memories of his stint in the  Vietnam war, her father committed suicide. This was a great shock to the  Campbell family and the community. Gradually, Shannon began to heal with  the help of her mom, grandma, and the handsome young ranch hand. I loved  this book, even though I'm not fond of horses.(obviously, they're prominent  in the story) I reccomend it to other Lurlene McDaniel fans and anyone  who's lost his/her will to live. It shows how much pain suicide causes for  the person's loved ones and may stop suicidal people from killing  themselves, or teach others how to recognize their cries for help.	2000-06-01

Recently, I saw this book at Wal-Mart and knew I had to buy it. I've been reading a few stories a day and sadly finished it yesterday. It has become one of my favorite books. There are too many good things to name about it and the other two books! There's a lot of variety in this latest  installment, including more poems and cartoons as well as short stories. I  enjoyed almost every contribution! A few great stories are &quot;Never Been  Dissed&quot;, &quot;Dear Child&quot;, &quot;A Gift of Time&quot;,  &quot;Ghost Mother&quot;, and &quot;Accentuating Differences&quot;. The way  teens work out their problems(especially family tension)is  interesting and  helpful. Now I know I'm not alone and have some ideas on how to deal with  difficult situations. The mother stories reminded me to appreciate my own  mom more. No people we love are perfect, but they all impact us, even if  they die. The part I didn't like was that most of the love stories are sad  and depressing.	2000-05-29

Later regretting that decision, I searched for it and after a long time found it. I bought it, expecting a thrilling read about a disturbed teenage girl. The girl, Lisa,  was disturbed, but the story didn't thrill me. I learned nothing new about  mental illness, except that many times even adults handle the situation  like children.(which wasn't really all that new to me before, I just never  thought about it) Plus, three of the four girls involved in the story had  similar names: Lisa, Elizabeth, and Betsy.

It has a stream of consciousness effect that shows Tish's thoughts over the course of one day.(and human thoughts are very erratic) However, on the second  time around most of the fog cleared. Tish had to stand up to her sexually  abusive stepfather, not an easy feat. Although one reviewer was correct  that Tish didn't show the self-blame or &quot;my family is normal&quot;  feeling of an abuse victim, most other emotions were realistic. She was  afraid at first to confront Tonnie, and she pushed away her friends. Many  parts were explicit, like the language and sex descriptions, but you can't  expect a book about an abused kid to be a picnic in the park. Overall, this  novel profoundly affected me. I reccomend it to older teens, especially  rape victims. If it confuses you at first, reread it. It's worth the  effort.	2000-05-17

It's about Jonas, a boy who lived in a futuristic community and was becoming an adult member of it. As an apprentice to the Receiver of memories, he learned about the  individuality, color, and variety of the past. That's when the boy and old  man knew that things needed to be changed. It was cool to learn about  another world, how Jonas received memories of sunshine and snow. It was  sweet how he cared so much for the baby Gabe that his Nurturer father  brought home. A blessing and a curse is that the book is so easy to  understand. Like some sci-fi novels, it doesn't confuse, but it could have   more depth. Why doesn't Jonas reflect more on his new discoveries and  feelings? Maybe he and the Giver(as he calls his mentor)could've done more  to open the community's eyes, but their decision was a start. The book does  serve as a caveat about what any society in the world could mutate into.  This is a young adult book, so you wouldn't expect it to compare to Isaac  Asimov. At least the story does have a happy ending. It would be  interesting if there could be a series about young Jonas' adventures and  what happens to him in the future, but speculating is also fun. Definitely  read some of Lois Lowry's other works like &quot;A Summer to Die&quot;, but  this one is worth checking out too.	2000-05-16

I thought, &quot;It's about ships. Boring.&quot; But recently I gave it another chance. I couldn't stop reading! Charlotte Doyle, a teenage girl, sailed on a transatlantic voyage in 1832. Caught  between a treacherous captain and a mutinous crew, she had to decide where  her loyalties lay. She underwent a remarkable transformation on the way.  Nearly every page is fraught with adventure. There was so much excitement,  especially at the end. The main part I didn't like was that  the sailors  were so fickle, unable to decide whether or not to be loyal friends to  Charlotte. Only Zachariah, an old black cook, stood by her the whole time.  The friendship between them was beautiful. Overall, I highly reccomend this  book, and I don't give great reccomendations lightly.	2000-04-27

Some parts were confusing, but soon I grew accustomed to the unique voice of the tough child-woman, Ellen. She had a beautiful name, but  an ugly life. Her father killed her mother emotionally. Ellen cleverly  avoided him, but was inevitably bounced from uncaring relative to uncaring  relative. In some ways, these family members were crueler than her dad.  Despite her trials, the brave girl(really more of an old woman than a  child) never gave up the search for love. She found it in unconventional  but kind people like a black friend named Starletta, a hippie couple, and  finally a foster family. She kept her grit and was more concerned about  others than herself. Many of the events are disturbing, but you survive  them as Ellen did: through hope and black humor. Overall, the book is  uplifting. I reccomend it to almost anyone.	2000-04-20
US	52698493	R19YNUYIPWAERL	0140317856	310958744	The Glory Girl	Books	4	5	6	N	N	The Outcast	I recently discovered this book and read it in two days, pacing myself. It's about a young girl named Anna Glory who was the only non-singing member of a family of gospel singers. I can relate to this because my  family sings gospel too but I don't because I get stage fright and don't  feel as talented as the rest. She was also underappreciated; nobody really  noticed her presence, which is how I ofen feel. But an unexpected person  from the past, Uncle Newt, showed up for Anna. She had a kinship with him  because he was a convict that the family despised. Together, these two  outcasts saved the rest of the family from death. This was  a..well..interesting portrayal of a family. The twin boys, who one would  expect to be really close, always played tricks on each other. Mrs. Glory  favored the oldest child, a girl nicknamed &quot;Angel&quot;. Mr. Glory  lost the &quot;joy of religion&quot; the instant he exited a stage. Not a  very Christianlike family. As Newt said, Anna was the best of them. I  reccomend &quot;Glory Girl&quot; to anyone who feels as if they don't  belong or count in the world.	2000-04-12

However, I was left disappointed and questioning. I'd rate it 2.5 stars, if that were possible. Patty seemed immature. I will give her kudos for blowing off the people who shunned her,  including her parents. I hoped for high adventure when she disobeyed her  parents and took a trip to Europe. But she and Roger, her boyfriend, had  silly arguements, and she spent too much time in France with him. I know  she loved him, but shouldn't she have been anxious to talk to Anton's  relatives? Why didn't she try to begin a relationship with them? The ending  was semi-inspirational, but not really satisfying. What about her and  Roger? Did she ever go back to America? I thought she'd want to see Ruth  again. Read this book only if you really want to know what happens to  Patty.	2000-04-11

I'd just gotten braces, so having a great new book to read was a small comfort. The story is about a misfit named Patty. Her parents mistreat her, and the only sources of love are her grandparents, her housekeeper Ruth, and a German  soldier called Anton. Although she's Jewish, Patty loves Anton dearly and  hides him in her hangout over the garage. Against her will, she must let  him go. The ending was a cliffhanger and paves the way for a great  sequel(check out the reviews to see if Mrs. Greene delivered). I identified  with Patty because I'm an outcast too. She was so brave and precocious for  a twelve-year-old. She willingly accepted the consequences for her actions.  The sacrificial love between her and Anton was so beautiful. Ruth was  wonderful also. I highly reccomend this, and one can't say that about every  book.	2000-04-11

Sara lived with her bossy aunt Willie, her beautiful older sister, and her retarded brother Charlie. She had a difficult time getting along with her family and  herself. She was happy one minute, discontent the next. No one sympathized  with her. One sleepy summer night, Charlie disappeared in search of the  swans he and Sara fed the day before. The family realized how much they  really love him, even if he was annoying sometimes. Read the book to see if  he's found. Teens should read this because they can identify with Sara's  dissatisfaction and conflicting feelings. The author's writing style is  spare but enjoyable. Just buy it!	2000-04-10

It's the story of a courageous Danish girl, Annemarie, who wanted to help save her Jewish friend Ellen. The ingenuity and persistence that she and the other Resistance members used to thwart the Nazis were inspiring.  Of course, there were losses. The story did end quite abruptly, but what  would Annemarie have done in the two years before the war ended besides  wait? Also, whatever happened to Ellen and her family? I've outgrown the  book a little, but I still treasure it. It had so much historical  background that I had to remind myself that the characters weren't real.  Don't we all need a friend like Annemarie who would risk death for us? Buy  it, you'll like it.	2000-04-06

Instantly, I got absorbed in the story of an nameless, outcast Indian girl who ran away from her tribe after her father's death. She felt a need to prove herself because her twin  brother who died many years ago was destined to be the Great One, and  nobody believed that she might be the true Great One. She wandered in the  wilderness, getting burned by geisers and fighting a grizzly. After braving  nature, she was captured by another Indian tribe and prepared to be a  sacrfice for their god. Will Wolfstar, her new friend from the tribe, help  her? The ending stunned me, but I loved this chilling novel. The arrogant,  proud young woman was humbled by her trials and even got a name. Read  &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; to find out what the name is and what happened to  the brave girl.	2000-03-26

But he unknowingly made friends with the perpetrator, Joselle, who might as well be motherless herself. Will they  ever reconcile after Blaze discovers Joselle's horrid secret? Check it out.

It told about a teenage boy who'd been captured and raised by a Mohican tribe at a very young age. He  discovered his heritage when he and his Indian brother Bamaineo were sent  to a school for white boys. They struggled in the &quot;civilized&quot;  world, although they eventually made friends there. But how will Echohawk  deal with his shocking past? Can he forgive his adoptive father Glickihigan  and the other men for killing his biological family? I definitely reccomend  this book. My mother and I read it at the same time and discussed it. We  both enjoyed it, and I'm sure you will too.	2000-03-22

Even today, it powerfully conveys the difficulty of growing up. Kathleen has insecurities about her looks, longings for love, and  conflict in her family. As I read, I feel as if I'm right there with her as  she rebels and grows. The story is so realistic, with great dialogue. I'd  reccomend it to any girl who's having a rough time being teenager.  &quot;The Jellyfish Season&quot; is also a roadmap for preteens who don't  know what to expect and a trip down memory lane for women who've already  been there.	2000-03-20

Josh had to go to Texas to live  with his aunt after his mother's death. Hitchiking to his destination, he  got beaten up by a man who offered him a ride. Later, a woman in a horse  and buggy took him to Canara, an alternate universe. He was confused about  the unusual civilization, but time unraveled the mysteries and his grief.  Soon, he made friends and developped loyalty towards the town. Will he ever  be able to leave? Does he want to? I highly suggest you read it to discover  what happens.	2000-03-20

Dinnie is a girl whose father makes her family move all over the US in search of &quot;opportunities&quot;. This time, her aunt and uncle take her by force to another opportunity-all the way across the Atlantic, to Switzerland. At first Dinnie rails against  being &quot;kidnapped&quot;, but soon makes friends at the international  school where her uncle is principal. All the different types of people give  a refreshing variety to the book, especially since Dinnie is so mild.  Keisuke is one of my favorite characters. I almost wished I could go to an  international school. Sadly, Dinnie must go home for the summer, not  knowing if she'll ever see her friends again. I wish Mrs. Creech would  write a sequel so we could find out.  I reccomend &quot;Bloomability&quot;  to anyone in need of adventure.	2000-03-12

The first time I tried to read it, it bored me and I gave up. A year or so later, I decided to try again. I understood the events better, and I couldn't put it down. Adversity bonded  two teens who were total strangers to each other. I've never been tricked  as Laura and Howie were, but I'm a loner and I also formed close  friendships with other lone wolves. The details of the boy and the girl's  flight away from camp were intriguing. But why is this book rated for ages  9-12? There are a few mentions of adult movies, nudity, and centerfolds, as  another reviewer said. While these references aren't pornographic, they are  still inappropriate for preteens. Only high school students and older  should read &quot;The Goats&quot;. Overall, it's a great book which I'd  reccomend to  most young adults.	2000-03-11

I enjoyed it so much, I later went out and bought it myself. I identified with Carley because although I don't have a scarred face like she does, I've never  really thought I was pretty. Love came to her in the form of Kyle, a blind  boy that she met in the hospital after she broke her leg. Will their  relationship end if his sight returns? Read it to find out. This was an  inspirational story. It gave me hope that if someone with Carley's problem  can be loved, then I have a chance for romance too. Buy &quot;I'll Be  Seeing You&quot; ASAP! I highly reccomend it to anyone in need of hope.	2000-03-11

I love how characters from Mrs. McDaniel's previous books make an appearance here. It's too bad that she's retired. &quot;Reach for Tomorrow&quot; shows how much the characters have grown.  Will Katie and Josh mend their broken relationship? Possibly. I didn't like  that some more people died, but otherwise I loved this novel. However, I'd  reccomend reading some of the other OLW books before you pick up this one,  it helps you understand the events better.	2000-03-11

(The Royal Diaries)	Books	4	23	31	N	N	Royal fun	I'm a fan of Egyptian things, so I was sure I'd like this book. It painted a picture of a real teenage princess with friends, foes, joy, and troubles. In other words, Cleopatra seemed like a living human as relevant as our own  times. She learned at an early age that some people she loved and admired  were untrustworthy. She had to rely on herself and pursue her goal of  becoming a good ruler. But at times, the book was a little boring and gory.  It's difficult to conceive how a supposedly fair ruler could kill his/her  family. Still, you should read this story, especially if you like learning  about ancient Egypt.	2000-03-08

This is what happened to Mila,until she was forced from her home to an institution for wild children. There she befriends the  doctors, a doctor's son, and a feral child named Shay. Mila becomes more  and more human, while Shay regresses. The story reminded me a little bit of  &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, although it's not nearly as sad. The  ending was kind of weird. Why did she give up all her blessings? But I  liked how the font shrunk as Mila's knowledge grew, then got big again when  she began longing for the sea. She &quot;spoke&quot; poetically of the  ocean and her dolphin family. Overall, this was a quick, entertaining read.  Of course I reccomend it. What I need now is a sequel. What about Mila's  human father?	2000-02-29

I was actually reading this as the new millennium dawned. How many ordinary kids would love to discover that they're actually wizards!  Harry Potter is for all ages! It's easy to read, but not childish. I could  see Privet Drive, Diagon Alley, and Hogwarts colorfully emblazoned in my  mind. I can't wait for the movie to come out in theaters! Believe the buzz  about Harry! I reccomend Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a novel  that rarely dissappoints and will leave its readers begging for more.	2000-02-27

This one is my favorite. It contains lots of adventure, mischief, and surprise. Harry and his friends are growing up and must face problems that even the adults in  their lives can't solve. Will Sirius Black kill Harry? Is this escaped  convict what he seems to be? What about Lupin, the new Defense Against the  Dark Arts teacher, and even Ron's rat, Scabbers? Is the black dog that  Harry spots everywhere really a death omen, as his fruity Divination  teacher claims? Curiouser and curiouser. So far, the Harry Potter series is  at the top of my favorite books list. Read Harry Potter and the Prisoner of  Azkaban, you will positively love it!	2000-02-27

At first the novel was a little boring, but soon it grew on me. I love it! With mixed  reluctance and eagerness, I finished the story today. Ian was ingenious,  surviving as he did for so long. He bravely faced life without his father.  The way that they'd lived in the old courthouse was interesting. When Mr.  Bayless left and the place was converted into a kite museum, the boy spied  on the workers until he knew them intimately. Like the reviewer below said,  Ian didn't become pessimistic over his traumatic life. He inspires hope.  You'll enjoy reading about his adventures.

This story is about an African-American family who leaves the violent Windy City for a quieter town. Yolonda, the daughter, has a hard time fitting in despite her assertiveness. So does  Andrew, her LD brother. But Londa sees beyond his lack of book smarts to  his musical genius. Can she help him utilize his talents and show people  that he is intelligent? The language in this book was beautiful,despite  some violence and sex references. Andrew's music is described so  wonderfully that you can almost hear it. Like most girls, Yolonda has  crushes. Although she and her ironically named Aunt Tiny are large women,  their size is celebrated rather than insulted. Aunt Tiny shows that a  little(sometimes a lot of) extra poundage keeps a person warm inside. I'm  not obese,but I can identify with Yolonda's food addiction. She understands  the virtues of chocolate! However,that's not always a good thing. Enough  lectures about eating habits, read this book! You're in for a real treat.	2000-02-24

I read the first Harry Potter book voraciously,hoping the next ones would be as enchanting. Ms. Rowling delivers in this sequel. I haven't experienced such a child-like sense of wonder and joy from reading a book  in years! This one is meant for all ages,not just children. Harry's a  wizard,but has everyday problems just like us &quot;Muggles&quot;. The  Harry Potter series is fun and unique. Most 300 pg books aren't interesting  enough to make you want to finish them in a day.  And the Harry stories  aren't Satanic,as some people say. I'm from a Christian family that's  hopelessly devoted to them. No Harry fans have been reported practicing  occult rituals. Parents don't have to censor these novels. They actually  teach moral messages,but in a non-preachy way. If you want a book series  that's guaranteed to be good,that you won't feel you've wasted days of your  life on,try Harry Potter.	2000-01-23

A few pages later, I laughed at Killian's &quot;literary appetite&quot; and pitied his situation. Soon, you learn about Rick's problems. Because his life  was  endangered in a juvenile detention center, he embarked on a journey across  the Southwest. He met Lon, a bird biologist who became like a father to  him. I'm not a &quot;nature girl&quot; who often reads stories with male  protagonists, but I immensely enjoyed &quot;Maze&quot;. There were  beautiful descriptions of the majestic landscape and an engaging plot. I  wonder what'll happen to Rick in the future; however, dreaming up the  outcome of a character's situation is part of the fun of reading a  cliffhanger book. To anyone who loves tales of adventure with  edge-of-your-seat suspense, I reccomend this book. My New Year's  resolution: read more Will Hobbs books.	2000-01-08

I wasn't sure if I'd like it,but I tried it. Usually I don't read a lot of books with male protagonists;this is an exception. Tony had to deal with  new wealth,moving away,coping with problems,and making decisions about his  future. Like real boys,he and his friends tried to do macho things.  &quot;Then Again,Maybe I Won't&quot; is like a guy's version of &quot;Are  You There,God? It's me,Margaret&quot;,but without religious elements. I  could look into a guy's mind. Girls and boys aren't that different in some  ways. We both have our insecurities. I'd reccomend this to novel to  preteens.	2000-01-07

Since I'm part Indian myself,Cloyd's(weird name)story appealed to me. Hobbs helped me understand his feelings,his rough life in foster homes,and his temper flare-ups. Cloyd's identification with the powerful  bear can inspire other alienated kids to cope with problems this way. I  even have a turquoise bearstone like the one in the book(that was one  reason I purchased the fetish). Soon,I'll buy the book as well,and the  sequel.

Margaret and her friends founded a club,gushed about boys,and worried about growing up like many of their real contemporaries. And Margaret's  relationship with God was interesting. Although I didn't understand at the  time why she was so impatient to wear a bra and get her period,the book  helped me when I went through these rites of passage. I reccomend it to  preteens to teach them about puberty,and teenagers and adults so we can  reminisce about our childhoods through Margaret's adventures.	2000-01-07

At first I didn't want to read it because the reviews made it sound boring,but trust me,it's not! It's happier and less melancholy than the  first book. The kids have matured,especially John. It's spiced up by  Zindel's usual wacky storyline and wonderful writing. He understands teens  much better than most adults. I won't give away too much,but this novel  involves more romance. Weirdness binds a motley crue of people,including  John and Lorraine,of course. I wish she would've featured more prominently.  It seemed that John &quot;wrote&quot; more chapters. (And why do they like  old people so much?) For those who appreciate humor and seriousness,sadness  and joy,I highly reccomend this book.	2000-01-06

It was about a group of British schoolboys who were plane-wrecked on an  uninhabited island. Ralph,a &quot;bigun&quot;,tried to lead and create a  semblance of civilization,with the corpulent,wise Piggy as his assistant.  It didn't work for long. One boy,Jack,rebelled and gathered up his own band  of painted savages. There were horrible casualties(I won't say who).  &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is scarier than any horror novel I've ever  read, because the events in it are feasible. Government and rules merely  veil the evil in every person. We must try to further suppress this force  with love so the human race doesn't suffer the same fate as these British  boys. It may sound corny,but to love  takes more strength than painting  ourselves as savages. Back to the book itself. It was very deep and made me  lose some of my innocence.

I enjoyed the warm silliness of his other books,like The Pigman. This one was dramatic and true-to-life. However,it bungled in many places. Some characters were hypocritical and detestable. Maggie and Dennis  weren't all that romantic and close,but they were the strongest characters.  They provided relief from Liz's ridiculousness. I will give kudos for a  poignant,thought-provoking ending. I use such strong language because I  knew Mr. Zindel could've done better. It was overall an OK book,but don't  read it if you're anticipating more great literature from him. Try The  Pigman and its sequel or The Undertaker's Gone Bananas instead.	2000-01-01
US	52698493	R1VQ9HQ88VBJUV	0380750260	255283772	Silver	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Money isn't everything	Of all NFM's books,this one is my favorite. It is humorous and touching. It's about a teenager named Sarabeth who lives in a trailer park. Her mother makes them move into a new trailer so they'll be in a different  school district and Sarabeth can get a better education at a different  school. Unfortunately,most of the kids at Sarabeth's new school are  wealthy,and she isn't. Nevertheless,she makes friends with a clique of rich  girls. Through them,she learns that money can't buy happiness. One aloof  girl named Patty has a crucial problem. What is it? Can Sarabeth help her?  Sarabeth also has troubles of her own with Mark,her new boyfriend. Any  teenage girl could relate to at least some of the situations in  &quot;Silver&quot;. This is a great book that almost anyone would enjoy.	1999-12-22

I identified with many of Meg's feelings,although I don't have an older sister who's ill. Her eclectic friends-all adults-were interesting. She had  an almost nonexistent relationship with kids at school,and school itself  wasn't very important in her life.  The ending is blatantly obvious,though.  Still,I love this book and reccomend it to anyone!	1999-12-22
US	52698493	RWJHJ1LGXC92E	0553282611	754203270	The Girl in the Box	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Powerful	This is no ordinary book. It tells how a 16-year-old girl copes with being trapped inside an underground room by a faceless kidnapper. Bits and pieces of her life are revealed through &quot;letters&quot; she writes on her typewriter. It's scary how relevant and realistic the novel is in our time.  It would be great if situations like Jackie's were unheard of,but they  aren't,and there are no simple solutions. The ending packs a punch and  leaves the reader hanging,like life. &quot;The Girl in the Box&quot; might  be too real for some,but I would reccomend it to those who think they're  mature enough to handle it.	1999-12-15

It shows the lurid reality of sexual assault that many young women face today. Simply because she was an outcast,Valerie was singled out for harassment. But you  get to look into the boys' minds,too. I sympathized with Rollo,which I  couldn't do otherwise. He was a nice guy who jumped on the bandwagon. He  stupidly kept annoying Valerie with phone calls,but he did try to  apologize. Although your friends might do something that seems fun,it's not  always prudent to join in.In this case,someone was hurt by it. Although the  book does give moral lessons,it was fun to read. If you want a provocative  read that makes you think,I reccomend this book.	1999-10-13
