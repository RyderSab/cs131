This one tackles the same subjects through the difficult eyes of those people who, as children, were inducted into the Hitler Youth.  This book is very frank about the jubilation these youngsters felt as they beheld Hitler and his vision for Germany and how they were indoctrinated in the propaganda.  It's very scary thinking of how Hitler targeted the young and innocent as vehicles for his schemes and how successful he was doing this. The author takes interviews and writings and shows clearly how the individuals were taken in by this machine; the youth themselves, now elderly, don't excuse themselves but do tell the tale so that it is easy to see how they became so enamored. This book should be required reading for those young adults studying World War 2 because it's important to remember that there were two sides to the story and how innocent youngsters were willing victims.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-04

McGavock is a well-known name around Nashville, which added to my interest.  I eagerly picked this book up and dived in, prepared to meet the main characters and learn more about the battle and its aftermath, and previous reviews made the book that much more appealing.  However, as I read, I found myself disappointed in the actual retelling of the battle itself; I was hoping for more action and deeper characterizations.  The plot meanders between points of view and Carrie McGavock's motivations are particularly difficult to understand.  On a personal level, I could delve into her darkness of depression over the loss of her children, but since it was a common occurrence in the mid 1800s, I found it a bit over-the-top.  Her feelings for Zachariah are not in character and are never believable.  Mariah is a strong character who never achieves her own voice and a few of the side stories seem forced as well.  The novel finally achieves its goals in the last 100 pages as the focus for Carrie becomes clear and her determination shows.  Hicks has a wonderful way with words but he needs to show the why of his characters rather than letting them stew in their own juices for much of the story.  Overall this is a good book, but not as compelling as I'd hoped.	2005-10-03

Hansel and Gretel, unwillingly abandoned by their father and stepmother into the Polish forest, find themselves taken in by Magda, the village \\"witch\\".  They must protect their Jewishness at all costs, but they also must just survive against the horrors of the Nazi SS.  This book is not for the faint of heart by any means; Murphy spares no punches with the violence and the realities of Poland at the time.  A few of the characters, such as the Oberfuhrer, seem over the top, and motivations aren't always well-defined.  While not the first writer to weave a Holocaust story around a fairy tale, Murphy does it well and leaves an impression I'm sure I won't soon forget.  But for the minor flaws already mentioned, this one would rate a solid 5 stars.  Recommended reading, but don't expect a light tale.  Be prepared to have your emotions rubbed raw.	2005-09-15

I was hoping to find the magic in this book that I found in its predecessor, Belle Prater's Boy.  And while this one does have its moments (the dialogue is very well done), much of it seems forced.  Gypsy and her cousin Woodrow take a bus trip to a nearby town in hopes of locating Woodrow's missing mother, Belle.  The characters peopling the bus seem to be White's focus, rather than the main characters themselves.  I feel the spark, mystery, and originality of the first book just isn't there for this one; it's still a good, quick read, but it's just not a worthy sequel.	2005-09-15

Lofts gives each queen between 2-5 pages of treatment, highlighting the main events of lives we know about only through historical documents and hearsay. Most of the more interesting facts about the queens is omitted; Lofts generally sticks to her facts and does a good job doing so.  It is wonderful to have a ready reference, especially for some of the lesser known queens.  Sadly, though, Lofts repeats a few since disproven tales and even repeats some of the wilder ones as fact rather than speculation.  Lofts also has some facts incorrect, such as stating that Mary Tudor was the born of the first pregnancy of Katherine of Aragon, when in fact she was at least the third pregnancy if not the fifth.  Still, the book is well-done, overall historically accurate, and absolutely gorgeous for its pictures.  If you're looking for depth, this isn't it; but if you are looking to be entertained while skimming a bit of history, this definitely fits the bill.	2005-09-10

Hornby has taken Rob Fleming, a 35 year old record shop owner, and given us a glimpse inside his confused, music-obsessed head.  Told from Rob's point of view, we learn about his obsession with list-making, his musical interests, and his preoccupation with his recently broken romance with Laura (who seems to be his polar opposite).  Rob seems to have built his life around his teenage interests:  music and sex. However, over the course of the novel, we are led by Rob to see his thoughts maturing and his realization that loving what you have instead of what you don't is what makes life bearable.  Rob is often whiny and a bit annoying and he doesn't work too hard at any of the relationships he has, whether with women or with friends.  In fact at times he's downright unlikeable, but the truth of his character keeps the reader interested.  I may have understood Rob's problems, but that didn't mean I always had sympathy for them; Rob's written as a person with faults that make him believable.  At times though, his whininess was a bit too much for me to enjoy which is why I'm only giving 4 stars.  But overall, this is a good novel with lots of interesting characters and an excellent backdrop of music.	2005-09-03

Persecution against the Quakers has always been a fact of life for Susanna and her family, and in fact, the story begins with Susanna leaving home to find work in the nearest town because her father has been jailed for practicing his faith.  Once Susanna moves into town, she meets Will Heywood, the son of a locally prosperous merchant.  Will's life has been mapped out for him:  apprenticeship, taking over his father's business, becoming an alderman.  However, Will has found that his life is missing something spiritually and he begins to realize that he is drawn to the Quakers' faith, as well as to Susanna.  That none of this fits with his father's plans is an understatement; Will must come to terms with himself and his beliefs.  Susanna finds herself caught up in her love for Will and her strong convictions for her church.<br /><br />Turnbull tells the story in chapters that alternate between Will's first-person account and Susanna's.  This gives the story depth and helps us to understand why Susanna reacts as she does in the face of persecution and how Will finds his own strength to stand up to his father.  The story moves along at a good pace and the storyline is believable.  This is an excellent account of the religious persecution of Quakers as well as an excellent relationship novel.  Turnbull makes us feel what the characters do and she pulls us into their world effortlessly.  This one is recommended.	2005-08-29

Tally is actually Lady Atalanta, whose family is rich yet not close.  Flora's father was killed in the war and her family struggles to make do, yet they are loving and supportive.  The two girls forge a friendship that defies both class and situation, even when Tally leaves school to attend first finishing school, then gourmet cooking school, and finally deciding on modeling.  Flora finishes school and works hard to become a secretary making her own way, though she does allow herself to partake of Tally's generosity in sharing a house rent-free.  The paths the lives of the girls take are predictable yet still valid.<br /><br />Margaret Mayhew has a gift for storytelling that pulls you into the story and makes you feel as though you are breathing the air of the characters.  This one, however, moves along a bit choppily at times, with large chunks of time being glossed over.  While we can understand the motivations of the characters, Tally does not seem to be sympathetic at all and I found myself wondering how Flora reconciled her upbringing against Tally's.  While the storyline is a good example of a coming of age tale, it's not Mayhew's best.  That being said, however, Mayhew's works are still better than most out today and she compares very favorably with Rosamund Pilcher.	2005-08-27

Feldman takes the idea and gives Peter a life in America, a life in which he attempts to deny his Jewishness by pretending he is a lapsed Christian.  He marries and has children, explaining his time in the prison camp as his being part of the Resistance movement.  But try as he might, Peter is swept back into his old life of hiding as Anne's Diary is published by her father.  Both longing for and repulsed by his own history, Peter tries to lead his life as he'd hoped he would but finds himself feeling righteous anger at how the movie and play based on Anne's book portrays his father.  His years long journey into self-discovery is well-played by Feldman's expert imagination. I could absolutely believe that Peter did in fact survive, and I still wish it had turned out to be so.  Feldman has invented a wonderfully tragic tale that is sure to stay with you a very long time.  Excellent storytelling.  Recommended!	2005-08-17

Fame and fortune brought on by the revelation of this vision bring many changes to Blossom's life, not the least of which is a change in her relationship with her friend,Alexander Armsworth.  Peck makes this story so much more than a ghost tale; it's a delightful romp through the paranormal in a more innocent time period.  Peck never fails to amuse and often makes the reader laugh out loud over Blossom and her antics.  This is recommended for kids of all ages.	2005-08-10

Sarah has moved back to the ranch and is facing many obstacles,including a drought that has caused her well to run dry.  Again Turner brings to life Sarah's indomitable spirit and forces us to get inside her skin.  Turner excellently depicts the hardships of life on a ranch around the turn of the century, and she effortlessly makes us understand Sarah's motivations, fears, and regrets.  My only disappointment with this book is the fact that it is not written in diary format as was These Is My Words and I think it takes a little away from the intimacy of the writing. But other than that admittedly minor complaint, this book is a worthy sequel and just as engrossing.  It will grip you around the heart and run you through the gamut of emotions.  Highly, highly recommended.	2005-08-09

Nell is learning the craft of healing from her grandmother as the book opens; her grandmother still practices the \\"old ways\\" and supplies the village with potions and curatives as needed.  Neatly tied into this mix is the existence of piskies and fairies, all of which conspire to help Nell and her grandmother as they are seen as kindred spirits.<br /><br />The existence of the two healers takes a sinister turn when the minister's eldest daughter finds herself with child and turns to Nell for a potion to rid herself of the burden.  Once Nell refuses, accusations of witchcraft are brought against the two women by the minister's two daughters.  This book does a credible job of showing how hysteria can grow and mob rules can make otherwise sane people turn against those they know should not be accused.  Hearn also seamlessly weaves real historical persons and events into the story.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to make of this book when I first started reading; I'd thought it was a straight historical novel.  However, as the novel progressed, I found myself drawn further into this world by Hearn's expert language and imagination.  The blend of magic and realism is artfully done and I can highly recommend this book to lovers of both historical fiction and fantasy.  This is a rare one.	2005-07-31

These Is My Words begins with Sarah Prine's family pulling up stakes and traveling toward a new home in the early 1880s.  Deciding to record the events of her life in a diary, Sarah takes us step-by-step through the real tragedies of life on a frontier but also through the triumphs that make life bearable.  Sarah is a tough young woman who is a sharpshooter, both with a rifle and her spirit.  Young and impressionable, she finds out that people and events are not always what they seem and she makes plenty of mistakes along the way.  The love story between she and Captain Jack Elliott is one of the best I've ever read; you can feel the love between the two jump off the page and grab you around your own heart.  Finding a stopping place in this wonderful book is next to impossible and to say that your soul will become involved is to state the obvious.  Sarah and her stories will live a very long time within me.  This is historical fiction at its absolute best.  Highly, highly recommended.	2005-07-29

Duncan MacDonald is a 14 year old boy who is taken in by the glory of war and honor and wishes longingly to accompany his father to battle.  Things developing as they do, Duncan receives his chance to be in the thick of fighting at the devastating battle of Culloden and he discovers that true war is not anything like he'd thought it would be.  A side story of the \\"fits\\" Duncan suffers becomes a major plot point later on but is a bit of a distraction.  The story is flavored with the dialect of the Scottish people and a glossary is included at the end.  This is a realistic portrayal of a young boy's dreams of war and the inevitable shattering of not only the dreams but of lives as well.  Good, solid, interesting but not riveting reading.	2005-07-27

Harry enters his 6th year at Hogwarts with Voldemort firmly coming back into power.  It will take all of his skill to overcome the dark forces around him as well as deal with the regular stuff a teen deals with.<br /><br />This book was just as good as my expectations for it!  I absolutely bow before Rowling's use of characters and the long-term story arcs that take place.  This is not the innocent Hogwarts of the first few books, and Harry and his pals are not the innocent kids they once were, either.  Rowling rightly assumed that if we're here with her in the 6th book, we know the background so she doesn't waste time rehashing old topics.  Instead she dives into unknown territory with both new and old characters.  At times I was devastated, elated, or amused but never, never bored.  And part of the charm for me is trying to decide what clues Rowling included in this one that will become a major part of the 7th and final book.  I can't wait for its release but like this one, I'm afraid it'll be over all too soon.	2005-07-22

With her she'd carried a suitcase which had followed her from her home to her aunt and uncle's house to a Jewish ghetto in Czechoslavakia and finally on to her final destination.  Many years later, Fumiko Ishioka decides to open a Holocaust Museum in Japan in order to teach young people about the horror.  One of the items she is sent to display is the suitcase which bears the name of Hana.  Her children become adamant that they must know more about this girl, so Ishioka goes to work.  She tenaciously goes to the prison camp where Hana lived for 2 years and discovers much more than she'd planned.  This is the story of undying human spirit told in a way that children as young as 8, 9, or 10 can understand.

Austen weaves a brilliant tale of Emma Woodhouse, a young socialite, and her community in Victorian England.  Emma cannot resist inserting herself into the affairs and pursuits of her neighbors and dear friends and the resulting chaos is delightful.  Emma is indeed a flawed character, but so are the others in this tale, which makes it all the more authentic.  Emma's belated realizations of the results of her machinations are humorous as well as often disastrous.  Feeling she must match her new protogee, Harriet Smith, with a suitable husband, Emma manages to mangle the situation not once but three separate times.

Picoult sets us up early on with a tantalizing bit about the loss of the younger daughter, Hannah,and keeps us going as we discover that Katie, the older daughter, has lost a child.  As members of the Amish community, the idea of a child out of wedlock is unthinkable...and obviously to Katie as well, since somehow the infant is found dead the morning after its birth.  Brought into the story at this point is Ellie Hathaway, a lawyer who is distantly related to Katie and who is also wrestling with her own moral, maternal, and relationship issues.  The characters develop well over time as Ellie defends Katie against charges that she's murdered her baby.  Ellie is shown to be a ruthless lawyer but she must come to terms with herself as she is made guardian of Katie--an act that requires her to live on the Amish farm during the period leading up to the trial.  Katie must try to get past the amnesiac block she's built up around her baby's death and try to discover the truth of the situation.  Picoult does a credible job of creating conflict and character development and her insight into the Amish way of life is superb. Of course there are a few minor quibbles, including the ending, which is plausible and pure Picoult. Highly recommended!	2005-07-02

Ashley is a regular senior in high school (notice I tried not to say she's \\"normal\\"--Anderson does that enough) who couldn't care less about prom until her best friend Natalia drags her onto the prom committee at the last moment.  Ashley is cynical about everything, including her boisterous family, and this attitude carries over into her school work and in particular the prom.  Ashley's boyfriend TJ foresees the two of them together after her graduation in a dump of an apartment with going-nowhere futures.  As the story goes on, of course Ashley begins to realize she really has more to offer than just a counter job in a store, tho she never loses her edge in expressing herself.  At times this book is laugh out loud funny and at times it provokes the reader into anger but it is never boring.  The sex is implied, not graphically stated, and is realistically done.

I normally love Roberta Gellis's work, but this one almost got wall-banged several times throughout the reading.  I only stuck with it out of respect for Gellis's earlier works, including Roselynde and Alinor. This one is poorly thought out and executed.  None of the characters rang true; Alex second guesses himself so frequently that I wanted to scream.  Desiree's abrupt personality changes made me shake my head in wonder.  I could never work up enough interest to care whether or not Vachel actually carried out any of his not well planned schemes.  And the love scenes were almost laughable at times....an example is a one sentence paragraph:  \\"Oh, oh!\\" Desiree cried.  I am saddened at this below-par work from a normally engaging author and I hope her next book takes us back into the writing and magic of her earlier works.

Told from the point of view of 16 year old Esther, this is the story of the teen leaving her family behind to try to find safety in France. It is a Holocaust story, but it is also a coming of age story; Esther feels fat and ugly, is mistreated by the other girls who are staying at the home, and is rejected by the boy of her dreams who only sees her as a little sister.  At times Esther can be annoying in her self-pity, but that also makes the story believable.  Esther must come to an understanding of her place in the world and what she has to offer.  The backdrop of the Holocaust makes the story more poignant as Esther realizes it's all up to her.  This is a good story and is recommended for its human elements.	2005-06-06

It didn't disappoint on either account!  Susannah was born a \\"mediator\\"; it's her job to communicate with the dead and help them to find peace so that they can move on to the next phase.  Sometimes they go willingly and sometimes they don't; Suze is known to become violent to get her point across.  In fact, that's probably my only gripe with the book:  Suze doesn't bother to become emotionally involved with her ghosts, at least in this first in the series, with the exception of Jesse (the hottie ghost living in her bedroom).  Suze is all business.  I also thought her new-found popularity at a brand new school to be a little unrealistic, but Suze is a likeable character who knows how to deal with the dearly departed (if not so much some of the living people around her).  I suspect she begins to grow in her relationships with the living as the series continues.  I enjoyed this tale and look forward to reading more in the series.  Recommended!	2005-06-02

What a nice ending to the terrific series of books by Lewis! The Revelation begins with Leah's long lost love, Jonas, coming back to Grasshopper Level and attempting to reunite with both his church and his never-forgotten love.  Long-kept secrets must find their way into the open, old hostilities must be resolved, and new and old loves must be kindled.  Lewis ties every thread up neatly, even if at times it does become a bit \\"preachy.\\"  Still, these characters have found a special place in my heart and will do so to anyone who reads these books. The character arcs over the series are believable and the situations they face must be overcome in ways that bring them to know themselves and God in new ways.  Highly recommended.	2005-05-31

This is the sixth book in the Georgia Nicolson series, and it continues the absolutely hilarious life of Georgia and her mates.  Georgia's family is going to Hamburger-a-go-go Land (America) and Georgia is going to be on the lookout for Masimo, aka The Italian Stallion.  What ensues is truly funny: Georgia's family continues to embarrass her in spectacular fashion; her \\"elderly mad\\" grand-vati is left in charge of Angus and Gordy; and her friends are always on hand to lend wisdomosity.  Of course things never go as planned with Georgia, but that's part of the fun and Rennison keeps the story moving at a fast clip.  I was literally in tears of laughter at several points during this book.  Highly recommended!	2005-05-29

Julianna, the heroine, is a bit independent by the standards of the day but believable.  Stephan is a typical knight errant of the times:  strong, silent, hot-headed.  When the paths of these two meet, sparks are ignited.  With the help of Stephan's younger brother, the two are brought together but such are the times that the king must give his approval to the match even though a marriage has taken place.  It is after the two marry that the story begins to fizzle.  The love scenes are a bit tame; our hero and heroine degenerate into calling each other \\"sweet love\\" in front of the entire court of England.  A side story of Stephan's Jewish ancestry is well done but doesn't ring true if looked at closely.  Overall this is a good book if taken as a romance, but if you're looking for historical accuracy, it's just not there.	2005-05-28

This is the story of Daisy, a fifteen year old who goes to England to live with her cousins in the not-too-distant future.  It is not giving anything away to say that Daisy begins a love affair with her cousin Edmond, but all their lives are changed as a war breaks out and England becomes an occupied state.  At first the kids are self-sufficient and untouched by the horrors, but as the story develops, shades of World War 2 begin to overcome them as they face separation, deprivation, and ultimate loss.  Daisy speaks in a believable voice that takes you into her soul and makes you feel what she does.  This one is highly recommended.	2005-05-22

This is the convoluted and captivating story of Ned Henry, a professional time traveler in 2057.  After one too many \\"drops\\", Ned is sent back to the Victorian era for rest and relaxation after he corrects an incongruity created by a fellow time traveler.  To say that things don't go exactly as planned is an understatement!  The hilarious characters and situations are entirely believable, and the plot twists and turns delightfully.  The convolution makes the story so much more enjoyable that it's hard to quibble over the technical details Willis insists on trying to explain.  I found myself laughing out loud and thoroughly caught up in this adventure.  Guaranteed to pull you out of a reading slump!	2005-05-04

Tony Bramwell was part of the Beatles' inner circle, a childhood chum who followed them in their journeys from Liverpool to London to the world.  He tells his story here, and it's very engaging.  Tony gives the juicy tidbits we all love, and he doesn't hold back when giving his interpretations of situations.  He makes it very obvious how he felt about certain people; I admire this trait because oftentimes the issues are skirted around to avoid hurting feelings or speaking ill of the dead.  One fault I have with the writing (which occasionally  seems a bit redundant) is that Bramwell jumps around chronologically which interrupts the flow at times.  I think Paul McCartney gave a terrific endorsement:  \\"Ask Tony because he remembers more than I do.\\"  And he does, telling it splendidly and keeping us entertained in the process.  Recommended by this major Beatles fan!	2005-05-03

Prince of Darkness is the fourth book in the Justin de Quincy historical mysteries, and Sharon Kay Penman retains her high degree of suspense and intrigue throughout this novel.  Justin de Quincy is again called into the service of Queen Eleanor, not for herself, but for her errant younger son, John.  For once, John has been wrongly accused of plotting against his nephew and Justin and his adversarial fellow \\"Queen's Man\\" Durand must work diligently to clear John's name before his brother, Richard the Lionheart, returns from his captivity.  John is drawn in a completely believable manner; he's a confident mix of arrogance and terrified young boy.  As Justin and Durand delve deeper into the mystery, familiar characters arise and the complexities of their situation finds them discovering new evidence that comes as a complete surprise.  Though at times Justin is not quite as self-assured as in the past,fans of the books will not be disappointed in this next volume in the popular series.	2005-04-17

I'll preface this by saying that if you love The Princess Diaries series, you'll like this one, too.  It's more of the same, but that is also the problem.  It's light and cute,but I was hoping for more character growth. The amount of laugh-out-loud moments were few and far between as well. The entire novel takes place in a very concentrated period of time and showcases Mia's run for President of the Student Council.  Of course she's still obsessing over Michael, worrying about schoolwork, and watching over her new brother while battling her grandmother.  The endless references to current pop culture kept pulling me out of the story and making me wonder how well this series will hold up over time--will it become overly dated? And what on earth is up with Mia that she is still putting up with Lilly? It's hard to imagine that Mia has found her backbone in standing up to Grandmere but is still allowing Lilly to run roughshod over her. Still, overall it was engaging--but let's hope Cabot decides to take it up a notch in her next book in the series.	2005-04-05

This is the story of thirteen year old Abby, a child who has always had strict parents and a structured, yet loving childhood.<br /><br />Then she begins to notice small signs that all is not right with her mother; her fears multiply as the signs become more and more disturbing until her mother's condition spirals out of control.  Abby adjusts as well as she can but all the while she is desperate for her old life.  Abby speaks in believable terms while maintaining the tone of a young teen.  My biggest complaint was the use of the present tense, which is a personal pet peeve and not a reflection on the author's style.  I loved Abby and my heart broke for her.  I know I will be wondering for a long time to come how her life worked out....yes, I know she's fictional but she was brought to life through the author's great sense of writing.

The characters are rich and vibrant and the situations are packed with details that bring them to life.  Fiona is a pure joy--filled with life, beaten back by tragedy, and triumphant through determination.  Nick is definitely one of the most sympathetic characters ever written.  The fact that real incidents, people, and places are seamlessly woven into the tapestry makes this much more than a rags-to-riches story; it brings believability to what might have been a trite tale. Donnelly uses colorful language to realistically build the scenes and create tension.  These characters are going to live in my heart for a very, very long time. Highly recommended.	2005-04-01

Rinaldi brings this tale to life by having Jane herself narrate; Jane at times says things that seem a bit anachronistic but overall her sense of wisdom and life comes through admirably.  Jane's life was so incredibly tragic and I'm indebted to Rinaldi for getting it out to YA readers.  My only quibbles with the book were the lack of overwhelming Christian structure that reportedly followed Jane throughout her short life, and a couple of questions about the timeline (which might have been changed for dramatic effect).  Rinaldi does a wonderful job of bringing history to life once again!  Recommended.	2005-03-25

Realizing that Lewis's books can often be preachy, they are still mostly enjoyable with well-drawn characters and good plots.  This one is sub-par for Lewis, however.  The plot is contrived and the preaching comes very heavy-handed.  I found the Christianity to be inserted in odd ways and conversions less than believable.  I usually love Lewis's work and her Amish characters in particular, but this one was definitely not her best work.  Perhaps it was the influence of her husband?  I'm glad I've got the newest in the Abram's Daughters series to look forward to or I'm afraid my interest in Lewis would end with this one.	2005-03-23

This is the story of Bridget, descended from Mary Magdalene, and her daughter Magda.  Set during the 1200s, the main characters are linked to the de Montvallant family.  This book takes the story of religious persecution in France and brings it to life brilliantly.  The characters themselves are often riddled with faults but more believable because of them.  Chadwick takes real events and ties them into the story seamlessly.  While this book has a hint of mysticism about it, it still rings true.  So much more than a romance, this story will capture you and leave the imprints of the characters stamped on your soul for a long, long time.  Highly recommeded!	2005-03-12

I am a bit of a Titanic buff and will read almost anything concerning the ship and disaster.  I admit I was skeptical of this book but found it surprisingly enjoyable.  It took a fresh spin on an old story and even threw in a bit of a mystery.  The writing at times is amateurish, and a bit repetitive (everything seemed to look \\"smart\\").  Some of the plot devices require a major suspension of belief (i.e., the side story of Carl's mother's \\"miraculous\\" cure). But the plot itself overcomes most of the faults.  It is generally a fun, engaging read and not to be taken as serious literature, but still enjoyable.	2005-03-06

The humor and poignancy within these pages transcend mere religion and get under your skin very quickly.

It is a truly believable account of Alex, heir to the throne of Rovenia, and the adjustments demanded of him as his father returns to take the throne lost by the family after WW2.  Alex is a typically spoiled rich kid who has been raised in England with the knowledge of his lineage, but never in his wildest dreams did he expect that the Rovenian government would choose to reinstate the monarchy.  Alex comes across as a confused, angry young man who only wants his old life back.  The use of present tense, at first minorly irritating, became a plot device that brought the tragic surprise to the surface in complex, truthful ways.  Alex is a sympathetic character, and the author does a credible job bringing him to life and making us understand his needs as he grows to accept his destiny.	2005-02-28

While this book is a fun, easy read, there's not a lot of substance to it.  It's written in the style of a 12-year-old boy, which makes it highly authentic but slightly irritating when applied to run-on sentences.  It also perpetuates the idea of the \\"good woman in the bad business\\" stereotype; in this case it's Al, mother of Tony, who dances in the Kitty Kat Club but reads the classics, holds an English degree, and is a wonderful mother.  All of this gives the mature Tony an opportunity to draw \\"the girls\\" from life without being sexually excited.  So while the book is meant to be fun, and is at times funny, it's a bit too formulaic to rate more than 3 stars.	2005-02-24

I read this book based on the wonderful Silken Threads, the previous book in the series.  While that book was a truly stunning example of historical romance at its finest, this one is less successful.  Hugh of Wexford is a believable character with a good deal of potential, but just about every other person populating this book is a caricature, which is a pity.  I began by doubting the authenticity of allowing a 12th century maiden to be as well-educated as Phillippa was, and still being allowed to live alone (regardless of her reasons) at age 25.  All of the side characters were over the top; in particular Clare, who just came off as an underhanded witch without a lot of brains and an out of control libido.  And while I'm not a prude, I found the sexual scenes that involved the characters other than the main couple to be unbelievable and too freely imbued with fetishes.  Because I did like the actual romance of Hugh and Phillippa, I give this book 3 stars.  But if you're looking for a book as well-done as Silken Threads, this is not it.	2005-02-24

I loved the premise that the characters were based on real people from Rinaldi's life, and I think she brought them out in believable, entertaining ways.  Rose is a bright, charming young girl and I found her reasons for marrying to be forthright and true to life at the time.  Comparing this book to earlier Rinaldi works, it's *almost* as good, but still lacking in that little extra spark which keeps me turning the pages feverishly.  I can still recommend this one highly, however.	2005-02-16

While there is still plenty of passion, there is also a credible historical backdrop woven into the plot.  Joanna, the heroine, is just a little too independent to believe, but otherwise the story itself is well-told and the little twists make this more than a run-of-the-mill romance.  The hero is also a man with faults, but not so darkly brooding as to be a stereotype.  The sexual encounters were tastefully written yet still steamy!

I could perfectly picture myself in the midst of this quaint village that had been &quot;invaded&quot; by the Yanks, turning it on its head and bringing it kicking and screaming into the 20th century.  I liked that there were different shades to each character and the author made the motivations clear and believable.

I was pulled into this story immediately because 13 year old Anna was so alive and thoughtful.  I identified closely with her, but also with all the characters--Piccoult's switching between points of view helped flesh out the story and added a dimension that might have caused this story to degenerate into a good guy/bad guy tale.

After a bit of a confusing start (the cast of characters could literally have numbered in the hundreds), I got my bearings and found myself swept into the lives of Constance Despenser and the courts of Richard II and Henry IV.  Wainwright has captured the essence of real historical persons and made me care deeply about them.  I had to take my time reading this book, not because it is in any way difficult, but because I needed to savor it.  Wainwright, with his expert research, has woven a story that should be read, experienced, and digested by all who love historical fiction. This is one is highly recommended!	2004-04-18

I am an avid reader of historical fiction and I picked up this book with high hopes since it concerns one of my favorite historical persons, Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England, and rightful heir to the throne which was stolen by her cousin Stephen.  I could only make it a couple of chapters into this book before I threw it aside in disgust.  A skimming of the remaining chapters did not give me incentive to carefully read anymore, though I truly wanted to like this book.  The writing is immature and absolutely horrid--it reads like a would-be drama that comes off as a comedy. I was ready for a new spin on this worthy tale but the writing was stilted and overdone.  Anyone with a sense of British history would be mortified at the way in which Matilda's character is abused in this book.  While there may be a slim historical base for some of the author's events, they are poorly told and overly dramatized.  With such a wealth of truly outstanding historical fiction available, it would be a shame for anyone to waste his time on this one.	2002-05-03

I've not read the earlier books, so maybe I'm missing an essential thread, but I felt this book was too scattered--the plot goes everywhere and ends up doing  nothing.  I found the &quot;Irish language&quot; parts cute, and the  relationship between the two main characters is refreshing, but there was  no suspense.  I found myself skipping large sections out of boredom.  I'd  read A Midwinter's Tale by Greeley and liked it immensely, so I was quite  let down in this read.  The &quot;action&quot; scenes felt contrived and  silly.  I did finish it, but I won't try another in this series.	1999-06-06
