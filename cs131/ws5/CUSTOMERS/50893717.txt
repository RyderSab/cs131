It reads like a novel, yet there is more truth in this tale than in virtually any other book I've ever read. These two people are real heroes, the kind one usually only reads about in books, but they are very much alive. One is tempted to say they are like Mother Teresa, only instead of caring for the dying, they care for the living!    It is also a tale of agribusiness interests run amok, \\"free trade\\" ruining the lives of millions at the bottom of the multinational food chain, and two people who do not even own a pillow, less a bed, who have decided to take on the World Bank and all their minions.     I feel blessed to know that such people even today walk the earth. You will learn so much from this book, and be inspired in the process!    --    Editorial Reviews    \\"The Color of Freedom is TERRIFIC! I read it with breathless attention and shouts of joy! This is exactly the kind of book we need: a real-life story with real-life heroes whose travails and triumphs enrich our own experience, seeding new possibilities.  In this dark time, this book is both spiritually satisfying and strategically invigorating. These people are moral giants, in comparison with whom we are like pygmies. After the strong review of multinational shrimp farming, I think that I have eaten my last prawn!\\"    -- Joanna Rogers Macy, author, \\"Widening Circles\\" and \\"Coming Back to Life: Practices to Reconnect Our Lives, Our World\\"    \\"Be forewarned: this is a provocative and dangerous book. \\"The Color of Freedom\\" is seemingly an account of the marvelous passion of a man and a woman, but make no mistake: it is really about you and the hidden strength which you have yet to draw upon.\\"    -- John Taylor Gatto, former New York State Teacher of the Year, and author, \\"The Underground History of American Education\\"	2005-03-15

But when I got to the section around 1920, I was shocked! Michener (probably based on being brainwashed by his Polish nationalist informants and simply not checking his facts) has Russia invading Poland!<br />Virtually all historians agree it was the other way around. To quote Isaac Babel:<br />Newly constituted as an independent nation after World War I, Poland sought to take advantage of the nascent Soviet state's upheaval to expand eastward, restoring its 1772 borders and its former stature...Jozef Pilsudski, leading the Poles, articulated the Polish mission both as a fulfillment of his country's historical destiny and as a crusade to save European civilization from the alien disease of Bolshevism....<br />Hostilities had begun in February 1919, in the wake of German withdrawal (after the November 1918 armistice) from the Russian-Polish borderlands...The Poles quickly acquired the upper hand. In April they took Vilna; in August, Minsk.... Polish troops kept moving, taking the Latvian city of Dvinsk in January 1920.<br />But many accounts date the beginning of the war to April of that year, when Poland moved deep into the Ukraine. On 6 May the Polish Army (aided by Ukrainian nationalist troops) took Kiev from the Reds.&quot;<br />In fact, in the treaty of Riga signed in 1921, Poland literally doubled its size, having unilaterally seized territory, some 80,000 square kilometers, from the Soviet Union.<br />Now that I see how wildly inaccurate Michener's storytelling is in this instance, I wonder about all the rest.<br />Be careful -- fun reading, but perhaps very poor history.	2004-02-11

On one page, he lists more than a hundred things he didn't know anything about before he encountering them in educating his daughters (the book focuses on the older one, which is sensible, given that the younger one was only 6 when the book ends.)<br />Yes, he does give himself a pat on the back, just as any homeschooling parent would when finding something that really works with his or her child. His daughter is undeniably very gifted, but what comes through is how much work he and his wife put in to enable that giftedness to express itself. I learned lots from this book, mainly that I can trust myself and my children to find our own way.	2003-11-26

Hunt's thesis is simple: a happy childhood lasts forever, and every child is no less a human being than we are, and must be treated as such. Adults behave as well as they are treated, and the same holds true for children. Adults generally do not improve their behavior when they are insulted, criticized, threatened, publicly humiliated, or beaten; or in the rare instances when they do so, the costs in fearfulness, anger, and resentment are extraordinarily high.<br />Fortunately, argues Hunt eloquently, the seed of how to be with children is implanted within us. If we listen hard enough, the direction of how to act toward a child comes naturally. Crying, for example, is a signal provided by nature meant to disturb parents so they can seek out the causes of the child's distress.<br />The Natural Child offers a consistent and compelling approach to raising a loving, trusting, and confident child, without resort to coercion or manipulation, simply by following the Parenting Golden Rule: \\"Treat your child as you would like to be treated if you were in the same position.\\" This book is a must for every public and church library, and the perfect gift for the individual or couple expecting the arrival of their first \\"distinguished visitors\\".	2002-02-02

We are experiencing a rather intense conflict over whalehunting by the Makah Indian Nation.  Many non-Indian (and some Native) environmentalists and animal lovers oppose the whalehunt, mainly on the grounds that it sets a poor precedent to restart it after a 70-year hiatus, and that it makes a mockery of attempts to preserve the natural environment. Some, in my opinion, have been particularly disrespectful of tribal elders and customs, publicly stating that the whaling traditions of the Makah are long since dead, and that since Indians now live in modern housing and hold down jobs like the rest of us, whaling is no longer relevant to the native culture.<br />The Makah insist that whalehunting is part of their treaty rights, and for others to pick and choose which rights they are allowed to exercise is similar to allowing another nation to decide which articles in the Bill of Rights Americans should be allowed to enjoy.  They see whalehunting as an important part of their cultural heritage, which they are seeking to preserve.  They, too, however, have spoken as if blind to the efforts of environmentalists over the past four decades to preserve and protect whales and their habitats so that whalehunting could even be a question.<br />Both groups share something in common: anger and grief.  Environmentalists grieve for a time when whales freely roamed the seas, when Pacific Coast forests covered the landscape, when the Puget Sound region was not simply a slash of highways and cheaply built (but high-priced) housing developments, when cities and towns were not choked with garbage.  Certainly, global warming and the pollution of the seas - neither of which can be attributed to the Makah - have accounted for more whale deaths than the Makah could ever accomplish. But still, for them, the hunted whale - the single whale that the Makah are likely to catch and kill each year using ancient technology - is a symbol of a world gone awry, of a vanished world (which may or may not have ever existed) in which humankind and the natural environment were locked in harmonious and continuing embrace.  And while they are in grief, they haven't learned how to mourn.<br />The Makah are angry, too, though many are slow to display it to outsiders.  They are angry about having their lives and culture wrenched away by invaders, but perhaps more so by the lure of modernity upon their young people.  They seek to recapture a rich and ancient culture, rooted in the earth and sea and sky, but which most of them, like the environmentalists, have never really known. They grieve for a past which they know, deep down, they will never be able to fully recover, a world for which a single, lonely hunted whale has become a symbol.<br />Dealing with anger and with grief - for oneself and for the world - is the common thread that runs through Joanna Macy's compelling memoir Widening Circles.  Having first met Joanna in 1977 at the protests against the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant (I make a cameo appearance in the book as the kazoo-playing pamphleteer and Sanskrit scholar), and later as her first publisher, I have watched with awe as Joanna has sought ways to transform our anger and grief into power, the personal power that gives our lives meaning even as we are stretched in our personal, political, and ultimately spiritual struggles.<br />Joanna's life spans five continents, and she is no stranger to grief and anger on any one of them.  It has been an unusual life -- from New York French-speaking schoolgirl raised by an abusive father and long-suffering mother to CIA intelligence officer; from wife of a Peace Corps director in India and Africa to student of Buddhism and systems theory; from motorcycle-driving scholar of community development in Sri Lanka to futurist - Joanna has an uncanny ability to step back from the everyday fray of our frazzled lives and focus on who she - and we - really are, or can be.<br />Indeed, one of the things Widening Circles is really about is identity. Joanna's many travels, coupled with untrammeled curiosity about her world, has allowed her the luxury of finding identity, in the present moment as her Buddhist teachers would instruct her, but also in the lives of others, in the past and in the future, and well beyond the limits of her own skin.<br />And this is the gift Joanna has given us.  Environmental problems are, at their core, human problems, questions of who we really are, and how we organize ourselves as a community and as a society, and ultimately how we see ourselves. When our grief and anger control us, we become prisoners of our little selves, and despair, when unexpressed, constrains us to a narrow focus upon the immediate, the here and now. Joanna's life work is truly an invitation to all of us to widen our circle, or in the words of William Blake, \\"To see the world in a grain of sand/And heaven in a wild flower,/Hold infinity in the palm of your hand/And eternity in an hour.\\"<br />Whales, too.

This much is true, and the story is well told by McCullough.<br />He also carried on one of the most interesting spousal correspondences in history, and this is also well handled by McCullough.<br />What McCullough seems to have forgotten is that Adams turned out to be an extraordinary dangerous man, a real foe of democracy. His greatest legacy as President -- the Alien and Sedition Acts -- were the model for the McCarthy era, and for demogogues hiding behind flags well into our present day.  It is shocking that McCullough gives Adams legacy as President such short shrift.<br />What did McCullough actually think about this singular contribution to American life?  After reading through all the verbiage contained herein, you still won't know. What this tells me is that the biographer -- for all the words and all the footnotes (but which leave out the Adams papers published in the last two decades entirely!) -- doesn't know himself.<br />Which means the book is shallow -- half-baked, not ready for prime time.

Now, instad of profound, I find it precious and peculiar.<br />Weil's attempted life of sacrifice, coupled with her willingness to be rescued by her rich parents each time the sacrifices seem to go too far, seem like the stuff of spiritual soap opera, not great religious vision. Her solidarity with the poor and the working class, while well-meaing, is ultimately a failure, and her attempt to teach the Upanishads to factory workers seems like comedy of the absurd.<br />Her religious writing is not much different.  Full of extremes, and paradoxes, and sometimes unnecessary verbosity, she strives for solidarity with a world of which, as she clearly states, she can never be fully a part. This, to me, now seems a peculiar act of self-loathing, and her anorexia is only further confirmation of this point.<br />Perhaps she is pointing the way of how not to be a saint. Anyhow, the reading is engaging.

Over time, though, I have come to the realization that Bonhoeffer's sacrifice -- his failed attempt to assassinate Hitler -- was in itself an attempt at &quot;cheap grace&quot;, the very thing he decried. He isolated himself from his community, and lacked the courage and fortitude to speak out when he had the opportunity. The result of his failed plot may have contributed to the deaths of millions of people, because without his plot it now seems likely that Hitler's generals would have overthrown him as much as two years before the end of the war.<br />Bonhoeffer has become somewhat of a cultic figure in recent years, and that's unfortunate. He was an important but flawed thinker who could never escape the Protestant individualism of his religious tradition. This book is probably the best example of his work, though Bethge's picture book on his life (&quot;Steps&quot;) contains enough for most people.	2001-01-13

No one could figure out what it meant except that multiple fields of endeavor feed the bottom line (so what else is new?. No one could ever figure out how to use it except by giving commands from the top.<br /><br />The book itself is tiresome, turgid, unreadable - a walking advertisement to get one to hire the authors and their friends as consultants, to try to figure out what it is all about. And once one does, one ends up with a big \\"huh\\"?<br /><br />Remember Yuri Andropov? This would have been a very useful book for him to have.	2000-02-18

I spent much of the 60s and 70s with posters of Hundertwasser's paintings on my walls. It was always clear that he was an architect, but one without any commissions. So when I came across this book, I was ecstatic.  He's  actually building! He is freeing us from the tyranny of straight lines, 90  degree angles, and an architecture divorced from nature. Some of his  buildings are like something out of Willa Wonka and the Chocolate  Factory!<br />I'd love to live in a city filled with Hundertwassers rather  than the neo-prison building that passes for architecture these days. And  so would others -- rents at Hundertwasser buildings in Vienna fetch a huge  premium.  And he is regreening cities at the same time. I can't wait to go  visit!<br />This book is also wonderful for preteens -- it will stretch their  minds about what is possible -- and give new reason to study the math and  physics necessary to realize the cities of our dreams.<br />This book was my  Christmas present to myself (I also gave it to others), and it was the best  present I got! Every time I open it, I want to sing!	1999-12-29

We carry around memories of them for years, and their impact on our social behavior is immense.  Kohl challenges us to look carefully at the books and stories we select for our children and at the  messages, both overt and subtle, that they contain. Should be read by all  caring parents (and teachers too!)	1999-08-09

Nancy Wallace's book has been in print for almost 10 years now, and there have been dozens of homeschooling books since - how-to's, diatribes, anthologies, talk with the experts, etc. - but there is no book which is  more respectful of the intellgience and in-born learning quests of  children.  Almost uniquely, she looks at &quot;homeschooling&quot; (a label  which does not do justice  to the book) from the perspective of the  children themselves, rather than from that of overanxious, or overeager,  parents.  Belongs in every home library dealing with &quot;alternative  education&quot;.	1998-12-21
