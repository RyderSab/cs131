Version · Today's New International Version	Books	5	35	37	N	Y	Good Parallel NT	This is a fine parallel NT.  It includes the NKJV, ESV,<BR>NIV, TNIV, NLT, NCV, The Message, and the HCSB.  One<BR>can do good comparison study using these translations.<BR>A few are fairly new to the church: the ESV, TNIV and HCSB.<BR>While I would have made other choices about which translations<BR>to include this is a good parallel NT.<br />What makes this parallel NT so good are the two essays in<BR>the introductory material.  The first is by Mark Strauss<BR>on the strenghts of functional and formal equivalent translations.   This essay by Strauss is worthy<BR>of study by every pastor and student of the Bible.  I wish<BR>Oxford would publish it in a booklet so it could receive the<BR>wide readership it deserves.<br />The second essay is good too.  It is about the different<BR>text types of the Greek NT and serves as a nice introduction<BR>to the subject.<br />Until Oxford finds a way to publish the essay by Strauss<BR>you'll have to buy this parallel NT.	2003-10-21

There is no comparable edition<BR>of the NIV published in the U.S.  You will need to get this<BR>Bible directly from Cambridge.  <br />The NIV is one of my favoirte translations. Some dislike it<BR>because is uses a moderate amount of dymanic equivalence.<BR>Others do not like it because it does not use enough.  I <BR>find that it is a great translation to use alongside the<BR>RSV, ESV, and NASB.  As one scholar has put it, &quot;Of the<BR>more accurate translations the NIV is the most readable,<BR>and of the most readable translations it is the most<BR>accurate.&quot;  I agree.

It is &quot;literal&quot;, but not<BR>so much so that there is no literary style.  The literary<BR>style is very much in the Tyndale/KJV tradition.  This is<BR>due to the fact that the ESV is a slight revision (6% I'm<BR>told) of the RSV.

It continues the<BR>NIV tradition of clear, contemporary English. While much of<BR>the NIV is still there in the TNIV, the TNIV has made a few<BR>changes here and there to make the translation even better.<BR>Most, but not all, of the changes have to do with gender<BR>accuarate language for people. This makes the translation<BR>more dynamically equivalent. While this<BR>is controversial this is the same philosophy used by the<BR>New Living Translation, another translation by evangelicals.<BR>Again, the TNIV has as its major strength a high degree of<BR>clarity and readability. The English style is modern and<BR>crisp, it reads well from the pulpit or lectern. Do not be<BR>bullied by those who do not like the TNIV. I've wondered if<BR>they had read it when I read their comments. It is a lot like<BR>the NIV, not terribly different from the NLT, and a very useful<BR>addition to my study desk and preaching and teaching ministry.<BR>It is also quite useful as a Bible for devotional reading; I am<BR>reading it through this year and enjoying it very much. <br /> Some additional thoughts on the TNIV, June 4, 2002. After<BR>reading the TNIV for some months now I have had the same reaction<BR>to it that I did to the NRSV. It is an OK translation, not as<BR>great as its predecessor, just OK. While I can affirm the use<BR>of gender accurate language in translation to a certain degree<BR>the NRSV and TNIV go too far. They bend too far towards changing<BR>the language to suit me. Too many singulars are replaced with<BR>plurals. The English style is not as good in either translation<BR>either. The NIV is not perfect, but it did not warrant the<BR>wholesale changes to gender inclusive language that the<BR>TNIV makes. The NRSV makes the same mistake. I don't think<BR>that the NRSV or the TNIV are great improvements. Neither<BR>reflect current English usage. Where I differ from some who<BR>oppose them is that I can recommend them, even though the<BR>recommendation is rather lukewarm. My mind has changed on the<BR>issue of gender accurate language in translation. It has its<BR>place, but the TNIV and NRSV go too far. I'm hearing from<BR>friends in the United Kingdom that the NIVI is not used very<BR>much. I think publishers are trying too hard. Around 25-30%<BR>of the Bibles sold in the U.S. are the KJV. After that the<BR>NIV holds on as number one holding around 40-50% of the market.<BR>Neither of these translations uses inclusive language, but <br />people read them. The NLT has done a pretty good job of<BR>giving us a dynamically equivalent translation that uses gender<BR>accurate language. Perhaps enough is enough. <br /> So, if you are looking for a Bible to read from use the NIV. If you think<BR>gender accurate language is extremely important use the TNIV.<BR>It is OK, just not as great or ground breaking as the NIV. The<BR>NRSV is OK for study, but it is not as great as its predecessor<BR>the RSV, which is a treasure the church need not have lost. Check<BR>out the English Standard Version and the New American Standard<BR>Bible too. These are very literal translations, quite good for<BR>study.<br />Update 1/21/2003<BR>The TNIV is a good edition to my library.  Like the NIV it<BR>works best as a translation for reading and comparison with<BR>more \\"literal\\" translations.  I like it a lot and plan to <BR>continue to use it.  As I said above, its major strength is<BR>its readability and clear, crisp English.	2002-04-26

I have this edition of the RSV in<BR>paperback. The NT is not the updated RSV (1971) NT, which is<BR>a weakness of this edition, but this is still a worthy addition<BR>to your library. This is especially true since the RSV can be<BR>very difficult to find. I suggest that if you are having a hard<BR>time finding the RSV you might want to purchase the English<BR>Standard Version. I do use this paperback Bible and enjoy reading from it for my devotions. In my opinion the RSV is a treasure not to be lost!!<BR>The best thing you can do is buy this edition or the Cambridge<br />edition of the RSV that has the second edition of the NT and then<BR>buy the NASB and ESV.  Let these translations in the great tradition of Tyndale/KJV shape your Bible study.  Then use others<BR>to supplement your reading and study.  The RSV is still available<BR>but not easy to find.  Blessed reading!!	2002-04-23

It was the Bible we used in church and<BR>Sunday School. When I went to college and theological school<BR>the RSV was the primary study text for every class I took in<BR>English Bible and theology. The RSV is a great translation, one of the wonderful treasures of the last century. It is still very useful<BR>and I use it all the time. I'll never discard my Holman Study<BR>Bible, New Oxford Annotated or the Harper Study Bibles I have owned for close to 20<BR>years. As wonderful as the RSV is it needs some updating. The<BR>NRSV was a noble attempt to do this, but as good as it is the NRSV adopted some of the principles of dynamic equivalent translation theory. In an effort to be \\"clear\\" or to adopt<BR>inclusive language, the NRSV became a less literal translation<BR>than the RSV. Now we have the ESV, a marvelous updating of the<BR>RSV. The ESV makes the RSV tradition a little less archaic,<BR>clarifies a few passages,and continues the literary sound of the<BR>Tyndale/KJV/RSV tradition. The ESV is also a very good Bible for study, it follows the form of the Hebrew and Greek texts<BR>very closely. I do wish the binding of my burgundy leather <BR>Bible was as good as the Bibles I own that are published by<BR>Cambridge University. My RSV Holman Study Bible, published<BR>by A. J. Holman Publishing many years ago is also a better<BR>leather edition than my ESV. But I am thankful for this editon<BR>of the ESV and encourage pastors and interested students to add<BR>this translation to their study desk.	2002-03-02

Glaspey features novels, classics from English literature, and a host of books from theology to Christian spirituality.  For a confirmed bibliophile this is a book to return to again and again.  I'll use this book for many years as I continue to read and collect many excellent books.	2001-08-10

It is one of the most important  translations of this century and I wish more people were familiar with it.   It reads so well, especially the great OT narratives and the NT.  I quibble  with it here and there, but it is a wonderful translation for devotional    and public reading and study.  Again, this is especially so in the NT. I  like it so much I will get a leather one!!	2000-08-27
US	51897802	R3V3IDJJ908F64	0842340505	538026527	Holy Bible, New Living Translation Deluxe Text Edition	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Outstanding for General Reading	I really love the NLT for reading and comparison with other translations  when studying.  There is a wonderful flow to the Biblical narratives that I  have not found in any other  translation except perhaps the REB.  I use the  NLT nearly everyday.  The only thing I do not like about it is that it uses  a red letter text in the NT.  I find, now and then, that this makes the  reading of the text a little more difficult under certain forms of  artificial light.  I much prefer black letter for that reason-I find red  letter an intrusion into the text anyway,  but that puts me in the  minority!  If you are familiar or very unfamiliar with the Bible use this  version. It is great and you will not regret it.  It is being revised and  will continue to gain many readers over the next ten years.	2000-08-27

The print size is great and the margins are wide enough for taking notes, but are not too wide. The leather is beautiful. If you like to collect leather Bibles add this one to your \\"wish list.\\" The cross references are very good too. The NASB is a very literal or formal equivalent translation. It tries to present as much as possible the sentence structure of the original languages of the Bible, Hebrew and Greek. That makes the NASB very useful for close study of the Bible. Use of the NASB with the RSV/NRSV, NIV, REB, NLT, CEV, TEV and the venerable KJV will provide the student of the Scriptures with a wealth of information. This Bible has a very important place on the study desk.  I continue to use this Bible.  It is beautiful and one  of the best bibles on the market.  It gets an A++ from  me.  The translation is outstanding.  I use it right  beside the ESV.  Again, this is well worth the money.  An excellent Bible.  Updated 9/16/2002	2000-08-27

I love watching the &quot;Andy Griffith Show.&quot;  I watch it almost  every day.  I've seen every episode and will continue to watch it, actually  I've watched it all my life.  Now and then I've used parts of episodes in  sermons as illustrations.  But this Bible study on my cherished &quot;Andy  and Barney&quot; is just not very good.  It is much too inductive for me  and I have had a hard time connecting the Scripture texts to the episodes.   They did not fit into the context of the show and the show did not fit the  context of the Scriptures.  I understand the desire to &quot;bridge&quot;  the Bible with the world.  I am a rather inductive  preacher as well.  But  there is little meat here in these studies and I am sorry we invested our  time and money in them. But the show is wonderful!	2000-08-15

New  discoveries had taken place in Biblical languages, especially koine Greek.   While this translation includes archaic language it helps the student to  see in the NT whether the Greek is plural by using &quot;ye&quot; for the  second person plural.  F. F. Bruce, one of my favorite NT scholars,  frequently recommended this translation as a study text.  It also uses  paragraphs rather  than single verses as in the KJV/NKJV or some editions  of the NASB.  The NASB is a great literal translation too.  The ASV of 1901  offers students of the Bible both a good literal translation and an  exploration of one of the most important English translations ever  published.	2000-08-12
US	51897802	R1PXQ5STSJULPY	0310902037	828958825	NRSV Harper Study Bible	Books	5	64	67	N	N	Excellent Study Bible	The first study Bible I owned was the _Harper Study Bible_  in the RSV.  That was almost 25 years ago and I still have it! I have a leather one too, the first one I bought was a hardback. This edition is quite good.   Lindsell expanded some of the notes and it uses the NRSV text, a very, very  good translation of the Bible.  The font is a nice size and it reads across  the page with excellent cross references in the margins.  I use this Bible  every time I study for sermons and Bible studies.  Any person interested in  studying the Bible in depth should consider adding this Bible to their  study shelf.	2000-08-02

Do you believe studying Christian doctrine is unspiritual?  Does considering what people of the Christian faith believe sound like something that would not be fun?  Well think again!  My  friend Larry Hart has written a wonderful book about an exciting  subject-Christian theology. He writes with clarity, passion and joy about  God, Christ,  salvation, faith, hope and love-and much more.  His book is   well-informed by evangelical theology and an openness to the work of the  Holy Spirit.  The book is wise, &quot;sound&quot; would be another way of  describing it.  It is scholarly, but not dense reading, there is a joy for  the subject that shines through to the reader.  My friend obviously loves  theology and the Lord!  Pastors (I'm one of them!) will find this book  helpful in their preparation of sermons, I certainly have found it helpful.   It would also be a good text for theological schools to use in classes or  for pastors to read for their own spiritual and intellectual growth.  Take  up and read and enjoy!	2000-08-02
