They are both dedicated cops with a keen eye for the truth, but this time they might have pushed things too far.  They're going after their own kind.

I didn't get interested in the plot until the very end when everything was being solved.  She could have done much better.	2001-05-28

It was almost a mix of TJ McGregor and Dean Koontz.  An excellent combination. &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; is the best I've seen Patterson do.  A story of a lovely girl with a strange yet beautiful gift that has put her and everyone she comes into contact with in danger's way. Desperation, fear, confusion and love make up the best book I've read in quite a while.  If you like action, you must read it.	2001-03-19

No one is able to find him.  The ex-NYPD on the case (now working with the FBI) is determined to apprehend him.  The author lightens the blow of seriousness with John's sense of humor.  You'll be seriously spellbound one minute and laughing the next.  At first, I didn't think I would like The Lion's Game, but quickly changed my mind after the first few pages.  An excellent read!	2001-02-24

She has quite a creative imagination.  The first book I read by her was The Hanged Man.  I absolutely loved it.  When I got The Seventh Sense, I thought it would have basically the same outline of characters since both books focus on psychic crime solving.  Was I ever surprised.  The books had nothing in common.  I like that about a writer.  Some authors loose their touch after their first book.  The Seventy Sense is a front to back page, high-action suspense.  I couldn't put it down.  There's not too much or too little of anything An outstanding job by MacGregor.	2001-01-28

This is the first book I've read by Catherine Ryan Hyde and loved it.  It tells about a boy with a big heart and witty intelligence.  He creates a project that will change the world though he doesn't know that the results will truly be worldwide. It makes you appreciate the simple creative minds of children.  Aside from that, there is a romantic tie that flows with the story to give the book a combination plot.  I recommend all to read it!	2001-01-25

I have read five of his books.  When I began the &quot;Brethern,&quot; I didn't think it wold be nearly as well written as &quot;The Client&quot; or &quot;The Street Lawyer.&quot;  Thankfully I was wrong.  There are many characters, you have to play close attention durth the first few chapters.  After that it's an easy and exciting read.  I look forward to more books by him in the future.	2001-01-10

Cole really touched my heart with how mature he was for such a small child, yet still just a little boy at heart.  He carried a talent that could either be horrifying or beautiful.  I was so surprised at the end.  A lot of people said they predicted the ending around the middle of the book, not me.  It was a total shock!	2001-01-10

At first it was confusing because she involves so many characters in her plot, but after the first 100 pages or so it's a good read.  She adds a balanced combination of mystery and suspense, which keeps you reading. The one flaw I've seen in all of her books that I read is that she never develops new characters.  She uses the same personalities in her writing just with a different plot.  I find it annoying to have the same information constantly repeated.	2001-01-07

I was surprised at how closely the movie followed the book.  That's rare.  It's an all time favorite of mine. It's too bad that there aren't as many classics written now as there used to be.  It seems that now that many popular books are focused around psychopaths and serial killers.  It is a real shame that there aren't more new classics.	2001-01-07
