Of having no boundaries or restrictions?     In the magical world of a young boy's imagination, a wonderland can blossom. Sent to bed without supper for misbehaving, the unrepentant and spirited Max lets his imagination soar. His bedroom transformed into an exotic wilderness, Max sets sail across a deep blue sea to where the \\"wild things\\" are.  After taming all of these fearsome monsters (turns out, he's the wildest of them all), the newly crowned \\"king of all wild things\\" leads them on quite a romp....until the lonely boy decides to return to the place where he is loved.     This journey into imagination is wonderful, whimsical and extraordinary. Small wonder that \\"Wild Things\\" was named the Caldecott Medal Winner for the Most Distinguished Picture Book of the Year in 1964. Author/Illustrator Maurice Sendak has created a timeless classic - one which will always be among my personal favorites.     [...]	2005-09-25

Turns out to be a great idea in this author's deft hands. A young worm - we know he's male by the baseball cap; his sister's is identified by her pink bow - offers young readers a hugely entertaining worm's-eye view of the world. We learn that the three best things about being a worm are never having to go to the dentist, never getting in trouble for tracking mud through the house, and never having to take a bath - traits that young children can appreciate. What \\"Diary\\" encompasses is a nifty mix of facts about earthworms and an entertaining anthropomorphized account of a worm family. (The young worm is no fonder of homework than his human counterparts.) Important points are gently reinforced - good manners, Truly hilarious illustrations (the Secret Service worms sport regulation dark glasses and earpieces) enhance the charm. This is an outstanding writer-illustrator team (Harry Bliss is an award-winning cartoonists for The New Yorker) that has, not surprisingly, been on the New York Times best-seller list more than once.

There's another wonderful spider tale out, and it's terrifically imaginative. If people are scared of spiders, what are spiders scared of? \\"People with big feet,\\" claims the young spider whose diary comprises this tale. The book offers a unique perspective - a spider on the wall, you might say - on an arachnid's life. The secret to a long and happy spider's life? Never fall asleep in a shoe. Which is a great reminder for young readers to check their shoes before putting them on. The author nicely mixes facts - spiders are not insects, and their existence keeps troublesome insect populations at bay - with fantasy as she gives her spiders some very human, and very funny, characteristics: \\"We tried the seesaw. It didn't work.\\" The little spider has to do a lot of things his human counterparts do, like safety drills at school and homework. And he has two improbable best friends who would normally be dinner - Fly and Worm - much to the chagrin of his own parents and the horror of his friends' families. This is a welcome addition to the author's \\"diary\\" series, in which she teams up with the inventive and award-winning illustrator Harry Bliss.     [...]	2005-09-25

But the little boy grew up, and needed more than the loving tree could provide. What happens in a realtionship when one of the parties takes and takes, until the giver has nothing left to give? When is love codependent and unhealthy? Do we get our sense of value, our happiness, from the attention and approval of others? These are some of the questions raised in the beautiful but disturbing, The Giving Tree. It is an infinitely sad book, if seen as an expression of unconditional love that is taken advantage of until nothing is left. But it can be a profound message if considered from the standpoint that, as humans, we too often leave thoughts of our Creator behind in our hectic rush to accomplish, be, do. Finally, we realize that other people, indeed, the world, cannot satisfy us, and so we return to the things that matter - and are at peace.     The author leaves it up to each reader to figure out what the book means/ intends. However readers take it, The Giving Tree is an excellent springboard for discussing the meaning of love. The author's simple, effective illustrations enhance the story line.     [...]	2005-09-25

But his wise mother sends him off with a wonderful secret to see him through and carry the memory and strength of her love with him always. The book's foreword says The Kissing Hand is \\"for the child within each of us who sometimes needs reassurance.\\" Love is truly the bedrock that sustains and reassures us on our path through life, and this book reinforces the importance of loving relationship for us all. Beautifully told, the tale may give youngsters the confidence they need to cope with whatever comes their way. In an unusual move, the author has teamed up two acclaimed artists (one a descendant of Sir Christopher Wren) with distinctive styles that nonetheless blend beautifully. These are endearing, luminous illustrations - Chester Raccoon has got to be the cutest raccoon in all of children's literature.     [...]	2005-09-25

Such is the case with this book. Despite grappling with an aggressive cancer, four-year-old Alex decides to open a lemonade stand in her front yard, with the proceeds going to the hospital that treated her. She reaches beyond herself to hasten a cure because \\"all kids want their tumors to go away.\\" As people learn of Alex's plucky response to her plight, the donations pour in. The following year, the \\"Little Lemonade Girl\\" extends her idea so that children around the country can open their own stands (more than 1,000, at last count) and send proceeds to Alex's fund. With its lyrical text and bright, charming illustrations, the book takes the high road and is nothing but positive. Rather than fretting over her illness, young Alex reaches out to others.    Small wonder that this book, written by Alex's parents, recently won the Benjamin Franklin Award: The Bill Fisher Prize for Best First Book in the Children's/Young Adult category.

From the moment the reader \\"buys\\" a ticket and climbs aboard, he or she will experience some of the voices, color and imagery of this bustling place. On the subway cars, we see many different faces - various ages, ethnic groups, nationalities, walks of life: \\"A sea of faces, an ocean of voices, a bit of the world in every car.\\" The readers stop at different points of interest: Yankee Stadium (161st Street), Times Square (42nd Street), Coney Island, and so forth.

Mother deer leave their newborns for days at a time to protect their young.

A young Polish boy, living with his parents in a house filled with love and music, yearns for a piano so he can play the music of his favorite composer, Schubert. But the family is poor, and it is the gift of a harmonica that lets the boy make music  - until the Nazis find them. Torn from his parents, the boy plays his harmonica in his concentration camp to keep from forgetting what once was and from losing all hope. When the camp commandant hears of his musical prowess, the boy is forced to play for the Nazi. Ashamed of receiving scraps of bread from the officer while others starve, he eventually hears heartfelt thanks from another prisoner. He realizes that, \\"Each night, like the very stars, my notes had reached other prisoners.\\" From then on, when ordered to play, the boy does so with all his heart. There are few happy tales from the Holocaust. But there are many stories of man's indomitable spirit, something that transcends the horrors of that time and place. This is another such tale, based on the true story of a Holocaust survivor. And it expresses the uplifting power of music, which no walls can contain.

What wonderful transformations can happen in our lives when we stop fussing about what life has dealt us and start seeking the unexpected gift in every problem!     That's the premise of \\"Murkles,\\" a story about a village plagued by these odd, smelly creatures. Small wonder the townsfolk want to keep them out. But an observant, tender-hearted girl named Juliana lets a Murkle slip through and do what it seems born to do. As a result, the Murkle is transformed, the air is filled with the scent of orange blossoms, and the villagers are delighted. Similar scenarios happen with a flowering plant that threatens to take over the town's pristine lawns, and a dull gray bird that can't be got rid of. When Juliana again persuades the mayor to let these creatures have their way, the town is vastly enriched as a result. The message is simple yet profound: individuals blossom when they're allowed to sing their own unique song. And all who think that many of Earth's creatures are expendable or unnecessary may have a change of heart. Exquisite illustrations bring the village and its unusual occupants to life.

The story is told from the viewpoint of a young boy who \\"views\\" scenes from other countries, while the text points out that children everywhere share one sun and moon and many other things. From coastlands to heartlands, from China to Iraq to America, people are more similar than they are different, the boy realizes. At the end, all the children, in different, colorful traditional garb, unite - as do all the planet's animals. This lovely, gentle book celebrates all life on earth and exhorts us to live together in peace. The illustrations are vivid and magnificent.

In this tale, told in poem form, the author has captured the magic and unconditional love that so often permeate the grandchild-grandparent relationship. Janet Mary Sinke writes of her subject with insight, warmth and love. As the two family members spend a day together - baking, swimming, lounging in the hammock - they relish their companionship. \\"I crack an egg. I make a mess. But Grandma doesn't care. She lets me crack another one, then brushes back my hair.\\" From the dust jacket photograph, the reader can see that Sinke is the model for the \\"Grandma\\" in this beautifully illustrated book - which makes the story that much more real and immediate.

Stinky may be the tiniest striped skunk in the forest, but she certainly knows how to make her presence felt. When she doesn't get her way, stamps her little feet, raises her tail, and sprays. Even when she knows she should behave, even when she has no friends left, she finds the self-gratification too strong to resist. Daddy tells her to practice self-control: \\"When an itch to be bad pops into your head, stop and think. Tell yourself to do the right thing. Then make yourself do it, even when nobody is watching.\\" Another person - a parent or teacher - could force her to do the right thing, he adds. But she needs to draw on an inner strength and do it herself. Finally, between the efforts of teachers and parents, it gets through to this thick animal that she's her own worst enemy.

High mountains rose straight up before me, and as I watched, a flock of white birds...winged their way together across the face of the nearest mountain. It was a Chinese painting in motion.\\" <br /> <br />Not everything was idyllic during Pat Linder's years in Taiwan. For this savvy, globe-hopping Admiral's wife, her husband's posting to Taiwan in 1977 proved not to be for the faint of heart. Earthquakes, political upheaval and the language barrier made for a bumpy ride indeed. There are undercurrents of trouble throughout, from the mysterious phone call advising her to unpack before she ever leaves the U.S., to the daunting number of armed guards around their Taiwan residence, to a rare eye disease that increasingly obscures her vision. And she is scathing in her comments about the cruel practice of foot-binding, designed to keep women from running away from their husbands. <br /> <br />Yet the memoir also contains moments of sheer hilarity, as when Pat makes her first attempt at using chopsticks at an official function, or when - desperate to get her air conditioning fixed - Pat speaks into one of the bugged ceiling fans in her home.  <br /> <br />Readers will be amazed to learn how, in 1933, the most valuable pieces from a Beijing art museum were packed into crates and then carried on the backs of peasants for 16 years, lest Japanese or Communist Chinese forces find and destroy them.  <br /> <br />When the U.S. government breaks off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1978, Pat's sympathies are obviously with the Taiwanese people, whom she has come to admire and love.  <br /> <br />Since the Admiral shared only unclassified information with his wife, readers will get little in-depth discussion of actual political events. But Pat writes with warmth, humor and passion that is quite engaging.	2005-05-09

God Created takes readers on a delightful journey through the stages of creation. \\"In the beginning ... Silence. Spirit.\\" What transpires in this book is a feeling of connectedness, between Creator and created, and among all the life forms that inhabit our planet. God created it all. Even \\"tears and laughter, smiles, frowns, winces, hugs and friendships, too,\\" says author Bozzuti-Jones. He makes the case that nothing is a mistake - that all we can \\"hear, taste, touch, see, be, or imagine\\" comes from God. The common refrain is: \\"and so much more.\\" More than we could ever imagine, or see, or touch. And so ours is a world of infinite possibilities. What an invaluable lesson for children! The author's faith is reflected, simply, reverently, and beautifully, throughout the book.     Jui Ishida's montage-style illustrations reinforce this message: there's no beginning or end to any of them; the eye is drawn seamlessly from image to image. Page after page, the story unfolds. This author isn't in a hurry to tell his story. It's timeless and eternal. The feeling one gets from it is of promise and of peace.     [...]	2005-03-30

When Christopher Cat's mother informs her son that cats need to learn character, but that cats can't be taught, Christopher takes up the challenge. He is sure that if they launch a Character Club, the other barnyard cats - all inquisitive creatures - will want to join it. And they do.     Christopher's enthusiasm is contagious and wins over his mother. Through her character, young readers will hear such gems as: \\"Character is ... always doing the right thing, even when nobody is watching.\\" And \\"How can we learn character if we don't know what it is?\\"     The cats learn that everyone has character traits, \\"like little tags hanging from your collar, telling everyone what you are.\\" They find out that character isn't something that happens as a result of wishful thinking; it takes effort. They also learn that character means little unless it's put into practice.      This is a delightful and instructive book, good for countless re-readings, and should be on the shelf of every parent, teacher and caregiver. Desirable character traits are listed for easy reference and will make discussion easier. Best of all, in our age of quick fixes, children will learn that building character isn't an overnight achievement but an ongoing process - and that the benefits are priceless.     [...]	2005-03-30

Eager to learn to read, young Tricia can't wait to get to first grade. Until she does, she occupies herself with coloring and drawing, which she shows real talent for. But to her dismay, reading and math don't come easily once she's in school, and her classmates are merciless in their teasing. It takes the perception of the new fifth-grade teacher, Mr. Falker, to realize Tricia has a learning disability and to take the time to help her surmount it. When the mystery of language and of numbers is magically opened up to her, it is truly a joyous moment.     For any child who believes he or she is \\"different,\\" this gentle book offers hope and encouragement. \\"To be different is the miracle of life. You see all of those little fireflies? Every one is different,\\" says Trisha's grandmother. Sometimes it takes a teacher to ask his class: \\"Are all of you so perfect that you can look at another person and find fault with her?\\"     In this lovely autobiographical book, the author tells a moving and compelling story of hope and caring. And her illustrations add a wonderful dimension to the tale. How delightful it will be for young readers to discover that another \\"slow learner\\" became a talented, published author.

That story is told in By My Brother's Side.     A serious leg injury has the family doctor predicting that Tiki might never play sports again, but he fails to take into account Tiki's love for the game, his positive attitude, and his devotion to his brother.   Ronde's support is enormously helpful, too; he spends hours by his brother's side, recalling memorable games and talking about their heroes, which helps keep Tiki's spirits up.     After watching from the sidelines for what seems an interminable summer, Tiki rejoins Ronde for practice and gradually regains his mobility and prowess. He keps telling himself, \\"I can do it.\\" And when football season starts, Tiki is again part of the team.      This book shows the importance of having a goal and moving toward it, step by step, until that goal is reached. And for every child who has been sidelined because of his size or ability, this book may be just the inspiration he needs.     [...]	2005-03-30

Every color, age, and size, we're united by beauty inside.\\" With girls comparing everything about themselves to others - and often forced to take a back seat to boys - books like this one are a treat. Author Jada Pinkett Smith celebrates women's diversity as well as our unity. We are magnificent, the author seems to be saying, each and every one of us. It's a thoroughly inclusive book; women and girls of all ages and ethnic backgrounds are lovingly photographed here. Delightful photographs illuminate the author's lovely, lyrical poem and show the many faces of girlish and womanly beauty. The effervescence of one cartwheel-performing child is simply delightful.      This is a book about warmth, caring, love, and the strength we get from female friends and family members. It's perfect for mothers and daughters to read together, and for girlfriends to share.     But it's not just a feel-good book. Feeling good about ourselves also takes effort: \\"We girls hold up this world as we build our self-esteem. We know that discipline will turn a princess into a queen.\\"    [...]	2005-03-21

His main character, Nikolai, asks his three best friends the questions he thinks are most important. If he only knew their answers, he believes, he will be a good person. Recognizing his friends' limitations, however, Nikolai wisely seeks further for his answers, and visits a wise old turtle. The turtle never answers him directly, but when a storm comes up and two panda bears are in danger, Nikolai dashes to their aid without a thought for himself. In his action, he finds answers.     This is a gentle tale, told well. Muth's illustrations are graceful and elegant, and beautifully enhance the many moods of the story. Based on a short story by Leo Tolstoy, who is probably best-known for War and Peace and Anna Karenina, The Three Questions succeeds in getting children to think of being of service to others. And to realize that, contrary to what advertisers would have us believe, life isn't about getting; it's about doing.     [...]	2005-03-18

I wrote this book because I want my grandchildren to...know they are part of a nation whose citizens enjoy liberty and opportunity such as have never been known before.\\" So says Lynne Cheney in America: A Patriotic Primer.    America is an enormously complex topic to cover, but Cheney does an admirable job. Using an alphabet format (\\"E is for Equality), the author manages to cover a lot of ground and do it well. Children will read about concepts such as tolerance and freedom; about leaders, from Native Americans, Founders Fathers and suffragettes to presidents and Martin Luther King; and about important places, such as Ellis Island and Yorktown. The \\"Concluding Notes\\" provide more in-depth information about the people and events mentioned, and even the Bill of Rights. Mrs. Cheney hopes not only that children will enjoy it themselves, but also \\"that it will most often be read and discussed by parents and children together.\\"     Robin Preiss Glasser's illustrations and border drawings are a treat. Fascinating in themselves, they keep discrete pieces of information clearly separate, yet bring a cohesiveness to the book.     [...]	2005-03-18

Books	5	9	9	N	N	A Winning Tale, Told By A Winner	Winners Never Quit is the delightful tale of a young girl, Mia, who loves to play soccer with her brothers and sisters. She's good at it, too. But one part of the game she hasn't mastered: losing. And when she quits in a temper, she discovers that her negative attitude may cause her to miss out on playing the game she loves. Forced to choose what is most important to her, Mia realizes that winning isn't everything; it's staying in the game that counts.    If anyone could tell this message convincingly, it's author Mia Hamm, star of the U.S. National Soccer Team, an Olympic Gold Medalist, World Cup champion, and five-time U.S. Soccer Player of the Year. In an afterword, Ms. Hamm says, \\"There is no 'me' in Mia because, in soccer and in life, I could never do it alone.\\"      Children seem to blossom when they realize that others have the same feelings, doubts, desires - the same good and bad traits. It's learning what to do with them that makes them \\"grow up.\\" Readers will feel they have found a friend in Mia Hamm, someone who was once a child too, and probably had to deal with her own dislike of losing in order to become a champion athlete. Soccer fans will appreciate Mia's removable, autographed color photo in the back of the book.      Carol Thompson's bold, action-filled illustrations are perfect.      [...]	2005-03-18

Bernard Waber's book works so well because it shows young readers the many faces of courage. There are the obvious kinds -firefighters entering a burning building, mountain climbers scaling the heights - involving people and actions which youngsters find heroic, larger than life-size. But children will realize, thanks to this insightful book, that ordinary, everday actions also require courage, whether it's breaking bad habits, holding on to your dreams, or being the first to apologize after an argument. Even acts of common courtesy may display courage in action.      This book encourages youngsters to go on in the face of adversity and feel good about themselves for doing so. It should serve as an excellent starting point for parents to discuss this important topic with their children.     [...]     To paraphrase Maya Angelou once more, \\"Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can't be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.\\"     Those who read Courage will undoubtedly agree.	2005-03-18

Young readers will learn about women who have a place in history because they led the way in important fields. These women range from well-known figures like Betsy Ross and Annie Oakley to people like Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman doctor; Mary Lyon, whose founding of Mount Holyoke College \\"opened the doors of higher education to women\\"; and Marie Curie, who received Nobel prizes for her work in both physics and chemistry.      This book is a rich compilation about the efforts of some of America's bravest and brightest female citizens, and should be in every home library. As with Cheney's America, this is a book best read together with parents. There's so much to explore and learn; it's a wonderful book to bring the generations together.         Mrs. Cheney follows the formula she used so well in America: A Patriotic Primer.  Robin Preiss Glasser's terrific illustrations bring this book to life.

Why, to see which would be voted the \\"bugliest bug,\\" of course. In Carol Diggory Shields' charming tale, children will hear about click beetles clacking, crickets singing, and ladybugs doing a tumbling routine. Children will love the way each bug shows off doing what it does best. Even a plain little bug, young Damselfly Dilly, participates - and hers proves to be the most important role of all. Because what none of the other bugs notices is that the contest judges are spiders - who invented the contest merely as a way of getting a good night's supper.      When Dilly points out that the judges are frauds, the bugs band together. Each bug, the quick-thinking Dilly declares, must do what it does best. And so the \\"mantises prayed,\\" the \\"army ants marched,\\" and \\"bombardier beetles took to the skies.\\" When the malodorous stink bugs join the fray, it will come as no surprise to readers as to who wins the day - and who consequently wins the Bugliest Bug title. The tale is charmingly told in verse form, with bold and inventive illustrations. Written by a children's librarian and illustrated by an artist who lives on Bug Island (true!), The Bugliest Bug is sure to captivate young children.     [...]	2005-03-18
