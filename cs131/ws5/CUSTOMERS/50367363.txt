This book specifically follows the migration of rich American girls to England and, subsequently, to marrying a member of the English peerage. It also reveals life in both England and America at the dawn of the 20th century. This book contains the most fascinating and seldom-explored facts from the period, and really takes an in-depth look at the everyday lives of the privileged during the Gilded Age. If for nothing else, buy this book for the pictures! With cartoons, photographs, maps and paintings, you get a visual guide to the period. This book is so well organized that practically every page gives you detailed information on a specific subject, and a picture to illustrate it. Most pages also have small factoids that are some of the best parts of the book. Certainly the best part of the book is how it follows a few American heiresses throughout the book, which really makes you care about the 'characters' and gives you the full story: from start to finish. If you love Victorian/Edwardian history, or the English Peerage, you will absolutely love this book. I refer to it almost once a week and enjoy re-reading it whenever I have some spare time!	2002-09-29

I have bought (and loved) several costume research books on the Victorian/Edwardian era. Fashion plate oriented books, most notably \\"Victorian and Edwardian Fashions from 'La Mode Illustree'\\", are great for research, but for true visual aides, the photographs found in this book are indispensable. The photos range from amateur snapshots to posed, professionally done portraits. With an almost equal distribution of male and female subjects, this book may be the best guide to authentic Victorian and Edwardian costume. Unlike fashion plates, the photos show costumes for a variety of occasions and suitable for different ages and sizes. Spanning the entire Victorian and Edwardian eras, you can locate most popular styles within the tons of black and white photos. For realism, check out this book. If you are more interested in the latest in fashion of the time, check out \\"Victorian and Edwardian Fashions from 'La Mode Illustree'\\". A great source!	2002-05-23

There is only one set of costumes for every 4 years, which leaves huge gaps in the fashion trends of the era. The paper used is not the usual sturdy posterboard-like material but more like glossy paper, which would not hold up to wear and tear. If you are going to buy these for costume research reasons, I would recommend \\"La Mode Illustree\\" for a lot more variety and scope. If you want to use these as paper dolls, I would not recommend these. I cannot imagine them lasting more than 1 or 2 uses.	2002-03-04

To get to know the different people you will meet downtown and see which interactions and topics to explore in different situations. It allows you to get a great date experience without a lot of experimentation and time. Really useful for dating. For everyday Sim gameplay, the guide says some, but not a whole lot more than you get with your game manual. Also, the pictures are black and white, which is kind of underwhelming. But overall I would recommend this for serious Simmers who want to get the most of their social interactions.	2002-03-04

The best part about this book is that the monolouges not often comprised of smaller speeches, cut up and pasted. Most of these monolouges are classic, tried and true and really useful for Shakespearen auditions and readings. An adequate amount of plot explanation and scene information is provided, as are explanations for the Elizabethan terminology. Nothing is left unsaid as far as preparation, meaning and suggestions on how a scene should be done. But the lack of variety and the absence of many well-known and good monolouges made me give this book only four stars. I would only recommend this to an actress just starting out in Shakespeare, who dosen't know a lot of Shakespeare plays and would be unable to go direct to the source for a monolouge, or have a certain play in mind. This gives a nice sampling of plays and characters to start out with. But for  actresses who know and have experience with Shakespeare, it would probably be even more useful to go to the actual play to find your monolouge.	2002-03-04

If you liked the BBC's &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice,&quot; you MUST buy this book. Not only for the pictures of the movie and characters, but the tons of backstage photos you get. All of the characters in the movie are fleshed out as actors and you really get a better sense of the movie in the end. There is a section on the costume, makeup, set, production, casting,etc... basically everything you would ever need to know about P&amp;P: both the mini-series AND the book. I mention this because I was plesantly surprised at seeing a section of the book dedicated to the mission of the mini-series and a perspective on the original P&amp;P novel. This book will also be valuable to period actors/those wanting to make a adaptation, especially if interested paritcularly in the Regency. As an actress, it was interesting to hear the different casting stories and see the behind the scence pictures. It is the kind of insight you usually get on a commentary track (which the DVD does not have) complete with pictures! A great book for fans of the movie or book, and period actors or filmmakers.	2002-02-07

This book is one of the most comprehensive, well-done and complete guide to both Victorian and Edwardian fashion I've ever seen. Although the illustrations are black and white, they are surprisingly well done (most costume design books don't detail hair styles, patterns, etc, but this one does.) I recommend this book as a very accurate guide to the period for researchers, costumers or fashion enthusiasts. The book, along with fantastic illustrations, includes a summary of the times and fashions and a very helpful glossary. Also it is much more than any other book I've seen--- it included SEVERAL fashions for each year and several different occasional wear layouts. If you are curious about this period, you must buy this book. I only wish they had a similar book for every period!	2002-02-05

Also, the recipes are often quite difficult to make. Other than that, this is fabulous book, with GREAT photography.

It includes many pictures of the interior of Regency houses and much more on the fashion of the day, including pictures and terms that will be helpful if researching or just very curious about the costuming of the day. While &quot;Jane Austen's World&quot; had much much more on Jane Austen's life and family, this book takes a much more indepth look at the times of the author including entertainment, exterior and interior of the homes and the fashion. I recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about the Regency or interested in writing a story, play, etc. about the period. Visually and factually satisfying.	2001-10-10

Now I read 800+ page books about Tudor history and I can't help but think back to the days when i used to recreate the illusrations using my own crayons and muse over every sentence in the book.

However, upon reading this book I was sorely disappointed. The first thing that made my feelings towards this book sour was not the fact that the author stretched and challenged Elizabethan history, but that she did so without considering the character of Elizabeth she had made in her first novel. Elizabeth in &quot;The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn&quot; is headstrong, thoughtful and deep. The Elizabeth you are shown is this book is quarrelsome, selfish and annoying. &quot;Robin&quot; Dudley is also a detestable character once you get down to it. If the whole concept of this book is supposed to be their love the reader should at least like one of the two lovers. But these two characters give you nothing to latch onto from the very start of &quot;The Queen's Bastard.&quot; Then we must meet this &quot;bastard&quot; in the form of Arthur who does very little to make you interested in the direction any of the three take in life. The diary entries are assigned to Arthur in this book with interjections of the story of Elizabeth and Robin. These entries are boring and go on endlessly without any reason to enjoy reading them. The plot of Elizabeth and Robin is so cheaply written it belongs in a grocery store aisle. If this wasn't bad enough you can't follow the plot well enough to build any kind of motivation or characterization for Elizabeth, Robin or Arthur. I could not and would not finish this book after I read a passage of several pages about Arthur's butt being sore. The gross and strangely worded sex scenes didn't hurt this book; it was already beyond all measures of a novel gone wrong. I cannot guarantee that you will not like this book but don't expect it to measure up in any way to &quot;The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn&quot; and do not look to this book for anything other than a romance novel of a slightly (and I must stress slightly) historic kind. Robin Maxwell can and has done much, much better than &quot;The Queen's Bastard.&quot;lightly) historic kind.

Unlike the petty, superficial novels usually written for children, this book's historical setting and endearing heroine make it a must read for all precocious children who grew up on fairy-tales, etc. Set in The Middle Ages, this novel explores the society of the time and also the conditions of the time including some hilarious insights on the hygiene! When I read this book in 4th grade I was automatically hooked on everything Middle Ages and actually was inspired to do research in my free time! Setting of the book aside, &quot;Birdy&quot; is a wonderful character that many girls will be able to connect with even though they live more than 500 years later. Each diary entry tells you more about this character, which makes her personality more in-depth than other books for this age group. I recommend this book for all ages but especially for girls who are just beginning to choose what kind of books they want to read and have always enjoyed fairy-tale and historical fiction type works. This book has a permanent place on my bookshelf--- right next to the Jane Austen and Charles Dickens I have come to cherish because of the pathways of literature this book created.	2001-06-08

This book allows an imaginative fairy-tale plot to be coupled with a headstrong and independent heroine. Girls will enjoy reading this with their parents or alone.

Other novels explored include &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles,&quot; and other novels of that genre and category. Sutherland's insights are simple and straightforward and his questions are probing and answer those sometimes irrelevant things your curiosity won't let you sit on! However, this book loses one star because Sutherland often does try to contradict the author and occasionally discards the author's motive in writing the novel. Also a warning: Don't read through the table of contents before you have read all the books addressed therein. Some of the questions assigned to each book will give away or ruin in part the ending to the novel. Luckily this is not a major setback. I do heartily recommend this book, but the reader must be open to new ideas about some of his or her favorite novels and authors, and must also take Sutherland's ideas with a pinch of skepticism.	2001-06-07

This glossary also allows for a fast reference to finding a word in any Shakespeare play. A word will have the meaning and examples of the when it is used in a play. This comes in handy when trying to locate a quotation or a scene. The binding is sturdy and the book is easy to carry and reference to.

But when I read &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; in 7th grade I found the first few chapters lifeless, dull and hard to read. Two years later I was encouraged by a friend to give &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; a try. I did and have since become a complete Janeite. I am now able to peruse joyfully through &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; with a new understanding and appreciation of Jane Austen. The reason? &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is fresh, witty and is a great introduction to Jane Austen's writing style without the formality of some of her other novels (unlike S&amp;S and Persuasion Austen does not give us a 10 page history of each family and their fortune.) If you have never read Jane Austen or have read her other novels and found them boring, read Pride and Prejudice. The characters, and the situations Austen presents to them, are hysterical and reveal a lot about Regency society and morality. This book perfectly compliments a great writer like Jane Austen and is essential to every reader's library. The Penguin Edition of the book is stellar and I personally recommend it not only for the in-depth and indispensable footnotes, but also for the cover that is non-suggestive of any of the characters' appearances. In summary &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a great book for beginner Austen readers and seasoned fans, and Penguin Classics is a great edition for fully enjoying and understanding the book.	2001-06-07

The beauty of Romeo and Juliet is universal of any edition you choose to buy--- Shakespeare's work is not what is being reviewed here.

This book contains all the precious morsels of knowledge that Tudor fanatics crave, but the writer's erratic style and organization makes it a struggle to get through and not feel completely tied into knots. Weir will begin to talk about something, and let the narrative be lead out of chronological, (or logical) order. She will mention names and titles flippantly, which leaves you thoroughly confused and constantly looking in the index. This is not necessary for most history books, but this book seems to be quite a difficult read because attention was not given to the little details like organization and clarity. Often, the same phrases will be used over and over again within two pages, at one point a whole sentence is practically duplicated on another page. The writing is not the best ever, however it is made up for sufficiently by all the facts and painstaking research it includes.  Also, I am really convinced that Weir has a bias against Anne Boleyn. The chapter on this wife is very critical of her and presents her in an unfavorable light; Weir is content to discredit sources that were bias towards her and embrace the sources that are just a much biased against her. However, the book only loses one star because ALL the information that you are given is impeccable, and there is nothing that can discredit this aspect. I would recommend &quot;The Wives of Henry VIII&quot; by Antonia Fraser for a book that is jam packed with (maybe not as many) facts and is much better written. If you care more about details, records and a barrage of sources, look to this book. However, do not hesitate to look elsewhere to find a good read about the 6 wives of Henry VIII, and perhaps only refer to this book on subject matters you want more information on. Great facts, terrible organization, but I am glad that I have learned so much about this subject matter.	2001-04-14

I really loved this book, but the best part about this particular form of Dickens's classic novel is the section at the end of the book that included Dickens's notes on the characters and plots, an alternate ending, and footnotes about the use of language or phrases that might be confusing to the modern reader. Also, the cover does not press an image of the characters or setting onto you, and allows you to picture your own Pip or Estella. Other editions of this book might not give you so many resources and be so reader-friendly. I am glad that I was forced to read this book, because I would have never read it on my own, or I would have quit after the first book---- which is a little boring, but reveals some very important facts to develop the intricate and complex plot. Isn't it great how everything ties up so nicely in Dickens? Read this book, but make sure never to question the genius of Dickens... putting you halfway to sleep before dropping a bomb and putting a huge plot into action.

First of all, this book gives a lot of stellar monologues for actresses of all ages and talents. I loved the selections that were included, and I felt that there were a variety of choices. However, the book did not have footnotes or ANYTHING to decipher the language, so you would need a separate Shakespeare dictionary if you wanted to understand some Elizabethan phrases. Also, the setup was confusing and not very convenient to use. For example, before every monologue there is an italicized description of the character and the situation, then there is the actual monologue in plain text.  I found this setup, which often spanned a number of pages, annoying. Also, the author pasted together speeches (sometimes awkwardly) without even noting that he had done so. This may not make much of a difference, but it did somewhat irk me. Don't get me wrong; the book is a useful resource, but mostly because of the size and selection. If you aren't concerned about size (it actually is pocketsize and highly accessible,) then there are plenty of other Shakespeare monologue books out there. Final verdict: Compact and accessible, but awkwardly formatted and pasted together at times.	2001-02-07

While historically inaccurate, I found this book to offer something beyond Alison Weir or Antonia Frasier's stellar, but heavily factual, interpretations. If you want to explore with an open mind the story of what could have happened, then read this book. My only beef with this book had to be the awkward love trysts of both Elizabeth and Anne. These passages about the love making of both queens is out of place and unnecessary at best. Also the constant references to Anne Boleyn's sixth finger, a myth that is slightly possible and mostly unlikely, is annoying. Do not read this book if you are expecting a high brow look at the facts, or even a high brow look at this era. But for a little bit of guilty pleasure in believing this is how it was, this (slightly fantastical) version of the story makes everything just tie up so nicely, that you almost want to believe that there was a diary, and that Anne Boleyn did have contact with Elizabeth I beyond the grave. The reviews for this book so far have all been very true, the bad and the good, because the truth is that this book creates mixed feelings. Try it out, but don't buy it until you know that you are ready for something a little different.	2001-01-22

I loved, loved, loved Kevyn's last book \\"Making Faces\\" because I could add a lot of the looks he did in his book to my everyday face. His techniques and tips were helpful and well illustrated. In this book, I found more looks that I would want to experiment with, but a lot of the makeovers he did had to do with classical movie stars, and therefore not very practical for everyday use. Both the makeup and the photography in this book are stellar, and the celebrities and unknown people alike look fabulous! However, I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for basic makeup tips and ideas. Most of these looks are not for the office, much less daylight. But if you are interested in the art of makeup and designing character based makeup, this book is a must have. I saw this book at my beauty salon before I bought it, and I wanted it as soon as I saw how it featured pictures of people actually applying the makeup, and also when I noticed the faces of Julianne Moore, Tori Amos and some very pretty imperfect unfamiliar women that wore looks I could see myself in. FINAL VERDICT: Delightful for women who want to experiment and explore the artistry of makeup. Not suggested as a starting point for people seeking basic makeup know-how. If you do decide to get this book, I suggest taking some signature looks of the timeless celebrity faces and make them part of your style. I can't wait to add a little bit of Elizabeth Taylor's eye makeup into my everyday routine!	2000-12-26

I am completely fascinated with the wives of Henry VIII, and I found this book to be especially intriguing. It is definitely a book you have to tackle (when I first started to read it I planned on reading it in 2 weeks.... I read it in a month) but this book actually pulls you in. It has as much of a storyline as a novel, yet it's a non-fiction book! This book included many interesting facts, and sited all the references, which was wonderful. The pictures added a lot to the stories. I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in the complicated and fascinating lives of the English monarchy during the reign of Henry VIII, or anyone who wants to be engrossed in story of intrigue, royal formalities and the part women played in a intricate royal court.	2000-12-10
