What the book lacks is suggestions on how to cure those bottlenecks. Sure, there are examples, but am I supposed to understand Oracle performance tuning through examples?<br /><br />The book would have been 100% better if it had concentrated on indexing. After all, better indexing is by far the quickest and best way to improve query performance.<br /><br />The book's information on Wait statistics is worth its weight in gold. Overall, the authors are highly knowledgeable and has highly granular knowledge of Oracle.	2005-10-13

Sure, the book calls Jack Welch an \\"As***le\\" but it is spoken as a compliment. This highly antagonistic, argumentative, determined, intelligent, and energetic hero is indeed a first class \\"As***le\\" without apologies.  He is the consummate proof that one needs to be an excellent \\"As***le\\" to be considered as a great CEO\manager. If you are one of the nice guys who wants to be gentle, cheerful, and sympathetic to your 80+hr/week working employees, forget it, you can't be a successful manager at GE. You need to be like Jack, and take all the credit for the hard work your underlings, and if any of them complain, you kick their fatass during their review which you are required to cut at least 5% of your staff.<br /><br />Be a tough, bottom-line demanding, reality driven, confrontation seeking, slave driving, and kick assing manager. Otherwise, you will get your butt kicked by other first class manager\as***les. This is the primary lesson of \\"Control your destiny or someone else will\\".<br /><br />On the business side, I found Jack's view on competitiveness (\\"if you don't have competitive advantage, don't compete\\") and productivity (productivity is the engine that drives profitability, job security, competitiveness, and higher pay) quite refreshing.	2005-10-02

I don't know any good golfer who hasn't had some formal private instruction. This book offers a good overview of some of the most common mistakes a golfer can make. I found it invaluable whenever my swing was little off.<br /><br />Although the illustration was good and better than most golf books you can buy, I still thought it could be better. Perhaps paying an artist to create many accurate drawings is expensive, but I think the book could have been immensely better if the publishers had.	2005-09-14

Otherwise, the authors of this book never seemed to have touched a server nor managed an IT department.<br /><br />The book deals with 10 topics:<br /><br />1)Lead, don't manage. (This part was very weak)<br /><br />2)Understand the fundamentals of your environment (The CIOs have to understand the fundamentals too??)<br /><br />3)Create a vision for how IT will build your organization's success. (You mean CIOs should have a goal??)<br /><br />4)Shape and inform expectations for an IT enabled enterprise (You mean computers can't do everything??)<br /><br />5)Create clear and appropriate IT governance. (The authors claim that IT governance is secret to IT success...and I was dumb enough to believe having talented personnel is secret to IT success).<br /><br />6)Weave business and IT strategy together. (As if business and IT are not weaved together in the first place. Yeah, all those million dollars worth of servers are secretly being used to play video games and do nothing for the business at all)<br /><br />7)Build a new IS organization--one that is leaner and more focused than its more traditional predecessor. (Do more with less...what else is new??)<br /><br />8)Develop and nurture a high performance team in your IS organization. (I think this one has been written only a million times in other books).<br /><br />9)Manage the new enterprise and IT Risks (Strictly fillers)<br /><br />10)Communicate IS performance in business relavant language. (This chapter was nice...essentially, you should market the importance of IT as much as possible).	2005-08-27

The first 94 pages of the book is spent on topics such as \\"Maintain a Healthy Skepticism\\",\\"Blame should be Avoided\\",\\"The Cost of a Poor Working Relationship\\", and \\"The Universal Law of Reciprocity\\". Although the author's advice on these matters is sound, the first 94 pages clearly does not provide what the users are looking for.<br /><br />The crown jewel of this book is its technical explaination of wait events. Its explaination of v$SQL, v$system_event, v$session_event, and V$Session_wait tables is well worth your money and your time. If you do not know of these tables, then do yourself and your Oracle users a great service and buy this book and master its contents. You will not regret it.<br /><br />The weakspot of this book is in the resolution of Oracle's slow performance. Although the book provides strong hints that most Oracle issues can be resolved with better indexing and index hints, the book does not emphasize it as much as it should. It also doesn't provide a whole lot of suggestions on how to optimize the SGA.	2005-08-24

Sure, she isn't a saint. But who is? George Bush? Give me a break.<br /><br />This is her AUTObiography, therefore, she casts her story in the most positive light possible. Did anyone expect anything else?<br /><br />The most interesting part of this book is her pre-White House days. The Clintons could have been a very wealthy couple (both are Yale law grads) if their goal was money. Instead, they have spent many relatively financially modest years in Arkanasas performing mainly public service. Hillary's only private sector job was with the Rose Law Firm, which she became a partner. They are the only White House couple in the last 50 years not to have their own separate private vacation home.<br /><br />The book also reveals Hillary's incredible work ethic, intelligence, and loyalty to her husband. Say what you will about her, but I don't think any of the three can be questioned. Overall, I found Hillary's life to be inspirational to all those who aspire to rise to the top from a rather modest beginning.<br /><br />Finally, I didn't know Bill Clinton's early life was so difficult. His biological father died before he was born and his stepfather regularly beat his mother until he was 15, when he was finally big enough to defend his mother. I imagine there has been many violent encounters between Bill and his stepfather. I wonder why Bill still kept his stepfather's last name \\"Clinton\\".	2005-07-26

I have found the book contains virtually no technical errors.<br /><br />If you are a ORACLE DBA who isn't too familiar with Unix or Linux, this is a very worthwhile book to read. Although it is not meant to make anyone a Unix\Linux guru, it is intended for the Oracle DBA who may lack fundamental competency in Unix\Linux.<br /><br />This book provides:<br /><br />1)Unix Architecture and basic Unix syntax<br /><br />2)monitoring Unix (CPU, Disk, Memory)<br /><br />3)Network management in Unix (weakest portion of the book)<br /><br />4)Interaction between Oracle and Unix server(could have been more comprehensive)<br /><br />5)Unix Admninistration for the Oracle DBA( file, task, and profile management etc).<br /><br />6)Many useful Korn Shell scripts (and how to create them) for ORACLE DBAs.<br /><br />If you already have medium to strong understanding of Unix\Linux, I recommend a book which is more focused on Unix\Linux to gain better mastery of the operating system.	2005-07-17

Instead, create an entirely different market for yourself by reducing cost of your products and services while increasing value to the customers. This, of course, is MUCH easier said than done and it certainly has been written before.<br /><br />How does one implement the blue ocean strategy? There are four things:<br /><br />1)Eliminate the products and services which the customers do not want.<br />2)Reduce factors which does not provide high value.<br />3)Raise factors which adds value to the customer.<br />4)Create factors which add value to the customer.<br /><br />Again, nothing I haven't heard or read before. The real value added by this book is its emphasis on the need to \\"think out of the box\\" and occassionally focus away from the narrow boundaries of comparative competitiveness, marketing, technology, and strategy. Rather, some attention should always be given to the dominant strategy of creating an entirely different market by offering different types of products and services to fulfill a yet unmet demand.	2005-07-03

Each Rule is explained in doublespaced 2-3 pages. It seems the author decided to stretch 50 Rules into 100 in order to sell more copies of this book. For example, Rule #11 (Dress Well) is almost the same as Rule #17 (Be Attractive) and Rule #61 (Dress One Step Ahead). The book is most worthwhile read for those who are recent college graduates working in a large corporate environement. For those who are seasoned veterans of climbing the corporate ladder, this book can seem simplistic.	2005-06-26

In order to enter in such a state, one must continually and patiently practice studying at the same time and location. One must also practice clearing both internal and external psychological distractions.

His unsurpassed success as a basketball coach has its roots in his teachings which is written in this book. As a start, he outlines his famous Pyramid of Success:<br /><br />1)Industriousness (hard work)<br />2)Friendship<br />3)Loyalty<br />4)Cooperation (be interested in finding the best way, not in having your own way)<br />5)Enthusiasm<br />6)Self Control<br />7)Alertness<br />8)Initiative<br />9)Intentness (Being determined and persistent)<br />10)Condition (practice moderation)<br />11)Skill (knowedge and ability)<br />12)Team Spirit<br />13)Point<br />14)confidence (Preparation and proper perspective)<br />15)Competitive Greatness<br /><br />Being around 90 years old, however, John Wooden is a big proponent (perhaps because he doesn't know otherwise) of the Old School. For example, he empasizes values over victory, character over talent, and love over competition. He doesn't even believe in recruiting basketball players. He also believes any basketball player with moral, ethical, or attitude issues should not be offered a scholarship (not at his program anyway). All this is fine, and I personally don't disagree. His ideas, however, are somewhat outdated in our hyper competitive results-oriented society. Take NCAA basketball, how many coaches are fired for not graduating its players? Very few. Most are fired, however, if they fail to notch enough wins.<br /><br />I still think this is a very good book to buy. Especially to youngsters and teenagers, that is, if you would like to learn lessons from an Old School teacher.	2005-06-26

He is aware of the current trends in the workplace and provides insightful suggestions on how one can dramatically improve the chance of promotion. There are three factors to promotion:<br /><br />1)SAW (Skill, Ability, Willingness)<br /><br />2)People's Positive Promotable Perception (relationship and leadership skills).<br /><br />3)Promotional Opportunities within an organization.<br /><br />Promotion is increasingly becoming more competitive. In most situations, one needs to be the best, not just good, worker to be promoted to the next level. One needs to set the highest standard in technical skills and constantly improve on it. Next, it is critical one has positive attitude even among those who are strongly negative. Emotional Intelligence in an increasingly stressful and hostile work environment (brought on by more work with fewer workers) is absolutely neccessary to create and maintain positive relationships with the coworkers, the boss, and the customers. Finally, one must be able to affirmatively answer the following question with measureable results: \\"Will promoting you result in creating greater benefit for the organization?\\". One must show the ability to put the team ahead of one's interest for the greater good in a consistent basis.	2005-06-05

Money matters, but only to the extend it can pay the bills.<br /><br />The annoying part was the author's rather liberal views. The author firmly supports graduated income taxation because accumulation of more wealth by the wealthy does not increase their overall happiness.  This in spite of the fact that author readily acknowledges graduated taxation has no effect on the distriubtion of income. The author also adds his views on the rat race and the education: \\"We are past the period of evolution when only the fittest can survive.

It wisely covers the basics and repeats them in a format which isn't too redundant. For example, there are several chapters on Loops (simple, cursor, while, nested etc). This makes sense since loops are extremely important part of PL\SQL. The PL\SQL code examples are very well thought out and the test questions are very thought provoking.<br /><br />The book does not cover advanced topics such as temporary global tables and performance tuning PL\SQL code, but that is beyond the scope of this book anyhow.<br /><br />Suprisingly, I thought the chapter on stored procedures was very weak. It was almost nonexistent. The book spends almost 3 times as much text on Triggers than on stored procedures. This was a mistake since triggers are rarely used because of its performance constraints. Stored procedures, on the other hand, are the bread and butter of PL\SQL.	2005-02-28

Although honest and direct, it simply isn't very entertaining to read. Ali is a good writer and writes about her life more accurately and convincingly than any ghostwriter could, but the flipside is that her writing comes as bit troubled and depressing.<br /><br />The best part of the book is about her relationship with Steve McQueen. It is amply clear that Steve was the love of her life, but unfortuantely also the greatest source of pain in her life.<br /><br />I read this book 14 years after it was initally published. I had only recently watched \\"Love Story\\" for the first time and I had instantly become Ali's fan. And for those who are also her fans, this book is a must read, as it provides a close analysis of her character and history.<br /><br />Looking at her life, I wonder if Ali's life would have been 10 times better and more stable if she had only stuck to her first husband, who incidentally graduated from Harvard and came from a prominent wealthy family (Oliver Barret clone?).<br /><br />Ali is not only beautiful, but extremely intelligent (Wellesly grad). She is, however,  highly insecure in deep need of acceptance. Combined this with her restlessness, and she has predictably lived a life of constant flux and torment. I hope she has finally found her peace.	2005-02-24

To be sure, it contains lot of good business anecdotes you will find in most business books. But if you want to find out what makes McKinsey's business practice so special and so much better than its competitors, the book leaves a lot wanting. Furthermore, the book is full of generalities, for example, the chapter on interviewing for facts was nice, but again, nothing special. You would be far better off buying specialty books on such matters. I think this would be a good book to buy if you want to enter into consulting or are looking to work for McKinsey. For others, however, the book does not break any new ground nor provides any brainstromy insights. Rather, it is full of nice business generalities and suggestions.	2005-02-18

And like most such leaders, the author is great at saying things without substance, but somehow makes them sound substantial.<br /><br />For example, in the paragraph that starts with \\"what is the highest goal?\\", I have noticed that the author never directly answers that question. Instead, he wavers with few meaningless dialogue such as \\"philosophical traditions tell us that we have within us amazing potentiality, including that of the whole universe...power of many nuclear reactions is present in  even a cubic cenitmeter of empty space..The highest goal is simply to be in this experience of connection or truth all the time.\\" That sounds awfully like what some bald headed Krishna dude try to sell me during my college years.<br /><br />To be sure, I felt the book does try to enlighten your spirit. Certain passages does open your eyes to new possibilities towards spiritual enlightment. If you are into such stuff, I suppose it is best to get it from a famous Stanford Lecturer\Yogi.	2005-02-18

This is nothing new, but the author provides a forecast of what tomorrow's business climate will look like. The individual will have more power than ever as employees and consumers. Independent contractors and will be far more in demand as well as service organizations designed fill a niche for larger ones. Anyone who has strong specialized skills will have far more leverage in the company. China and India will be a powerful, if not dominant, force in the global economy. The stock market will be influenced more by individual investors. Most business will require longer operations, requiring workers to work longer hours and be on alert for 24/7. Technology will enable smaller business to effectively compete against larger business better than any other time in history. Scale matters less than ever. Overall, we are moving towards a very favorable long term trend towards the global economy where especially the talented will be richly awarded, but those who lack specialized skills might be left out of the all the wealth generated by the increase in globalization and technology.<br /><br />The author is a very deep business thinker, almost as insightful as Peter Drucker, which is really saying something. The author is gifted in forecasting the future trends based on the present data. The 2nd half of this book wasn't nearly as good. Maybe the author was writing fillers (as many authors are forced to do to meet page quotas mandated by the publishers).	2005-02-12

RMAN thing is hard to love and even harder to learn. No wonder most Oracle DBA are not proficient with RMAN, at least not enough to troubleshoot it when the basic \\"backup database\\"  and \\"restore database\\" statements go awry. The stinker is that RMAN isn't that much more sophisticated than SQL Backups. For example, the online tablespace restore is not really a feature, but really a bug. It is so convoluted it is a miracle when someone can pull it off. One advantage RMAN has is its ability to restore OFFLINE tablespaces while the rest of the database is online. But SQL backup/restore is about 10x easier.<br /><br />This book, unfortunately, is a must for the Oracle DBAs. Do not believe you know RMAN unless you read this book. Actually, do not believe you know RMAN unless you RMAD.<br /><br />There are 12 disaster case scenarios and their solutions in the book, which are quite helpful. Plus, there are around 12 workouts which explains the basic intricacies of RMAND commands.	2005-01-28

The information in this book is nothing new. Yet, I found it even more boring than other books in its genre. For example, the author outlines NINE steps to making a decision.<br /><br />1)Identify your Objective<br />2)Do Preliminary survey of your options<br />3)Identify the implicated values<br />4)Assess the importance of the decision<br />5)budget your time and energy<br />6)Choose decision making strategy<br />7)Identify your options<br />8)Evaluate your options<br />9)Make your choice on time and budget<br /><br />If you follow the author's nine steps to  making decisions, then you are an idiot or an intellectual masochist. For example, if I walk into a donut shop and want to make a decision on which donuts to buy I must 1)realize that I want donuts to end my hunger 2)check out all 60 different donuts in the shop 3)realize donuts costs money 4)calculate how important it is to buy the right donut 5)realize you shouldn't take too much time to choose a donut because it just isn't worth it to ponder this in your head for too long and, besides, the other customers are yelling at you to make your choice by now 6)choose a strategy to choose the right donut while ignoring the donut shop manager's death stare 7)ask yourself if you want twinkies instead of donuts 8)donut vs twinkies? hmm I wonder which one is better? 9)ok I want the French Cruellers which costs a whopping 70 cents less than the good old twinkies!

So the book has lot of credibility. The content, however, was full of fluff.

I have a feeling it is even bigger mess than what appears in the book. After all, who would let 6 billion people know about all the trash that went on in her life? Having said this, there are plenty of trash in the book that makes you go woo and ahh over the details of her sex life and the porn industry. If you like National Enquirer, you will love this book.

The author goes to great lengths to explain only the rudimentry. For example, the author explains around 12 useful commands for the beginners and ignores the rest. Of course, there are far more commands to learn to be truly competent with Linux.<br /><br />If you already know how to install and configure Linux, stay away from this book. On the other hand, if you just learned how to spell Linux, then this book is a good place to start. Just remember to buy an another more advanced reference to raise your understanding.<br /><br />My only gripe about this book is that the author lacks strong understanding of Windows but criticizes it nonetheless. For example, the author claims that when a Windows GUI crashes, the entire OS crashes with it. This WAS true....about ten years ago.	2004-11-27

Most of the information in this book can be obtained either through the metalink or other websites.<br /><br />The book is good if you would like to expand your knowledge of RAC.

If you have examined your life and asked the difficult questions, then this book will not be an epiphany as it is to so many people. To me, this a was a basic \\"what is the meaning of life\\" book. I didn't find the story to be particularly interesting or unique. What I found interesting was the character growth of Mitch Albom who was an idealist brought down to earth by the harsh realities of life but finds his idealism again through Morrie.<br /><br />Overall, I think the book is a worthwhile read.

Unfortunately, we often bungle these crucial conversations precisely because these conversations are important and emotionally charged. Our own bodily functions and emotions block our own ability to rationally and calmly analyze the situation and speak in the language and tone required to resolve delicate and complex situations.<br /><br />The main problem with the book is its explaination on how to master these crucial conversations. The author writes 150 pages worth of conversational techniques. From my experience, communication is not a technique, but a blend of one's experience, emotion, intellect, physicality (body language and voice), and genetic disposition. Although everyone can improve their communication skills, I believe reading about few steps in a book is hardly effective or worthwhile.<br /><br />Instead, I think the author should have focused on the crux of his methdology. That is, mastering crucial conversations involves controlling one's emotions (emotional intelligence) in a way that one does not lose emotional equilibrium despite one's almost irresisitble desire to do so in critical situations.<br /><br />But I have a feeling the book would have been less than 100 pages if the author had chosen such route. And such a short, albeit more effective, book does not make for best sellers.	2004-10-18

Practically every advice written in this book is backed up by some empiracal evidence or study. The book covers all aspects of communication such as listening, body language, and influencing others using operant conditioning.<br /><br />One should note that this book focuses improving relationships through better communication.  Hence, this book is not suitable for situations where antagonistic and competitive communication styles are warranted. For example, I thought the chapter on negotiation was poor due to the fact that the book promotes a \\"nice guy who will listen\\" approach to negotiation. Such approach to negotiation with no competitive strategic objective will spell disaster against a well seasoned negotiation sharks in a professional environment.<br /><br />Overall, the book offers solid scientifically based advice on personal communication.

The economy and the stock market will boom from now until around 2010. Then they will falter badly from 2010-2025 with 15%+ unemployement, deflation, bad housing market, and massive social problems. His advice is simple, invest heavily into the stock market until 2009 and bail. Homeowners should also sell their homes around 2009 and rent until 2013 when the housing prices should bottom. Business owners should also sell their high flying businesses around 2009.<br /><br />Harry Dent's economic model has proven to be accurate. Although he tries to incorporate other statistical methdologies to backup his forecasts, Harry's main tool is still his demographical analysis. Based on the fact that spending patterns differ considerably based on age, Harry has done a great job of charting the future based on economic impact of domestic consumption based on demographical changes.<br /><br />Here are what I thought were the flaws:<br /><br />1)Harry makes little attempt to counter his own arguments. For example, Harry does not fully address the impact of the current 3%+ productivity growth. Also, the impact of the rise  and the changes in the use of IT is not addressed fully. Harry dismisses these two trends as a mere side effects of demographics and technological progress. He apparently believes neither will change the outcome of the demographic economic cycle.<br /><br />2)Harry does not fully address the impact of exports. Harry fully acknowledges that domestic consumption in Asia and South America will continue to increase well into 2020. Can the rise of US exports to these regions offset the lack of domestic consumption from 2010-2025? Harry doesn't make this clear.	2004-10-14

Dell repeatedly sites three things for his company's success 1)execution and 2)having the right people 3)selling direct.

So this book adds little value in terms of historical importance. Given this, I put higher emphasis on the readabilty and the entertainment value of the book. Although not badly written, I felt the writing could have been more salacious. It is written somewhat like a college history textbook. More than a few times, I put this book down and fell asleep.  Very few lives have been as remarkable and as interesting as Napoleon's. This book is a classic case in which the author fails to emphasize on the interesting aspects of his life (his rise, historical significance, brilliance, lovers, marriage life, and how people worshipped him etc).

Here are my thoughts.<br />1)This book is definitely not for the beginners. I highly recommend you start with a more basic book that gives you an overview of Oracle. Oracle tools are highly unintuitive and using them can be a frustrating experience especially for MS SQL DBAs *smirk*. Learning to just to connect to an Oracle database is a learning experience that will take knowledge on how Oracle's network and security function.<br />2)If you already have a working knowledge on how to operate an Oracle database, this book will no doubt provide a more solid foundation for your knowledge (except RAC). I particularly found its chapters on RMAN and IMPORT/EXPORT utilties particularly helpful.<br />3)Perhaps the best part of this book is that it encompasses what the author believes is the most essential knowledge to becoming a highly competent Oracle DBA. The book does not try to be a reference for every Oracle topic. Instead, the author has smartly picked the most important information needed and presented them in a readable format.<br />4)My only issue with this book is that it is wordy.

From the quality of the information in this book, the author certainly seems to understand mortgage. Yet, the street-wise tone of the author actually curbs his own credibility. He uses phrases such as &quot;Avoid the bang of a bursting balloon&quot;,&quot;How to borrow jumbo amounts without paying jumbo rates&quot;, and &quot;[author] simplifies complicated math...[and] make sure your loan rep is being honest with you&quot;. Such lingo belongs in an infomercial. Beyond his own hoopla, the book does contain valuable information. Just don't buy into his own hype.	2004-06-23

I thought the first 40 pages were very thought provoking. The rest seems to be fillers. If you already know and understand what BATNA is, then don't bother buying this book. The the book's explanation of BATNA and its importance in all negotiation is worth its price and your time.	2004-06-23

The book deals with mortgage, realtors, home inspection, price negotiation, and closing. Unless you are a real estate professional, you will learn plenty from this book. It also helps the author is a very fluid writer and her explainations are precise and easy to understand.<br />My only gripe is despite its 500 pages, the book is too short! The last 150 pages are spent on appendix and the book has a large print. Yes, the book is concise but at the expense of being more comprehensive. But I am being picky here, you will not regret picking this book over others in the market.	2004-06-04

This book is geared towards the first time home buyer who can't tell the difference between a mortgage from a smorgage. Although it won't make you an expert, it will provide a comprehensive understanding of every aspect of obtaining a mortgage. I particularly found the section on garbage fees very helpful. It has shaved off hundreds of dollars from my closing fees, and that alone was worth the price and the time invested in reading this book.	2004-06-04

Instead, it is about what it is like to be an Army Ranger. I would say 15% of the book is dedicated to the subject of leadership in the Rangers.<br />The book hits not so much at the intellectual level, but at the emotions. It does a fine job of describing the ATTITUDE of Ranger leadership. Perhaps it is implying that leadership is mostly about winning attitude.<br />The book holds the reader with its tales of harsh training every Ranger must suffer. Its training is specifcially designed to push every Ranger to their physical and psychological limits, resulting in what appears to be a near death experience to most Rangers. I found it intriguing that Rangers lose sexual appetite during their brutal training because all they can think about is their basic survival (warmth, food, shelter, and overcoming pain) while successfully accomplishing their mission.	2004-05-13

All the rudimentry concepts are explained in detail. The practice problems are marvelous. The author, unlike most programming authors, clearly understands the paramount importance of writing practice programs to learn a new computer language.<br />If you want to have a heavy duty understanding of ADO, ASP, and OOP, then this book will come up short.

But its valuable knowledge far exceeds its price. There is a reason why this book is used for mandatory leadership curriculum at West Point and virtually all military leadership training schools. It teaches soldier to 1)Be of strong ethical and moral character (loyalty, integrity, discipline) 2)Know valuable skills and knowledge (technical and personal) 3)Do utilize the leadership skills to make a difference.<br />There is a best selling book &quot;Be, Know, Do&quot; which relies heavily from this book as a source. I recommend buying this book instead because it is much cheaper and contains virtually all the information contained in that one.<br />I wish this book was thicker with even more useful information. The book could have expounded far more in detail, especially things related to interpersonal skills (communication and motivation). I know there is a wealth of psychological  research on the subject of leadership which the book could have used for further enlightenment. But the book limits its focus only on its history and military leaders as a source.<br />Leadership is a deep and complex subject because it requires one to deeply understand oneself and the others. This book provides a solid basis.	2004-05-03

He is a medical doctor with excellent imagination and reasonining ability. I was almost stunned by his ability to intuitively and logically link disparate aspects of human society (grandmothers, early menopause, and circumcision for one). I think his conclusion SEEMS unscientific because the author relies heavily on footnotes at the end of the book to validate his claims.<br />If you are curious as to why:<br />1)Marriages exist<br />2)Male\Female sexual peak differs considerably<br />3)Menstration is so evident and regular (29.5 days)<br />4)We became meat eating hunters<br />5)Boys are circumsized<br />6)Menopause occurs<br />7)Homosexuals exist<br />8)Human courtship is so complex<br />then read this book.

Despite its dimunitive size and exborbitant price, this book is worth a purchase.<br />The book gives leadership knowledge derived from the academia, the battlefield, and fine examples. Its values comes from its simplicity.<br />1)Be: Leadership is about character. It is not a pretense. Honesty, discipline, and duty are paramount for a leader.<br />2)Know: Every leader must be knowledgeable not only about their job, but everyday things. Since knowledge enables, a leader must be highly knowledgeable.<br />3)Do: Leader must put their skills to a good use.<br />Why only 4 stars? The book assumes the Army is the perfect organization. It is good to have strong sense of pride in your organization, but pretending your organization flawless is somewhat antithesis of good leadership.	2004-04-15

In other words, there is zero scientific basis.  Having said this, this is a fun and very intriguing book to read. I don't think I have read anything like it. The author is apparently very well read and brings forth the best theories on seduction from hundreds of literary sources and biographies. You can say this is the Bible of the literary view on seduction. I would rank this book with &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; in the common sense knowledge of people skills. This book is destined to become a classic.	2004-03-21

Books	4	3	8	N	Y	Pioneering journalist with a pioneering view	John Stossel will someday be recognized for this audacity to take on the government, the media, and the powerful to bring us the truth, which is far more elusive than it seems. I particularly like his take on the media's obsession with FEAR and how it impacts our thoughts and behaviors to a point of paranoia. I loved his lawyer bashing and the revelation of how our legal system really works. This man is not afraid to stand up for what is truthful, even at the expense of making many enemies, purported even within his own news organization. He loves to cut through the bull and bring you to the real motivations and dealings of some of the most crooked people and schemes devised (most of them legal AND from our own government).<br />My main qualm with this book is he is not totally objecive. The man is a self proclaimed and an obvious libertarian. I wish he had been little more balanced in his views.	2004-02-24

The book gives reasonable explaination of how one can enhance his\her personal brand, but most of the details are missing. The most insightful part is that one's corporate career is decided by one's personal brand, and it isn't always related to one's competency, but how people talk of your personal characteristics and skills in two sentences or less. Yes, your corporate success is mainly decided by how people talk and think of you in couple of sentences.<br />I think the author is way too smart to give ALL his secrets away. After all, he is still the CEO of a major insurance\financial corporation. But I think what he reveals is worth the books's price.	2004-02-24

Most of the insights are rudimentary and its &quot;best practices&quot; are common sense to most experienced SQL DBAs. If you are an experienced SQL DBA, I would recommend this book for only two reasons:<br />1)You want to obtain some stored procedures as a DBA utility. If you are already a good T-SQL programmer, this will bring you limited value.<br />2)You want to have a good understanding of SQL Clustering and Log shipping. The book does better job than most in describing both SQL clustering and Log shipping. But the explanation is very general and more architectural than explaining how to implement and manage one.	2004-01-23

The practice problems are well thought out and are useful to understand C#. Also, most of the elementary topics are covered. So this is a great first book to learn C#. On the downside, the author's writing style is wordy. Finally, the author does a poor job of explaining WHEN to use certain features of C#. The benefits of using one approach over another is not apparent to the beginners. For example, I wish the author had spent some time explaining  when to use inheritenance and polymorphism, especially when one can write perfectly decent C# code without them.	2004-01-23

This is not a book for the beginners but for those who seek more than superficial understanding of SQL. Nor is this book for those who seek comprehensive knowledge of SQL because it addresses mostly SQL architecture. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book both for the DBA and the Developers alike.<br />My main qualm with this book is it seems to be hastily written. It reads almost like a late night term paper. This is not to say the information is inaccurate, but the writing of this book is second rate and the author's lack of enthusiasm for explaining the finer points is evident.	2004-01-23

This book was written as a joke. For example, it gives advice on how to survive attacks by crocks and sharks. It says you should pounce on the nose of crocks and irritate the gills of sharks to free yourself. Now that is funny. It is funnier to see how some of the reviewers of this book think it will actually work!

She seems like a preeminent authority in the field and her book shows it. Virtually every viewpoint is backed up by scientific research or strong rationale. Although few would agree with every single point of this book, even fewer would argue that author's opinions have no basis in fact or science.<br />My only dissatisfaction with the book stems from the fact that the author provides dearth of advice or suggestions on how we should adapt our thoughts and behaviors based on the knowledge. In other words, this is NOT a self help book. Rather it is more like a PhD thesis on the evolution of the human sexuality, but of a high quality.	2003-11-29

The authors apparently do not believe in writing fillers to sell a thicker book for a higher price.<br />3)The scientific approach to dealing with different management types is refreshing.

It isn't, however, so great if you already have good exposure and understanding of Windows 2000\2003 clustering and want information on cutting edge technical knowledge and troubleshooting. Furthermore, the author's writings of Windows 2003 clustering is based on its Release Candidate version. Many of the best refinements of Windows 2003 clustering (like automatic the rebuild of the quorum log if it is deleted) isn't discussed. Taking into account of the dearth of Windows 2000\2003 clustering books out there, this is one of the best.	2003-11-16

The subtitle of this book is &quot;Too many jobs too few people&quot;. Due to the demographics (which is impossible to alter in a short period), it is certain we will have too few people in the work force by 2010. The question is will there be too many jobs by 2010? Even the author concedes it is impossible to forecast the economy in the next 5 years, let alone the next 10. Hence, the author's conclusion of pending doom of massive skilled worker shortage by 2010 is speculative.<br />In fact, many prominent economists will argue that the economy will falter BADLY after 2010 because the consumer spending will drop like a rock due to the aging population (people over 55 spend considerably less). The actual scenario might be &quot;too few jobs too many people&quot;.<br />Finally, the reliability of author's statistics are somewhat questionable (they are from the government after all). For example, according to the author, there are more than 3 million jobs right now than the number of people to fill them. In reality, however, the job market has been the toughest it has been in years, and many people are being laid off without work for over 6 months or more. When statistics conflict with reality, then ALWAYS trust the reality.	2003-11-02

If you want to become something better, than I strongly suggest you buy and master &quot;SQL 2000 Unleashed&quot; and &quot;Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Performance Optimization and Tuning&quot;.	2003-10-31

Yes, it does cover lot of basic concepts, but they are tuned for those who already have a fundamental understanding of C#, Java, or C++ (all related to C). What separates this book from others is its practice problems. The best way to learn programming is to practice, and this book provides enough practice problems to really enhance one's understanding of C#. Highly recommmended for intermediate level C# developers.	2003-10-31

This is, of course, a pocket guide and, hence, a forgivable flaw. If you understand Windows 2000 really well, then this book will hardly provide anything new, except for obviously new features such as disk shadowing. If you want to truly understand Windows 2003, then I suggest other books. This book is only for those who seek superficial and minimal understanding of Windows 2003. One note, I highly recommend this book for those who are looking for their first book on Windows 2000\2003 as it will provide a good introduction.	2003-10-31

For example, companies like Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, and GE does not qualify as being &quot;Great&quot; in the author's opinion. If you can agree with that, then this book is GREAT!, but if you think the author is little flawed in leaving out the most profitable and fastest growing companies from his list of &quot;Great&quot; companies, then this book is merely Good.	2003-10-31

The author successfully makes a convincing, although less than airtight, argument that there is a housing bubble, and it will burst while dragging the economy with it. If you want to understand the relationship between housing prices, financial markets, and the economy, then this is a great book to read. If you want find a balanced view of the future housing market trends, then this book is less than satisfying.	2003-10-29

As a person who has read around 10 books on leadership, I am beggining to realize the topic is far more complex to be contained in a single book. This book addresses on aspect of leadership, change managment, better than any book I have read. As the book points out, leadership is about change (which is too categoric for me to totally agree). A good leader brings change only at a rate which the stakeholders of the change can absorb it, and failure to do so will result in the ousting of the leader. This simple concept was quite revealing to me and deserving of the price of this book.	2003-10-29

This is your Concise Reference Guide to Understanding Why and How Best to Survive It	Books	3	154	212	N	Y	The sky is falling! The sky is falling!	This book is a fascinating read and I recommend it. But I can't help but think the author is acting like Chicken Little. First off, the author does NOT have an Economics background. Having said this, many prominent economists would agree with his conclusion that a great economic downturn will occur around 2011 after a great boom. The crux of the author's argument is that the consumer spending of 45-54 year olds drive the economy. In fact, there is a strong correleation between the the number of 45-54 yr olds in the demographics and the Dow Jones. By 2011, as the number of 45-54 yr olds decline, so will the Dow Jones. The author fails, however, to point out the correlation between the Dow Jones and economic indicators such as unemployment, productivity, and GDP. This is a huge missing link to his argument. There are other factors which the author does not address, such as technological growth that is driving up the productivity. The fact that the Great Depression was caused by, not only the demographics, but wildly unregulated financial system is totally ommitted.	2003-10-21

But something about Jack's philosophy of management has really struck me as being contrary. How can the management NOT manage through intimidation and fear when the CEO REQUIRES them to cut 10% of their staff EVERY year?<br />Everyone who has ever been involved with corporate politics know that such conflicting objective is highly unlikely if not impossible to obtain. Wouldn't YOU fear the management and feel initmidated when you KNOW the mangement must cut or replace 10% of their staff every year? Such style of management is using intimidation and fear to bring out the results from people, pure and simple. For Jack Welch to deny this is being disingenuous and or he is &quot;kidding himself&quot; (which is something he preaches one should never do).	2002-01-03

It is obvious the publisher (Osborne) demanded the author to write a 500 page book in order to justify the exorbitant cost of this book.<br />The real information on backup and recovery does not start until page 331!!!!! The author is a good writer and obviously had lot of IT experience. He does his best to make the book as informative as possible. But it is apparent that backup and recovery information is not worth 500 pages of text.<br />I think the book could have been salvaged quite well if the last chapter on case studies of backup and recovery scenario was better written, but this is where the author REALLY bombed. His recovery steps can all be summarized as recovering the full, then incremental, then transaction logs. Anyone who knows ANYTHING about SQL recovery knows THAT.	2001-08-23

Its title &quot;admin 911&quot; with flashing red siren indicates its purpose is for providing emergency repair and restoration information of DNS and WINS. I would say around 10 pages of the ENTIRE 375 page book is dedicated for this subject.<br />Cutting edge methdology for repairing DNS and WINS are not mentioned at all. The book should have contained case studies and scenarios on how DNS and WINS can be best fixed. Instead, the author talks about what DNS and WINS is and how it functions.<br />If you want to know what DNS and WINS are, then this is not a bad book to get. But if you want to understand and write scripts for disaster recovery of DNS and WINS, look elsewhere.	2001-08-23

The author is not a bad writer, he is just too subtle. Unfortunately, such writing style is not the best for emphasizing important ideas.<br />The funny thing about this book is that it APPEARS useless when it is jampacked with extremely useful information. Even though I read this book 7 months ago, I did not appreciate this book until recently when I had to put together a Windows 2000 DNS environment. It is highly informative will teach you some advance DNS topics. It has a surprisingly good chapter on security as well. Although this will NOT be the only DNS book I would buy, it certainly explains many aspects of Windows 2000 DNS better than any book I have read, and I own total of 4 DNS books.<br />I particularly liked the author's explaination of Active Directory Integrated DNS and DHCP + DDNS interaction.	2001-08-18

The author does not waste paper with wordy sentences that is only meant to take up space to create a 1500+ book to justify a  price.<br />The author explains three things in depth and better than any books I have ever read (and I have read lot of SQL books): Index optimization, query optimization, and locking.<br />These three topics are usually for advanced SQL developers who must performance tune a complex database. This book is not for the beginners. Having said this, if you want to be a serious database developer, this book will put you ahead of your competition. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be or is a database developer.	2001-08-01

The author does a great job of packing a LOT of useful information into 600 pages. I particularly like his lab exercises, which are very well designed.
