This book is part history, part theological argumen in favor of women's ordination.  Therefore, I will critique each aspect.<br /><br />I found Todd's treatment of the LCMS interesting and well-written yet lacking in professional integrity.  While her facts and dates are correct, her frequent editorial analysis of persons and events alerts the reader to an abnormal amount of \\"spin.\\"  Throughout the historical sections, Todd employs left-handed compliments and ad hominum attacks on certain figures, while treating others very sympathetically.  For example, CFW Walther consistantly characterized as a Stephan-flunkie who talks big but lacks clear judgment; J.A.O Preus was a manipulative politician who refused to listen to sound reason.  Meanwhile, those who challenge authority, Scripture, or advance the cause of women are--like Russell Prohl and the Seminary's \\"most moderate\\" (228) professors--sympathetic characters.<br /><br />Furthermore, Todd's presentation of the various doctrinal arguments is weak.  When she presents a view she agrees with (against Scriptural inerrancy, for women's ordination, etc.), she either presents them as self-evident or relies on brief references to \\"the Gospel\\" or socio-cultural equality.  While she uses much ink to present opposing arguments, she focuses more on the arguments' political impact and never really treats them seriously.  It never seems to occur to her that people might actually believe that an inerrant Bible prohibits women's ordination and that these people take this belief seriously.  In all, the author is too emotionally invested in the subject matter for a reader to trust her historical analysis.<br /><br />As a theologian, Todd fares much worse.  Her theology is one based on a subjective reading of the Bible as opposed to a belief that theology is objective--not coming from within a person or culture, but from an unchanging God.  As such, Todd is guilty of doing the very thing she accuses others of doing:  beginning with a theological idea (women should be ordained), then creating a theological method that supports this idea.  Her \\"support\\" ranges from insightful critiques of LCMS doctrine (e.g. an evolving theology of the ministry) to down-right silly arguments (e.g. implying that Martin Luther and CFW Walther never really believed in Scriptural inerrancy or a male-only priesthood).  Most distrubing are her positions that Scripture is neither fixed nor inerrant (allowing whatever a particular reader wants it to say); that amorphous words like culture should dictate theology and practice; that the Gospel has destroyed ALL worldly differences between everyone; and that one should be ordained if he/she \\"feels a call\\" regardless of personal qualifications as specified by Scripture (inerrant or otherwise).<br /><br />In all, I cannot recommend \\"Authority Vested.\\"  While I am willing to hear arguments on the role of women in the Church, the Ministry, and authority, I am not willing to hear such arguments from authors who subscribe to an \\"ends justify the means\\" approach.  Todd sacrifices the doctrine of Scriptural inerrancy, the reputations of fellow Church members, and sound argument because she believes her end is just.  I disagree and cannot recommend this book.ing from within a person or culture, but from an unchanging God.

He joined a monestary and excelled in his studies, dedication to the Christian faith, and in politics, so that he rose through the ranks and was appointed to run a monestary at Nogent, France.  Paul Archambault, the translator and editor, is a professor of French at Syracuse University.<br /><br />Guibert's \\"Confessions\\" is divided into three parts. In the first part, he tells the story of his life--the low character of his father, the goodness and saintliness of his mother, a harsh education under a beloved tutor, the hedonistic lifestyle he lead after his tutor left to join the monestary, his own decision to join the monestary, his work as a monk, and his eventual election to run the Monestary at Nogent.  Part one ends with several stories of divine punishment (through lightning, etc.) of sinful monks.<br /><br />The second part of the book is the shortest and concerns itself with the history of the Monestary at Nogent.  Like the previous division, this section ends with anecdotes concerning divine punishment for sinners.<br /><br />The third division of the book is a lengthy account of the Laon serf's revolt from Guibert himself, a man who lived in the area and was personally aquainted with the principals of this revolt.  He gives first-hand testimony of and second-hand accounts of the characters involved in this revolt including Enguerrand de Boves, Saint Anselm, Biship Gaudry, and Gerard de Quiezry.  He knows the political intrigues, who hates/is allied with who, and the secret motivations of powerful persons.  It makes for an interesting historical read.  Guibert follows his established pattern as he finishes this book citing examples of divine judgment for various sins.<br /><br />Guibert of Nogent's book is an important contribution to both French political history in the 1000s and 1100s as well as ecclesiastical history.  Guibert gives important details about French politics (including the role of bribery) and the mechanics of revolutionary riots.  This book is also useful for one who wants to grow in their knowledge of the Church.  Guibert shows how one might join a monestary, what monks actually did, how they rise in influence, and how that influence might be wielded.  Most intersting of all, the reader can see the degree to which church politics influences state politics and vice versa.<br /><br />Paul Archambault has translated this book from its original Latin.  I'm not in a position to critique the accuracy of his translation, but since the previous (1970) edition contained many archaic words (thou, thee), this readable translation is appreciated.  Archambault's footnotes (which give brief biographies of people Guibert mentions, defends difficult translations, cites Bible references, and gives other general information) was very helpful to this reader.  His 40-page introduction clued this reader into themes, set the historical scene, and gave a personality sketch of Guibert of Nogent himself.<br /><br />In all, this is a recommended book for those interested in this period of European or Ecclesiastical history.details about French politics (including the role of bribery) and the mechanics of revolutionary riots.

This book is a reworking of his doctoral dissertation.  As such, \\"The Word in the Desert,\\" is extremely throrough, scholarly, and keeps the central thesis in mind throughout.<br /><br />Burton-Christie's purpose in writing is to examine \\"how the use and interpretation of Scripture shaped the quest for holiness amongst the desert monks of early Christianity (4).\\"  But before he begins examining the role of Scripture and Sprituality, he devotes significant space to the formation of and life in early monastic communities (and why not? This is a doctoral dissertation).  While this section was interesting and provided some necessary foundations, this section was the most frustrating to read as I was anxious for Burton-Christie to actually get into the meat of his thesis.<br /><br />Once the backgound of monstacism was firmly in place, Burton-Christie moved into monstic ideals of the Holy Life and the role Scriputre played in this life.  The interplay between these two ideas made for an informative and enjoyable read.  The illustrations were excellent and made the weighty subject matter entertaining.  As a result of reading this book, my knowledge of and respect for the monastic lifestyle has grown.<br /><br />I would recommend this book, but those who have had some historical and/or theoligical training would benefit most from reading it.	2005-09-20

His experience and research have prepared him well for this book:  a detailed summary of the Tabernacle, its furniture and building materials, the functions they had for the ancient Israelites, and how they point to Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Zehr is methodoligical and thorough in this book.  He succeeds in his goal of neither focusing on the Tabernacle's Old Testament usage to the exlusion of Christ nor does he focus on Christ to the exclusion of the Israelite usage.  While he does go into some detail about the Tabernacle, its construction, and Israelite worship practices, he does not allow himself to get bogged down in the details and lose the forest for the trees.  Instead, in an engaging writing style, he always returns to major theological themes and Christology.<br /><br />While this reviewer does tend to disagree with some aspects of his analysis (an avoidance of Baptism when covering the Laver; an avoidance of Communion when covering the Table which is always supplied with bread and wine, an awkward diatribe against infant baptism, etc.), these drawbacks do not greatly detract from a fantastic book.  \\"God Dwells With His People\\" significantly enhanced my understaing of the Tabernacle, helped me to understand its relevance for Christians today, and provided excellent analysis (and pictures) of the various aspects of this ancient institution.	2005-09-09

In this 16-chapter book of the Bible, Paul addresses many topics that still concern the church today.  Within this letter, Paul writes about Holy Communion, the Resurrection of the Dead on the Last Day, the role of women in the church, the individual Christian's relationship with believers in other faiths, and homosexuality--just to name a few.  Any one of these topics would be a daunting task to cover in a book, let alone all of them.<br /><br />However, Gregory Lockwood--missionary to the indiginious people of Papua New Guinea for 17 years, professor at Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana for 10 years, and currently the pastor of Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Bendigo, Victoria, Australia--treats all of these topics masterfully in this thorough commentary.  Lockwood is a Christ-centered sacramentalist who believes in the inerrancy of Scripture and this is evident throughout this well-written commentary<br /><br />As Lockwood covers the major controversial issues above mentioned, two major themes shine through:  (1) he shows the reader the relationship between the individual believer and the Church and the relationship between the Church and Christ.  (2)  He shows that spiritual gifts and Gospel freedom are intended not to puff up the individual, but to build up and edify the church.  With these themes in mind, Lockwood uses sound scholarly exegesis and pastoral care and concern to advance the orthodox, Lutheran understanding of these issues.  While normally gentle and loving in his prose, he can also be tough at certain parts.<br /><br />While this enteire commentary has been a pleasure to read and has tremendously aided in my understanding of 1 Corinthians, one of the most enjoyable parts of this book is when Lockwood is able to connect a portion of this letter with the emerging Christianity of the people of Papua New Guinea.  Coming from a polythiestic, male-dominated faith tradition (like the Corinthians), Lockwood is able to make fascinating parallels between Paul's words and how they have transformed the people of Papua New Guinea.  Indeed, this reader thirsts for a fuller treatment of Lockwoods work among these people.<br /><br />This commentary is highly recommended--it stands with Louis Brighton's commentary on Revelation and Leon Morris' commentary on John as the best I've read.New Guinea.

In this volume, he takes a unique look at the Biblical book of Job--creating not a verse by verse exegetical commentary, but rather shares his thoughts and insights as a pastoral counselor.<br /><br />This treatment of Job as a Counseling Verbatum proved to be very helpful and enjoyable to this reader.  As one trained both in theolgoy and counseling, Hulme displayed practical, on-target commentary in both areas.<br /><br />Hulme takes the reader through the book of Job and introduces us to Job's original state of mind.  Then he examines each of Job's counselors (Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and Elihu), and critiques their counseling style and subsequent results.  He points out helpful counseling techniques (and how to apply them in a modern context), shows the reader what is counterproductive (and how to avoid them in a modern context), and explains possible motivations for the comments of all the men involved in the story.<br /><br />This book will certainly not replace a pastorl counseling textbook nor will it replace an exegetical commentary on Job, but it is a welcome addition to each one.  It leaves this reader with feelings of empowerment should I have to counsel a suffering brother or sister in Christ.  It also influences my reading of the book of Job as I have a more complete understanding of the inter and intra personal dynamics at play within the story.  This book will remain on my bookshelf.  Recommended.	2005-07-30

In this reader's opinion, Bauckham's treatment of Jude is supurb, but his treatment of 2 Peter suffers because of his belief that it is pseudepigriphal (written by an anonymous author who is pretending to be St. Peter).<br /><br />I was entranced by the first part of this book--the commentary on Jude.  Bauckham greatly improved my understanding--not just of the theological elements of this work--but of St. Jude himself and the earliest days of the church in general.  Through an analysis of the gramar and vocabulary of Jude and through examining points of contact with other ancient works, one is able to gain a respect for both Jude's high degree of education as well as his knowledge of practical theological matters.  I was impressed with how relevant the message of Jude is to modern readers.<br /><br />The second section, on 2 Peter, is explored as thoroughly as Jude, but was not as enjoyable a read because of my own disagreement with Bauckham's assumptions.  As previously stated, Bauckham believes that 2 Peter was not actually written by the Apostle Peter, but rather by one of his friends/students/etc.  Bauckham makes his case for this in the introduction, but is very unconvincing as he argues that 2 Peter is a hybrid piece, combining an epistle with a fictional first-person summary of his teachings.  Too much in the letter conflicts with Bauckham's view and this reader percieves some of his arguments as theological acrobatics.<br /><br />Even still, Bauckham's analysis of the content of 2 Peter is excellent.  He convincingly shows the heretical arguments of Peter's opponents; he shows the unity of the letter; and points out where Peter's eschatological arguments are a continuation of both Jewish and early (earliest) Christian end-times doctrines.  It is a convincing and practical work.<br /><br />In all, this fairly conservative treatment of these two Biblical books is recommended--especially to those Christians who have neglected these underrated additions to the canon.onents; he shows the unity of the letter; and points out where Peter's eschatological arguments are a continuation of both Jewish and early (earliest) Christian end-times doctrines.

Durham is a professor of Hebrew and Old Testament at Southeastern Baptist Seminary in North Carolina and the author of many scholarly works on Old Testament studies, including this volume in the Word Biblical Commentary Series.<br /><br />Of the Volumes in the Word Commentary that I've read or consulted, Durham's treatment of Exodus ranks among the best.  One of Durham's greatest joys in preparing this commentary is the fact that he is required to make his own translation of the Hebrew text.  His skill and enjoyment in this area certainly shine through as he jumps from wooden translations, to phrases that capture the spirit of the Hebrew (as opposed to the literal translation), with all his translation decisions explained in his translation notes.  I learned more about Exodus than I expected from reading the translation and notes!<br /><br />As for the commentary proper, I am pleased to find that John Durham is easily one of the most readable contributors in the Word Series--he seems to know when a point needs more explanation and when he's \\"beaten a dead horse.\\"  I was also pleased to find that Durham, a respected scholar in an academic setting, was able to briefly cover \\"Ivory Tower\\" theories about certain portions of text, but then have the wisdom to put such theories in their proper place.  He often mentions an academic controversy or debate, but then does a great service to the reader by putting the debated portion of Scripture in its proper theological context.<br /><br />This last point is perhaps the most valuable aspect of this commentary--the author never forgets the major theological themes and points in the book of Exodus.  Whether the text is about Ten Plagues, Ten Commandments, Tabernacle Furniture, or rebellious Israelites, Durham always puts these portions of Scripture in context--theological and historical.  He is one of a shrinking number of Old Testament authors that actually has respect for the textus receptus.<br /><br />While this commentary has many strengths, it also has some disappointing weaknesses.  The first among these is the absense of any New Testament applications.  Durham begins by pointing out that Exodus is the third most quoted OT book in the New Testament (running behind Psalms and Isaiah), yet does not make the connections between the Testaments.  Whether a portion of Scripture is quoted by Jesus, Paul, etc., or whether Messianic prophesies are apparent (Passover, the table in the Tabernacle, Moses' arms being supported in a crucifix position, etc.), Durham ignores it.<br /><br />A second disappointed aspect of Durham's commentary is the amount of respect and credit (and space) he gives to source-criticism and \\"later editors\\" theories.  At many points, it is very difficult to tell if Durham actually BELIEVES that some of the events recorded in Exodus actually happened.  He clearly does not believe that Moses wrote the book, but he does believe that the Lord descended onto Mount Sinai, but he's not sure if the Tabernacle and furniture actually existed.  It often seems as if Durham deliberately avoids taking a position on historical reliability and the like.  If, in the Introduction, he stated that he is simply giving an overview of others' ideas (see Beasley-Murray's commentary on John), that would be one thing.  However, Durham makes no such claim and the reader is left wondring where the author's religious convictions lie.<br /><br />In all, this is a solid commentary on a difficult and diverse book of the Bible.

The second purpose is for those already involved in worship (planning or attending) would have their knowledge of and appreciation for hymns increase.  This reviewer falls into that latter category.<br /><br />I must first admit that I cannot read music, nor have I ever made a study of any sort of music.  However, I am familiar with the tunes of many of the hymns referenced simply because I've sung them many times.  I have found nearly every aspect of the book favorable--from the discussion of hymn lyrics as poetry to the examination of various historical and cultural traits of hymns to the use of hymns in modern churches.  As a result of this book, I feel more prepared to choose hymns for a worship service, move a congregation in a musical direction, and observe the future development of hymn writing and study.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for any church-goer who wants to develop a deeper understanding of congregational singing--from chants to \\"spiritual songs\\" to non-Western hymns--and especially their own congregational heritage.  I would also recommend it to those who have an interest in this unique branch of the arts.	2005-07-03

Both his expertise in exegetical theology and his expressive writing style easily make this the most readable text book this reader has come across.<br /><br />Franzmann treats all 27 New Testament books in the order in which he believes they were written, beginning with the Epislte of James and ending with the Book of Revelation.  For each book, he gives a throrough introduction to the state of the known world and especially the state of Christianity at that time (and place), he introduces the author, covers the main ideas and unique aspects of the Biblical book, and gives a outline.  These things prepare the student/reader for a meaningul reading of the Biblical text itself.<br /><br />After the outline of the Biblical book, Franzmann treats the more far-reaching aspects of the book.  He comments on the value of the Biblical book (how it has served the Church and Christians during the centuries) as well as the authenticity of the book (what problems both ancient and modern scholars have with the book).  As far as authenticity goes, Franzmann is clearly orthodox and conservative in his views.  He describes the \\"problems\\" scholars have with books like Second Peter, Jude, the Gospel of John, etc., but refutes nearly all arguments against authenticity.<br /><br />There are a few aspects of this thorough introduction to the New Testament that this reader believes deserves special mention.  Throughout the book, Franzmann displays a high respect for the activity of the Holy Spirit within the church--the Spirit which has directed the Church \\"into all truth,\\" and to recognize these 27 books as divinely inspired as opposed to other books of the era (such as the epistles of Clement, the Shepherd of Hermas, etc.).  Franzmann also displays a high regard for the scholarship of the ancient world.  For example, he proudly holds up the fact that the church has never doubted the idea that the apsotle Paul wrote Second Timothy until recent times and uses that fact as reason to continue to uphold Pauline authorship.  Finally, Franzmann covers a few aspect of modern scholarship which tend to confuse beginning theologians.  Among these are \\"homologoumena\\" and \\"antilegomena\\" issues; the process by which the New Testament came into existence in its current form; and \\"form criticism\\" just to name a few.<br /><br />In all, this book is highly recommended.

His career has been one of studying and advising the dynamics of disfunctional churches and counseling pastors who have been hurt by said churches.  \\"How Your Church Family Works\\" is an introduction to systems theory as it relates to interpersonal dynamics within a church and has been very helpful for this reader.<br /><br />Steinke begins by introducing the concept of systems--that every unit in a system effects and is effected by every other unit in that system.  He then covers how systems work--always seeking to remain stable, even if that stability harms most or all the people in that system.  He then moves into a discussion of forces that stabilize or change a system (anxiety, closeness, etc.).  Finally, after weaving theory and example to the point that the reader has a fuller understanding of systems theory, Steinke shows how individuals within a system can effect change for the better.<br /><br />The overriding theme in in \\"How Your Church Family Works\\" can be \\"knowledge is power.\\"  Steinke accurately describes the \\"tunnel vision,\\" the pressure to conform to others' idea of what your role in a system should be, and the tendency of people within a system to focus on other people in that system and blame them.  However, through understanding systems, the way they work, their flaws, and how to be an angent of change, one can make an ineffecient, stifling system a productive, nurturing system.  They key is knowledge and \\"big picture\\" thinking, and defining one's self.<br /><br />In all, this book has been incredibly helpful as I continue to reflect upon my experiences at a church with a dangerously crushing emotional system.

Beasley-Murray frequently treats a contriversial portion of the text by explaining (in a sympathetic style) several differing scholars points-of-view on the text only to (in fairly unsympathetic terms) criticize the weaknesses in said scholarly opinions.  This reader found Beasley-Murray's writing style confusing in this respect.<br /><br />I also hold a different exegetical opinion than Beasely-Murray on some key points--the most notable of which is our differing opinions on the author of John and the identity of the \\"Beloved Disciple.\\"  While this reviewer holds to the traditional orthodox view that the Gospel's author and Beloved Disciple are one and the same--John (son of Zebedee and disciple of Christ), Beasley-Murray holds that the two individuals are different people and that neither is the above-mentioned John.  It is clear that such an opinion colors what is otherwise a pretty orthodox and conservative commenary.<br /><br />This volume of the Word Commentary Series does have some excellent points which deserve commendation.  Beasley-Murray, gives a fair and thorough treatment to sections of John that the church has traditionally held to have references to the sacraments (Chapter 6, water and blood flowing from Jesus' side, the meal of fish and bread in John 21, etc.).  Many other commentators give the sacramentarian view cursory treatment, but Beasley-Murray gives the view respect.  In all, Beasley-Murray makes a practice of treating the text and other scholars very thoroughly and respectfully.  For the most part, it was an enjoyable commentary to read.<br /><br />One final negative comment on this volume--one that has to do more with the editor:  an extrordinarily frustrating aspect of this book's type-set was the fact that the normally small, closely spaced font was often reduced significantly in size for no apparent reason.  While it appeared as if certain paragraphs (or pages) were offset as if to indicate an extended quote, there actually was neither a quote nor a shift in Beasley-Murray's narrative.  This both annoyed and distracted this reader.<br /><br />While I realize that I spent most of this review griping at various aspects of the book, my overall opinion of this commentary on John is positive.  I feel that a reader would benefit from reading George Beasley-Murray's treatment of the text.  Recommended.Murray gives the view respect.

It was as if Haugk wrote a case study of my situation.<br /><br />Because Haugk is tremendously accurate in describing what an antagonist is, I put tremendous confidence in his advice concerning how to identify antagonists in your church, how to recognize an attack is coming, and how to effectively deal with an attacking antagonist.  My pastor in Chicago, who recommended this book to me, has put Haugk's advice into practice a number of times and vouches for its effectiveness.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book strongly enough to all pastors and persons in a church leadership position.  While antagonists purposefully engage in unfair, destructive conflict wherever they go, churches are particularly vulnerable to antagonists.  Knowing who they are and how to minimize their impact could save your ministry.	2005-05-09

The woman who was awarded $3 million for spilling McDonalds coffee on herself comes to mind for me, but there are hundreds of similar rulings and similar outrageous payouts.  With increasingly more people filing such lawsuits how confident are you that your church will not be found liable for something or another and forced to pay our tremendous amounts of money?<br /><br />Stephen Chawaga, a Philadelphia attorney, has put together a brief (80 page) handbook introducing liability and the general principles of this confusing legal area.  Focusing on charitable institutions--and especially churches--Chawaga explains various scenarios in which a church WOULD be found liable by a court and also scenarios in which a court WOULD NOT be found liable and why.  He also gives a good deal of practicle advice concerning how to protect yourself against exposure to liable suits.<br /><br />Whether it's personal injury (slipping and falling) suits, employee injury suits, or suits resulting from the inappropriate actions of employees or volunteers, the principles of protecting yourself remain the same:  be vigilant in looking for possible problems, create safeguards against said problems, and educate yourself about liability.  This book is a good first step toward all three.	2005-05-09

Through these he succeeds in showing the superiority of amillennialsim over the other theological views.<br /><br />This book has been tremendously helpful to me, a proud amillennialist.  However, I do believe that those who hold other positions will benefit more from reading this book.  As Riddlebarger admits, it is difficult to read a tract against your own theological position; we have the tendancy to \\"dig our heels in\\" and refuse to listen to critcism.  But not only is such examination part of our Christian responsibility, but Riddlebarger's academic and personal integrity make this the perfect, non-threatening book to begin to explore biases.  For example,I disagree with his treatment of Romans 11, but respect the manner in which he presented his view.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended.	2005-05-05

Through the context of Roman slavery (Onesimus was Philemon's slave), Nordling shows how the book of Philemon contributes to the Christian understanding of vocation and service.  Through Paul's promise to pay all of Onesimus' debts, Nordling shows how Paul is a \\"type-of-Christ\\" in this letter.  In it all, Nordling shows that this brief letter overflows with care, gentleness, pastoral concern, and a desire to teach the Christian reader about reconciliation with eachother because of our reconciliation to Jesus Christ.<br /><br />In all, Nordling's commentary on Philemon ranks with the best Biblical Commentaries I've read--including Louis Brighton's commentary on Revelation and Leon Morris' commentary on John.  Like me, I imagine you'll be pleasantly surprised at how in-depth and relevant to the modern Christian theis brief book is.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-03

Upon the death of his father, Bryson became very nostalgic, especailly about the many road-trip vacations his dad would take the family on.  In order to commemorate his dad, recapture some of the happiness of his youth, and reaquaint himself with the land of his birth, Bryson takes two extensive road trips.<br /><br />One is a fall trip into the Deep South, up the Atlantic Coast, through New England, up Michigan, down Wisconsin, and home.  The second is a spring trip through Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, through New Mexico to Las Vegas, to the Pacific Coast, through Nevada, Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota, and then back to Des Moines.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Bryson attempts to strike a humorous balance between the places themselves, the mind-numbing frustration of long-distance driving, and his own travel anecdotes.  I most enjoyed the parts when Bryson describes the places themselves and the people he encountered.  To Bryson, there must not have been much difference between the various places as he felt compelled to continually comment on the plethora of crappy souvenier merchandise and the fact that he finds most things boring or gaudy.  When he actually enjoys being at a place and takes to the time to give the reader a brief history lesson, describe some of the unique buildings or scenery, or talk about the way of life in this place, I most enjoy the book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of the book describes funny anectodes from his road trips--getting bored in Carbondale, Illinois; getting drunk in Santa Fe, New Mexico; being refused service at the only diner in a Wyoming town; searching for feminine hygene products in Bryson City; etc--and also describes his thoughts on traveling, searching for local radio stations, and other scenes from the highway.  While Bryson struck a good balance between the three, this reader would have preferred a greater focus to be put on the towns visited--but this is a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />In all, the book was a quick and fun read.  I laughed out loud at times, found myself wanting to take my own road trip, and was generally envious of and entertained by Bryson's trip across America.  I recommend it and look forward to reading his other travel narratives.his reader would have preferred a greater focus to be put on the towns visited--but this is a matter of personal preference. <br /> <br />In all, the book was a quick and fun read.

Each new metaphor is introduced by a story, shown through Bible verses, and analyzed.  Also in each Gospel metaphor is helpful advice about how to preach/communicate that metaphor and an analysis of what kind of person might be especially helped by such a communication.<br /><br />In the final part of the book, Preus takes up the issue of practical theology:  now that you more fully understand the ways in which the Bible communicates the Gospel, how will you use that knowledge.  This part is extremely helpful as it addresses teaching, preaching, evangelism, and missionary work.<br /><br />With short chapters, a fluid writing style, and an emphasis on both exegesis and practical theology, Preus provides a book that will both inspire the imagination, challenge the Christian (no matter her level of Spiritual Maturity), and better equip the Christian to spread the Good News of Salvation...or Rebirth...or Adoption...or a number of other metaphors.

James Kennedy was the pastor of Coral Ridge Presbyterian church and founder of the Evangelism Explosion Program for lay evangelism.  This book is designed to act as an introduction to and textbook for the program.  It is especially designed for pastors and other church leaders who would like to implement the E.E. program of evangelism.<br /><br />This book came highly recommended to me and so I approached it with high expectations.  However, I found the book to be rather disappointing, mainly because the program is big, bulky, programatic, and \\"I'll talk, you shut up and listen\\" oriented.<br /><br />We'll begin by asking a question.  If you were to go up to someone and begin talking to him about Christ, what would you say?  Where would you begin.  The second chapter of this book gives a lengthy outline of what to say.  Kennedy advises the reader to memorize the outline and practice it several times over.  This outline is very artificial and programatic as it incorporates small talk (ask about a piece of furniture of his job) and canned phrases to be used.  In subsequent chapters, which show the outline \\"in action,\\" I am struck by the fact that the Evangelist just keeps talking and talking and talking, never letting the Prospect get a word in edge-wise.  This same \\"outline in action\\" is repeated SEVERAL times throughout the book (my eyes glazed over as the book constantly repeats itself), and every time, it's the same:  Evangelist talks for pages, followed by a simple, three word sentence by the Prospect.  I would not WANT to evangelize like this, nor would I want to be evanglized to in this manner.<br /><br />A second criticism I have with the book is that Kennedy, who obviously has a huge church, has presented his program in such a way as to make it incredibly intimidating, especially for the smaller church (meaning church of less than 1,000).  With layers upon layers of evangelists (from Prayer Partners to Junior Trainers to Lieutenants), and with so many people calling on or making visits to the Prosptect, I cannot even fathom going about forming such a complex, hierarchical, time-consuming program.  It seems frustratingly unworkable.<br /><br />There are aspects of this book that make it worth reading.  The two diagnostic questions (repeated numerous times in this book) are excellent, thought provoking questions on mortality.  The chapter on anecdotes that illustrate Biblical truths are also fantastic, as is the chapter on dealing with common arguments against Christianity.  Furthermore, sprinkled randomly throughout the book are amazingly helpful pieces of insight that obviously come from an experienced, successful pastor.  They don't necessarily have anything to do with Evangelism Explosion, but resemble misplaced gems of incredible value.<br /><br />I can neither positively recommend this book because of its pushy, canned, complicated method; nor can I negatively condemn this book because helpful insights and strategies can be gleaned from it--but the gems are the secondary things and \\"throw away lines.\\"  I don't believe the author has accomplished his objective in this book, but has given me some things to think about.ny people calling on or making visits to the Prosptect, I cannot even fathom going about forming such a complex, hierarchical, time-consuming program.

In this commentary, the reader will find no historical-criticism.  Rather, the author has faith in the inerrancy of Scripture and treats this portion of Scripture accordingly.  Happily, when difficulties arise between the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel according to John, he acknowledges these difficulties, lists several possible ways in which they can be reconciled, then ends with a statement reminding the reading not to be unreasonably dogmatic about such a difficult thing.  Morris' conservatism and respect for the text is refreshing.  Morris also writes in a very readable, fluid style.  I found myself reading the nearly 800 pages of text much quicker than I expected to, mainly because the narrative structure was captivating and a joy to read.  Morris frequently ties John's writings to the other Gospels, the Old Testament, Jewish/Roman history, and the post-Ascension church.  He also has helped my understanding of John by pointing out his unique writing style (double meanings, playing loose with quotes, fondness for numbers, time, and geography, etc.)<br /><br />There were aspects of this book that I did find frustrating.  The most frustrating for me was Morris' anti-sacramentarian treatment of John 6 and the account of blood and water flowing from Jesus wound.  Morris argues that John 6 should be read primarily as Jesus \\"teaching about spiritual realities...but...there may be a secondary reference to the sacrament(313).\\"  However, he spends the following pages arguing against each and every perceived reference to the sacrament.  I have strong beliefs that Jesus teaches primarily about the sacrament in these verses--that is my bias and I would like it do be shared by Morris--but the fact that he promises to address the sacramental teachings of Christ,then argues against his own stated view!  I have a similar problem with Morris' treatment of blood and water flowing from Jesus' post-death wound as he barely addresses the belief that it is some reference to Communion and Baptism.  A second issue I have with this book is the poor copy editing.  The final pages of this book especially have frequent misspellings, misplaced commas, and extra letters inserted within common words (\\"nthe\\").<br /><br />Overall, the weaknesses of this book do not even come close to overcoming the many, many positive aspects.  I feel as if my insight into the writing style and theology of John has greatly increased because of Morris' book.  Furthermore, I am anxious to continue my studies of both John and the Synoptics as a result of Morris' work.

While such material easily be dry and make one's eyes glaze over, Twombly actually succeeds in making his book a (mildly) exciting page-turner--quite a feat for a fundraising book.<br /><br />This brief (111 pages) book essentially chronicles fifteen weekly meetings between Frustrated Man and the Visionary.  Frustrated Man runs a not-for-profit agency which does great things for many people, but Frustrated Man dreams of taking it to the next level--which he can't do without increased, steady funding.  Frustrated Man is thus becoming increasingly...um...frustrated.  The Visionary is a man who knows Frustrated Man's problems well and spends several weeks holding brief meetings with Frustrated Man in order to show him, step-by-step, how to increase his funding and achieve the dreams he has for his organization.<br /><br />Twombly must be a master at organizational fundraising as he makes this complex task seem easy and exciting.  Never having been in a position that required me to raise funds, Twombly's book not only made me believe that I could do it well, but that it would actually be enjoyable cultivating relationships that involve my regularly asking for money!  But while Twombly makes fundraising seem possible and enjoyable, the book pulls no punches when communicating the idea that effective fundraising will require a shift in priorities, systemic change, and hard work, but big changes are presented in such a way as to make it seem managable and worthwhile.<br /><br />While I recommend this book (which only requires a couple hours of time to read), I did find relatively little that a parish pastor would probably find helpful.  This book seems geared more toward organizations like homeless shelters, retirement homes, community activist groups, etc.  Pastors can, however, find many things to glean from this \\"Funding your Vision.\\"n from this \\"Funding your Vision.\\"	2005-01-24

However Randy Alcorn, parish pastor and founder of Eternal Perspectives Ministries, does an excellent job condensing his worldview to the degree that he \\"breaks it down\\" into six \\"keys\\" and provides many memorable statements that tend to churn continually in the readers' head.<br /><br />The dominant view among Christians is one of \\"this is MY money/house/stuff and I'm going to give a little back to the Lord.\\"  Alcorn disagrees, instead arguing that \\"It's all God's stuff and He has asked you to manage it for him, so start using it to promote God's interest in the world.\\"  He makes the case for his worldview using Scripture, analogy, personal experience, and other well-written examples.  Jargon, complex theological/philosophical words, and the like are not found in this book, but Alcorn does an excellent job talking with the reader on his level.  Both Alcorn's faith in God and his love for his fellow man shine through in the narrative.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended.  I am confident that, no matter what amount of money you do or do not donate to you local church, this book will challenge you to change not just you giving habits, but the entire rationalle behind your giving--but not in a \\"guilt-trip\\" sort of way, but rather in a loving, pastoral way.	2005-01-24

Manners are defined as the ways in which these three things manifest themselves.  With these definitions in mind, once can easily go through both the book and life having a good idea of what to do/not to do in a social setting.<br /><br />Post has divided his book into three major sections:  Everyday Live, Social Life, and On the Job.  In each, he has several examples of \\"dos\\" and \\"don'ts\\" that seem silly to even address (loudly burping while at a business function, using deoderant, not calling female co-workers \\"Sweetie\\"), but he also has many techniques and guidelines that are quite helpful--this is especialy so for infrequent occasions like job interviews, attending a wedding, or \\"working a room\\" at a business-social function.<br /><br />Another aspect of this book that I enjoyed was Post's writing style.  Knowing that etiquette is often viewed as an \\"upper class\\" type thing, Post plays into this stereotype tonge-in-cheek as he uses fictional examples of visiting vacation homes on the beach and attending cricket matches.  He also writes in a \\"high class\\" yet very readable style and uses humerous names for fictional charactes (Dan Petrefied, Heather Nervous, etc.).<br /><br />While older gentlemen will probably have mastered many (but probably not all) of the manners and techniques Post writes about, younger men will probably benefit most from this book.  Some can benefit from a little refining or incorporating techniques, others are probably doing just fine in social situations, but can use the confidence boost that this book can provide.

Wurmbrand writes about this very book that it has \\"no literary value,\\" which is true.  He writes in a \\"stream-of-consciousness\\" style, seemingly paying little attention to chronology and jumping from event to event.<br /><br />But while Wurmbrand does not skillfully craft a litarary masterpiece, he does give the reader quite a masterpiece as far as emotions and history are concerned.  I'm aware of little historical work on Undergrounc Churches anywhere--be it Eastern Europe, the Middle East, China, or other lands.  Wurmbrand does history a great service as he provides a first-hand account of Romania's secret church, how they worshiped, how they evangelized, how they communicated and provided support for each other, etc.  The resourcefulness of the Church was both inspiring and surprising.<br /><br />This book is also very emotionally charged.  Wurmbrand pulls no punches as he describes the means by which he and other Christians were tortured:  placed naked in a freezer until nearly dead, warmed up, then placed back in the freezer repeatedly; made to partake in a mock-Communion service of urine and feces; cut several times then placed in a room full of starving rats; and then there's the conventional methods of torture:  beating, attacking your family, and raping.  Reading Wurmbrand's descripting of these acts shocked this reader several times.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for both its historical and inspirational value.  It is also highly recommended because, while Romania's Underground Church no longer has to operate in secret, there exist Underground Churches in other nations of the world:  China, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Cuba (just to name a few).  Reading about this particular underground church has given me insight to how the other Underground Churches still opperate today.y.	2005-01-17

However, while I read Proverbs with frequency, this is my first commentary on the book, and I must express my disappointment in Murphy's treatment of it.<br /><br />To be sure, Roland Murphy, a professor of Biblical Studies at Duke University, had a tremendously difficult task in preparing a commentary on such a Biblical book:  not only are most of the chapters disjoined and unconnected, but many of the verses seem unrelated to the surrounding verses; context is nearly impossible to ascertain, etc.  Murphy is to be commended for researching and presenting the connections and threads which are woven throughout the Biblical book, frequently having to reach both forward and backward to make connections.  He effectively argues that the person who put the final form of Proverbs together didn't do it as haphazzardly as modern man often thinks.  Furthermore, Murphy's translation and explanation of the individual proverbs were found beneficial for this reader.  The final 50 pages of excursuses also provided a helpful, holistic treatment of various topics.<br /><br />However, I tend to disagree with many of the theological assumptions that Murphy brings to Proverbs and as a result, have found much in the commentary that I disagree with.  (1) On pages 276-277, Murphy argues for religious pluralism in the book of Proverbs; (2) throughout the book, he argues that Israelite wisdom is dependant upon Egyptian wisdom (as opposed to a high view of Scripture which does not deny the connection but at the same time tends not to elevate the Egyptian worldview);  (3)Murphy holds on to the belief that Ancient Israelites did not believe in an afterlife(making the theology of many proverbs suspect); (4)and Jesus Christ is kept to a minimum in this commentary (mentioned only three times in passing to dismiss the idea that \\"Woman Wisdom\\" in Proverbs 8 and the \\"Son of God\\" in Proverbs 30 referrs to Christ).  While Murphy is definately not a theological liberal (he argues against some liberal arguments), his moderate attitude does tend to lead to many doubtful conclusions.<br /><br />While there is much to commend in Murphy's well-researched, scholarly, thorough commentary.  Furthermore, he is to be doubly commended because of the difficult nature of the book of Proverbs.  However, I cannot recommend this book because Murphy approaches the text with a lower view of Scripture than is helpful, and holds on to too many ideas which run counter to Orthodox Christianity.dismiss the idea that \\"Woman Wisdom\\" in Proverbs 8 and the \\"Son of God\\" in Proverbs 30 referrs to Christ).

In Seminary, one of my homiletics professors would have us preach in front of the class without any notes and I've preached in front of congregations without a manuscript, so I come to this book with a little--very little--experience in preparing and delivering a note-less sermon.<br /><br />I found this book very helpful because Webb kept the routine of the parish preacher in mind throughout the book.  As and example, his chapters are subdivided into days of the week (Chapter 1 is subtitled \\"Monday and Tuesday\\").  I also appreciated the encouraging tone of the book.  It always had the underlying message, \\"you can do it!  I know you can!\\"  However, while Webb strives to encourage the reader/preacher throughout the book, he also realistic in pointing out common mistakes, pitfalls, or new skills to be learned.  A secondary message is that preaching without notes will be difficult at first, but will be easier as time goes on and new skills are aquired.<br /><br />The parts of the book I found most helpful are the sections on \\"outlining\\" a sermon and actual sermon delivery.  The special attention to \\"chunks\\" of memorized information and natural transitions between \\"chunks\\" is helping me to write more natural sounding sermons.  The chapter on delivering sermons witnout notes provide a helpful list of do's and don'ts.  Happily, Webb also covers pre-delivery jitters and post-delivery blues, which some preachers may still imagine are unnatural for veterans of the pulpit.<br /><br />I normally try to list a couple aspects of the book that I dislike about the book, but it was pretty difficult with \\"Preaching Without Notes.\\"  The only part of the book I really disliked was the example sermon itself in the Appendix.  Instead of Jesus being at the center of the sermon--as he is at the center of our faith--I was sadly surprised to find Jesus mentioned only in passing.  Nevertheless, an Appendix does not a book make or break.  In all, I greatly enjoyed the book and am sure it will help me deliver increasingly better sermons.to find Jesus mentioned only in passing.

US	51636710	R2GJB9SBIHT4EI	080282515X	97180869	The Epistle of James (New International Commentary on the New Testament)	Books	3	12	21	N	N	A little disappointing	The New International Commentary on the New Testament is generally an excellent series because of its highly readable narritave, conservative viewpoint, high scholarship, and the pastoral love that comes through in the narrative.  In this particular volume in the series, however, the \\"high scholarship\\" overshadows the other three characteristics of this series, making it a very disappointing read for this reviewer.<br /><br />The Reverend Doctor James Adamson, a Presbyterian minister in Santa Rosa, California, writes in the Introductin that one of the chief goals of this commentary is to prove that James carefully plotted out his epistle, and that it was not (as many commentators believe) an unstructured collection of random thoughts.  This goal and the scholarly way in which it is pursued makes this commentary fairly confusing and did not do much to strengthen either my faith in Christ or my understanding of James' epistle in general.<br /><br />Adamson employes two techniques frequently.  One is his habit of finding a word or theme in the text of the epistle, then connecting it to the same word or theme elsewhere in the epistle to prove its structure and unity.  The second technique is to introduce and explain what other (disagreeing) scholars say about a particular section of James, then (once the oppornent is fully explained) Adamson presents his own view, explaining why his view is superior.  I found myself quite frustrated with these techniques.  In the first technique, I found myself agreeing that a structure exists, but Adamson doesn't draw any conclusions from these connections as far as the overall message of James is concerned.  (\\"Sure, he talks about the evils of uncontrolled speech earlier as well.  Yes, it shows unity in the epistle, but so what?  How does this help me in my faith life and how can I communicate this to the congregation members in a sermon/Bible Study?\\")  The second techniques is also frustrating because I really don't need to fully understand a theory that Adamson will debunk in a few paragraphs anyway.  If I wanted to know what Martin Luther thinks about James, I'll read Martin Luther.  But I'm not reading Luther, I'm reading Adamson.  I want Adamson to present what he thinks without having to first disagree with Luther.<br /><br />While there are many aspects of this book that I did not enjoy, there were others that I thought were helpful.  I appreciated the fact that Adamson kept his textual criticism to the footnutes and the excursis sections.  Textual criticism on a Catholic Epistle is always an issue, and he handled it quite well here.  Furthermore, his treatment of Extreme Unction, his sensitivity to the Jewish background of the book, and his efforts to show the complimentary relationship between Paul's theology and James' theology are all helpful and appreciated.<br /><br />In all, Adamson tends to gravitate more toward the scholarly issues involved in James--the ones seminary professors would be interested in, as opposed to the ones pastors and lay people would find helpful.  I fully believe that Adamson knows this Biblical book and can apply it in a way helpful to church work professionals, but he did not do this in this volume.<br /><br />Mildly recommended.ly understand a theory that Adamson will debunk in a few paragraphs anyway.

Upon reading the description of the INTJ (which I tested as), I was shocked that I identified with nearly everything the test said about me.  Since then, I've read two other books related to the Myers-Briggs test and greatly appreciate all that I've learned about myself, my wife, and my friends from studying personality types.<br /><br />While these books (including Personality Type and Religious Leadership) have been tremendously insightful, I have not found this book particularly helpful as I continue to prepare for the holy ministry.<br /><br />There are many things I like about this book.  At the forefront of them is the fact that it is based on Myers-Briggs personality profiles, a theory I buy into hook, line, and sinker.  As I read this book, I found myself understanding some of my fellow seminarians and some pastors much better.  I also came to understand some of the pitfalls that are common of people of my personalty type (along with why they are common).<br /><br />I also feel compelled to commend the authors for addressing sexual pitfalls common to pastors of particular personality types.  They took on a huge, contriversial subject, and treated it in a helpful way.  Love and concern for fellow clergy definatley came through in this section of the book.<br /><br />Things about this book I didn't like are also numerous.  The authors try to walk a fine line between being objectively descriptive and pastoral/caring when addressing the personality types, but they often don't succeed in this.  They often came across as communicating, \\"INTJs are not too introverted to be effective and they often don't take others emotional needs into accound, so they often don't last long in parish ministry.  But that's not to say that there aren't a whole lot of good INTJ pastors.  You can do it!\\"  The authors don't exclusively treat INTJs in this manner, but rather appear pessimistic about anyone who isn't an EFTJ or EFSJ.<br /><br />Finally, unlike other Myers-Briggs books, I found myself questioning whether they accurately describe me as an INTJ.  Other books have me pegged, but I found myself thinking, \\"no, I can't identify with that; that doesn't sound like me\\" when certain sections that were supposed to pertain to me.  As a result, I am walking away a little unsure about what to work on for my own growth as a pastor.<br /><br />In sum, I think very highly of the theory upon which this book rests.  There are many great Myers-Briggs books out there that I think are able to help people in all walks of life--knowing yourself, your strengths and your weaknesses, is the first step to becoming a happier and more successful person.  This particular book, however, seems to miss the mark in a way others have not.

Lane does an excellent job analyzing the structure and themes within Mark, explaning parables from different angles (as well as understanding one parable through the other parables), and commenting on other aspects of ancient Roman and Jewish life.<br /><br />This reader also appreciates the conservative approach to Lane's commentary.  With so many authors attempting scholarly acrobatics to learn about the \\"Markan community\\" or practice source criticism, it is refreshing to read a scholarly commentary that holds a traditional view--Mark from the book of Acts wrote this Gospel based almost exclusively on the teachings of Peter.  While many reviewers herald this \\"new and exciting\\" method of interpreting Mark, there is actually little \\"new\\" about it--the traditional conservative view of Mark that the church has always held is the view proposed by Lane.<br /><br />Although an excellent work, this author does have one criticism concerning the ending of Mark.  While Lane is with the majority of scholars in looking down their noses at Mark 16:9ff, Lane dismisses these verses as \\"unoriginal\\" without much of a discussion.  Without even reprinting the text, he criticizes those who hold to the originality of these verses as unscholarly and speculative.  A fuller argument for his premature ending, a more detailed explanation of the function of this abrupt \\"literary device\\" and a short commentary on Mark 16:9ff would have been greatly appreciated by this reader, especially in the light that Lane seemingl treats the ridiculous Freer Logion as sacred writing.<br /><br />In all, this book is a great, mentally provocative treatment of Mark's Gospel that simply fell apart at the end.  Highly recommended!	2004-11-15

Sande, being a lawyer, writes that legal action ends up costing more time, effort, money, and friendships than one normally expects at the outset.  For both practical reasons and as a form of obedience to God, Sande advises and helps Christians through the reconciliation process.<br /><br />To be honest, the paradigm has not totally shifted for me yet.  The practical illustrations did help me to picture what Sande's advice looks like in \\"real life,\\" but at times the dialogue and such still seemed awkward, sugar-coated, and overly evangelica.  Similar to an episode of \\"Seventh Heaven.\\"  However, the illustrations were not intended to captivate, but rather to illustrate.  In all, recommended for Christians.	2004-11-03

Bruce (professor at the University of Manchester) did a poor job in his commentary.  On the contrary, this commentary is good in many ways.  However, the relatively low ranking is more reflective of my opinion that Bruce did not achieve the goals that the set out to accomplish.<br /><br />In his introduction, Bruce says that this book is intended for lay readers so that they get a better handle on these often-neglected Biblical books.  With this in mind, Bruce does not advance his cause by reproducing a translation with archaic language (\\"Hath\\" \\"Abideth\\" \\"unto\\").  Because nobody uses these words in everyday language, their use in the commentary will make lay readers fairly uncomfortable.  Furthermore, Bruce tends to discuss various aspects of the Greek language and textual variants--probably inappropriately so if writing to a lay audience.  I find it unfortunate that Bruce thinks that he could write \\"This is an perfect passive/aorist\\" and think the layman knows what he's talking about.  Similarly, at one point, Bruce goes on a tangent about the difference between Codex Vaticanus and the Syriac manuscripts.  Most pastors probably wouldn't even understand the relevance of this.<br /><br />The all-to-frequent jargon detracts from what is otherwise a very readable commentary.  Where Bruce really excells is advancing his theory concerning the occation for the writing of these epistles, then showing how various verses prove his theory.  I found that I have a much fuller understanding of the Johnine episltes as a whole and am able to better make sense of them as a result of this book.  Bruces arguement that the Apostle John actually wrote these books are similary defended throughout the book as he draws connections between the epistles and the Gospel of John.<br /><br />Because I believe my own understanding of these three epistles has increased as a result of this book, I would recommend it.  However, I'm sure that there are better books for you--whether you're theologically trained or not.  Reading this book would definately NOT be a waste of time, but I imagine that your time might be better spent reading a more specialized commentary.er, I'm sure that there are better books for you--whether you're theologically trained or not.

Bruce, a professor at the University of Manchester and author of many excellent New Testament commentaries, has produced an excellent work in his commentary on the Gospel of John.  This book is intended to be read by lay members of the church, so there isn't an awful lot of Greek, nor is there jargon.  In fact, he does such a good job avoiding such issues, that he \\"makes it look easy,\\" the mark of one whose scholarly and writing skills have been finely honed.<br /><br />The format is simple:  Bruce translates a few verses of John, then offers an explanation (sometimes only a paragraph, sometimes a page or two).  He comments on the historical/cultural context, Messianic expectations, the other three Gospel accounts, and other interesting literary or theological issues.  One walks away knowing he has a better handle on John.<br /><br />This reader appreciates F.F. Bruce's conservative theology.  He argues that the disciple John wrote this Gospel (and effectively supports this argument), he does not speculate get into \\"development of the text\\" issues, and he places a heavy focus on Jesus, his work, and his teachings.  Many excellent scholars are so focused on text-criticism issues, that they blind themselves to Christ himself.<br /><br />Also of note is Bruce's treatment of the (controversial) passage concerning the woman caught in adultery.  Added to the end as an appendix, he argues that while Johnnine authorship is in doubt, the passage is authentic Gospel and treats it quite fairly.  In all, a very good commenary that I would recommend to laity and those who want a good introduction to John.	2004-10-18

Robert Kolb, a professor of systematic theology at Concordia Seminary (St. Louis) attempts to present in \\"Speaking the Gospel Today\\" a Lutheran understanding of Evangelism, more specifically, witnessing.  The book is divided into four chapters:  the first deals with ways God has and has not revealed himeself.  The second deals with the effects of sin (it either makes one feel falsely secure or crushes a person), the third deals with they way the Bible describes the person and work of Jesus, and the final chapter deals with the church-building work of the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />This book has a lot of excellent theory on witnessing.  Among these are a relyance on the Holy Spirit to work faith in a person  even if the \\"delivery\\" of Law and Gospel isn't all that great;  Kolb stresses knowledge of the attitude of the one you're witnessing to (hence the constant \\"why do you want to know\\" question);  He shows the worldviews held by the faithless as opposed to the faithful worldview; and the list goes on.<br /><br />However, this book has not been rated as high as other books for two basic reasons.  The first is Kolb's writing style.  The man holds two doctorates and I have a lot of respect for him, but he tends to write over my head.  To his credit, he has tried to \\"dumb down\\" the book for people like me, but the end result is a writing style similar to that of a pendulum:  he writes like an average Joe, then goes into \\"doctoral thesis\\" mode, followed by \\"average Joe.\\"  The end result is that I could never quite get into a rhythm with the book, making Kolb's main points diffucult to find and understand.<br /><br />My second criticism really isn't much of a criticism at all.  Aside from asking \\"why do you want to know,\\" Kolb has very few practical, every day witnessing techniques in his book, but rather mountains of theory.  Granted, Kolb didn't set out to write a pracitcal manual for witnessing, he did set out to write a high-minded systematic book on witnessing theory.  However, the average Christian or pastor probably isn't going to get a lot of \\"bang from his buck\\" on this book.  I know I'd have to read this a couple more times to fully understand the main points and sub-points and get it all straight in my mind before I start applying it.  The time I would have to spend doing this probably could be invested better elsewhere.  Then again, I often find myself on the ignorant side of things, so take what I say with a grain of salt.<br /><br />In all, I would not recommend this book for most people.  Graduate students, teachers, church workers with a lot of time on their hands, etc., would most likely really enjoy this book.  Pastors might want to give it a shot.  For everyone else, I'd explore other options.However, the average Christian or pastor probably isn't going to get a lot of \\"bang from his buck\\" on this book.

He later interviews over 100 pastors of rapidly-growing churches.  To this reader, an analysis of cold-hard facts based on statistical data and interviews is much preferable to some other books on church growth I've read--many of which offer Biblically-based theory or specific techniques.  Rainer's book successfully blends these two.<br /><br />While Rainer's righting style is machine gun-esque, rapidly firing fact after fact and statistic after statistic at the reader, the anectodal evidence does tend to soften the book, making it readable.  However, even if the book read like a dictionary, the information and insights would be well worth the effort.  By reading the book, I can readily identify a dozen short-term, long-term, and systematic changes/improvements that can be done to help in attracting more members.<br /><br />Finally, it should be noted that while reading this book, one can tend to think in terms of \\"quid pro quo\\"--if I implement these ideas, then my church WILL grow.  Rainer does contend (and I agree) that the ultimate cause of church growth is the Lord.  He's the one guiding the process, the effectiveness, and the results.  He uses different means and different people, each having different gifts.  This book can be read either as a \\"how to\\" book or as a description of a series of churches/pastors who have an accurate and accepted knowledge of themselves, their church, and their mission (ie worship and evangelize).

Working from the origianl Greek, Becker reproduces the Greek, provides a translation, and gives his analysis of the text.  Intended for seminary students, but written so fluidly that it was far from being \\"over my head,\\" Becker points out which terms are to be taken literally, figuratively, and why.  He often comes back to these explanations to refresh the reader's memory (as keeping the symbolism from reality can often be confusing).<br /><br />This was truly and enjoyable read for me and reading it before Louis Brighton's commentary on Revelation would have greatly benefited me.  While I respect the scholarship in Becker's commentary, there are points that I tend to disagree with.  Examples of this are his association with various plagues and symbolic figures as stemming from imporoper use of the Sacraments (Holy Communion and Baptism) and from the evils of false doctrine.  While the sacrament argument is plausable, I think Dr. Becker might be reading his own biases into the text as it relates to false doctrine.  While correct doctrine is important, I don't believe that warnings against it are necessarily personified by symbolic characters in Revelation<br /><br />In all, an excellent, highly recommended read, especially for millenialists/Left-Behindites.  I think it'll cause you to look at Revelation in a different light.	2004-09-14

With over 100 pages of introduction to the major schools of thought in the scholarly world (where exactly are the Galatian churches?  What influence did Greek, Hebrew, etc., thought have on Paul's work, when was this written?), Longenecker makes clear where he stands on the major issues and why, but does so without being caustic.  His work on the actual text is similarly thorough as he gives many cultural inisghts and effectively balances the \\"mirror technique\\" (from the introduction) with the idea that Paul is also laying out his own theology.  I also appreciated Longenecker's treatment of variant readings as he cited which sources had variants and quickly explained his textual decisions<br /><br />I do have two problems with this commentary, however.  One is that Longenecker tends to be confusing as he tries to show how Paul's letter is similar to other genres of Greco-Roman letters.  He uses Latin terms frequently, but only defines them in the introduction (among many other Latin words and theories that he rejects).  Not only does this reader feel that Longenecker was trying to fit a round peg into a square hole as he treats Galatians in this way, but the frequent jargon does not aid in my understanding of the book.  My second problem is more of a personal preference.  Longenecker's book is an exceptionally slow read--giving a wealth of information, but not being very conversational in style.  However, this is a personal preference of this reader and not an argument that Longenecker did a \\"poor job.\\"<br /><br />Quite the opposite is true.  Longenecker has treated the book of Galatians quite fairly and thoroughly.  The result is a scholarly, respectful, informative, fairly conservative.  This book would benefit pastors, lay persons (especially those who have studied Greek), and other professionals looking to gain a fuller understanding of or appreciation for Galatians.anding of or appreciation for Galatians.	2004-09-04

Because of this book, Palm Sunday had more meaning for me; I understood the institution of the Lord's Supper in a new way; and I realize that there is medical explanations for Jesus sweating blood (even though the text is ambiguous he might have sweat huge drops of sweat like blood) and for both blood and water coming out of Jesus pierced side.

To prove this, the author looks at how the Old Testament spoke of God (what terms were used, what wording was customary, etc.) and showed that the early Church (most of whom were Jewish converts--Paul was a rabbi) used the same termonology when writing about Jesus.  He also looks at differences between Jewish/Second Temple Period references to God as opposed to angels (or any being that is less than God, but more than man) and shows that these types of references were not used when writing about Jesus.<br />There is an argument that the author too quickly dismisses many Scriptural passages that run counter to his argument.  While this may be true, I don't think it was within the author's scope to fully treat each Biblical passage.  This book is quite short, making it necessary for Bauckham to &quot;get to the point&quot; quickly.  Furthermore, the book is intended to have people read the New Testament from a different perspective.  In these things, Bauckham succeeded.  It is an interesting read and I recommend it.	2004-05-28

Beginning with choosing a text, Long shows how one might analyze the text to determine the central meaning, and look for new angles in Bible passages that may challenge our understanding of that text (or make for a unique sermon).  The remaining steps are similarly detailed, yet highly adaptable for your own individual style.  Furthermore, Long apparently knows the young preacher's habit of delivering a sermon that is either too broad or rambling, so he always makes sure that the sermon stays on-track.  Finally, a big benefit of this book is Long's constant reminder that sermons are works that are meant to be delivered orally, and thus heard (not read).  Keeping the lay audience in mind and how people typically listen/hear was highly valuable to me.  Recommended for those who want to learn more about what kind of work goes into sermon prep.	2004-05-28

That is definately not saying that this book is bad.  Quite the opposite.  Armin Panning gives a very good conservative view on these two brief books of the Bible.  The greatest benefit for me is Panning's efforts to show that these books (especially Ephesians) fit into an established Pauline pattern--present a broad theological commands, then show how they can be practically put into practice.  While I would recommend this book, especially for someone more interested in the Pauline epistles, I would first recommend other books from this series.	2004-05-28

The Seven Habits is nothing like this in that it turns the attention onto the reader:  it is his/her job to motivate him/herself, to figure out what needs to be done, and to actually go about doing it.  The classic, and masterfully illustrated principles for becoming a &quot;more effective&quot; person refuse to let the reader accept excuses for non-action and for poor results.  It is a classic example of Teddy Roosevelt-style Rugged Individualism, but always reminds the reader to truly care about other people and build relationships with them (everybody always SAYS that family is the most important thing in their lives, but rarely act this way).  I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone.	2004-05-26

This commentary on Revalation gives a completely different, centuries-old amillennialist interpretation of one of the most difficult books of the Bible.<br />Brighton is a professor emeritus at Concordia Seminary in Saint Louis (and one of the nicest people--student, prof. or other--that I've met on campus) and has an extrodinarily high reputation in the New Testament department.  His commentary is based on the Koine Greek, which is translated into English.  Any awkward translations of unique word usage is explained to the point that, by the end of the book, one is able to see Semetisms in John's hasty writing.<br />As far as the text goes, Brighton masterfully lays out his amillenialist view:  that the seven seals, trumpets, etc. all introduce the same period of time (not following strict chronology) and that these visions all represent what is happening in the church today.  Symbols are clearly explained and frequent reminders are provided so that the reader doesn't get confused trying to keep them all straight.<br />For many people, the thought of the end of the world is quite frightening.  Brighton's Revelation commentary is Christ-centered and has a clear focus on the Good News of life eternally with Christ in heaven.  Instead of feeling fearful as I read eschatological prophesy, I found myself longing for Christ's return.  Highly recommended.	2004-05-26

This book is divided into four sections that reflect the four biggest concerns Americans face--the workplace, the family, time, and money.  The basic message of the book is that one must think in terms of &quot;investing,&quot; whether it be money, time, or effort.  It is important to examine what one invests in so that maximum returns can be paid on that investment.  As an example, investing money in a car yeilds a much lower return (a negative return) than investing in a mutual fund.  Investing time in televison watching yields a much lower return than helping your child with his homework.  Investing in effort in a long-term project that is still months away yields a much higher return than filling out some pretty-unnecessary paperwork.  Other commentators are correct when they say that the examples of theory-in-action can be fairly unrealistic (even though they really happened!), but they illustrate the authors' points well.  I would first recommend the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.  If you find that helpful (and I imagine you will), this book is an excellent follow-up to it.	2004-05-26

Because it would take too long (and be too redundant) to explain to each individual, Forde wrote this book on Martin Luther's Heidelberg Disputations to help these people understand to look at things as a theologian of the cross.<br />If this is Dr. Forde's goal, I'm sad to say that he didn't achieve it.  I'm not saying that Forde's research was faulty.  Neiher am I saying that Forde incorrectly explained what it means to be a theologian of he cross.  What I am saying that the prose is such that a lay-person would probably find it too difficult and confusing.  Being a life-long Lutheran, none of the concepts discussed by Dr. Forde were alien to me.  However, they were written in such a manner that I had to continually re-read certain sections to understand Forde's point.  He packs so much into each sentence that you REALLY need to pay attention to each sentence lest the continuity be lost.<br />Was the book excellent and accurate?  Yes.  Was it too &quot;thick&quot; for the average, non-theologically-trained Christian?  Yes.  (by the way, at 115 pages, it's not physically thick, but each sentence is saturated with important stuff) So, I would not recommend this book to those who are looking for a little light reading on the Theology, but would suggest serious students of theology take this book on.	2002-12-19

I've been bouncing back and forth between reading books form Concordia's &quot;People's Bible Commentary&quot; series and Westminster John Knox Press' &quot;Daily Study Bible&quot; series.  The same comments I've written about for previous Concordia &quot;People's Bible Commentary&quot; books still holds true:  while it does an excellent job in staying faithful to scripture (not saying &quot;well, this chapter really shouldn't be in the Bible&quot;), it does tend to get a bit too basic for my tastes.<br />This commentary tackles the often boring books of 1st Kings and 2nd Kings.  As this series is designed for people who are only recently beginning to study the Bible, this book does a very good job of introdicing the book and its characters.  The author even tells you not to worry so much if you can't remember all the kings' names right off the bat, they'll become increasingly familiar the more you read the book.<br />In the commentary (which follows a few verses of scripture), the author does a good job of filling the reader in on world politics, the state of the worlds militaries, customs of Israel and Judah, and political relationships between the People of God and her surrounding nations.  He also includes much commentary that speaks to modern society's ills.  He constantly points to a didobedient king and asks the reader, havn't you acted the same way in the past?  Let this guy be an example to you.  He had me feeling guilty on more than a few occations.<br />For the respect given to the Word of God, for the historical analysis, for the modern applications, and for constantly pointing to Christ as our salvation, I would recommend this book for those who are beginning to study the faith or for those who want to get some insight into the Lutheran mind.  For others, I'm sure there are some more insightful books out there, you'll just have to wait until I can find them and review them.	2002-12-11

Then, he gave it up and took a job working among mentally handicapped people in Canada.  This book, a speech in its original form, is part Nouwen's process of adjusting to his new life and part a chronicle of lessons he's learned working among the developmentally disabled.<br />This book is primarily speaking to Christian pastors, emphasizing the need to &quot;get back to the basics&quot; of faith, especially not letting yourself get caught in the trap of thinking too highly of your own importance.  However, it is an excellent read for pleasure as well.  I would highly recommend it.	2002-12-11

You wouldn't use sock puppets to explain math to accountants; you wouldn't use in-depth power-point presentations to explain math to first graders.  With this in mind, why do many Americans still try to talk about Jesus using the methods used thirty years ago?  Why do we use Christian &quot;jargon&quot; to explain Christianity to those outside the faith?<br />Henderson, as you might guess, contends that modern American Christians must change their approach to sharing the faith in order to fit modern America.  The pattern of Henderson's book is straightforward:  he examines a particular aspect/mindset/value of modern Americans; he then gives ideas about how a Christian might share Words of Eternal Life with such an American.  Henderson's prose is both straightforward and enjoyable.  He gets right to the heart of the American mindset, then illustrates it with descriptions from scenes from popular movies, personal anecdotes, jokes, etc.<br />In all, Henderson does the modern Christian a great service in writing &quot;Culture Shift.&quot;  Jesus tells Christains to tell others about him (&quot;Go, therefore, and baptize all nations...&quot;) and Henderson can help us along the way through this book.  Highly recommended.	2002-11-04

They give advice concerning the character and conduct that Christians should have, specifically the character and conduct of a church's pastor.<br />Where Barclay's strength lies is in the meticulous analysis of the text.  Paul tends to pack a lot in his sentences; Barclay picks the sentence apart and brings things into clearer view.  While he does an admirable job discussing Paul's world in the light of the times (when slaves outnumbered free men, when women were neither to be seen nor heard, etc.); how Paul's words can be applied to a modern, slave-free, woman-respecting society; and spends a great deal of time analyzing Christian conduct.<br />While the commentary is generally good, it wasn't much that I hadn't heard or read before.  It can be argued that this was Barclay's intention.  Since he translated the entire text from the original Greek, quoted many other Bible verses and Paul's pagan contemporaries (to illustrate the thinking of the day), etc., he could have written a pretty good commentary series intended for Biblical scholars.  Instead, he wrote one for the regular chruch-goers.<br />I do have to throw in one comment concerning the inerrancy of the Bible.  Barclay speculates that Paul may not have written the entire epistle, but rather that someone found one of Paul's old letters and re-wrote it to address the Gnostic heresy in the Church.  This speculation is dangerous as it encourages one to pick apart the Bible and throw away the parts that he/she doens't like.  It makes the Bible subjective (\\"I don't like that part about no murder.  I don't believe the Holy Spirit wrote that, so I'll ignore it.\\").  The Holy Spirit doesn't need an editor; It will have what it wants in the Bible and make sure that any \\"false teachings\\" are not included.<br />In all, this is a pretty good commentary.  It gives a thorough, Biblical analysis of the conduct of Christian pastors and lay-people.

Although the time changes, the stories all have the same theme:  a young, beginning pastor wrestles with the fact that, although he tries to \\"live a good life that God would be proud of,\\" he still sins.  The characters struggle with this fact and end up realizing that EVERYBODY sins and that because Jesus died on the cross to save us from our sins, we needn't worry about our sinful nature because Jesus death is bigger than any sin.<br />I have to admit that Giertz does a much better job than I did in describing the above (essentially, a forgiven Christian cares that he sins but can't help it while an unforgiven sins and couldn't care less).  In the course of the book, Giertz addresses infant baptism, the work of the Holy Spirit, liturgical worship vs. non-liturgical worship, conflict between Christians, and a historical vs. a literal interpretation of the Bible.<br />While he tackles heavy subjects, Giertz does it in an entertaining way through this novel.  Not only is it a good read, but it'll get you thinking about deep religious issues.  Recommended	2002-10-11

While Gibson gives a wild roller-coaster of a commentary, Honsey gives a steady, traditional train ride.  While Gibson shocked me, thrilled me, and made me wildly angry, Honsey made cool, logical sense the entire way through.<br />Honsey, being of the Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod, advances many views that I've known and loved for years, namely 1) The events in the Book of Job really happened  2)  Job (as well as the entire Old Testament) point forward to the coming of Jesus  3)  If his research doesn't provide him with an adequate answer, he admits it.  4)  The entire Bible (even the speeches of Elihu) is inspired by God and there for a purpose.  That is to say, if the Bible said it happened, it happened; mere, silly humans are blasphemous when they begin to say &quot;this particular part of the Bible really shouldn't be there.&quot;<br />As such, Honsey, produces a calm, logical commentary.  When he sees something that points forward to Jesus (or some other part of the Bible), he points it out; when Job says something that borderlines blasphemy, he give Job the benefit of the doubt (God commended him for his righteousness so Honsey won't accuse where God doesn't); he explains his thinking and why he disagrees with other Bible commentators.<br />In all, Honsey gives a clear, accurate picture of the book of Job.  While being neither dramatic nor flashy, he does earn points with straight-forwardness.  While not a particularly gifted poet in the sense that he can point out the highly emotional yet difficult-to-comprehend poetry of Job, he is gifted in presenting Job as a part of a greater whole--the Holy Bible.  A heartily endorsed commentary (and commentary series).	2002-09-30

Could be better	Eugene Peterson has been thinking about it for a long time and has some advice for pastors out there.  Before he gives the advice, he has some words of criticism for them:  they've been sucked into the world of \\"respected\\" professionals who let money or comfort dictate their career decisons (e.g. the ambulance-chasing lawyer, the salesman who tells you what you want to hear just so he gets the sale).  He admonishes pastors who have a similar mentality and advises them to work on their prayer life (especially the Psalms), read the Bible with more fervor, and find a \\"spiritual counsleor\\"-- someone who can guide you towards a closer relationship with God.<br />Of course pastors need to read the Bible and pray!  This is no new revelation!  He did make me more interested in reading the Psalms, though.  The section on \\"how to read\\" was not to my liking, either.  The section on the importance of finding a spritiual mentor, however was quite interesting.  Americans seem to have a fascination with Teddy Roosevelt-style \\"Rugged Individualism.\\"  This apparently carries over to the pastor who now thinks he has to be a strong leader of the church instead of realizing that Christ himself acted like a servent for us.  He even humbled himself to wash his disciples feet and act as our \\"whipping boy\\"--taking a punishment that was rightfully ours as he died on the cross.<br />While I whole-heartedly say that Peterson's last section was the best, there are some good points to his first two sections.  I already mentioned a new respect for the Psalms; in fact, the word \\"respect\\" is the key theme for most of Peterson's book.  Respect the fact that, when you pray, you are talking to your Creator and Redeemer!  Don't take that lightly!  When you read the Bible, realize that it's your Creator and Redeemer talking with you!  Don't read it lightly!  That pretty much sums up Peterson's book.<br />Read the introduction to this at your library or bookstore.  If you're really into the book after that, go ahead and buy it.  Be warned, however, this is Peterson's best writing in \\"Working the Angles\\" and the prose kind of goes downhill from there.hat, go ahead and buy it.

I've read the Bible's \\"Job\\" a number of times and the poetry-style narration made my eyes glaze over as I read.  I understood the meaning of the sentences, but didn't understand the raw emotions being displayed.  Gibson points out that very emotion!  He points out when Job is dancing on the brink of blasphomy--he yells at God asking, \\"so what if I've sinned against you?  How does that harm you?\\"  He taunts God and accuses Him of acting like a bully towards Job.  But Job isn't the only person in this book that made me shake my head in disbelief.  Job's three \\"friends\\" repeatedly try to convince a violently sick man on his deathbead (Job himself) that God's letting him have this horrible disease because Job is a rotten, no-good, dirty sinner.  With friends like them, who needs enemies?  Gibson does a fantastic job of pointing these exchanges out, giving me new respect for the Book of Job.<br />Now, to where I get angry with Gibson.  Our differences are theological, the worst kind of difference.  First, we disagree concerning when the story of Job actually took place.  I say somewhere between the times of Noah and Jacob; Gibson says after the Israelites left Egypt.  No big deal there.  Where we seem to have our big differences is our trust in the Holy Scripture as God's infallable word.  Gibson insults the beginning chapters of the book by calling the story of Job's downfall a \\"folk tale,\\"  implying that it was a silly, happy prologue to the meat of the story:  the debates.  He has a habit of pointing out the author's \\"mistakes\\" (the author is the Holy Spirit.  He don't make mistakes) and even goes so far as to REMOVE chapters of the book (because they don't really belong in the Bible) and make them an appendix!  The Holy Spirit doesn't need an editor!<br />I believe that the Holy Bible (the entire thing) is the inspired word of God; that the dot over every \\"i\\" and the cross of every \\"T\\" is supposed to be there.  God would not let his message to us be corrupted, either by the addition of verses that \\"aren't supposed to be there\\" or by the removal of stuff that God wants us to read.  God is more powerful than us.  He'll keep out the stuff that's not supposed to be there and doesn't need Dr. Gibson to help him out.  Furthermore, Dr. Gibson sets a serious precedent for theologians:  when mere, sinful people start trying to decide on their own what parts of the Bible are Holy and what parts are not Holy, it reduces the Good Book to yet another \\"what's right for me isn't necesarilly right for you\\" idea.  As for me, I'll let God decide and just view the entire book as Holy as it is--even the parts I don't like.<br />In sum, the parts that Dr. Gibson has respect for and treats seriously are excellent and emotion enducing.

At one point they had a theologan on.  The host asked him what 12 books of the Bible he would bring if he were stranded on a desert island.  \\"Well, I certainly wouldn't bring Leviticus,\\" was the theologan's reply.  That is the case with many Christians.  To them, many of the Old Testament books \\"just aren't important,\\" but they ALL are still the word of God.<br />George Knight gives us a very readable and practical commentary on the book of Leviticus (a manuel for Israel's priests and a \\"Holiness Code\\"--moral commands--for the people).  The book consists of a half-chapter (give or take) of Scripture followed by Knight's commentary.  Knight often gives some very insightful commentary showing what this type of animal sacrifice shows about God's personality or explaining why the people could only have one type of crop in a given field.<br />Although Knight succeeds in making a normally dull book (especialy when compared with Genesis, Joshua, 2 Samuel, the Gospels, etc) seem exciting, there do exist some faults with the book.  One chapter in Leviticus deals with rules agains homosexuality.  Instead of coming right out and saying what he believes Leviticus says about the subject, Knight tip-toes and tap-dances so much, I'm still not really quite sure WHAT he believes about it.  I'm not sure if he's delicately trying to say that God is wrong about gay folk or if he's just a little afraid to actually condemn homosexual practices.<br />There are other places in the commentary where Knight does a similar tap-dance routine, but overall, this is an extremely good commentary that really aided in my understanding of Leviticus.	2002-09-15

After all, how can one write a 350+ book about Scrabble and make it a page turner?  Let me explain.<br />Fastis writes in first person, making the book read more like a journal or memoir than a typical non-fiction book.  He decides that, as a book idea, he would attempt to become a world class competitive Scrabble player so as to write about the other people who do.  Along the way, he writes about his frustrating mistakes, the odd people to whom he turns for advice, the most unique of competitive Scrabble players, the history of the game, and major tournaments.  All taking place during a three year period.<br />This book was difficult to put down, Fastis writes in a very engaging way.  I found myself caring about the people Fastis introduces us to (and even cheering for some over others), and wanting to whip out the old Scrabble board and challenge someone (and I hate Scrabble).  The down side of the book, though, is towards the end, you start to wonder what is going to happen to the various people Fastis writes about.  It's kind of sad to think that middle aged people exist who don't have any kind of job except; instead they memorize the Scrabble dictionary and concentrate on developing strategies.  God's blessings to you, gentlemen.<br />In sum, it's worth a read.  It's entertaining and informative.  If nothing else, read it to see how a book about Scrabble hold your interest.	2002-08-30

In &quot;Decisive Day:  The Battle for Bunker Hill,&quot; Ketchum wrote an excellent history, peppering the narritive with anecdotes, short histories and footnotes, personality profiles, etc., making the work a true masterpiece of Revolutionary War histories.  Unfortunately, that formula didn't work as well on &quot;Winter Soldiers.&quot;<br />The title of the book is &quot;Winter Soldiers:  The Battles for Trenton and Princeton.&quot;  Thus, one would tend to believe that the book is about those two battles.  That, unfortunately isn't true.  The first third of the book is about the &quot;big picture&quot; of the war (why Americans decided to rebel, &quot;no taxation without representation,&quot; etc.) and about British political reaction to the war.  The second third of the book is about the successful British campaign against New York.  The final third of the book is about George Washington's attacks on Trenton and Princeton.<br />The scope of this book was too broad for Ketchum to re-create the same literary success that he achieved in &quot;Decisive Day;&quot; there were too  many people, places, points of view, etc. to really draw the reader in.  The information contained in the book was good and accurate.  It is written better than most Revolutionary War books I've read, and I suppose I had expected a lot from Ketchum since reading his other book, but I can't help but feel let down by this one.<br />Recommended, but just barely.	2002-08-20

In fifth grade, I cried because the fictional main character's pet goose died.  I cried while reading \\"My Bloody Life\\" because \\"Reymundo Sanchez's\\" life was non-fiction and common in our nation's cities.<br />Sanchez's eyes opened up and he ended up leaving the Latin Kings (unlike \\"Slim\\" and others who were killed instead of being allowed to leave).  He writes from the perspective of an older man who is able to look back on his life and truly reflect on what the event of his life signified.  Thus he is able to reflect on his decisions, then explain his thought process at the time (eg. when the 35-year-old Maria takes 13-year-old Reymundo's virginity, he is able to say that he now realizes that what Maria did was horrible and probably ruined many future sexual experiences for him.  But at that time, all he wanted was to have sex and \\"be a man.\\")<br />Sanchez is able to soberly reflect on his life.  The result is a flowing, \\"matter-of-fact\\" prose as he describes his introduction to alcohol and marijuana (at the age of 12), his physically abusive parents, his multiple murders, his violence against others, his physical and sexual abuse of other women, his drug dealing and cocaine addiction.  The rapidity with which Sanchez went from a nice kid with good grades to an amazingly violent, self-centered gang-banger is both shocking and sad.<br />This was a very powerful book set in a neighborhood not too far from my house.  To know the daily goings on a few miles from my house, in the neighborhood my parents grew up in is very sad.  The subject matter is violent, graphic and quite disturbing, but needs to be read.  You probably won't have a good time reading this book, but you'll be doing yourself a favor if you do.  Recommended.	2002-08-13

The main character in this novel is Frankie Addams, a twelve-year-old girl from a small town in the south who is at \\"that awkward age\\" and bored to tears.  The only thing that even comes close to resembling excitement in her life is the fact that her brother (in the army during WWII and stationed in Alaska) is getting married within a week.  Frankie somehow convinces herself that she, her brother and the bride-to-be are meant to be togther and convinces herself that the three of them will live an adventerous life together after teh wedding.<br />While the main character is probably the most illogical and annoying main character in any novel I've ever read (with the possible exception of the main character in \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\"), the redeeming quality of this work is the style in which Carson McCullers writes.  Even with a ...main character like Frankie, McCullers writes in a very enjoyable style.  Although I never \\"understood\\" Frankie Addams, I did grow to like Bernice (the black cook) and John Henry (Frankie's 6-yar-old cousin).  McCullers draws the reader into the setting and makes the characters three-dimentional.<br />While I would not exactly consider this a Young Adult \\"coming of age\\" novel, I would recommend it.  I don't think the pace is quick enough to hold the interest on young adults, but I would encourage them to read this book.  I would more strongly recommend it to People high school age or older, not because of the story, but because of the prose.	2002-08-10

She also wrote it to let potential pastor's wives know what they're getting themselves into when they marry a pastor or a seminarian.  Nearly exclusively applying personal anecdotes, Keck provides the reader with 20 chapters (but only a total of 100 pages) of anecdotes in which she talks about what the church community often expects of a pastor's wife (teaching Sunday School, singing in the choir or playing piano at services); friendships that are made and lost as a result of moves (a pastor stays at a church an average of ten years) or misunderstandings; the particular joys and difficulties of raising a family among a church; the troubles that people come to you with; and the genirosity that members of the congregation often grace pastors and their families with.<br />While it is an extremely short book, many of the examples are quite interesting and eye opening.  They lead for discussion.  As my fiancee and I (I'll be a pastor in a short 4 1/2 years) read this book, several discussions came up.  &quot;That's so sweet,&quot; would be one comment, followed three pages later with a, &quot;Woah!  What are we going to do if that happens to us,&quot; comment.  A lot of, &quot;are we sure we want to be a pastor and pastor's wife knowing that this could happen,&quot; comments also filled our conversations.  Thankfully, Lorena Keck seems not to regeret in the slightest the choice she made when she married a seminarian.  Although she has experienced many sorrows in her life as a result of being a pastor's wife, she has experienced an overwhelming number of joys.  Furthermore, her trust in God to help see her though any troubles, along with the joy she receives knowing that her efforts are serving the Lord make it all worth while.  An excellent book recommended expecially for people who are thinking of the ministry or who want to know what the job of a minister is all about.fe as a result of being a pastor's wife, she has experienced an overwhelming number of joys.

While many see it as the story of a boy who overcomes prejudice, I see it more as an adventure novel. The novel is set during World War II, so war (especially submarine warfare) is involved as are shipwrecks and the struggle to survive on a desolate island. The characters are well-developed and the author avoids including events for the sake of plot convenience. It's a short read and well worth it. Highly recommended.	2002-06-27

I'm about to enter the seminary and a pastor loaned this book to me because it accurately reflected the life of a minister--especially a minister in a small town.  It was fascinating to say the least.  One aspect of this book which I found particularly interesing was the bredth of the problems that Rev. Lischer had to deal with: a teenager who is pregnant and fears telling her father because he'll beat her; a seventeen-year-old girl who's having an affair with a thirty-five-year-old man and doesn't understand why people are against it; advice to the man who is considering quitting his job at a factory to concentrate on farming full time; should contemporary songs be introduced to an extremely traditional congregation?; a young, frightened woman who is about to undergo emergency surgeory and her husband.  I found myself asking myself what I would say in these situations as I may very well be facing them some day soon.<br />One piece of advice that Lischer points out once, but occurs more that he realizes is that reflecting the love and compassion that God has for you in your dealing with others tends to work.  When Lischer treated people with respect and love, as God would have us treat others, things turned out pretty good for him; when he attempted to impose his own personal political feelings, things tended not to work out as well.  Lischer does attempt to impose his own views quite often in the book--from the time he tried to have the American flag removed from the sanctuary of the church to his own biases concerning against &quot;restrictive&quot; tradition in the modern Lutheran church.<br />In sum, this has been an incredibly helpful book for me as I went about making my decision to enter the ministry.  Although this book is well worth the read, I did have problems as an ordained minister tended to write against traditional religion and I was disappointed to find that Lischer wrote little about the domestic ups and downs of pastoral work (he briefly mentions a fight he and his wife had concerning the amount of time spent working versus the amount of time spend with his family).

Ford focuses especially on evangelizing to Generation Xers.  One aspect of the book was excellent:  the section dealing with \\"who Generation X is.\\"  He has Generation X pegged.  The excerpt of a speech and Ford's own presented reserach have accurately depicted the fears, hopes, inconsistencies, and world-view of people in their late twenties and early thirties and showed how their values interconnect.  He also accurately presents the problems one faces when trying to speak to members of Generation X about the Christian faith, especially their apparent inability to see any need for a god since they already have everything they need (but not limited to that view).  As I've tried to speak with my friends about the Lord, I get resonses similar to the ones Ford points out to me.<br />Ford also does an excellent job of telling Christians what NOT to do when attempting to evangelize to Generation X, namely argue with them and/or force God into conversations.  This is good advice for witnessing to just about anyone.  Ford then suggests a method of witnessing that the apostle Paul had used:  becoming a living example of the Love that God the Father has for all people, the Grace that Jesus Christ displayed by taking the punishment for our sins as he died on the cross, and the Fellowship that the Holy Spirit creates among people who worship God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit.<br />While I do admire Ford's \\"thinking outside the box\\" in coming up with this simple method of witnessing, I wonder how effective it is.  Of the three fictional example stories Ford includes in the book, the only one that seems believable to me is the one concerning the Gen X sports reporter.  I cannot picture the Jewish television executive or the lawyer converting to Christianity as a result of the events in the fictional stories (two of the three conversions result as tragedy enters the lives of the characters--I imagine people will turn to almost anything that will fill a painful void in their lives).  Then again, I may be wrong.

This is very important for the author of a young adult novel not to do and Joan Bauer writes about cancer and politics, she challenges her readers to figure out or find out on their own what's going on.  She also creates some intersting, memorable characters.  Hope is an exciting, dynamic heroine, G.T. Stoop is the embodiment of goodness and kindness, and Eli Millstone is an excellent villian.<br />However, I suppose I expected more of a Newberry Honors Award winner.  This book wasn't superior to the other YA novels out there.  It had similar themes and situations (young girl begins to fall in love with a handsome guy; good vs. evil; ANOTHER young girl with a screwed-up family).  I'll tell you, if you want to write a new and refreshing novel, write one in which the main character's family is not screwed up in some way--make it a normal, funcional, supportive family!  No dead parents or siblings, no alcoholism or physical abuse, no absent family members.  I can't even remember the last YA book I've read where the family was a supportive nuclear family.  I digress.<br />The story is entertaining, but nothing that's going to open the eyes of a young reader or make her see the world in a different way.  It's just an entertaining story, nothing deeper.  A kid would do good to read it, but she would do better to read others.	2002-05-19

We can all think back to our grade school days and remember that one person who, for one reason or another, was picked on and could do no right in the eyes of the other class members.  In this book, the main character, Ludwig von Beethoven Carter (poor guy), is that guy from grade school who was a normal, accepted kid who got good grades.  However, he becomes the guy in the class who is picked on when his mother becomes the star of a silly, educational science show for kids.  In order to regain his popularity, Wiggy Carter keeps trying to change his image in order to be accepted by the \\"cool,\\" trouble-making kids.<br />While one looks at the title and cover of the book, he thinks that this is going to be a book written just for the amusment of the young reader.  However, I was happily surprised to see that this book deals with a lot of peer pressure issues and social issues that junior high students struggle with every day.  I highly recommend it to help put things in perspective for students.  They have to go through \\"drama\\" in the classroom every day and this book can really help them to look at the \\"queen bee\\" as well as the \\"nerd\\" in a new light.	2002-05-19

Stargirl Caraway is (on the surface), the nuttiest fruitcake in the school.  In Mica Area High School, where conformity is highly valued, Stargirl acts like an escapee from the insane asylum:  1850s Prarie Girl dresses, she has a pet rat, she plays the ukelele every day in the cafeteria, and, as the main character, Leo, finds out, she constantly goes out of her way to do things for other people:  she gives a small treat to every member of the school every holiday, she anonymously buys gifts for total strangers, and countless other acts of kindness.<br />So what does one do if he is forced to choose between being liked by his high school community in general and remaining loyal to Stargirl, the personification of kindness (who happens to be strange as strange can be).  This is a very well-written book.  Jerry Spinelli makes the reader feel very warmly toward Stargirl, resent the cruelity of the other students and yet struggle with Leo as he has to make a very difficult decision.	2002-05-19

All the reader knows at first is that Branwell, a junior high student, is institutionalized because he is unable to speak after a horrible accidnet involving his baby sister.  As the book progresses, Branwell's best friend devises a way to communicate with the silent Branwell and slowly figure out what happened to baby Nikki that fateful night.<br />This is another great example of an author that refuses to write down to the young reader.  He hooks that reader in the first chapter and takes him along on a great mystery novel.  The reader is forced to consider how important new information is, who's lying, and, at the same time, wonder about the fate of Nikki.  This book does have some mature content, so I wouldn't recommend it for readers under 11 or 12 (and they've got to be a mature 11 at that), but the small amount of mature content does not detract from this masterfully crafted novel.<br />Although I read YA novels because I'm a junior high literature teacher, I have a new respect for the YA novel, especially after reading this book.  Whether you're 11 or 111, you would do very well to treat yourself to this book.  HIGHLY recommended.	2002-05-19

To tell you the truth, in church every Sunday, the pastor would talk about how Baptism and Holy Communion forgive one of his sins, but I never really understood why.  I couldn't understand why a baby is Baptized when that baby obviously can't even understand the concept of &quot;I&quot; let alone the concept of a Triune God.  So, to find the answers to these questions, I turned to the Catechism.<br />I found the answers to why Communion and Baptism offers forgiveness of sins; I found the rationalle for Baptising babies (they can have a saving faith); I found answers to other questions that I have never thought of:  Even though we pray &quot;...and lead us not into temptation,&quot; God does not tempt us to sin; what each commandment really means, the relationship between obeying the Law of God and Grace/Forgiveness.<br />Now, if Luther had just sat down and wrote his own thoughts on all these subjects, the book wouldn't be worth the paper it was written on, but Luther makes sure he puts several verses from the Bible (none taken out of context), to show Biblical support for his answers.  It really helped me to understand my fait a little better.  It's little wonder that it's been in print for nearly 500 years.	2002-05-19

In response to the tragic death of his daughter and separation from his wife, Jack Dubois takes his son, Perry to a secluded, forested region of Minnesota, then becomes the stereotypical \\"silent tough guy.\\"  As a result, Perry (who is also home-schooled), has no friends and nobody to talk to.  He is self-reliant until a new family moves into the nearby Bennett House:  A large family of talkative artists from California.  Perry is upset about this (as I know I would be if talkative artists moved in next door to me), especially because  the only family memmber his age is a girl (ewwwwwww!).  Slowly, Perry and Jack open up to each other and build interpersonal relationships.<br />While I don't think this is Kristine Franklin's best book, it is a good one.  I taught it to my fifth graders who enjoyed it a lot.  One good thing about this book is the fact that Perry is a dynamic (changing), three dimensional character, so we can focus on him and how he changes during the novel, while the other characters are largely one-dimensinal.  This is not a criticism of the book:  it allows the young reader to identify with the characters and predict what his/her reactions will be (\\"Dad will say nothing, Willow will talk a lot and be annoying,\\" etc.), so that reading comprehnesion is easier.<br />In sum, I recommend this book because kids enjoy the story, the static characters make reading it easy and because it's generally an easy book to teach.	2002-05-19

While World War II is the turning point of the main character, John's, life,  comparitively little of the book deals with John's life as a soldier.  Instead, the book focuses on the period between Pearl Harbor (when John is 17), and when John turns 18 and can enlist.  The author paints an excellent picure of John as a young man doing normal, ordinary things.  He meets a girl (who is against the war), falls in love with her and makes plans of the future, when he is discharged.  THe war, however, changes John forever; he is not changed because of a physical wound or anything similar, but in ways I think it's best to let Cynthia Rylant explain.<br />Have I given away too much of the story?  I don't think so.  Like \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" the joy in this book is not the suspense that comes with the unfolding of the plot, but rather the prose and feelings evoked by the author.  Highly recomended!	2002-03-02

The premise sounded great: telling a familiar Bible story through the eyes of a minor character.  However, I was disappointed in some aspects of the book after actually reading it.<br />Julius Lester does some very good things in this novel:  he stays true to the Bible AND somes as close as he can to presenting the actual historical period.  When reading the author's notes at the end of the book, he explains some of the things he included (or avoided including) to make the book as historically accurate as possible.  I also very much like the \\"God is orchestrating things; He has a plan\\" theme that runs through the book.  It believe it would lead to some very good theological discussions.  The rivalry (and reasons behind it) are revealed so that the Biblical story of Moses is put in an easily imaginable historical context.  Finally, Lester's characters are highly developed and quite interesting.<br />Although this book is excellent for may reasons, I have decided against assigning to my students (5th) in the Lutheran school I teach in.  One reason is that one of the main characters (a twelve-year-old) talks about her breasts too much for the boys I teach to feel comfortalbe with.  Futhermore, being a male teacher, I don't think either the girls or I would feel comfortable reading such passages aloud in class.  I know that as girls become women, the size of their breasts are important to them, but it seems as if the majority of the young adult novels I read need to have the main character harp on her breast size and her menstrul cycle.  I'm sure Judy Blume is happy to see that so many current young adult novel authors have been influenced by her, but in following in Judy Blume's footsteps, authors tend to create a lot of books that teacher and his class can't read.  I digress, however.  Lester puts the breast-talk in a historical context; Almah discusses her breasts in such a way as to illustrate her maturity, her love for the sun, and her beauty.  She is also naked (sometimes dancing naked) at some points in the book.  If there were some passing references to her sexuality (or replace sexuality with beauty), the book would have been fine, but as it is, I would not assign it to my junior high students.ntext; Almah discusses her breasts in such a way as to illustrate her maturity, her love for the sun, and her beauty.

Paul Longmore has written an excellent book for the serious George Washington scholar.  George Washington is a difficult man to understand.  After reading five books on the man, along with several published books and articles on the Revolutionary War, Federalist Period, and biographies of other people who were active in Washington's days, I still have a hard time grasping why such a diverse group of people universally looked up to and respected Washington.  Edmund Morgan's book, \\"The Genius of George Washington\\" helped me to understand how Washington wielded power once it was attained, and this book helps to fill in the gaps as it describes how George Washington worked his way toward greatness.<br />Longmore's argument in the book is that George Washington was FAR from a minor player in his rise to fame.  It wasn't through a series of coincidences or through fate that Washington became the very embodiment of the American Revolution and Federalist Era.  Longmore argues that Washington had, in his youth, an insatiable lust for power...but would only seek to achieve it through socially respectable means (highly developed interpersonal skills didn't hurt, either).  It is through an examination of what constitutes \\"socially respectable,\\" Washington's writings, and examining the change in his tone as he matures that Longmore bases his premise.  In my opinion, he does a very good job of it.  His arguments are strong and backed up in an extensive end-notes section.  The only problem I have with his research is that I would have liked to see Longmore's view on two major incidences that happened in Washington's early life and how they affected his rise to fame:  the death of his older brother/patron Lawrence; and his marriage to the filthy rich widow, Martha Custis.  In all, Longmore has written an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone who would like to begin a serious study of the early life of the \\"First in War, First in Peace, First in the Hearts of his Countrymen.\\"<br />By the way, this is not a cradle-to-grave biography of Washington, but follows his life from birth until about the time he takes command of the Continental Army.n.\\"<br />By the way, this is not a cradle-to-grave biography of Washington, but follows his life from birth until about the time he takes command of the Continental Army.	2002-02-22

I've encountered many \\"counter-culture\\" teens like the main character, Ant (short for Antonia), who have the nicest parents, but seem troubled.  Their dress, actions and attitudes seem to shout, \\"I don't care.\\"  Rather than take the \\"I don't care\\" exterior and run with it, Choldenko writes in the first person from Ant's point-of-view, so that we can see the contrast between what Ant says and what Ant does; what Ant's goals and dreams are and how her actions (especially her constant lies and deceptions) prevent her from achieving those dreams.  Choldenko goes a step further, however.  She doesn't focus on Ant as the cause of, and solution to all of her problems.  She shows how her family contributes to, her problems through a lack of meaningful communication.  Far from being a down and negative book however, it is written with a rather light-hearted tone.  Choldenko includes many scenes inteded to put a smile on your face (the interactions with Harrison, for instance) and will quickly switch to a confrontation between Ant and her family.  The contrast serves to strengthen the different emotions.<br />I am seriously planning to assign this book to my sixth grade class to read.  I think they'll like it and it looks like they'll be able to identify with many of Ant's problems/thoughts (thus, making for great discussions of the book).  Unless I edit this review, assume that the book as assigned reading went VERY well.	2002-02-22

Happily, I've discovered a book that both students and history teachers (such as myself) will enjoy.<br />Students would enjoy this book because it's a good story.  It's a coming-of-age novel about a fourteen-year-old during the days of the great Yellow Fever epidemic in 1790's Philadelphia.  While those around her panic or die, Mattie (the main character) struggles to keep her head clear, her family safe, and her mother's house and business protected from robbers.  It's a life or death situation that follows a young girl as she rises to the occation.<br />American histoy teachers would also do well to either assign this book, or have it in her classroom library.  Andeson attempts to be historically accurate in her period novel, and succeeds.  Moreover, she mentions things that a history teacher can take and run with.  Why are President Washington, Secretaries Hamilton and Jefferson, and other federal government officials in Philadelphia, anyway?  What's all this talk about \\"bleeding\\" a sick person?  What's a necessary?  This would be a good choice to assign as a class novel as it can be used in both literature courses and history courses.  Highly recommended.	2002-02-11

Extensive works must be read and analyzed, both primary and secondary in order to find trends within similar institutions.  Furthermore, the longer the institution was in existance, the more documentation exists that must be sifted over in an effort to see how the institution has evolved over time.<br />With the difficulty of the task in mind, John Blassingame has done an excellent presenting his research in &quot;The Slave Community.&quot;  He successfully has used primary accounts of plantation owners, slaves and visitors of the Antebellum South to illustrate how plantation life really was.  I use the term, &quot;illustrate&quot; as opposed to &quot;paint a picture&quot; because it more accurately describes what Blassingame has done in his book.  He is straight forward in his approach.  His attitude is &quot;this is how it is.  Here is how I know.&quot;<br />But more than explain how plantation life was for the slave, he shows how African-American culture assimilated to general European-American culture over the generations.  He also makes extensive use of other social science disciplines including anthropology and psychology (especially when examining how plantation owners maintained order on their farms and how the slaves resisted the plantation owners).  Furthermore, I admire how Blassingame has respect for his reader.  In his forward style, he resists the temptation to moralize about the condition of the slaves and/or the barbarity of the whites.  Instead, he has respect enough for his reader to let him make up his own mind about the various aspects of the &quot;peculiar institution.&quot;  After reading this book, I have a hard time picturing anyone attempting to support the plantation owners.	2002-02-11

From corporate lawyer to tranvestite prostitute; from McDonald's Employee to CEO to professional hockey player; from UPS delivery person to Lutheran pastor this book runs the gamut of jobs.  The jobs are not put in the standard Q&A interview format where the reader can see what question is asked and how the interviewee responded, but rather put in a narrative form, making for a much quicker and enjoyable read.<br />One of the best aspects of this book was comparing and contrasting the various jobs:  how did the person end up with this job; what are his/her duties; what's daily life on the job like; what's the best and worst part of the job; do you like your job (nearly all answered yes); what the job holder's career goals are.  As someone currently looking at a career change, this book was not only entertaining, but useful in getting me to think about what other kind of stuff is out there (I had already eliminated \\"transvestite prostitute\\" from my list but this book was useful in strengthing my resolve to stick to that decision).	2002-01-31

It's not so much a story about John Steinbeck taking a trip, but rather a story of a trip, that happened to be told through the eyes of John Steinbeck.  Steinbeck, himself, often takes third billing to the miriad of unique individuals he encounters (French-Canadian migrant workers, mechanics, hotel keepers, actors, etc.) and the beautiful scenery that Steinbeck describes so well.<br />Other reviewers consider &quot;Travels with Charley&quot; the ramblings of a grumpy old man, but I disagree.  Yes, his age and his opinions come into play in this book, but the world is always going to be seen through the eyes of an individual.  This individual happens to be nearing the end of his life and is apt to compare the world as it is to the world as it was.  This comes into play during the meeting of a young man who works on a nuclear submarine and when Steinbeck visits his hometown.  Other times, Steinbeck comments on changing American opinions, such as his surprise that many Americans prefer to own a mobile home than own a piece of property--Steinbeck always believed that the stability that comes with a piece of land was superior to the advantages of mobility and he was curious to find out why the shift in attitudes.<br />As the book neared its end, however, it seems as if Steinbeck got really tired of the project.  His travels through the Deep South, during which time he encountered numerous racists was depressing.  Furthermore, the ending of the book was quite abrupt.  A book as good as this one deserved an ending with more effort put into it.  In all, I would recommend this book.  It's fast-paced (but with introspection, unlike &quot;On the Road&quot;), witty, and (with a few exceptions) makes you feel pretty good about being an American.	2002-01-26

I just didn't enjoy it	\\"Parrot in the Oven\\" is a pretty good book that sets out to portray life in the Barrio.  The action follows a high school underclassman, Manny, as he meanders through life.  There really is no climax in this book; it is a collection of stories, told chronologically and revolving around the same family.  Martinez's biggest success in this novel is creating a sense of apathy.  The title, \\"Parrot in the Oven\\" is to remind the reader of a fable in which a parrot is thinking to itself how hot it is in the shade, not realizing he's in an oven.  While the main character is by no means stupid (as the fable implies), he is disturbingly apathetic.  The reader clearly sees Manny in dangerous and destructive situations and becomes frustrated when he simply \\"goes with the flow,\\" and this, I believe, is the reaction Martinez is looking for.<br />In the opinion of this reader, flaws exist in the book, however.  While Martinez succeeds in creating a mood of apathy, I feel the book would have been more memorable if he presented some possible solutions to the problems of barrio life.  Furthermore, while the marketers call this a \\"coming of age novel,\\" I would disagree because Manny is too static for me to say that he went through a change.  Finally, while there is a lot of anit-white talk in the novel, the reason behind the racism is not explained.  If Martinez is going attempt to portray reality in his noven and have so many of his male characters bash whites, I would at least like it if he were to have a character attempt to explain Latino racism.  None of the characters do this, which does a dis-service to all races reading the book.	2002-01-23

This slow reader began and finished the book within a couple hours, but the length of time reading the book does not reflect how useful the book is.  Some of Dobson's main points are:  keep Christ as the center of your relationship (Dobson being an evengelical Christian, writing to others who strongly value Christ); make sure you see eye-to-eye on the big things and be prepared to get into big fights about little things; men and women think differently and it would benefit you greatly to learn the way the other sex thinks.  Dobson writes in a fluid style and liberally sprinkles in anecdotes, research, and selections from others' works to make his points.  In doing this, he makes his main points stand out and makes his book a fun, lighthearted one written about a subject that is anything but light.  Recommended.	2002-01-11

Upton Sinclair does an excellent job of presenting the characters, especially Jurgis and Ona in a way as to make the reader like them.  Who couldn't admire a strong, hard-working, optimistic man whose goal is simply to support his wife and family by doing an honest day's work for an honest day's wage?  Sinclair gets the reader to &quot;root&quot; for Jurgis, the underdog.  That's exactly the reason the reader will become greatly depressed as the forces of a capitalist society (as Sinclair sees it) slowly, slowly grinds Jurgis and his family down.<br />As Sinclair has Jurgis work in the meat-packing factories, live as a hobo, live as a beggar, work as part of the graft-generating maching, work behind the scenes during elections and finally work as a scab while the workers strike, Sinclair unveils more and more levels of corruption that was so characteristic of the late 1800s and early 1900s.  Sinclair's obvious goal is to make the reader wonder, &quot;how can any honest, hard working man survive when so many forces have an interest in surpressing such men?&quot;  The answer, according to Siclair is Socialism/Communism.<br />Towards the end of the book, when Sinclair presents this option, the entire book becomes more of a political pamphlet or piece of propaganda.  Such a novel deserved more of an ending.  Sinclair never tells the reader what ever becomes of Jurgis and the remaining members of his family--it is rather a call to arms for working people to join the Socialist movement in America and vote for the Socialist ticket.  A disappointing ending to an otherwise compelling and stirring book.	2002-01-05

As examples, shows the reader examples from Washingtons' life and letters with regards to national power, military power, foreign relations and the comperative power of nations and the power that comes with honor or respect.<br />This is a slim work, consisting of less than ninety pages, but these pages have done a great deal to flesh out my understanding of Washington the person.  Morgan has convinced me that Washington is a genius with regards to the understanding of power and the remoteness and aloofness that historians often find puzzeling is less an arrogant flaw than a deliberate calculated example of his understanding of power.  While this, as I have previously said, is not a &quot;fresh contribution,&quot; it is a contribution which sums up a difficult subject in an extremely well-written and engaging way.  I highly recommend it.	2001-12-27

While this book does have many good points, this isn't a book I would recommend.  The story would be very entertaining to a fifth grader but the vocabulary skills and difficulty understanding Paris or gypsies would frustrate a reader in this age group.  A sixth grader, however, would more easily comprehend the vocabulary (I admit that I didn't know many of the words and had to guess at their meaning in context--and I don't consider my vocabulary skills poor by any means) and cultural situations but they would be bored by the simplistic story.  In all, I would not recommend it not because it is a bad book, but because I think there are better choices out there.	2001-12-26

When the novel begins, Sarah is at an ebb in her young life--she feels self-conscious about her physical appearance (without tangents on breast size or her menstral cycle (thank you), making this a book very appropriate for a classroom) and her inability to interact in a meaningful way with the two most important women (read: role models) in her life--her older sister and her Aunt Willie, who is raising her.  It is during this coming of age process that Sarah's younger, mentally handicapped brother, Charlie wanders out of the backyard in the middle of the night and gets lost in the woods.  While the plot is relatively straight forward--Charlie gets lost and Sarah participates in a search to find him--this novel is an good one because of the excellent development of the main character.	2001-12-26

The author, Lou Cannon, comes from an interesting perspective--a reporter who covered the Reagan White House.  However, this book is not just a summary of the events covered by Cannon (resembling a memoir), but rather Cannon uses his personal and professional experiences as a springboard from which he throroughly researched the events of the Reagan Presidency.  Where Cannon's work shines brightest is in his treatment of foreign policy--he clearly conveys the delicacy of foreign relations, the role of the individual in policy decisions, and how foreign affairs is always in a state of flux.  However, where this book does not shine as brightly is the sections dealing with domestic policy.  Because Reagan relied so heavily on his staff, one has trouble keeping names, titles and relationships straight.  Furthermore, Cannon doesn't have the same logical continuity that he displays during the foreign policy sections.<br />There were other aspects of this book that I didn't enjoy.  One aspect being the length of the chapters.  Now, while this is clearly an idiosyncratic preference of this reader, seventy page chapters could and should be broken down into smaller chapters.  Furthermore, the author uses footnotes extensively.  I would estimate that two-thirds of the pages have a footnoted anecdote or other piece of narritive.  While footnoted narritive in general can be helpful sometimes, it seems as if Cannon or his editor simply didn't have the heart to cut information that didn't neatly fit into the general narritive.  Finally, I was confused for the first 250 pages or so as Cannon jumps between the running of the Reagan Administration, Reagan's background, anecdotes and statistics to illustrate Reagan's personality (the paragraphs using Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences was superb, by the way), background of the major players of the White House Team and previews of things to come was confusing and frustrating.  In all, I would recommend it to people with a particular interest and background in Reagan or his presidency, but not as a biography of Reagan (as its focus is more Reagan's staff than Reagan himself) or as someone's first Reagan book.(the paragraphs using Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences was superb, by the way), background of the major players of the White House Team and previews of things to come was confusing and frustrating.

This approach is perfect for a book in the &quot;...for Dummies&quot; line as it is usually what this line of books attempts to do as well.  In the case of this book, Morris succeeds very well.<br />Morris swings between a light and humorous narritive and a more serious tone frequently, making for an interesting read.  Furthermore, I enjoy the way he divids up his topics/chapters:  Often in the title, he asks a question, then takes you through the history of philosphers who have tried to answer the question.  Often, Morris &quot;stresses out&quot; the reader in the process (especially in &quot;How do we know that we know anything&quot;) section as he (the reader) struggles along with a seemingly logical argument that runs counter to prior beliefs.<br />While many have argued that Morris argues positively for the existence of God in the book, I would light-heartedly say a) havn't you learned after reading this book is that philosophy is about thinking hard about important questions and proving the conclusions you've come to?  Write Morris a letter or write your own book about your views on God b) this is just an introduction to philosophy.  It's intended more for people to get a bit of a handle on an intimidating subject--bringing philosophy to the masses, if you will and c) even if you believe the author's treatment of God is poor, the rest of the book overshadows this point.<br />In all, I recommend this book, especially to those of you who, like me, have friends that are philosophy majors and you have trouble keeping up with them in conversation because you don't get the following joke:  Rene Descartes walks into a bar.  The bartender says, &quot;do you want a beer?&quot;  Descartes replies, &quot;I don't think so...&quot;  then he disappeared.

With this in mind, I decided to read it myself to see what the buzz in the classroom was about.<br />As I first started reading this book, I was rather confused as to why the class enjoyed it so much.  To me, the book was pretty boring as Willo Davis Roberts develops her characters.  I expected a faster pace from a book entitled &quot;Hostage.&quot;  However, the pace quickens signifigantly when Kaci actually becomes a hostage.  It is at this point the tempo picks up and the book becomes very exciting.  Roberts does an excellent job of developing the rising action and  I've often found that when the rising action is so good, the climax lacks in excitement.  This is not the case with &quot;Hostage&quot; however as the climax lives up to its definition as the most exciting part of the book.<br />While this book is generally very good, I do have two minor complaints (aside from the slow beginning).  First, I found two typos in this book.  While that may not be a major problem, it does bother me when a professional company and a professional editor allow two typos to escape them in one book.  Second, I'm finding a disturbing trend, especially in young adult and children's books, of plugging other books within the narritive.  In &quot;Hostage,&quot; Roberts plugs two other books.  Trying to hock other books within the narritive is not only disappointing to see, it detracts from the story.	2001-11-28

His great-great-grandfather accidently got a curse placed upon him by a Madame Zeroni.  Since that time, what can best be described as &quot;bad luck&quot; has plagued the Yelnats family.  Stanley lives up to the family curse as he is arrested for stealing a pair of shoes belonging to a superstar athelete that was being auctioned off to support a charity.  The judge doesn't like the idea that someone would steal from a charity, so he throws the book at Stanley:  18 months of hard labor at Camp Green Lake.<br />Now, while Camp Green Lake may sound like a happy, fun-filled place, it's actually one of the hottest, dryest deserts in the world--it hasn't rained there in 110 years.  Forced to dig a five foot deep hole with a five foot diameter every day in the hot sun, Stanley slowly realizes that holes are being dug for a reason other than to &quot;build character.&quot;<br />This book is fast paced and really hooks the reader, especially the young reader.  It is well written, shifting between humor and drama (my class laughed out loud more than a couple times).  Sachar also shifts between past and present, at first confusing the young reader,  until Sachar includes and event to connect the two seemingly unrelated stories (again, a chorus of &quot;Oooooooh&quot;s from my class as they realize what &quot;sploosh&quot; really is and as they realize the connection between Madame Zeroni and Zero).  This really is an excellent book and I highly recommend it to any reader, no matter his or her age.	2001-11-17

Trina, the main character, is a typical sixth grade girl who feels the weight of the world on her shoulders as she watches her father fall deeper and deeper into clinical depression and worries about the state of her unborn sister (Trina's mother is 48 years old).  These are tough topics for a twelve-year-old to handle, and Trina does  have trouble adjusting and adapting to these problems--as well as dealing with the day-to-day problems of life by herself as she tries to give her parents time to sort through their problems by theirselves.<br />Franklin should be commended because she never resorts to &quot;talking down&quot; to her young adult reader.  Neither does she sound preachy or sugar-coat the story with an &quot;everything will turn out OK&quot; theme.  Indeed, the reader is never sure how the story will end.  Trina is often afraid, uncertain, and feels alone.  She feels compelled to give up certain &quot;kid&quot; things and takes an adult role in the house...yet seems to resent the fact that she has to make that choice.  Although this may or may not be what young adults in similar situations think or do, it is very easy to empathize with Trina; the reader is taken on an emotional roller coaster along with the main character.<br />In a side note, I met Kristine Franklin at a teachers' conference in Springfield, Illinois, in spring of 2001.  She was a very nice and personable lady and I'm happy to find that such a lady is such a talented writer.  Highly recommended.	2001-11-14

While they did take their religion very seriously (your life on earth does determine whether you will spend eternity in heaven or hell, after all; it's best not to take chances), they did have fun.  Bruce Daniels does an excellent job researching the relationship between Puritans and fun:  What did they do?;  How much time did they spend doing it?;  What DIDN'T they do that might surprise us?; Did some groups have fun one way while others had fun another way?; and the all important question for historians:  Why?<br />Two themes run through Daniels' work:  the Puritan ideal with regards to fun is that recreational activities should a)  not be sinful b)  give one rest so that he or she can serve the Lord more efficiently c)  be productive and d)  not be an end unto itself.  The second theme that runs through &quot;Puritans at Play&quot; is that, while the first generation of Puritans in America came pretty close to this ideal, as the years went on and New England became more heterogeneous, the ideal had great influence, but was viewed more as a guideline for recreation as opposed to a matter so grave as to have long-lasting (read: eternal) implications.<br />In this amazingly well-researched book, Daniels analyzed how reading (the ideal recreational activity in Puritan America), music, church related activities, public gatherings (such as public hangings or military  training days), dancing, eating, sex, bars, gambling, and sports (among others) fit into both the Puritan ideal and the Puritan reality.<br />The beauty of this book is that Daniels tackles such an all-encompasing subject with apparent ease.  I feel he has accomplished the goal he mentions in his preface, to write a book suitable for both the serious scholar and the recreational historian (although my one complaint is that his first chapter made for dry, difficult reading).  From Chapter Two on, Daniels introduces the reader to Puritans on their own ground, always making sure to put things in a cultural context.  I would definately recommend it to fellow amateur historians.y one complaint is that his first chapter made for dry, difficult reading).

O'Dell must again be complimented for getting into the head of this woman and successfully, smoothly taking the reader along as her world outlook changes.  He even pulled at my heartstrings a little when Rontu dies.<br />However, aside from the death of Rontu, O'Dell never really makes me care about the character.  I understand that this is a novel intended for young adults, but I suppose I expected more from a book that has won so many awards and has been raved about by so many of my colleagues.  While it is worth the short read, it didn't live up to my expectations.	2001-11-07
US	51636710	RSZCSWUXDEFIZ	0140434895	365726027	Great Expectations (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A celebration of the middle class	I don't think I'd be giving away much of the plot if I were to say that the story revolves around Pip, a young, middle class orphan who has dreams to be a wealthy, respected gentleman, but has no hope of this as he is a rural blacksmith apprentice.  His prospecs change,  however, when a mysterious, anonymous benefactor offers to make Pip's dream a reality.  I won't give away the ending, but the novel supports Dickens' belief that the middle class is the class to which people should aspire.<br />The plot of this story wasn't to my liking.  Dickens' attempts towards the end to wrap all the subplots into one neat little package annoyed me...similar to plot twists in modern Hollywood movies--things so outrageously convienent that it makes one want to roll his eyes.  The manner in which things are written, however is fantastic.  While the main characters are rather boring, the minor characters, (especially Biddy, Herbert Pocket, and John Wemmick) were much more interesting.  Thankfully, Dickens focused on them enough to flesh them out and make them memorable.  I would recommend this book, not because I enjoy the plot, but because the writing style is superior and because I, being lower middle class, enjoyed the positive viewpoint Dickens extended concerning my class.	2001-11-07

Let me first say that I'm a George Washington fan.  I've read a few biographies of &quot;the first in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen,&quot; and was excited to find this work was available in Amazon.com.  Not only would I own the only book Washington ever wrote (although it was written at age 14 and was supposed to be a personal list of do's and do not's, not a book), but I would gain valuable insight into Washington's personal mannerisms as he consulted his old list frequently.<br />I suppose it's my fault for not carefully reading the info that Amazon.com posted.  The book is a whopping 30 pages and has 110 Rules, many of which consist of only one sentence.  Furthermore, most of the Rules are things that we do without thinking.  One rule advises the reader not to speak &quot;with meat in your mouth&quot; or &quot;Put not off your clothes in the presence of others, nor go out of your chamber half dressed.&quot;  If you regularly discuss current events while a chicken leg is dangling from your teeth or serve a cold beer in your underware (unless, of course, you work at a gentleman's club), you might benefit from this book.<br />But I weakly attempt humor.  Most of the rules, while they are common sense, remind us of  how we, over 225 years later, should interact with people.  Other rules advise us not to give medical advice to friends if we're not a doctor, you frustrate the sick.  Don't be too hasty to spread news of someone else's misfortunes.  In a business relationship, make conversation quick and to the point, yet not cold or unpleasant.  While I admit that a few (five, maybe) are very outdated, many of these rules are very useful.  The small size of the book allows for it to be carried in a purse or briefcase easily so that you can frequently look at it.  In sum, if you have the money to burn, I say, get the book.  It's helpful and insightful.  If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't get it as I don't think it's worth the money.y.	2001-11-03

I'm not a big fan of Native American culture nor any kind of mythology.  I've been to Baraboo, Wisconsin, and (being a life-long city boy), didn't really like it.  So the fact that I gave a book about these vary subjects five stars should say something about the author's talent.  It was very difficult to put this book down.<br />Horan wrote from the outset that, &quot;things are not what they seem,&quot; preparing the reader for a surprise ending.  This really engaged me as I looked for various hints and clues.  The great majority of the book is written in the form of a letter from Leslie Siconski to his sister and brother-in-law concerning the final few years of their recluse brother, Charlie.  As Charlie's life and untimely death are slowly reavealed, this reader could not help think of it as a prelude to some greater story.  Charlie's life tells of several conflicts which the reader assumes will be resolved by Leslie, even as he approaches the end of this 264 page work.<br />If I were to offer a couple items that I disliked about the book, one would be the vocabulary.  I consider myself to have an excellent vocabulary (at least that's what Reader's Digest tells me in their vocabulary quizes).  However, Horan's vocabulary dwarfs mine considerably.  There were more than a few times I had to grab my trusty dictionary to figure out what he was trying to tell me.  Also, many of the chapters end in a poem written by the late Charlie Siconski.  While I understand the poem exists to give the reader insight into Charlie's mind and add to his &quot;spirituality,&quot; I'm not a poetry fan and was slightly frustrated when a good chapter ended with a poem.  However, this is more a fault of the reader than the author.  Horan has written an excellent book and I highly recommend it to you.	2001-11-03

As a little shaver, I never especially enjoyed this type of light, comical book.  Yes, I was a bit of a nerd, even back then.  So, now that I'm a 24-year-old nerd, why did I decide to read a book intended for 4th graders?  1)  because I teach fifth and sixth grade now and the reading level of the book wasn't that far off.  Why not see what the kids are reading these days?  2)  because it was sitting on the desk of the former 4th grade teacher's classroom where I eat my lunch and I was bored.  So, why not read it.<br />The book really wasn't that bad considering it was written for someone 14 years younger than me.  The hero of this line of books, Wally McDoogle, is a klutz and, quite often, he trips or stumbles, etc. setting off a chain of events culminating in some great disaster.  Bill Myers is very talented when it comes to explaining in a believable way (to the ten-year-old mind) how sneezing can humorously result in a destroyed room and a computer that has a unique glich--whatever is typed into the computer becomes reality.<br />Myers also inserts a moral, Christian message in this and every other of the Wally McDoogle books, making it a fun read and assisting in character education.  It's nice to see the redeeming, Christian social value of the book.  Myers also develops some humorous moments.  My personal favorite, although I'm not sure if it's intended, is when Myers shamelessly plugged another book in the Wally McDoogle series into the narrative of this book.<br />While the idea of a compuer that creates reality is an excellent idea, I'm not sure that 4th graders of 2001 would appreciate the importance of the computer bug being a Millennium Bug.  I really doubt that he or she would even understand the now-historical term.  Aside from that, the book is pretty entertaining.  If I were to buy one of Myers's books of the Wally McDoogle line for a youngster, I'm not sure I would pick the Millennium Bug one, but would look to others.  All-in-all, I would probably recommend to a kid, a different book, but would not be disappointed at all if the kid chose to read this book.y recommend to a kid, a different book, but would not be disappointed at all if the kid chose to read this book.	2001-09-17

I feel I should start off this review by saying that I bought and read this book because I enjoyed the movie so much (and it's rare when I actually like a movie I see).  In every case, when I watch a movie and read the book version, the book version is superior.  However, this is not the case for &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  My biggest problem with the book was the genre in which it is written.  The narrative is quick, with short paragraphs, constantly shifting between describing the action and waxing philosophy (more on that later).  This technique made it difficult for me to empathize with the unnamed main character.  While Palahniuk did succeed in making me feel the despair and frustration of insomnia, it was much more difficult to understand the tragedy of having a split personality, knowing that you're being followed and tracked, or the frustration that must accompany why strangers are calling you &quot;sir&quot; and treating you with uncommon respect.  Also, the most interesting and developed character is Marla.  While I do appreciate her character, I would have preferred a more developed main character or Tyler Durden.<br />There are, however, some very good aspects of the book as well.  I have read this book being compared to &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and &quot;On the Road&quot; because it's so representative of my generation (indeed, the quick pace reminded me of &quot;On the Road&quot;).  In many ways, I agree with this comparison as Palahniuk addresses many issues and frustarations unique of Generation X:  being bombarded by violence; constant pressure from advertisers and commercialism; empty feelings that result from a consumer culture; the fact that we are &quot;a generation of men raised by women&quot; and thus have a self-identity conflict and others.  While I can't identify with Tyler Durden's rant that we are &quot;God's middle children,&quot; without a special place in history and that it would be better for us to be noticed for being bad than not be noticed at all, I imagine that many in my generation can identify with that remark.  In all, I would recommend the book to members of my generation as it addresses topics that the movie does not, but I would also strongly advise you to watch the movie first and to talk to others about the topics raised.  It can't help but assist us in making sense of our generation and our time.t be noticed at all, I imagine that many in my generation can identify with that remark.

While the biographies don't do much in the way of helping the reader understand everyday colonial life, they do aid in allowing one to understand other aspects of colonial life.<br />The best written are the biographies of Pocahontas by Kathleen Brown; Rev. John Cotton, Jr. by Sheila McIntyre; Bryan Sheehan by Margaret Connell Szasz; and Lewis Morris, Jr. by Michael Watson.  Brown presents an example of early European-Amerindian relations and shows us the difficulty of determining what sources are truth versus what is self-promotion or legend.  Cotton is a pastor twice accused of marital infidelity.  His story gives us examples of how Puritans dealt with sinful citizens, of efforts to spread the Word of God to Amerindians, and of the importance of communication between community leaders.  The story of Bryan Sheehan is an intersting read.  We so often read success stories in American immigration.  Sheehan is definately a failure:  Roman-Catholic (and thus treated poorly in New England) and unable to hold a job with any promise of financial security, Sheehan joins the British Army during the French and Indian War.  He survives several horrible battles to discover that, upon hearing a rumor of Sheehan's death, Bryan Sheehan's wife married another man and had a child by him.  The Lewis Morris biography gives us an example of pre-Revolution politics in America.  Of special note was the Anne Hutchinson biography by Marilyn Westerkamp.  While it is obvious that her research was excellent and she succeeded in showing the reader that Hutchinson's popularity threatened the social order (e.g. she became too powerful and the religious leaders felt threatened) and the depth of Hutchinson's intelligence, Westerkamp didn't quite succeed in proving that Hutchinson's activities were not tolerated because she was a woman.<br />The only two biographies I didn't enjoy were the biographies of French missionary Gabrial Segard and Amerindian translator Isabel Montour.  The biographical information available on the former is not exactly extensive, making for a confusing biography.  With regards to the latter, it is probably more a fault of the reader that he didn't care about the role of a translator in English-Native politics.<br />Finally, in my opinion, not enough attention was paid to slavery in the American colonies.  Olaudah Equiano was the only biography of a slave in this anthology, and it can hardly be said that his life was typical.  A biography of some other person involved in slavery would have been informative as well--be it a slave, slave owner, slave trader, slave-master, slave-owner-turned abolitionist, etc.  This could have been done at the expense of one of the many European-American cultural brokers biographies.Gabrial Segard and Amerindian translator Isabel Montour.

Possibly have a discussion with him about history or baseball?  I would recommend to you &quot;Honus and Me.&quot;  Although it is predictable, corny and slightly far-fetched, it was a fun read.  The author researched the subject and era and tries to present historical information as accurately as possible (as a history teacher, thank you!), and even discussed his research at the end.  The result, an adult/mentor is able to talk about the work a historian does (or even extend it to a talk on the scientific method) and use a subject that is usually not considered &quot;historically important&quot;, but is fun for boys--baseball.

With nearly 300 reviews for &quot;On the Road&quot;, I figured one more can't hurt.  One of my favorite teachings of our Savior, Jesus the Son of God, is that we shouldn't worry about the future or where we're going to live in ten years or what how we're going to find something to eat or will my boss get mad at me, etc. etc., because our Father in Heaven is looking out for us.  A sparrow can't fall from the sky without the knowledge, moreso, the will of God.  And what is more important in God's eyes, a sparrow, or man, who was created in God's image?<br />Why do I refer to the Bible? Because above is the main theme of the book, as expressed (secularly) by Dean Moriarty.  However, while Jesus used this example to illustrate God's love and encourage Christians to focus on serving God and helping others (not worrying about money and such), Sal and Dean use it as an excuse of sorts to be irresponisble, hard-drinking, sex-driven guys on four very impressive road trips.  As Dean says, it's silly to worry because whatever you do or whatever happens to you, everything is going to turn out just great.  While the hedonism displayed in the book is not exactly my favorite aspect of it, the book also has other qualities worth discussing.<br />The pace of the book is interesting.  Kerouac tends to use a quick pace when important or painful events are discussed and omits emotion and detail (e.g. Lee's wife overdosing, a bar fight in Colorado), but other, seemingly less signifigant details are emphasized (e.g. the opera seen in Colorado, the nature of grapes in Southern California, the all-night debate between Moriarty and Carlo Marx).  It serves two points:  it keeps with the themes of finding pleasure and tries to show that even the seemingly earth-shattering events in one's life are just part of the flow or continuing story.<br />I ramble on.  I think the book might be worth a read if you're interesting in reading about the exploits of the above mentioned men or if you're interested in the above mentioned theme.  However, if you're looking for descriptions of places in America or something along those lines, don't bother.  I found this book only moderately worth reading.terested in the above mentioned theme.

He seems to me to be arrogant, egotistical and has a habit of refusing to listen (with any real seriousness) to differing views on a subject once his mind is already made up.  I still hold these views, but Remini presents to us a man who is much more than the one-dementional figure described above.<br />Like most, I have low expectations of a book that is a one volume version of mulitple volumes (Remini cut 1600+ pages into under 400).  They tend to simply give a recap of the events of the subjects life without much explaination or connection between events.  Happily, Remini's book does not fit that stereotype.  In the introduction, Remini says that he keeps in mind that this will most likely be read casually by people mildly familiar with Jackson.  He therefore specifically points to events in Jackson's life and tell the reader, &quot;this is important because later Jackson will remember this and...&quot;  He does this from the earliest days of Jackson's life; admitting that Jackson was a bully of sorts, Remini also says that he might not be so abrasive if he had the influence of his father (who died before Jackson was born) or if he didn't have to rely on charity from his uncles and aunts to survive.<br />Through this technique, Remini gives the reader a fuller view of Jackson and how the many circumstances of his life come together to produce a unique man.  Along with the man's characteristics mentioned in the first chapter, Jackson is also extremely patriotic, devoted to the Christian religion, slightly paranoid, in constant pain from bullets lodged in his body and a refusal to let himself rest, a workaholic, and an excellent strategist.<br />While I do agree with some that Remini could have elaborated more with regards to certain issues (the question &quot;Was Jackson right to attack the bank?  What were the long lasting effects?  Were there other options?&quot; etc.), it was not especially necessary, considering his goal was to introduce people to Jackson's life, not so much his life and times or legacy.<br />In sum, this is an admirable one volume treatment of one of America's most complex United States presidents and war heroes.  If you're looking for a one-volume biography of Jackson, I don't imagine you would find many better.necessary, considering his goal was to introduce people to Jackson's life, not so much his life and times or legacy.<br />In sum, this is an admirable one volume treatment of one of America's most complex United States presidents and war heroes.

John Adams is no exception in this regard.  When we meet someone new, one of the first questions we ask (or are asked) is &quot;What do you do for a living?&quot;  This is not surprising because most people base their identity off what they spend 40 or so hours a week doing.  Furthermore, we base our initial opinions of others based on their jobs.  When we become friends with a person, however, their career becomes secondary to (but not independant of) their personality and values.  When I say that David McCullough treats John Adams as a friend, I mean that he focuses primarily on Adams' values, advice, examples of how he put his values into practice.  Rather than get a lesson on the Declairation of Independence, McCullough tells the reader what John Adams role in the formation of the document was and how his values (anti-slavery sentiment for example)contribute to the result.  And while Adams' career is discussed at length, the most enjoyable aspect of the book comes in the form of advice that John and his &quot;dearest friend&quot; and wife Abigail give to their children and to each other.  In sum, McCullough gives us a well written biography about the life, career and wisdom/values of a man from New England named John Adams.  I highly recommend this book; your opinion of the second president of the United States will be raised as a result and his practical advice will be appreciated.	2001-07-08

Although the strategies suggested for resume and cover letter writing (getting an interview and job) are nothing new, the second half of the book in which the authors describe five different career tracks are excellent in that they are directed specifically towards History Majors.  While I originally pictured history majors going into either professional historian-type jobs (e.g. professors, authors) or classroom teaching, the authors very correctly pointed out that historical museums and other pubic education institutions are in need of people with history backgrounds as are businesses, etc.  The advice is practical and the information proved to be very specific for me--a history major.

I just assumed from the clips that I had seen that Dr. Frankenstein went to the cemetary, stole body parts, created a monster, the monster escapted and the story climaxed as a group of townsmen find the monster and lynch it.  How happily wrong I was and what a sad mockery the story has become.  Instead of finding a plodding flat-headed creature with an IQ of 3, the monster is actually something worse--he's still 9', but he's agile, possesses superhuman strength and agility and worse of all, he's much superior in intelligence to his creator.  He is witty, is accomlished in persuasive speaking, quotes poetry and is determined to spend his horrible existance (he has nothing better to do--none can bare to look upon him as he is so horribly disfigured) stalking Dr. Frankenstien and making him suffer if he does not create another companion.  This Monster is much scarier and worthy of a great story than Hollywood's plodding oaf.  Shelly does an excellent job of pulling this reader in and struggling along with Victor Frankenstein as he debates the options in this lose-lose situation (slow destruction of his family vs creating a potentially more evil companion for his evil creation).  I had no problem suspending my disbelief and greatly enjoyed the characters (I especially enjoyed slowly watching Victor Frankenstein grow sick and insane with worry) that Shelly creates.  Aside from the Bible, if I could recommend any book, right now it would be Frankenstein.	2001-07-01

First, he tackles a topic that has not traditionally been looked at--teenagers who, during the Great Depression, decided for one reason or another, to leave their homes and families and illegally travel from city to city in trains.  More than give a staight-through narrative as most authors do, he allows the rail riders to tell their own stories.  Uys arranges the narratives (a chapter long, usually three in a row), then inserts his own chapter of commentary pointing out similarities and differences in the stories he's researched.  What results is something that can be thought of as a book discussion group, where Uys is a participant.  Uys simply points out many of the interesting aspects of the stories and sometimes other things he's researched while leaving the powerful first person narritive alone.  Through this the reader can see not only the historical context and big picture (usually thanks to Uys), but also the smaller details that many third-person book length narratives might leave out--the long, maddening hours one would experience if he was unfortunate enough to hop on a car with a flat wheel (constant jackhammer-esque pounding for hours upon hours, preventing sleep or comfort of any kind); the looks on people's faces or tones of voices as they offer to help or chase away hobos; the story of the lady who called the police on a starving young begger as she fed some stray animals instead; the many anonymous people who paid for meals for starving teens; watching a fellow teenager die after he tried to jump onto a moving car, fell and had his legs severed by the train's wheels and the list can go on.  This book was an interesing and moving one as Uys and his interviewees show both the freedoms and the dangers of riding the rails.  As an interesting side-note.  I decided to read this book afters seeing a documentary on MTV about modern day Rail Riders (&quot;Travelers&quot;).  Knowing that a similar subculture of people still exist, experiencing the same freedom and dangers (added to it a sense of confusion and hopelessness) made the book that more moving.  I would recommend it.subculture of people still exist, experiencing the same freedom and dangers (added to it a sense of confusion and hopelessness) made the book that more moving.

After all, one would not expect a pioneer in Play Therapy to write about a failure in that particular field (thank you for pointing that out Ms. Ban).  The book is entertaining in the same way a mystery novel is entertaining--slowly, as Ms. A gains Dibs' trust, we understand the frustrations of living in a family intent on keeping up appearances.  Indeed, one can assume that the more &quot;trouble&quot; Dibs is to the family, the more they try to cover their problem child up, making matters even worse...but I digress.  The evolution of Dibs from a totally introverted ball of anger, confusion, and fear into an outgoing, affectionate genius makes it as gripping as a fast paced fiction novel, but it warms the heart as well.  What other reviewers point out holds true as well--if people took the time to listen and extend a helping hand, especially to those who are introverted or &quot;trouble cases&quot;, this world would be much better.	2001-06-30

Whether the egg came first or the chicken did, however, only Amis can answer.  I do believe that the author succeeds in showing the reader that the only time the narrator finds fufillment is in the death camps.  When Friendly is in private practice in America, the narrator is angered every time a prefectly healthy patient begins seeing Friendly, then becomes sicker and sicker until the patient leaves near death, rarely to be seen again (telling the story backwards) or how his long time girlfriend arrives to a perfectly clean house, then procedes to dirty the dishes, windows, carpet, etc.  The only time the narrator inside Friendly's head feels good about the events going on around him is when bodies are brought to Friendly for him to make living humans.  In all, it's the strangest book I've read (made much easier once I started reading skipping a few pages and reading the dialoge the in &quot;correct&quot; order), but worth reading in that it gives the reader something to think about:  is this an accurate representation of how Nazi doctors saw themselves?	2001-06-30

It is true to say that Roosevelt believed in hard work and that he expected it of others, but simplifying Roosevelt by simply calling him a rugged individualist ignores the complexity of the man.  H.W. Brands does an excellent job of keeping with the rugged individualism theme while illuminating other aspects of Roosevelt's life.  While I picked up the book having a great respect and admiration for the man, when putting Brands' book down, I had to admit that I wasn't sure anymore.  Brands' Roosevelt to me seems moderately egotistical, slightly unbalanced and thoroughly unique in that he didn't conform to what others expected of him.  Add to that Roosevelt's intense patriotism and personal insecurity and you have a man who is much more intersting.  He ceases to be the face on Mt. Rushmore, and more an object of pity...at least in the humble view of this reviewer.  I recommend this book, especially for those who are more interested in getting to know a person than getting to know a president.	2001-06-30

Each chapter is divided into two parts:  1) Primary sources  2)  Two or three scholarly articles (usually written by an expert in the field).  Each source or article is designed to act as a springboard for classroom discussion lead by the professor.  In all, I like the format of the line of books and enjoyed it when a professor assigned it as a text.  I'm so nerdy, in fact, that I've bought a couple books from the &quot;Major Problems&quot; lines to read for pleasure. This particular title in the series was compiled by a former professor of mine, Steven Riess.  He succeeds in putting together a series of documents that enlighten, challenge opinions and, in all, provide a wealth of information while leaving no clear cut answers.  Favorites include essays on why sports were restricted in colonial New England (because of religions reasons or for practical/safety reasons?), the interview with Muhammad Ali, and Chapter 14: The Business of Sport (highlighting the benefits, drawbacks and inside deals involved in big money major leagues).  Riess also succeeds in giving legitimacy to the study of sport--think of all the money spent on tickets, all the air time, advertisements, etc. that are involved in modern sports.  Sports IS a major part of American society and Riess helps to present its rich history and evolution.  This is a college text book--not something one would take to the park with them on a Sunday afternoon to read under a tree, but this was not  Riess' intention.  Clearly, he hit the mark he was aiming for.	2001-06-30

First, it has characters that young adults like to read about--high schoolers, cheerleaders, football players, etc.  Strasser also includes minor characters for break away from the action or for comic relief.  I know my students enjoyed the characters, especially the girls who enjoyed the interaction between them and the fact that the progagonist is a female.  Second, it deals with things that many young adults should know more about and/or have strong feelings about:  the Holocaust and peer pressure.  Discussing Nazi-ism with my class prior to reading the book caused them to ask many of the questions that the characters asked.  The book helped them to understand the Holocaust better and lead to a discussion about peer pressure and the importance of setting your limits clearly before someone in high school pressures you into something (drugs, drinking, sex, stereotyping).  Finally, it's a well written book.  It has short chapters (everyone likes those), it's fast paced (because the book takes place over a week or so) and the main points are easilly understandable because the author has the characters repeat important information in different ways several times to make sure the young adult reader is not getting lost in sub-plots.  In all, an excellent work that more parents or other adults should read with their children.	2001-06-30

I have to compliment the author on the first chapter of the book--we are introduced to the as-yet-nameless main character.  Immediately the reader feels both pity and admiration for the boy who has no family, name or anyone to care for him.  However, through the force of his own wits and will survives traveling across the country assisting in harvesting.  Just as a minor character, the first we know of to care for the boy, is about to give him a name...the unexpected happens (I won't ruin it).  The first chapter will hook the young reader (or in this case, the older reader), and lead him to a sheepherding ranch in Montana where the book turns to themes of family, responsibility, forgiveness and persistance.  I would recommend it for teachers, parents and young adults.	2001-06-30

I suppose Mick Foley (aka Dude Love, Cactus Jack and Mankind)  benefited from this reader's low expectations.  This is not just a book  about professional wrestling, although we readers will get a healthy dose  of it, but about the personal life of Mick Foley as well.  The best part of  the book is Foley's high school and college days.  I've heard people say  that you never read an autobiography of a loser.  Only &quot;great  people&quot; write autobiographies.  Now, I am reluctant to call Foley a  loser, however, he freely admits that he was not part of the in crowd.  In  high school language, Foley would be called a dork.  He's goofy, has an  obsession with male genetalia, rock music, professinal wrestling and women  (which he has absolutly NO luck with).  Furthermore he writes in a  stream-of-consienceness style that indicates that he is fully aware of his  less-than-stellar public standing, wishes he was more popular, yet accepts  the fact that he is who he is.  From the beginning, Foley establishes  himself as a person who we can all identify with.  His days as an  independant (read:  poorly paid, minor league) wrestler makes for  interesting reading, as does his days in his first major organization, WCW,  and as he wrestles for major promotions in Japan.  However, as he moves  into ECW and the WWF, Foley tends to assume that the reader is familiar  with this time of his life and the wrestling fan sub-culture in general.  This, actually is my biggest criticism of the book:  Foley tends to assume  that the reader has a previous knowledge of professional wrestling.  This  reader happens to know a good deal of it, but if Foley hoped to acheive his  goal of having non-wrestling fans read the book and gain a respect for the  work pro wreslters do, I imagine he will fall short because of the  previously mentioned criticism.  While Foley did succeed in raising the  reputation of professional wrestlers in this reader's eyes (some of the  &quot;bumps&quot; he and others take during matches for the entertainment  of the fans is simply amazing), I believe others will become confused  reading the book.  In all, this easy-to-read autobiography is an excellent,  entertaining and thought provoking work from a man whose line of work is  generally not respected in society.

To put  it simply, Conroy examines the dynamics of torture:  how it is done, what  kind of person tortures others and why, and what is the affect of torture  on the person actually tortured.  Conway uses an excellent method of making  his points in that he decides on an aspect of torture he wants to examine  (e.g. the effect of torture on the tortured), gives details of three actual  torture event (always Belfast IRAs tortured by British, Palastinians  tortured by the Israeli army, and a black cop-killer tortured by Chicago  police), then draws conclusions from them.  This is not to say that he  limits himself and his studies to these three events; far from it.  Conroy  interviews victims from these tortures and many others.  One of the most  intersting aspects of the book is when Conroy examines the question of who  tortures.  He interviews several persons who tortured (including members of  South American armies, a U.S. soldier in Vietnam, a British agent in  Africa, etc.) and determined that they have the remarkable ability to  rationalize what they have done.  Conroy even admits that the majority of  the torturers are cordial, likable people.  He then presents, through  describing scientific experiments that all people have the ability to  torture, because people have the ability to rationalize actions that they  consider inconsistant with their general opininos of themselves.  I could  go on as Conroy draws several fascinating conclusions about various aspects  of torture.  However, one aspect of this book that this reader had problems  with concerns Conroy's handling of the Chicago Police aspect of this book.  While in other portions of this book, the author is surprisingly objective,  in the Chicago case, Conroy's bias shines through.  Conroy spent years  researching this case for his newspaper and it seems as if his reputation  as a journalist depends on coloring the judge as inept and the entire case  as racist.  I find this aspect of the book to be an unprofessional result  of typical journistic arrogance.  In all, an excellent, thought provoking,  highly recommended book.reputation  as a journalist depends on coloring the judge as inept and the entire case  as racist.

This is my first full length account of the Great War and I feel I know more about the Battles of Ypres, Verdun, Somme, etc.  I also  know more about &quot;Mustard Gas&quot; and the European political  situation that led to the Great War.  I also think that Keegan accomplished  his goal of overwhelming me with staggering death counts for inches of  land.  I found myself asking &quot;why all this death for nothing?  Can't  the generals see this is insanity.  Why don't they see the same old  strategy is not working?&quot;  While I believe this is Keegan's goal,  should it have been?  As a professional military historian and author of  several other books on military history, wouldn't Keegan serve the world  more by trying to explain why, to get inside the generals' minds, to  explain strategies?  He does very little of any of this.  At one point  Keegan begins to explain some very intersting aspects of British General  Haig's religon and how he used it to cope with the gut-wrenching death  count.  I confess I also became quite angry towards the end of the book  when I realized the extent to which Keegan glossed over American  involvement in the war.  He describes one American battle, but quikly  points out that the AEF only captured 13,000+ Germans because the Germans  were caught by surprise.  Isn't that one of the goals of attacking armies?  Keegan's anti-American bias is also evident in his listing the death tolls  of the involved nations...except America's.  Finally, I find it very  unprofessional that Rommel (of WWII) is mentioned more then American  General John Pershing and that Keegan devotes more space describing  memorials and gravesites than he does to American soldiers.  One reviewer's  comment that one should have a prior knowledge of European geography to  understand the troop movements of 1914 hold true and Keegan devotes too  much time to the movements of individual armies, companies, etc. and not  enough to exciting and enlightening primary source accounts.

Let me start with the good things about this work:  Yohannan has an excellent perspective on how to most effectively spread the Gospel of my Lord, Jesus Christ.  I'll use the example Yohannan does:  When a Krishna  missionary at the airport runs up to you wanting to talk to you about the  Krishna religion, you probably take a look at his flowered robes, shaved  head, etc. and think to yourself that this foreign religion isn't for you.  This is how a great majority of Asian people react when a Western  missionary runs up to then saying something about Jesus Christ.  A much  more effective way to spread the Word is through having Indian missionaries  preach to fellow Indians, Thai missionaries preach to other Thais, etc.  Fantastic idea. Bad parts about the book:  &quot;To achieve this goal,  donate $30-$120 dollars per month to Gospel for Asia&quot;.  If mentioned  just a handful of times, I wouldn't have minded the plugs at all, but  Yohannan crammed it down my throat.  Furthermore, Yohannan's had more  devine revelations than Moses has.  A simple fact is that the Lord chooses  not to reveal himself directly to his flock anymore...except K.P. Yohannan.  The man attracts miracles, which makes me wonder if he is being completely  truthful in the autobiographic portions of his book.  Another interesting  inconsistancy:  did you know when you translate a song from an Indian  language to English, it still rhymes?  I didn't.  In one of Yohannan's last  chapters, he states that, when it comes to Christianity, the means are  equally important to the ends.  I then wonder why Yohannan had to create  fictional events to further his great idea concerning effective witnessing.	2000-06-27

Let me start witht the good points:  It is meticulously researched.  It told me everything I wanted to know about this 8 year period and then some.  Adams succeeded in showing  the reader how time flowed during this period--that is, he did not say  &quot;this happened, then this then that, the end&quot; but rather drew  upon the past and showed that these events evolved from prior events.  He  also gives new insights on the Louisiana purchase, Chase impeachment and  Chesepeake and Leopard incident.  Lots of great information.  Drawbacks:  1252 pages.  I thought I'd never finish the book and at times found myself  looking at my bookshelf thinking &quot;I could have read three books in the  time it took me to read this one.&quot;  but I think that's more of a fault  of the reader then of the book.  Adams focuses more on foriegn policy than  I would have liked (another fault of the reader) and has a habit of  introducing a person by his full name and title (e.g. George Canning) and  then calling him Canning every time thereafter in the book.  With the HUGE  amount of Congressmen, Senators, ambassadors and members of the gov't of  France, Spain and Englan, etc, etc, etc, keeping the names straight can be  a very confusing task.  While the quotes he uses are good, I feel he uses  quotes too often, to the point where they detract from the usually  excellent prose.  I'm glad I read it, but I think I would be happier if I  would have used my time to read other books.  Finally, this is not a book  for the casual reader of history.  Only serious students of early America  would find this book worth while (in my humble opinion).	2000-06-19

He remembers seeing the fire from his house a few blocks away, but doesn't like to talk about it.  One man my dad used to  work with was actually on the run that put out the fire.  He also refuses  to talk about it.  Why do I mention that?  Because it illustrates the most  powerful part of the book for me:  the fact that the fire still haunts  those whose lives were affected by it.  The authors did an excellent job  researching the fire and give a gripping account of how/where it started,  when the children and nuns realized the danger they were in and the efforts  to save their own lives as well as the lives of their friends.  Then the  book turns to the aftermath of the fire.  Did you ever wonder how the  parents of the deceased reacted when they were finally given the news?  The  authors follow the severly burned children to the hospitals and chronical  their recoveries or slow, painful deaths.  It looks at how the genuinely  heroic firemen coped with watching children jump out of firey classrooms to  their deaths.  Finally, the authors investigate the cause of the fire and  give compelling evidence concerning who they believe started the it.  I  highly recommend this book.

As my first  biography on Eisenhower, Perret did an excellent job of elevating the  former president's reputation in  my own mind.  In school, I was taught  that, &quot;...the American people believed that all Eisenhower did while  president was play golf.  They were right.&quot;  After reading Perret's  biography, I can see that this is clearly untrue.  Eisenhower played a  great role in the early years of the Cold War.  Furthermore, unlike some of  the men who became president after him, Eisenhower had a good understanding  of world events, a vision of the United States' role in the world (esp.  relations with the USSR), and went about making that vision a reality.  The  narrative, for the most part, flowed.  However, there were several times in  the book when I had to stop, shake my head a little and re-read a paragraph  just to make sure I read an odd statement correctly as Perret makes some  very odd remarks in this book.  For instance, he advances the notion that  General Marshall (of Marshall Plan fame) might have been gay; he laments  the fact that Dwight and his son John S.D. Eisenhower never shared  father-son moments such as urinating together; Eisenhower becomes angry  because Russian ICBMs are larger than American ICBMs &quot;like a man  becomes upset when comparing his penis to another man's to find that the  other man's penis is larger.&quot;  Statements like this detract from the  book rather than illuminate the facts.  Overall, the book was very much  worth my time, but I'm sure there are better Eisenhower biographies out  there.	2000-05-18

I  always enjoy when a book explicity points out something that common sense  tells you is right, but you've just never really thought of before (not  seeing the forest through the trees)or gives you new ways of thinking about  things.  McDowell's book does just that.<br />I think that when people get  into a &quot;funk&quot; and aren't dating or what have you, they begin  asking the question, &quot;what's wrong with me?&quot;  McDowell refuses to  focus on this, pointing out that God loves you, there are good things about  you, look at what's right with you.  This point and the point that (I'll  explian by example) if you are attracted to neat and tidy people, you  probably wont attract them if you're appearance is sloppy are two of the  points of the book that stick out the most.  It's not one of those books  that's going to change your life, but it's easy reading and worth your  time.  Recommended.	2000-04-01

Alvarez did succeed in helping me to  understand the hardships that the Garcia girls went through as they  attempted to be accepted by American society and revel in American ways yet  at the same time hold on to their Latin American roots (and please their  family by doing so).  Alvarez does make it clear to the readers that,  emotionally, this is not easy task.  Although I understand intellectually  how difficult it is to find a balance for the Garcia sisters, Alvarez does  not make me understand emotionally, which I believe was her intention.  If  I may take this opportunity to voice one criticism of the book.  The device  Alvarez employs of holding out a series of anectodes about the Garcias,  from the most recent to the oldest is rather confusing.  Perhaps it would  have been easier for the reader if she would start at the oldest and worked  toward the most recent.  Take that criticism for what you will as it is  more a matter of personal preference than of any &quot;mistake&quot; on the  part of Julia Alvarez.  Alvarez does provide us with a good overall read.	2000-04-01

I read all  three in an effort to understand Washington the man.

Reading these books has convinced me that the  only way we could understand this mystery is to actually meet GW.  This  being impossible, the next best thing would be to read some Washington  books to appreciate the things GW did for our nation.  Another Amazon  reviewer gives us a brief list of some actions that give us a hint to GW's  personality and leadership skills.  Let me emphasize that this is a BRIEF  list.  There is a reason Washington is put on a dollar bill, why our  capital, a state and several counties are named after him and why he is  called &quot;first in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his  countrymen.&quot;<br />Now that I've established the importance of reading  about Washington, Flexner's book a one volume account of Washington's life  that I recommend.  While he does move rather fast at times and while I  disagree with Flexner's belief that Washington is a diest, he does present  a fine account of his our Founding Father's life.  Flexner espicially  allows us to understand how Washington goes about making decisions and why  these decisions were so respected in the Early American community	2000-04-01

For this reason, I am reluctant to enter my review of this book.  However, I do think I can give those considering buying this  book some information.  For the record, I am a devout Christian.  I enjoyed  reading the book and found it interestig and insightful, but I don't think  I was reading it for the same reasons as others.  I did not read it in  order to &quot;arm&quot; myself as I argue God's existance with  unbelievers.  I did not read it because the book is somewhat fluffy and I  could easily argue that McDowell presents shoddy research.  I read it  simply because I am a Christian and I desired a little more insight into  the faith to which I subscribe.  Here are some of My Brief Answers to  Frequently Asked Questions:<br />Will this book sufficiently arm me as I do  battle with Unbelievers?:  Probably not Is this book intened to be the  end-all, be-all, convincing me that God definately does exist?:  Probably  not. Is the research thorough and clearly preented:  Not really. If I do  not believe in God, will it cause me to question my non-belief a little  bit?:  Quite possibly.<br />The reason (I believe) McDowell wrote this book  is so that unbelievers would critically think about their faith or lack  thereof.  The breity and simplicity of the book make it very inviting.  Putting myself in the unbeliever's shoes, if I decided it would benefit me  to read an apologist's book, I think I'd rather spend very little time  doing it then a great deal of time, making McDowell's book all the more  inviting.  Furthermore, to refute McDowell's arguments, I'd be forced to  study history and the Bible more.  Imagine that.<br />So, McDowell's  ulterior motive is to get unbelievers to feel a little uncomfortable and  make an attempt to reaffirm their belief that there is no God (or at least  no Christian God)through researching Biblical truths and the Bible.  If we  learn a little about McDowell, he was an athiest who was challenged to  research Biblical truths in order to refute them and wound up convincing  himself that the Bible is true and that God does indeed exist.  Do you  think he might be hoping the same thing will happen to other unbelievers  who pick this book up?  To sum everything up this book will be good for you  if you read it for the &quot;right&quot; reasons.  I enjoyed it and  recommend it for a light read.le about McDowell, he was an athiest who was challenged to  research Biblical truths in order to refute them and wound up convincing  himself that the Bible is true and that God does indeed exist.

I think part of the reason is that I just finished &quot;Truman&quot; by David McCullough before reading this one.  If I wrote a biography, I wouldn't want it to follow Truman.  Second, I  think I was turned off by the fact that Ketchum tried to fill in parts of  Madison's early life by saying thing such as &quot;we might imagine Madison  looking out his window at those mountains.&quot;  etc.  I understand that  very little information about Madison's early life is available and  historians often piece together what they can, but the underlying  &quot;this isn't fact&quot; attitude it a turn off.  I feel it necessary to  stress that I don't fault the author as this seems to be a matter of  personal preference.  In this book, Ralph Ketcham does a good job  examining Madison's political beliefs, theories and writings and how they  all came together as Madison helped write the Constitution.  He also helps  us to understand the political and personal relationships between  Virginia's &quot;aristocracy&quot; including Madison, James Monroe, Thomas  Jefferson, Patrick Henry, George Mason, George Washington, etc.  Finally,  we see how Madison was an unsuccessful president as he was neither able to  mantain control of his cabinet nor wage a successful war in the War of 1812  (yes, we did win the war...kind of...but it should have been a much easier  victory, and some of the blame must be put on Madison).  Interesting  insights and Madison should be studied, but this book really lacked  something I still can't put my finger on.  So, I recommend it for fellow  history buffs, especially those interested in Early American History.  I  don't recommend it for those looking for a fun leisurely read.	2000-04-01

Smith's book.  He focuses on  Washington's presidency and helps us to understand why he is consistantly  ranked by historians as one of the top three U.S. presidents. Smith focuses  on his precedents and the respect he commanded from all, including  Jefferson and Hamilton who, without Washingtons' leadership might have  destroyed each other and the country in their political intrigues.  Highly  recommended.	2000-04-01

End is silly	John Updike gives us an especially well-researched novel following various generations of a particular family.  The first chapter follows an 1880's pastor named Clarence at the point that he realizes that &quot;there is no  God.&quot;  We see him struggle with the fact that he went from an exalted  member of the community to a place of disgrace and poverty.  Very  intersting!  When Clarence dies at the end of the first chapter (of four),  the book follows the exploits of Teddy, the shy, akward, un-ambitious son.  Teddy is not your typical protagonist, which makes the second chapter  excellent reading.  Chapter three follows &quot;Alma&quot; Teddy's daughter  and a Hollywood movie star.  About the middle of Alma's chapter the book  becomes quite different.  I found it was no longer an enjoyable read.  In  the final chapter, we follow the exploits of Alma's (and some rock star's)  son, Clark (active in the 1970's-1990's).  Clark's chapter is so cliche  it's almost laughable.  I'll try not to give away parts of the plot, but  Clark ends up joining a Waco-type cult (continuing with the religion  theme).  As I've mentioned, Alma's and Clark's sections are not even worth  reading in the opinion of this reviewer, but the first two chapters are  excellent.  What started out as a great book, deteriorated into someting  pathetic.  Or did Updike intend this as a commentary on modern society?  It  is well researched as several events (such as the strike in Clarence's  chapter) did take place, but the end seems very sloppy.  You have to judge  if this is deliberately so as a social commentary.	2000-04-01

While it is essentially the story of the Western take-over of a region of Africa, Achebe presents this take-over in a unique way.  The  novel follows Okonkwo and his exploits.  At first, from Okonkwo's  perspective, the Christian missionaries are a side-note to the daily  routine of African life, then as the missionaries gain more and more  influence, they take center stage in Okonkwo's life.  Gripping.  The  previous reviewers mentioned some interesting aspects of this book.  One  says that &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; gives legitimacy to highly  structured African culture.  Very true and excellent insight.  I suppose I  couldn't see the forest through the trees in this case.  UBU35 claims that  this is a book by a male for males.  Although Chinua Achebe is a man, I  think the male-domination theme of this book is more to caputre the spirit  of African culture, which is definately male dominated.  Instead of sexism  on Achebe's part, I think it is more of a litterary device to capture the  African culture.  This is also true for Achebe's using short, simple  sentences.  In all, a great read.	2000-04-01

This is not because he rigid and proper like George Washington nor because he was a great American philosopher like Thomas Jefferson.  John Adams fascinated me because he was  so normal.  Reading this book will show how, through hard work, Adams rose  from an upper-middle class background to one of the greatest politicians of  the era.  Few ever think of Adams when they list the influential American  Revolutionaries, but through his laborious work in Philadelphia, he became  the Continental Congress' &quot;indispensible man.&quot;  Furthermore,  Ferling gives the reader a superb account of Adams the President as he  demonstrates that Adams failed as a President because of both the political  intrigues of Alexander Hamilton and because of his refusal to commit the  American armed forces to a war with France (which he know would destroy the  young nation).  If you are intersted in one of United States most  under-rated presidents, this book will serve you well.	2000-03-30

A Philadelphia merchant during the citical period of the 1760's through the 1820's, Coxe is a case study in switching political  affiliation.  As the Revolutionary War rages on, Coxe is a Loyalist and  even attends the lavish Philadelphia balls with the British officers.  When  the war is over, however, Coxe switches his alliances, emerging at the  forefront of those fighting for ratification of the new Constitution.  He  is rewarded with a job in George Washington's Treasury Department.  However, Coxe becomes disillusioned with the Federalist Party as he begins  to campaign for the Democratic-Republican, Thomas Jefferson.  In his later  years, Coxe spends much time campaigning in Pennsylvania for various  political candidates, trying to manage his extensive land holdings and  begging, usually fruitlessly, for a patronage job.  The author attempts to  show how Coxe, although running the gauntlet of political affiliations, has  never let go of his core beliefs.  He does not quite convince this reader,  but he does make an intersting case.  Even more important than Cooke's  historical interpretation of Coxe's life is the fact that reading this fine  biography helps one to more fully understand and appreciate the work that  political underlings do, especially as it relates to early American  political intrigues.  One criticism I have of this book, and I admit  it is more of a matter of personal preference, is that the author  chronologically jumps around too much.  In my opinion, this leaves the  reader somewhat confused with regards to how some aspects of the subject's  life interact with other aspects.  Cooke does this especially with regards  to Coxe's land speculation.  It takes away from the overall quality of the  book when Cooke describes Coxe's buying and selling of land in the  Carolinas and I'm spending time trying to figure out what else is going on  in Coxe's life.  This is not a book written for curling up next to the  fire, but rather for those who fancy themselves scholars.This is not a book written for curling up next to the  fire, but rather for those who fancy themselves scholars.	2000-03-30

He has an excellent narritive style; he makes it seem effortless as he shifts from an 18th century quote to narritive and back to  quotes.  Furthermore, he gives the reader anecdotes in order to make a  point or to provide a fuller understanding of a personality, the war of the  late 1700s (which,in my humble opinion is the best use of anecdotes).  I  thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.<br />  Bobrick Benson makes much of  the fact that he is a decendant of both Loyalists and Patriots, so one  would assume that he would try to present a &quot;balanced&quot; view of  the war.  However, Bobrick tends to favor Americans.  On the surface, this  may seem &quot;un-scholarly,&quot;  but Bobrick provides us with many  anecdotes as to why he favors the American underdog to the cocky and  sometimes cruel British soldiers.<br />  Finally, I must comment on the  fact that Bobrick does not simply focus on the generals and battles of the  American Revolution, but also examines the politics of the Continental  Congress, and the courts of London and Paris.  He vividly shows the reader  how the battles effected the governments' decisions and vice versa.  He  also accurately shows that politics is never smooth sailing, but rather  illustrates how there always exists fierce debate, even in  &quot;unifying&quot; war times.	2000-03-30

For years, early American history has been one of my biggest interests and I can honestly  say I've never read a book from this period that was as gripping as  Ketchum's.  It rivals David McCullough's &quot;Truman&quot; with its  ability to pull the reader in, making him feel as if he's in the midst of  the battle.  Furthermore, he displays an intimate knowledge of both the  particulars of Bunker Hill as well as 18th century warfare in general.  Highly recommended.	2000-02-10
