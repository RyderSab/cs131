I learned some things from this book, and it gave me some issues to think through in my own life.  But I was disappointed with the book at the same time.  I didn't enjoy the pictures, and was left with a hungry feeling at the end.  I've read many books about altars, and this is the best one so far, but isn't the gem I had expected (wanted) it to be.	2002-02-01

In a hurry, I glanced through the table of contents and it looked complete.  I also skimmed through the pages, and the layout looked clear and well done.  All of this was on quick inspection.  Once I started reading the book, I couldn't believe I got snookered into buying it from these things.  This author can't write her way out of a wet paper bag, and I seriously doubt that she can even use Visio.  I took the book back.  Don't make my mistake.	2002-02-01

It covers sacred pilgrimages made by believers of many religions and over most of the planet.  The author shows respect for all seekers and pilgrimages, and explains their purposes so that I could understand why this pilgrimage was important to each faith.  I really loved the practical information, such as the detailed maps of the route, and have referred back to many of the pilgrimages often.  An outstanding collection for anyone who wants to understand more about the nature of the spiritual journey.	2002-02-01

New to this craft, I needed something that would give me the information you gain through experience, and it did that.  I was able to select a medium difficulty project for my first project, and teach a teen how to do it at the same time.  We both had fun, and the soap turned out beautifully.  She got many compliments when the gifts were opened, and felt really good about herself.  This one is a keeper!	2002-02-01

I thought the book was fabulous, talking about how animals communicate with us and how to understand their behaviors.  The author explains the value and mechanics of developing richer relationships with animals in ways that kids can understand.  The author's attitude is open and trusting with animals, and is exactly the kind of attitude I wanted to foster within my budding vet-to-be-niece.	2002-02-01

I  was disappointed with this book.  It is a showcase for the author's home  office, which involved construction and landscaping.  I am of more modest  means, and I was looking for very PRACTICAL ideas.  The tone of the book is  more of &quot;look at what a wonderful job I have done&quot; and while the  author's office is nice, it is not the kind of project I have in my near  future.  If you are just thinking about your first home office and you  would like someone to explain the basics, this would be a good starter  book.  But even the technology and  equipment information is out of date --  those things change so fast!  As long as you don't expect too much, this  has some good information.	2000-08-17

This book has really helped me organize my thinking about the  cards.  The author provides some information, and then launches you on a  voyage of personal discovery through writing exercises.  Now, when I look  at a card, I spot symbols that mean something to me, and my meaning for  card spring naturally from this!  But more than that, the author believes  that the true purpose of the Tarot is to help each of us on our personal  inner journey, and not just for fortunetelling and such.  I have increased  my understanding and use of the cards so much from her book!  I'm so glad I  have taken the time to explore the Tarot with this book.	2000-01-02

When I need to be reminded that I'm just at a JOB and my LIFE is about meaningful things.  When I need to be reminded that what I  think about my circumstances does make a difference, and how I treat the  people around me says a lot about who I am.<br />Some of the sentences, maybe  even paragraphs, I don't understand.  I find that some passages just don't  add to my understanding of my life and my purpose in life.  But for the  most part, this tiny book reminds me of the &quot;big picture&quot; of my  life.  I'm glad to have it handy when I need it.  I can open to any page,  read for a minute or two, and step outside the daily traumas of my career  and back into the calm part of myself.	1999-07-06

I use them more than any other tool because they are so positive and helpful.  Often, when I'm feeling down or glum or angry, I will ask the angels to guide me to the card that  will help me understand what is going on so I can get back to feeling  positive.  It never fails!  I select a card, and the description in the  book contains something that touches my heart in that moment.<br />These  cards remind me to look at life from a higher perspective, through the eyes  of the angels looking down at me and everyone else.  They help me to break  through whatever has me stuck at the time, and to laugh at myself.  One of  the great things about these cards are the photographs.  They are  beautiful.  And the messages in the book are inspiring to read by themself,  without using the cards.  I recommend these cards for EVERYONE who wants to  approach life from a positive place, and feel the flow of love in their  heart.	1999-07-06

I just moved into a new home that has a garden, and I'm rereading Shakkai to get some insights on  how to go about planning a garden that would be a true spiritual haven for  me.<br />What I totally missed in the first reading was the correspondence  between human relationships and the human/natural world relationship.  I  was approaching my garden with a sense of respect, but now I have an even  deeper understanding that the garden is about the relationships between the  plants (and amongst them) and myself.  I have only read a couple of Andrews  books, but the parallels between this future life story and what I know of  her current life experiences is shocking and yet comforting.<br />I now see  myself as the center of my universe, surrounding by relationships with  people that cross the bounds of time, and by relationships with all of the  physical objects around me.  My vision for my garden now is to create a  place that reflects my inner peace and self understanding, more than it is  about gardening books and landscape architecture.<br />Thank you, Lynn, for an  outstanding new experience of my own life.	1999-07-06

Jeff's insights on human growth, reincarnation, astrology, and the questions of human existence are profound.  I have always suspected that if we mere humans would get a direct answer about the meaning of life, we'd be unable to process it. Jeff's book bridges this gap for me.  I find new information each time I pick up this wonderful book.  It's like having access to a mystic who drops pearls of wisdom into your ear each time you open the cover.<br />I have heard Jeff speak about this subject several times, and am always amazed at the depth of his comments and how relevant they are for daily living.  If you ever get the chance, hear him speak.  If you are looking for more of Jeff's work, see his volume II from Amazon.com.	1998-07-14

I discovered this gem about 10 years ago at a time when I was searching for a way to change my life, to be happier, and to make some sense of the things going on.  There is no psycho-babble in this book.  Instead, what you find are very simple exercises designed to take you along a path.  The exercises are deceivingly simple.  At first, I thought that just reading them was enough, and I did feel better just reading them.  But when I actually took the time to do one, I discovered that I felt EVEN BETTER, so I began from the beginning, working through every exercise.<br />For years, this book has been my secret, the tool that I used to help me that I didn't share with anyone.  Now that I'm busy creating the life I have always wanted, I understand that there is enough for everyone, and want to share this book with the world.  If you want to change your life, if you are seeking for something you can't quite describe, this book may just have your answers.  But don't make my m! ! istake and just read it--do the exercises!!  That made all the difference for me.	1998-07-14

It was like a mystery--and showed me such a difference slice of human experience that I had to find out how it ended.  Taisha's book was more satisfying to me than Castaneda's works, althought it travels in the same world.  Maybe it's just the way she writes, or the fact that it is a woman's perspective, but I was totally captivated by this story.  It showed me a way of life unlike anything I had imagined possible.  Each person must decide for themself if her story is true.  For me, I believe it.<br />When I finished this book, I was left with several new ideas that didn't fit into my old way of thinking.  Over the last year, I have been working them through, and have discovered the answers for myself.  For a while, I wished that I could go to live with some scorcerers and have a similar growth experience.  What I have accomplished is to find my own mystical path in the midst of everyday living, paying ! ! the rent, and keeping the fridge full.  It's a solution that works for me.  Taisha's book gave me a jump start into an area I didn't even know existed, and I'm grateful for that experience.	1998-07-14

I had never been exposed to information from channeled sources, so there was an element of newness for me, along with the quality of the content.<br />I reached a point after a few months where I began to feel that some of the content wasn't accurate, that it was a story told to accomplish a purpose, but wasn't literally the truth.  This sense has served me well.  I recommend this book, but also recommend that you take from it only the parts that your life and heart tell you are for you.  Leave the rest.<br />One of the best points about this book is the emphasis on setting intentions.  They give excellent examples of intentions.  One of the greatest benefits in my life from this book is living in a more purposeful way, using intentions to steer the direction of my life.	1998-07-14

And how fortunate for us that Philip Sedgwick is here to provide such a readable introduction and guide into these new realms.<br />Heliocentric astrology redraws an astrological chart with the sun, instead of the earth, at the center.  Sedgwick explains the significance of this shift, and provides a fun and informative map of the new territory.  His views of the new meaning of standard astrological elements come from his years of experience and profound insights from his extensive study and reflection.<br />I heard Sedgwick speak on this topic at a recent astrological conference, and came away wanting to learn more.  His book is full of the same wit and intelligence I experienced from his talk.  Some understanding of traditional Western astrology will help you understand his concepts, but this book is written for everyone with a beginning understanding of astrology, not just the practicing professionals.	1998-07-13

I found within this simple story the encouragement I needed to move forward in my life, and the courage to take the risks to follow my heart instead of the practical advise of the world around me.  I have no regrets three years later.  This story is simple, the lessons are profound.  This is the wisdom of innocence, which is not the wisdom of the world around us.  This is the kind of advise loving parents want to give their children.  If you really want to follow your heart, and you hear a nagging voice in your head (or from your friends and family) that you should do the PRACTICAL thing instead, do yourself a favor and read this book.  The hero of this story doesn't have an easy time while he follows his heart, but he has the joy of knowing his life is well spent, and does achieve his dream.  This book shows you a magical view of what your life can be.	1998-07-13
