I agree wholeheartedly with the Hawaii reviewer's statement that Mr. Breiter has once again brought forth the crystalline Dhamma from the late Ajahn Chah. Everything Arises, Everything Falls Away is another brilliant compilation of insights from this great teacher, but Breiter doesn't stop there.<br /><br />No, in this new book, there are also stories about life with Ajahn Chah from this former monk who knew him as well as any Westerner, living and working with him and also translating for him in Thailand and when Ajahn Chah visited the U.S. These stories are just as enlightening as the Ajahn's direct teachings, but for those of us who like a little story here and there -- which was, after all, how the Buddha himself taught -- these little sprinklings of what it was like to be around this tough, enlightened being are a wonderful balm after the hard work of trying to internalize the Dhamma.<br /><br />In short, this book is absolutely vital for anyone who loves the Dhamma as taught in the Thai forest tradition, or for anyone who loves to hear stories about enlightened masters of any tradition. Another simply brilliant job of bringing Ajahn Chah's words to the West by Paul Breiter.	2005-05-30
US	48324285	R86H5KS99SUQ2	0786713364	50358962	Buddha Da: A Novel	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Compassionate and compelling	At first, I was afraid of the Scottish dialect in which this is written, but after three pages it failed to register any longer except as how these characters talked and thought. Don't miss this book because of the dialect -- I almost did and I would have greatly regretted it.<br /><br />Buddha Da weaves together the story of three members of a family -- Da, Ma, and Anne Marie, their daughter -- and does it seamlessly into a story of fallout, faith, hunger, and redemption. It is just about a flawless book, flawlessly told. I don't know the last time I found a book as dramatically pleasing and logically coherent and consistent as Buddha Da. It is a masterpiece I will recommend to everyone interested in Buddhism, family life, or just good fiction. I look forward to the author's next book.	2005-05-30
US	48324285	R3OF1FYGWC6R5M	1931044813	577458066	Venerable Father: A Life with Ajahn Chah	Books	5	22	24	N	Y	A moving tribute -- and a guide to life as it might be lived	I've bought and read both Being Dharma and Still Forest Pool, and enjoyed them very much. But Venerable Father is far superior to them in giving this soft American a real idea of what it was like studying under and living with Ajahn Chah. I both envy Paul Breiter for his experience, and am really glad it was him rather than me going through it! :)<br /><br />But seriously, this humble yet assured voice resonates throughout the book. Yes, it is the skill and compassion of Luang Por that is responsible for the quality of much of the book, but truly Breiter's frank evaluations of his experiences during and after life as a forest monk makes this much different from other, more traditional memoirs that I have read. I'm not saying that he's enlightened with a capital E, but during the course of the book the training (when fully followed, as Ajahn Chah taught) seems to automatically make the monks into more awake, more compassionate, less suffering people. The importance of even trivial-sounding Vinaya rules becomes apparent, and thus Chah's way is illuminated.<br /><br />The sections of the book after he disrobes are even better. You can take the monk out of the forest (and his robes), but you can't take the forest out of the monk. These chapters were poignant and in some cases very funny indeed. Ajahn Chah's total intuitive understandng, and effortlessly devastating criticism, of Mahayana double-talk was especially amusing. For instance, to the Mahayana claim that we don't need to do anything to improve because our nature is originally perfect, when he says that's like saying if you put sh*t on a silver platter, you don't need to clean it before eating from it because the platter was originally clean! But all the time he is understanding totally how Mahayana, for all its linguistic troubles and even theological difficulties, is as dedicated to the path of freedom and compassion in its own very different way as is the Forest School.<br /><br />This book is a gift. It gives us the feeling of sitting at Luang Por's feet -- the wonder and the horror of it, a highly (even totally) awakened master teaching each student to match his or her understanding, and a mischievous old man pushing his monks to the very edge of sanity, or a little beyond. I know I wouldn't want him tugging on my robes and laughing while I was trying to give a first Dhamma talk in Thai, but it would have been amazing to know and love this man. Venerable Father is as close as any of us will come to Ajahn Chah, and we have Paul Breiter to thank for it. I'm incredibly inspired to ordain, even more than before. Scared, too, of course, but living under the Vinaya sounds like a pure and productive way to live.<br /><br />If you want to read Luang Por's words and get even more inspired, buy and read Being Dharma and Still Forest Pool, too!<br /><br />NOTE: Be sure to buy this book in the Paraview edition. There are other, unauthorized reprints out there, and this is a beautiful volume..

US	48324285	R2UTJUCNT0BQYS	1400040442	437281256	Bangkok 8: A Royal Thai Detective Novel (1)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Really enjoyable read, but a weak ending	As a Buddhist who loves to read (and write) fiction, I found Burdett's book a fresh story told in a way that really spoke to me. So much Buddhist fiction is of the Zen variety, which is really a caricature of Buddhist thought. But Thailand is a Theravadin country, which means they follow the original teachings of the Buddha.<br /><br />Not that you'd necessarily recognize those teachings in Burdett's Bangkok, a true den if iniquity. But in his hero, Sonchai, all of the best of old-style Buddhism is found. (Yes, he wants to kill the killer of his friend, but he works with that as the novel progresses.) Bangkok specifically and Thailand in general are characters in this swirling novel of intrigue, desire, and karma.<br /><br />That's the good stuff. The only really bad thing about the book is the last 20 pages or so, which go on a strange tangent that has little to do with the themes of the rest of the book. \\"Magical\\" things happen which seem much more like an outsider's view of the wacky Thais than do the rest of the book, which read like a real insider's story.<br /><br />But don't let the last 20 pages dissuade you. They're not terrible, and the rest of the book is so well done, you'll be hoping to make a trip to Thailand... even as part of you is frightened to death.	2004-09-27

This book is sad indeed.<br />For instance, the Dalai Lama is not considered a &quot;God&quot; by the Tibetan Buddhists. They &quot;worship&quot; him the way a Christian &quot;worships&quot; a great preacher or teacher--he inspires faith in those of his denomination. Dave Hunt's misinformed comments about the Dalai lama is one of MANY, MANY intentional lies in this book. If you're a real Christian--not one of &quot;Hunt's army,&quot; but someone who actually follows the Bible--then avoid this like a plague of locusts.	2003-07-27

But never have I read a book that had ALL of the value of the other books between just one set of covers. This is that book.<br />Ajahn Chah of course was (and through his students still is) a marvelous teacher, with the gifts of humor and directness. Even in translation, you get a full feeling of what it must have been like to listen to this man talk. (Although, as Brahmavamso says, we laypeople get the jewels of sometimes all-night talks. Sorry, Ajahn Brahm!) This book is like having Luang Por speak directly to you, with kindness and toughness at the same time.<br />I &quot;sipped&quot; a chapter of this book a week, never wanting it to end. I have been reading it for six months now and finally finished it, and I will probably start over from the beginning and do it again. It is not overstating the point to say that this book is a gift to humanity.<br />Also, and this is less important but still nice, Food for the Heart is a truly handsome book. It's technically paperback, but with jacket tabs and a strong cover. The paper is thick and creamy--sorry if I'm enjoying my senses too much! :) And the typography is very pleasing.
