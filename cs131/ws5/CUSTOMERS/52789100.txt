Written with amazing flair and style, the trek becomes your own as you read of the harrowing experiences and wonder how these men (and one woman) could possibly have survived all that they did. I found myself wondering at times if it would not have been better for them to return to the slave camp! Truly a fabulous account and a must read.	2004-03-01

Anyone interested in learning about the Mormon faith and it's origins may find this book tolerable. I think I found it boring because the cover and other sources made such a big deal about a pair of murders in the book, that I thought that was what the book would focus on. The actual part about the murders was very well written and extremely interesting, but it isn't as if murders don't happen in the name of religion and God every day. Most notable about this book would be the correlation one could make between our current situation with the Taleban and the Mormon faith a long time ago. I also got the impression that just about anyone in the Mormon faith can call themselves a prophet. It's a strange book and I got bored quickly and had to push myself to finish it.	2004-02-28

All she showed was that there are waiters and waitresses and hotel maids that work hard for low wages. Didn't we all know that? She also occasionally dipped into her own money, rendering the entire experiment faulty.  <BR>Plus, when she admits to smoking pot, the book turned me off because if you really were that poor, you certainly wouldn't spend any money on pot. Her entrance into the world of the working force was a farce and she made it a farce. This book is a good subject, it just could have been written with much more punch.	2004-02-13

Horror and suspense authors can relax; this book just did not instill fear the way one would expect from author Michael Crichton. It is difficult to feel the sense of reality that is so necessary for a good suspense novel, as tiny nanoparticles of some experiment escape from a quiet lab in the Nevada Desert. These nanoparticles take on life like qualities and chase people around sucking the life out of them. Continually evolving, they change both shape and Modus Operandi with every turn of the page, leaving the reader not quite willing to submit to the usual spine tingler. I read this book in 2 days and could have read it in one if I had pushed it, but it just bored me. I also had the &quot;twist&quot; figured out long before the ending.	2004-02-05

Extremely prolific, James A. Michener writes as only he can write about the Caribbean, that vast expanse of ocean surrounded by Cuba, Puerto Rico and the extensive small islands smattered across the seascape. This is a powerful history of these islands, and James Michener takes us from the 1300s when a peaceful tribe of Arawaks are horribly destroyed all the way to Castro's Cuba. This is the sort of book one would do better learning about this area from, as the author weaves plot upon plot into a brilliantly masterminded historical novel. You will learn more from this book about the Caribbean Sea and its islands than any history or geography class could give you, and you will have more fun doing it! I gave it four stars simply because with a book this size, there was bound to be some dreadfully boring parts, and there were. If it were a bit shorter in length it would lack nothing but a Pulitzer.	2004-02-05

A twisted take on a Romeo and Juliet type story that takes place in the greens of Ireland where the shamrocks grow wild and the faeries and leprechauns take care of nature. It's most forbidden for faeries and leprechauns to actually mix, however, so enter the love story. Not quite the Montagues and Capulets, but an adorable version of it. Then there are the humans who are NEVER supposed to actually see the faeries and leprechauns, but somehow do, and we have to start the love story again. A fanciful tale that with perhaps just a bit more faery dust might make an adult read. I think children of ages 8 plus would enjoy. It's just not quite the fantasy that can take an adult places we should all be anyway.	2004-01-10

It's hard to describe a book as both full of adventure and boring at the same time, but that is how I found this book to be. The story is about a man with several aliases, owner of a fifty foot sailboat who hires a personal trainer to come on board and keep him &quot;in shape.&quot; Little does Jim Leighton, who has little to speak of except nice abs, know that &quot;Will Sparks&quot;, the sailboat owner is on the run. From Russian spies to nuclear anythings to satellites in space, someone wants Will Sparks, and wants him badly. Someone with the money, time, and superior intelligence it is going to take to try to keep up with Jim and Will as they sail the ocean all over the world just trying to escape. It seems no port is safe. If you like sailing, you will give this book a five star rating for not only it's adventure content, but the seemingly endless drone of &quot;how to&quot; sail a boat. A very Tom Clancy like story in that the inner and outer and sideways workings of a sailboat compare to his stories of submarines et al.  This is where I found it boring, as I know next to nothing about sailboats and am not interested in learning. However, I did find the adventure content excellent, and each time I was sure I'd fall asleep, author Paul Garrison brought it back again. So try it if you like adventure and can handle mechanics, otherwise, leave it for a rainier day.	2004-01-10

Once again, author John Saul takes us to places we shouldn't be, but those of us who cannot stay away from the dark basements of our minds will find ourselves in a macabre building called &quot;The Rockwell&quot; in Manhattan. Looking a bit like an old Scottish castle, it's the perfect setting for us to peek in on what is going on with Caroline Fleming and her new husband Anthony and two children. Caroline's first husband had died unexpectedly while jogging in Central Park, mugged and strangled and Caroline is sure she cannot go on until she meets Anthony Fleming. Charming, suave, and dracula-ish, she marries him. But he lives in the Rockwell, and the children don't want to move in THERE. They've heard the stories, the hauntings and dead things and whispery noises. Caroline does her best to convince them how silly that is, and the Rockwell does have lots of neighbors in the building that welcome the children with open arms. Of course, there is something strange about the place, and John Saul will be happy to tell you all about it, in a nightmare. After you've stayed up all night turning pages. Enjoy your visit to the Rockwell, you may not get to visit again.	2004-01-07

Based on this premise, this author is amazingly adept at seeing through to our souls, to all the times in our lives we loved and trusted, only to have dreams shattered, lives wrecked and pieces all over the ground. Easy to read and absolutely true to form, this book describes what betrayal is because it comes in so many forms, somes we never even thought of, and how betrayal by trusted loved ones or others can change you, making you a person that you yourself can no longer understand. Painfully, and step by step, as you read this book, there is a high probability you will catch glimpses (maybe even photos!) of yourself. It sometimes wasn't an easy book to read when it really hit home at points, but it definitely is a must read anyhow. Dealing with secrets people keep, nasty gossip, odd behavior and all the way up to infidelity, buy this book and learn to heal. It's the only one to date I've found that at least gives you the desire to do so again.	2003-12-21

Or at least, that is exactly what Bill Clinton (and Hillary) are depicted as. We the people never entered their minds as they literally raided the White House, disgraced the nation, and dishonored the values and truths we held to be self evident. It was not just the Monica scandal (and others), those is hardly even mentioned in this book. This author tells us things that will shock you so much more than those events. Be wary America, because if we should fall prey to a Clinton or likewise household again, we can only hope we'll have top military aides like &quot;Buzz&quot; Patterson to show us the truth. Can you imagine a president &quot;losing&quot; the nuclear codes to our nation? Eyeballing from top to bottom a military aide's wife in full view of her husband? Letting Osama bin Laden go free? Hating the military? Well, keep imagining, because it gets worse. I could not put the book down and I think all of America should read it. It is fairly written, not a hint of bias, as Col. Patterson struggles to maintain a neutral position on Hillary's antics and behavior and Bill's disgusting nature. Col. Patterson manages to pull it off, so that it does not come out sounding like a hate book, because it is not. The Clinton administration, embarrassing as it was to our nation, was more dangerous to America than a nuclear missile could ever be. You'll be shocked, sickened, dismayed, and (rightfully so) horrified. Please read and spread the word.	2003-12-21

This book about the nasty people we all seem to encounter at some point in our lives is actually pretty slim and fast reading, yet comprehensive and worthwhile. Jay Carter, author of &quot;Nasty Men&quot; talks about people we know and maybe even love who are expert &quot;invalidators&quot;, that is, consciously or otherwise they seek us out and usually, withour our even being aware of their tactics, we find ourselves suddenly victimized by depression, low self esteem and other horrors and we cannot figure out why.

In &quot;Bias, How the Media Distorts the News&quot;, I believe the author's original intentions were to show some factual evidence that what we are hearing on TV via the news is information that either simply isn't true or is mostly slanted towards the political left. Since the latter is no big news (pardon the pun) to anyone, I bought the book with a bit of caution. Throughout the book, the author smears some of TV's top anchors with a vengeance that makes you wonder if his claim that his co-workers sudden disloyalty to him is simply due to one article he wrote. Nose in the air, the soapbox even taller, Bernard Goldberg proceeds on a near hate campaign for his &quot;former&quot; friends, and unfortunately in the process we get the vitreous bile. I certainly did not learn anything I didn't already know, and I thought of all the books that I could write about people who have done the very same to myself. Most of us have people who we thought were friends and then noted a knife in our back or sensed disloyalty, and that is what this book really was about to my mind. It's a shame, because it did sound interesting, and I really did think I might learn something, but I think the ending of Mr. Goldberg's career would have been better left unsaid. There is nothing, in my opinion, the public needs to know in this book. In the end, Mr. Goldberg's axe is even a bit larger than the average.	2003-12-01

Many realistic solutions are also offered. The amazing part is that if you have lived with a Borderline Personality Disorder Person long enough, you will recognize qualities within yourself that you are exhibiting! It is as if, in a way, the &quot;disease&quot; is contagious. I learned much about myself, my partner, and there was only a minimal amount of nonsensical psycho-babble. Mostly, it's pretty factual. The only part I wish the book offered more of is how to be certain you or your partner does have this disorder without benefit of a psychiatrist, since it does sound very much like a label psychiatrists are wont to throw on a disorder they barely understand.	2003-11-29

In all fairness, mushiness in romance novels does not go over well with me, and there is enough fluff in this one to pick a field with. Still, it is very well written, and though the plot has a big zero throughout, the reader is captured by the heartwarming thoughts of Wilson, narrator and mostly protagonist of this story. Noah is a forlorn character, but helps to emphasize the liveliness of the other characters. In this book, a wedding is going to take place, and Wilson and Jane, parents of the bride, are given eight days notice to prepare. A nightmarish scenario for any parent, they set out to do just that. The story begins with a forgotten anniversary, and ends with a wealth of truths about love, and time shared, hearts caressed and the meaning of never taking advantage of the golden prize when you get it. Very nicely put, just a bit too mushy.	2003-11-08

This is a great read and a heartfelt book about a 14 year old girl who accidentally shot her own mother when she was little. The memory of what happened that night is, of course, haunting, but young Lily wakes one day and finds that her &quot;Jar is Open&quot;. Tired of being made to kneel on grits and being unloved by an angry and unrelenting man who doesn't even try to be a father to Lily, Lily sets off for the only place she can even think of, a name on the back of a honey jar label that her mother kept. All it says is Tiburon, South Carolina, but Lily is certain it's her way out. Breaking her black nanny out of jail after Rosaleen is beaten senseless for trying to exercise her right to vote, this stunning story finds mothers for Lily everywhere and home is in the last place you expect it to be. Also, there is a reader's group guide at the end, which is always a plus. This is a beautiful story beautifully told by Sue Monk Kidd, her writing is exceptional. From page one you are emerged, and by the end, you are a character yourself as Sue Monk Kidd winds her literary genius around your heart.	2003-10-04

I know this book is a classic, and James Fenimore Cooper sought to fatten these pages with epic sagas of Indian and White-Men wars, placing special emphasis on the pride of every Indian tribe and their greatly diverse natures. He succeeded. The proud and somewhat glorious adventures of these doomed warriors is on every page. The Indian tribes are richly described in their bravery and cunning at war, their knowledge of the land they love and know so much better than the White Man.  In the wilderness of the 16th century, we have the Mohicans and the Mingos at war with each other and the white man. It is significant to the author to point out the last of the great Mohican tribe as a symbolic reference that, during this time frame, one tribe at least was near extinction, an omen and future yet to befall the rest of the \\"owners\\" of a country much loved and revered by the Indian. What becomes tough for the reader to sort out is this: Some tribes are referred to by three different names - or more, and within these tribes, some Indians themselves by many names. Adventure and fighting are abundant of course, and James Fenimore Cooper even adds a bit of romance and intrigue as a quest for two loved ones underlies much of the story.  I am sorry to say I was lost in trying to keep it all straight, and the book put me to sleep more often than not. Still, if you are an adventure lover and particularly interested in 16th century sagas, you may thrill to these pages. If not, it's a pretty good sleeping pill.	2003-09-25

Though this three cassette audio version offers some sound ideas, they certainly are not anything worth your changing your life over, I'm not even sure they WOULD change your life.  Neither are they anything self-help lovers have not heard before or read before in some fashion. Also, read by the author Cheryl Richardson, these 3 cassettes tend to have a monotone that could lull the poor listener into a coma. On more than a few occasions, I wondered where the author came up with an idea, since in the next paragraph or later on another cassette, she would clearly relate a story of her own life that contradicted the entire idea she presented in the first place. In fairness, Cheryl Richardson makes it clear she was not intending to &quot;practice what she preaches&quot; when she does that, but it just leaves the listener confused.

The Martins had tried to have a baby of their own for so long that they eventually adopt 6 year old Marty, a slightly troubled but astute youngster abandoned at age five.  When Vikki Martin becomes pregnant 4 years later, ten year old Marty can't help but feel just a bit resentful as he hears Vikki and Dan say they are finally going to have \\"a baby of their own.\\" As if he was not really \\"their own\\".  Wishing his mom was not pregnant, young Marty can't help but blame himself when she miscarries.  He is certain it was his wishes that caused Vikki to miscarry.  And then, incredibly, Vikki keeps feeling her baby move within her. It's impossible, she knows, psycho even, but real enough to send her and Dan back to the doctor's office.  Elation replaces despair as they learn from their puzzled doctor that Vikki must have been carrying twins, for there IS indeed a child inside of her. It's the oddest thing the doctor has ever seen, yet there it is.  Marty feels redeemed and happiness is restored to the Martin household as Vikki proudly gives birth to a strong and healthy baby boy. Marty is prepared to love his new brother, yet, from the instant he sees him, he senses something is amiss. \\"He's gross\\", he blurts out accidentally, and Marty is quickly chastised by his parents. Yet try as he might, there IS something VERY wrong with baby Darian. And only Marty sees it. Baby Darian can do things no other infant can do, and as the author leads you through the various stages of Darian's infancy, it becomes clear that Marty must get someone to believe his thoughts that Darian in not just growing up, he's growing in a very different way.  This is a horribly frightening tale with enough fear and suspense to make you hear noises that aren't there, and enough bloodshed to make you wonder if you really shut the closet door - or was it a crack open all along? Expertly presented, five starts to author Vincent Courtney. But don't turn out the lights yet.	2003-09-25

Firstly I'd like to commend the reader of this eight audio cassette version, Ms. Alison Fraser, for having done as superb a narration I've yet heard on an audio version of any book. Secondly, the story itself has little to do with \\"The Buffalo Soldiers\\" story itself, yet the author, even by mentioning them very little in comparison with the rest of the story, manages to incorporate the essence of \\"The Buffalo Soldiers\\" themselves so that without it, I don't think this book could make it. Beginning with the tragic deaths of two little girls and the effect their deaths has on their family, Laura, their mother and Terry, their father, and intricately weaving in the story of a young, black, foster child, this story manages to capture and tug at your heart quite strongly. Terry is a \\"tough guy\\" state trooper you have to be careful not to dislike, but by tape 2 I was transfixed, listening more and more each day, needing outcomes. The author's message seems clear, triumph over tragedy, victory despite adversity, harsh realities we ignore when we could help, yet this tender story of Alfred, a ten year old black child, says so much more. Chris Bohjalian speaks to prejudice, to nightmares, to heartaches, to love and to spirit in the harsh settings of today and during the Buffalo Soldier's time as well. The story is brilliantly crafted and excellently told. This one, well, you might, perhaps, come to believe in your dreams again.	2003-09-25

Ken Follett sets this story in twelfth century England, where Kings rule, but not necessarily lawfully, and Bishops corrupt, Earls change hands as fast as in a poker game, and the suspense is fabulous! I will admit to one point of &quot;get on with it&quot;, but it was brief, the entire book is filled with excitement and suspense. Prior Philip has just been made Prior of Kingsbridge, but he knows little of what is in store for him as he takes over the tiny church and tries to govern his monks with a firm hand while building a village and priory he can be proud of. Tom Builder has wanted nothing all his life but to build a fine cathedral, but a sword of sorrow seems to keep piercing his heart as he first sets out with his pregnant wife Agnes, and child to find work. From that small but interesting starting point, the plot deepens until one cannot stop turning the pages. We meet the ruthless William Hamleigh, the villain you love to hate, as he takes over the Earl of Shiring, while the daughter of that Earl becomes his life's obsession. Aliena has plans of her own though, a death bed vow to her father and a brutal memory of the castle take over with William Hamleigh at the helm will spur her to heights hitherto unknown to women in that age. Her strengh and courage bring forth renewed hope time after time in this epic saga that is nearly one thousand pages long and worth every page. The Middle Ages will come alive for you as soon as you start page one. So what are you waiting for? Enjoy the rarity of a novel with the perfect setting, the most thrilling characters, and one of the best plots (and subplots) waiting to absorb you. In this novel, we learn something very special about the human heart. Enjoy!	2003-09-25

Truly, though all of what Dr. Phil has to say is common sense (with a little stand up comedy thrown in) in this four cassette edition about your life, and although most of what he says you knew somewhere in your heart, you will learn the most incredible things. I thought our relationship (my husband and mine) was good, I can see I was right, but there were so many ways to make it THE relationship that I never even thought about. I truly think this man could run for President. One thing he mentions is passion, having a passion for the things in life that matter most to you (among having other things) and you can just hear the passion in HIS voice, knowing he believes what he is saying, and not just believes it, but wants YOU to know it. Because it's simple. Because you already know it and have to face it sooner or later. Because it will make your life so much easier. Don't struggle emotionally one more minute, just listen to these cassettes together with a partner, alone on your headset, while resting in the bath, and you will absolutely be amazed by the transformation that sets inside of you almost instantly - all good of course. You will also learn some harsh realities, along with a few things you didn't know about Dr. Phil that will surprise you. Best of all, no griping, no grumbling, just listen, and the fee....well, judge for yourself what you would pay a therapist for all this great advice and all of this time. Dr. Phil bills by the heart.

This is a brilliant and fascinating subject matter, however, I could not for the life of me decide how a Ph.D. author could possibly get a book published with so many English spelling and grammar errors that I had to check repeatedly the front cover for the name of the author. I thought perhaps English was not his first language. But a Ph.D? And a name like Dennis Stevens? Well, in any case, there were so many completely unbelievable spelling, grammar, and syntax errors that unfortunately these over-shadowed what may have been a good book. Also, be forewarned: If you CAN get past the errors, this author loves statistics, he does his studies by interviewing actual inmates or felons/criminals themselves, then goes on to say less about the mind of the criminal than the statistics of the crimes they are likely to commit. I usually pass on my books. This one is trash. I gave it two stars because there actually was a paragraph or two that made sense.	2003-09-14

Superbly written and absolutely enthralling, this passionate novel about friendship and loyalty will have you turning pages all night. The strange name of the book is in itself a reason to peek, so open wide and enjoy one of the best written novels and fully engrossing stories today. You'll find the setting in 1930's Kansas during the Depression perfectly fitting for the scenario of a small but unforgettable ladie's quilting club. Friendship runs deep, and in this story, friendship and loyalty are called upon to save a life. If you guess who did IT, then you are a better sleuth than most, and if you don't, then you did.

The author of this book, Joan Borysenko, is a leading authority on women's spirituality, which confounds me, because I did not know there was such a thing. An authority on spirituality I mean, since spirituality - well, read the book, because it is very well written and it is the story of a woman who is searching for the perfect fit between herself, her physical &quot;me&quot; self, and her spiritual self. The woman and her husband have no problem traipsing the continents in quest of the answer to their why am I heres and who am I's, and it makes for very interesting reading. I can't imagine how it is expressed from a soul to a written page as it attempts in this book, but what I enjoyed was the various descriptions of all kinds of practices, cults, religions, sects, and the quest itself is daring and adventuresome. These are good people, this is a good book, but I wondered why they were looking. Isn't the answer in the mirror?	2003-09-08

Now one of the twins is found brutally murdered, after spending an evening out with a famous astronaut, Christopher &quot;Chief&quot; (for his Indian blood) Hart.  It's much more than meets the eye here, as the remaining twin claims to have switched with her sister that particular evening, playing the switch game for the first time ever as adults.  The remaining twin is devastated; sure the murder was meant to be her.  As the plot gels, and the murder becomes more and more intricately weaved with a possible conspiracy of enormous proportions, so does the question arise: Who really is who?  The story is brilliantly written by Sandra Brown, quick to clasp the reader's interest, a little slow at times, but eventually fantastically brought together in a smashing ending that will leave you reeling.	2003-07-29

Perhaps because I found Richard Preston's The Hot Zone such a terrifying and captivating book, this one pales in comparison.  I was not thrilled with his book The Cobra Event either.  In this true story of bio-terrorism and all of it's implications, Richard Preston seems to taffy stretch the truth in many instances, seemingly a deliberate attempt to make what is already a dreadful truth even more terrifying.  For me, he failed, it was boring.  I wavered between a thirst for knowledge, lay-person knowledge that is, and anger at the author for tossing out biological weapon recipes as if they were pennies to be had by all.  At one point he does claim that it is \\"public\\" knowledge, but one would normally have to do a great deal of research on the subject and be well-versed and well trained in the field of bio-chemistry to understand it.  Instead, Mr. Preston attempts to make it very easily understood, leaving one with a \\"Gee thanks a lot Mr. Preston\\" sarcasmic attitude.  I thought his own attitude was cocky at best, but feel I must give credit paradoxically for the wealth of knowledge the book did contain.  The only portion of the book I found scary in the least was Mr. Preston's delivery of information that could, and most likely will, fall into many ugly hands. Much of what is said in this book could have been said with less detail and more vivid animation.  I wonder why he wrote it?  It doesn't, in my opinion, necessarily frighten, it's too factual for the average reader to scare them,  it's outright boring for a lay person such as myself and it smacks of sensationalism regarding a subject too awful even for that.  There's only a handful of people in today's world I think would benefit from this book, and we haven't found them yet. Gee, thanks a lot Mr. Preston.	2003-07-29

Jay is elected popularly as the 43rd President of the United States, with Senator T.E.Garland (d-Tex) as Vice President. Just two years later, President Jay has dropped significantly in the polls, and subsequently invokes the 25th amendment, declaring himself as having a &quot;major depressive episode&quot; and unfit to perform his duties as President. He transfers hid duties to Vice President T.E. Garland.  When it is learned President Jay is ready to re-assume his duties, a massive plot emerges to overthrow the sitting president and arrange some sort of coup d'etat. This is where it becomes incredibly confusing. There are far too many characters to keep straight, everyone seems to have a code name or &quot;Go Code&quot;, the Vice President who is really the President seems in on the plot, as do the Joint Chiefs of Staff and several Senators.  I like political intrigue, conspiracy and mystery, I really do, but I listened to this audio cassette (two tapes) four times and still I don't think I got it right. Frankly, it's one big mess.

Nothing in this world can prepare us for the spiritual aspect of this haunting murder mystery as described on this audio cassette version.  As much as science and reason can explain things seemingly unscientific, does there ever come a time when science alone cannot?  In this tender drama of a twenty-one year old nun, one cannot help but question the mysteries of faith - in all its forms.  Agnes, the twenty-one year old nun, has never known life as we have. Sheltered and secluded in her upbringing, abused and tragically disturbed, Agnes turns to the Catholic Convent when her mother dies.  Surely there, Mother Miriam can produce or at least invoke a kin to humanity in this child, and perhaps even be somewhat of a mother to her in many ways. Perhaps Mother Miriam can bring her a sense of a real world, a sense of mankind with all of its beauties and all of its flaws. Truth is not told lightly here, and when Agnes delivers a child, beliefs must be questioned, questions must be answered, faiths must be acknowledged - or abandoned. Beautifully portrayed on one audio cassette, you will hear Agnes' song long after the cassette is over.	2003-07-29

Each time I read Nicholas Sparks, a part of me is truly and forever amazed that a man can write with such depth, as though seeing into a woman's hidden places and tracing their outlines onto pages.  No exceptions here.  Adrienne Willis is divorced - a rather tragic figure -, yet her strength is in her very own tragedy, if only she could see that.  Asked by a friend to house-sit an inn on the coast of North Carolina, Adrienne, Adrienne agrees.  She is alone, her teenage children visiting with their father, and their will be only one guest.  She is certain she will manage, even with a fierce coastal storm predicted.  Paul Flanner has come to Rodanthe, North Carolina for different reasons.  He is a skilled surgeon, specializing in reconstructive surgery.  When one of his patients dies unexpectedly, and his wife leaves him - he realizes he has spent 25 years of his life being all of the things he should not have been.  A letter from the dead patient's husband calls him to Rodanthe - and despite his attorney's advice - Paul goes.  Adrienne and Paul are so different, so NOT for each other, yet each has a lesson to learn, and each as a lesson to teach.  Paul must go to Ecuador, to see his son he never bothered to be a father to.  Adrienne must reveal a secret long kept, to save her grieving newly-widowed daughter from falling forever into the black abyss of those who have no hope.  The intricate weaving of this story is a story all by itself. But only Nicholas Sparks could have put this one together.	2003-07-16

The characters could have been cardboard figures, the plot is dry, there just is not enough &quot;oomph&quot; to get the story off of the ground. The character Anna Catalano is called &quot;home&quot; temporarily to help out in the family restaurant. For Anna, home is not a safe haven, but a place of bad memories and disappointments better left buried and sorrows best not come to light. Patricia Gafney, the author, does make an attempt to trhow in some romance, but there just isn't enough there and the story fizzles. There are no &quot;flight lessons&quot; unless the author is trying to describe Anna Catalano's flight to and from home, and herself. If you must read this one, get it from the library.

When I first read this book, it was years ago. For the first time in my life I was made aware of the clear and present danger of biological weaponry. It frightened the taste right out of my mouth. This is one book that will open your eyes to the possibility of what, if caught in enemy hands, can be done to us. It happened all over the world, the Ebola virus, so much more than the word \\"deadly\\" can describe it, and yes, even in Virginia. How we fight these things there is no way to tell. We can only hope that we are always one step ahead of the enemies. Dying from E-bola would be worse than being skinned and dipped in salted boiling water. It is as horrible a scourge as mankind will ever see (we hope) and the book, which is non fiction and very true to life, has stayed with me for all these years. I think of it particularly today, as biological weaponry becomes closer to reality than any of us ever thought it would.	2003-07-06

This was the second time I have read the book, (hoping to get a little more out of it) and it just doesn't make much of a grade. The ending is a fast paced whirlwind of activity that does not match the rest of the book, and though some of the story does center on the actual human beings contracting this \\"virus\\", too much of the story is centered on the individual sleuths attempting to solve the puzzle and the mechanics of biological warfare. This aspect of the writing makes the book less of a good read and more of a definition of biological warfare, which can surpass the average layperson so easily that the reader can get lost quickly.

Anyone interested in forensics would just love this book. It is complete with pictures (some gruesome) and many different criminal investigative techniques.

It's short in pages, but very long in thoughtful wisdom. The story is about a boy who's lost his brother in a boating accident, of which he was part of. When he tries to commit suicide, feeling guilty about his brother's death, this story takes a twist you could not have expected. His parents, himself, his grandparents turn into anything but Ordinary People, and I think the title is a play on words, almost sarcastic, because of all the things this family is, ordinary was NEVER one of them. The father is a caring, almost over-doting but well loved by the reader, the mother an absolute villain, and the boy, who can be nothing but himself, does not know that that is precisely who he is. A very strange but loveable psychiatrist helps to do the trick, but the inner strength of the boy is what shines through every page, the paradox being he is certain he has no inner strength. Infinitely treasurable, the story becomes as real to you as yourself. If only all books and stories could be written like this one, with page turning drama and straight from the heart, there would never be another book review. 10 stars to the author on this one, plus a Grammy and an Emmy and an all around standing ovation.	2003-05-30

Holden Caulfield is a pimply, foul mouthed, sixteen year old kid who believes with all of his heart that just about everyone and everything in his life is a \\"phoney\\".  He thinks, of course, he is great, but no one understands him. His teachers stink. He goes to school. Many schools. In fact, today we would call Holden a \\"loser\\". Yet I believe the story is given to high schoolers often to read because of it's very \\"unphoney\\" coming of age of young Mr. Holden Caulfield. Thankfully, not all teenagers are like Holden, who comes from a well-to-do family, with a dead brother he loved and a little sister he adores. He is a poignant protagonist, and if read in the right light, can tug at your heartstrings as you begin to sense the isolation and loneliness that has lived with him for a very long time, I sense since his older brother Allie passed away. When Allie died, Holden was old enough to recall himself smashing all the windows in the garage and breaking his hand that night. Holden, though not the epitome of a teenager, is an alienated, sad, individual who builds his armor by swearing and chain smoking and not believing in life at all. We hear about Holden first at his latest school, Pencey, and those last few days at Pencey describe much of adolescent life during the early nineteen forties.

It is science fiction with a humorous attitude, but indeed, the Martians have arrived. It's slightly reminiscent of Welle's famous Martian arrival, with the exception that these Martians are real, and they have definitely arrived. They first appear to Luke Devereaux, a struggling writer who has borrowed a lone cabin in the middle of nowhere to try to break his writer's block. An ominous knock on the door. Yet no prior sound of a car so far out in the desert, cautiously Luke opens the door. And so it begins. Yes, they ARE little green men, and they are everywhere, and sanity becomes a matter of degrees for most earthlings. And the Martians stay. And stay. And stay. One must get used to living with these irritating, caustic, sarcastic little green things that can pop in and out anytime and anywhere, and wreak havoc on anyone and anything. The human race is being driven crazy! The Martians have no harmful intent it seems, except to disrupt the lives of everyone on earth. They simply must be dealt with. Written in 1955, this story gets an A+ in my book. I had just randomly grabbed it off my shelf for a quick-read. I was immediately hooked and was finished in two days. This book needs to be on the bestseller list!	2003-05-23

I gave this book four stars because of Patricia Cornwell's excellent writing style. She is very smart, of course, but writes with a smoothness little known in this genre. She certainly does provide convincing tidbits about Jack the Ripper, enough perhaps to make some people believe her choice of killers did it, but I had to think about reasonable doubt. So long after the infamous crimes, it is inevitable that Ms. Cornwell would be unable to collect enough physical evidence, even in conjunction with Scotland Yard, to prove her case. If I were a juror, I would have to plead not guilty. There is more than reasonable doubt, and some of her \\"facts\\" (for want of a better word) are definite stretches. In my heart, she almost has me convinced, but there is still that little bit of \\"almost\\" hanging around that insists this case is not closed. Having read most, if not all of Ms. Cornwell's books, I'm more on the believer side, as she is indeed an excellent forensic pathologist, usually in the person of Kay Scarpetta. I also thought that she gave Scotland yard an unfair shake, considering what they had to work with back then, often it sounds as though she blames the nearly unsolvability of the case on their shabby police work, when in fact, they simply did not have today's technology. She also balances this at point with some commendations for Scotland Yard, but I ended up feeling she was not pleased with their work back in the Jack the Ripper days and thought that even with little technology, they could have done better. It's your turn to be the juror.	2003-05-23

This is a sort of humanistic psychology book that speaks of Western Christianity. Ira Progof has done just a fantastic job of captivating his audience. It is a translation of one of the classics of Christianity, but it is written in laymans terms and just absolutely brilliant. Ira Progof does the best job of translating this classic guide to spiritual experience that I am now looking for other books written by him. The translation speaks so well of inner depths and souls and things you may have always wondered but were never really sure of spiritually. I found myself staying up late at night, anxious to finish, but not anxious to end it! I may just read it again. There are passages that are so deep and so meaningful that I found myself reading them over and over. Some may find these passages I speak of vague, and they are. Yet they are worth understanding. This book takes effort and the pay-off is astounding.	2003-04-22

A plot has been set to assassinate the Vice-President elect of the United States. The why is answered at the end of the story, but only one Secret Service man is aware of the plot. Someone has infiltrated that elite group, and now there's only one man in the entire world who can capture the would-be assassin. Jack Reacher, brother of Joe Reacher, a former Secret Service Agent now deceased (although we never find out how Joe died), is an \\"outsider\\", hired to play the role of an assassin, to find the loopholes and the errors in the Secret Service's plans to protect the Vice President-elect Brook Armstrong. Jack Reacher does a great job, but why and who wants to asassinate Armstrong?Is there a secret in his past? It's time to find out. Good plot, well developed characters, action packed, but just not my kind of book. Perhaps you will enjoy it better.	2003-04-22

There doesn't seem to be much room in the house anymore for her now that Andrea is gone. Daddy and Mommy have no place for her in their heart. Or so she feels. The perpetrator seems obvious, but until the police are one hundred percent certain, they suspect everyone, even Ellie. Ellie, even at age 7, does have secrets of her own, secrets her now dead older sister Andrea has made her promise NEVER to reveal. Ellie wonders if Andrea's death means she can tell those secrets now, and she isn't sure. What Ellie doesn't know is that Andrea's well-worn  \\"Swear not to tell EVER\\" may unlock the key to finding Andrea's murderer.	2003-04-22

Heather and Micah Malone live a storybook life in New Hampshire, with two adopted daughters and a town devoted to being close knit. I loved the way the author began the story, with a creepy \\"Here I come\\" kind of way. The FBI wants Heather, claiming she isn't Heather at all, but one Lisa Matlock, who is wanted for murder in California. The clues weigh heavy against her. Her common law husband is crushed and tries to believe in her while realizing she has never mentioned her past to him. Her dear friend Poppy, a paraplegic decides to take the case on, refusing to stay by Heather's side throughout whatever ordeal may ensue. Heather insists that she is Heather and NOT Lisa, and this is some terrible mistake. She is terrified for her life, and her heart aches for the girls and Micah. In the meantime, Poppy meets Griffin, a reporter, who admits he just mentioned Heather's remarkable similarity to another case he had once worked to a reporter while in town last spring on another story. That reporter ran with it and now it is a mess. Poppy doesn't ever want to forgive him for that, but there is something about him that keeps drawing her closer and closer. As a paraplegic, Poppy doesn't believe she will ever find or want love again, but Griffin moves into a cabin across the lake and is determined to help Heather. Heather's two girls want Mommy, desperately, and they cannot understand what has happened. Everyone keeps telling them that Mommy has taken a trip and will be back soon.  With a lot of sadness and a pinch of loneliness, this author does a fine job with a strong plot.	2003-04-08

The author does such a great job at describing the weather in this stormy tale of a new baby, left in the snow, but covered on the steps of St. Alban's Episcopal Church. The new Reverend is a woman, and it is she who stumbles upon the writhing bundle while getting ready to brave the weather and go for  a jog. Reverend Clare Ferguson finds a note next to the baby, saying \\"Please give Cody to Mr. and Mrs. Burns here at St Albans.\\" Mr. and Mrs. Burnes are anxious for a child, and everyone in the little town of Millers Kill, Washington knows this. Snow is falling all of the time, the Reverend just hates to get rid of her tiny car, but an SUV will be so much more practical. The police and an ambulance arrive at St. Albans, whisking baby Coty to an unknown fate. 6 days later, a young woman is found dead, bashed in the head with a blunt object, left lying out in the snow. She is 6 days post partum and her name is Katie. She is Cody's mother. Throughout all the interviews, one man stands out because Katie once dated his son. He is of a most despicable character, already having molested the oldest girl he had until she left for college and possibly molesting Katie as well. He believes he is the child's grandfather and wants the child. The FBI and local police know this would be a horrible place for the child, the man smells of booze, the 300 pound wife has no say, but the Department of Human Services has plenty to say once all the blood and DNA testing is in.  Days later, Mr. McWhorter, the would be grandfather is also dead, shot in the back of the head, left in the snow. It's a great who done it story. I personally did not figure it out until the end, but when you find out who killed Katie and her father, you will be shocked. There are undertones of romance. Reverend Clare must keep herself in check with the Chief of Police, who is married and also must keep himself in check. This added a bit of spice and reality, which wasn't needed but was appreciated nonetheless.	2003-04-07

Nora's novels are not too sappy, although this one touched the edge.Seth Quinn is coming home,home at last to where the Chesapeake waters of Maryland have always entranced him. The first ten years of Seth Quinn's life were unequivocably awful. Until one day, his knight in shining armor appears, and he is whisked away to the Quinn Boatyard, where he has two older brothers and a sister. He learns of course, that Ray Quinn, his &quot;knight in shining armor&quot; had to use the lure of money to get him, but Ray is portrayed as a saint, and means no harm. He wants to save Seth from a drinking relic of a mother/prostitute before it is too late. Naturally suspicious, Seth Quinn remains so until he is given what he wants most - to never to be returned to his mother. Ray gladly promises. Ray dies soon after, but Seth's new family keeps him, and he grows into a promising young man, handsome and smart. From scrawny teen to husky man, he goes to Rome to be a famous painter. And his paintings are a hit, and they do sell, and Seth Quinn does become not quite as famous as he'd liked, but happy for the first time in his life.  He is now a skilled and reknowned painter, but the need to escape the city of Rome is pressing. There are dark secrets there. The author makes  a strong effort to emphasize how close the Quinn family is. There are Quinn family sayings and Quinn family rituals and all in the spirit of fun. By now, &quot;Boats by Quinn&quot; is a famous industry. Predictably, boy meets girl, meaning Seth does meet a woman who has just opened a flower shop in town. She finds him pushy but &quot;when a Quinn wants something, he gets it&quot;. Yet an ominous and sinister path follows Seth, a real life haunting of sorts, one he cannot seem to lose. Will his new lady find out? And if she does, will she still want him? Will anyone want him? Maybe it is &quot;a Quinn thing&quot;. Only the reader will know for sure.	2003-04-07

The back of the book insist this is &quot;a hilarious and chilling.......playground for the rich, ...brilliantly suspenseful..&quot;ad nauseum. First I couldn't keep the characters straight because one of the protagonists was a detective named Lynn Cutter. I thought it was a female, which threw me really off track when MR. Cutter gives private investigator Breda Burrows a long look at her blue eyes and long legs. MR. Cutter is a policeman, but one who is hoping he will get into no more trouble until his pension comes through in a matter of months. Along stumbles (literally) Ms. Breda Burrows, a strong woman, but desperately in need of someone with a badge to help her solve the mystery of a rich woman who believes her husband is philandering by giving sperm to a sperm bank.  My sympathies and sense of humor lie with Mr. Cutter, who is really a very funny character and brings life into this incredibly boring story. As Breda's guide they must wander through the glazed world of Palm Springs, where they will encounter oddities that don't fit, bodies that shouldn't be dead and loads of money. This book is not captivating enough, even with Mr. Cutter as a lively character to warrant one star.	2003-03-07

Science Fiction being the tricky genre that it can sometimes be, author L.

His mission - to bring one kidnapped Jettero Heller of a group simply designated as the \\"Fleet\\", which is much higher in the chain of life on Voltar, to Earth for a less than dubious task. The characters are alive and the story is told from the viewpoint of Soltan Gris himself, making it all the more interesting. This is book one in a series of ten, and I most definitely am beginning book two immediately. L. Ron Hubbard manages to mix a melting pot of creativity in authorship. There is humor, the story is fast-paced, there is suspense for the suspense and mystery lover, and even some exotic moments with the Widow Tayl (a nymphomanicac of Voltar). A definite must for science fiction lovers and just a very well written, expansive, delightful story. Enjoy!	2003-02-06

I found this book filled with information about the plague, but it was not precisely what one would expect in a book touted as such. I did not quite get the connection that the author first alludes to in the first few pages. The author claims he will show how bioterrorism may very well be our worst concern by the end of this President's term, yet mentions very little to support the plausability of this statement. Then too, we have the author's underlying (seeming) arrogance, curt remarks on other authors and such. Not a page turner for sure, and the Plague is such an interesting subject that it is a shame this book could not have picked up on that point and elaborated. I found it dry, and I gave it two stars for it's information and it's (thankfully) brevity. I truly did expect more of a connection with today's world and felt cheated.	2003-02-03

A young child accuses a young man of a crime. Her guilt possesses her life, excommunicates her sister from the family, and sends the man, who happens to be her sister's lover to prison. Had it been an adult who had done such a thing, the story would have depth, but from the beginning you realize the child has a vivid imagination, as said by the author when he describes her love of colorful words when she writes, which she loves to do. And so from the beginning you understand the police would never believe her story, and there, in my view, is where the story ends. Lives ruined, loves shattered, a young child haunted by one day when she was little? It doesn't work, and it isn't well written. The ending was beautifully put together, and that is why I gave it two stars and not just one. At times the author attempts to help the child recant her original accusation, which would have made sense, but then the author fails us, and doesn't, and tries to make a story out of a ludicrous, more-than-unlikely tale.	2002-11-26

Judith Singer is a widow, but a long time ago, she had an outrageous and delicious affair which led her to fall in love with Nelson Sharpe, a former homicide detective. Knowing that being together and separating from their respective spouses would ruin too many hearts, they end the affair, with noone the wiser. Until now. A woman has disappeared in the neighborhood, and Judith, famous for having solved one old mystery a long time ago, just can't keep her passion for snooping away from this one. This leads her to a run in with a Mafia Leader who claims he is no longer one but wants her to find who killed his son's wife. When Nelson Sharpe discovers Judith is in touch with, and actually working for &quot;Fancy Phil&quot;, he goes ballistic, and re-enters her life with an explosion heard as soon as you turn that particular page.

She must go from being a well known artist in France to become a mother to her two nieces in Long Island Sound. Tragically, Dana's sister and brother-in-law have been killed, and now Dana must take on, with the help of Grandma, two sullen and emotionally destroyed children, both girls. At first Dana plans to take Allie and Quinn back to France with her, to introduce them to a new lifestyle, to move them away from the tragedy. But a link with an old swimming student and fate steps in to change Dana's mind. Quinn is convinced her mother's death could not have been an accident, after all, it had been family tradition to take swimming lessons until the age of ten or so in the event of an emergency, and there was no way her mother, Lily, could have succumbed to a simple sailing accident. Quinn is determined to find out the truth, and she is the anchor that holds the story together. Well put and well written, not striking, but a good afternoon read.	2002-09-30

Author John Katzenbach has done a fabulous job with this one. Ricky (Frederick) Starks, a brilliant and successful analyst, receives a note one day, presumably from a former patient. \\"Happy Birthday, Dr. Starks. You ruined my life. And now I fully intend to ruin yours.\\" Signed, Rumlestiltskin. Dr. Starks is given a limited time to kill himself, or he will be made to suffer the grim and gruesome torture, harassment, maybe even murder, of any one of the 52 members of his own family. All the stalker promises is that whatever he does to a member of Dr. Stark's family, that person will never recover from it, either physically or maybe emotionally.  Within this limited time, he and the \\"former patient\\" will communicate through the New York Times classified ads. If he figures out his stalker's identity, he wins and the game is over. If he cannot, he must kill himself or....the cat and mouse chase in this story is simply fabulous. A brilliant scheme begins, and when it ends, you will not believe it yourself. Terrific!	2002-09-30

In fact, he is such a big deal in Hollywood that he can afford to always fly first class and share in all of life's finest. Terry McQuinn has also not heard his father's voice in ten years. Split up because of what Terry describes as \\"money and pride\\", Terry last saw his dad at his mother's funeral, ten years ago, and even then they stayed apart. Terry's dad had always been the caretaker for the summer cottages in Maine, beautiful cottages where wealthy residents could afford gardeners, housemaids, butlers and caretakers. Terry grew to look at his father as not much more than a servant, and Terry also felt his father deprived his mother of a life of her own in many ways. But the breach is broken by the raspy sound of his father's voice on the telephone one day. His father says only \\"I've got my doctor here... he wants to talk to you.\\"  The doctor informs Terry his father is dying. Terry flies home, but then tears up the last leg of his ticket to drive the rest of the way, coming to the realization that he doesn't really want to get there that quickly. By the time Terry reaches Maine, his father has passed on. But there are cottages to maintain, and his father's only workshop, and one very special cottage that holds Christmas memories tucked away in a little boy's mind that cannot be ignored. Terry decides he must open this one cottage for Christmas since it was a job his father had promised to do. The rest is magic, pure and simple, and if you believe in true love, and you believe that ice can melt, you will love this story.	2002-09-30

Each evolutionary period seemed to bring out a new definition of God, it is as though we created Him to suit our needs as our needs changed. And perhaps we did indeed. For those hard core religious folks, it brings to mind unsettling questions about God. If God is so changeable, if humans can make Him what they wish at any given time in history, then couldn't He just be what we create and not vice-versa? A definitively thought provoking book that will challenge even the basis of creation, but will just as easily bring you to a new and honorable state of mind about the One whose word we listen to. For non-believers, I think this book strengthens their case, and makes it look as though God has always been whatever we choose Him to be, yet Karen Armstrong does an excellent job of walking the very fine line between believers and non-believers. This is a true historical gem. Unfortunately, there are many times the words get lost because the focus grows dim. This is the case when Karen Armstrong tries to cram way too much history in one chapter. I think it should have maybe been a series, or two books, because too much information can be as bad as too little information at times.	2002-09-07

In \\"A Civil Action\\", which is a true story, it is up to one lonely lawyer to fight for the victims of leukemia, believed to be contracted by contaminated wells in Woburn, MA. But the story is really about our justice system, which is a sham at the best of times. How motion after motion gets denied, how the plaintiffs never get to tell their heartrending stories of trauma, illness and death. The narrative is by John Shea, and he is fabulous both in tone and verbage. His enthusiasm brings you closer to the case, and when you remember that it is a true story, you want to sit down and cry for these poor people overlooked by the corruption and red tape of our criminal justice system. It's truly shocking and an unforgettable story at the least. In the beginning our hero (Attorney Schlickman) fights with a vengeance, in the end, he, like the Woburn residents, have begun to lose their mental stamina. Emotionally exhausted, the trial goes on, even when it seems all is lost. You will find this reading experience enlightening and memorable.	2002-09-04

Read with aplomb by Paul Scofield, this classic Dickens novel is a great audio tape to take along with you when you are walking or exercising. David Copperfield seems somewhat of a pitiful fellow, which makes you like him all the more, and the villainous character of Mr. Uriah Heep is brought out quite nicely. What struck  me was how people in this book fell in love so quickly, as though looking at one another and sensing an attraction was enough for a proposal of marriage. Young Mr. Copperfield loses his father at a very early age, but is quite content with his housemaid and his mother, who love him dearly. Then he is sent for a two week visit to the home of his housemaid, where he has a marvelous time, only to return and learn that his mother has re-married a dreadful man, who beats David and sends him away to the worst of schools, where, if he is not careful, he will be beaten daily. When his mother passes away, young David begins to become a man, and it is this that you will admire, his strength and perseverance in growing up under such adverse circumstances. The cassette version is only two cassettes long, but it is long enough for you to understand precisely what Mr. Dickens means for you to understand. And yes, David Copperfield suffers many trials and tribulations as an adult as well, which keeps it interesting. What he becomes in the end will not surprise you, but it will delight you.	2002-09-04

In these thirty two stories, you cannot help but wonder if author Bentley Little was just recording his own nightmares. They are, for the most part, too weird to be frightening, although there are a few parts that will bring out the adrenaline. When he is not being scary, he is grossing you out, which is never a bad thing for horror lovers. Unfortunately, I just could not find myself stuck to the pages, it just wasn't that mesmerizing. What I kept thinking of is what my own collection of nightmares written down would be like, and I think they would be similar, if not as vivid. Bentley Little is a fine author who does a good job of putting stories together, but this time I think he could have added a little more reality, a little less abstract extreme, and a lot more depth.	2002-08-28

Marissa Jenkins is an unmarried, attractive individual with a successful career. She has plenty of male friends, unfortunately, they are all married. Marissa claims the life of a married man is easier to handle than the dating \\"singles scene\\" and she continues in her illicit affairs despite the often crass but well meaning criticisms of her friends. Then one day Marissa receives a phone call from an unidentified wife, a threat to \\"leave her man alone ... or else.\\" At first she does not think much of it, but the phone calls, and later notes, and even later attacks, soon have her in fear for her life. She is fortunate to have just a couple of good friends on her side, and when Marissa's life seriously becomes endangered, it is these friends, the ones who do not judge her, that help her through her crisis. I found this book not just about adultery, which in itself is awful, but about the power of friendship. The author states so clearly and so poignantly how there are just some friends who truly do love you, no matter if what you do seems wrong to them. Though it was a good book, it wasn't deep enough. The fear Marissa felt, the condemnation of her friends, the questioning of her own lifestyle, were not delved into deep enough. It's a short read, but had it been longer, we may have come to love Marissa, instead of feeling that she just may have gotten what she deserved. There is no character development, just shadowy introductions that never end up to much. A good read I guess for a long summer day, but not a must-read by any stretch of the imagination.	2002-08-24

If you have ever suffered from depression, or have had someone you love experience this debilitating disease, you need this book. I savored every page, finding comfort in the fact that not only had other people suffered from this disease, but that others had suffered so much worse and had survived. There is hope, and hope is in these pages. Andrew Solomon talks a lot about his own experiences with this dreadful disease, but he introduces us to others that are so pitiful, so heart-wrenching, you cannot help but want to pray and hope for these people. If this book ever reaches the higher echelons of our red taped Congress, and if those members themselves read it, I believe it would change the way mental health is viewed forever.  There is candor here also, and some humor, but by confronting the very definition of depression, Andrew Solomon has made great strides into this vast realm of unbelievable depths. He covers treatments of the disease, the good side and the bad, population statistics (which will render you speechless), the history of depression, suicide, addiction, the evolution of depression, and lastly, but most importantly, hope. I loved and treasured the last few pages, his last words, his truthfulness and openness. Please read this book. Please read it. If not for yourself, for others you know. The friend you talk to every day may suffer without your knowledge. Your teenager, so &quot;normal&quot; on the outside, may be in incredible pain, your aging parent.... the list goes on, but read this book. It is, without question, the foremost and most open book you will ever read.	2002-08-24

I'm not a western fan, but occasionally I do read Westerns for a change from my usual. And Louis Lamour is always a favorite. Not because of the tough and gritty &quot;Howdy Pardner&quot; kind of cowboy, but because I find him funny, his characters likeable, his books a quick read and an amazing escape from reality. Sometimes, too many of the books I read are too serious, or too dramatic, or too thought provoking, but Louis Lamour can be counted on for straight facts. There is always a bank robber, and always a person who &quot;needed killin'&quot; and always a damsel in distress or a least a damsel who catches the main character's eye. Kind of like a Harlequin for a break in serious realms, I always enjoy him.	2002-08-24

I use audio books to help me on my exercise walks, and this one was so intense and so dripping with drama, I did extra laps just to see what would happen. Stephen King's extraordinarily ability to take the mundane and add the creep factor reigns supreme here. An unwed pregnant woman goes to her OB-GYN, at a time when unwed mothers were a huge taboo, and her OB-GYN is impressed by her strength and her fortitude and determination to go through with this birth. He is so impressed in fact, that he follows her carefully through each stage of her pregnancy. When it is at last time for her child to be born...well, then there comes a dark and gloomy night at a men's club, years later, where this certain OB-GYN proceeds to tell this tale. The club has been meeting for years, each member telling extraordinary tales, some old war tales, some cigar smoking tales, the usual, but THIS story, well this story is called &quot;The Breathing Method&quot;, and the OB-GYN who chooses to tell the story begins by recalling that at the time of this woman's entrance into his life with her illegitimate pregnancy, he was just beginning to introduce the Lamaze technique (not yet called that) to his pregnant patients. He was adamant that it worked, and he was nearly called a fool because of the little pamphlets and booklets he encouraged pregnant woman to read and to try and use during labor. His unwed patient takes the breathing method to heart. So focused and so determined is she to use this method, it becomes almost a part of who she is. But I will leave you there, so as not to spoil the ending for you, however, I will say, the ending is shocking, and you will think about it long after you are finished this story. The reader, Frank Muller is perfect, just right for what Stephen King wants to say. Enjoy the breathing method, if you will, it's power will amaze you.	2002-08-24

A young White Lawyer begins to date the daughter of the President. They have some fun events and adventures outwitting the Secret Service at times, and those episodes have their merits, but both the young Lawyer and \\"Shadow\\", the code name for Nora Hartson, the president's daughter, become ensnared in a political snaggle that involves betrayal, murder, and of course, the inevitable scandal. The reason I use the word \\"Unlikely\\" is because it is highly improbable for any of this to happen the way the author tries to betray it, and books. as you know, that try hard to incorporate an element of truth but use the wrong characters and situations, are a failure. It becomes a who-dun-it, and a boring one at that.	2002-08-24

I bought this book for my daughter's summer reading, and it turned out to be a simply delightful and encouraging story of a young woman's trip from youth to adulthood. Taylor Greer used to be Marietta Greer, but like her life, she changes her name, determined to leave her Kentucky childhood behind and get away from a certain future of pregnancy and bare feet. With a few fix-it lessons from her mother on old cars, Taylor takes her beat up 55 Volkswagon with no windows, no back seat and no starter, and begins a trip across the Great Plains, determined to drive as far west as she can until the car won't run anymore. Taylor hadn't counted on a lot of things, but mainly she hadn't counted on her rocker arm breaking down and having to use half her money to fix it. She also hadn't counted on being given a baby to raise. Her quick wit and strong heart take her further than she ever dreamed possible. You will adore the people she meets, the life she lives, and her incredible courage as she begins to find perhaps not the life she had envisioned, but a life full of good friends, warm lessons, and a special kind of love . A story to capture your heart.	2002-07-03

This book is jam packed with historical information relating to theology from the very beginning of mankind. I found it interesting, but just a bit too jam-packed for me. It is tough to keep it all straight, and I kept hoping the author would liven it up a little. It is, however, a truly marvelous study of the religions of the world, their origin, their history, and their evolution as the needs of man changed. A very fascinating subject that the author does extrememly well with. If you are a student of world religions, you will find this book invaluable. If you are looking for a light, entertaining read, perhaps it is better to look elsewhere.	2002-06-29

I have not read all of Mr. Koontz' books, but I would be very surprised if this was not absolutely the scariest book he has ever written. In typical Koontz style, the story begins with a glimpse of our worst nightmare, Mr. Edglar Vess. Mr. Vess is not just any psychopath, he is a living, breathing nightmare that walks the dark side of the soul with INTENSITY. Everything Mr. Vess does, he does for the sheer sensation of it. Every touch, every smell, every visual, has him in extreme ecstasy, including painful and awful senses. Since Mr. Vess feels he has most certainly \\"conquered\\" such human weaknesses as love and honor and friendship, he feels quite free to exercise his taste for various sensations. Murder is just a word to Mr. Vess, slaughter is not even in his mind, yet that is what he does to each and every victim, and there are many. With the exception of one. A sixteen year old girl named Ariel is locked in his basement. He is savoring her because she is so beautiful. He is waiting for her to \\"ripen\\" so he can then play at his macabre game. Chyna Shepard has been there before. She plays a young adult woman, vacationing with her only friend and confidante in the world when Edglar Vess decides to slaughter the whole family. Edglar is unaware that Chyna is in the guest bedroom and after his slaughter he is unaware that Chyna has survived. She may well be his one fatal mistake, for Chyna begins to stalk the stalker. She is tired of having been abused as a child and all of her life, tired of being the victim, and desperately intent on avenging the death of her best friend. When Chyna stumbles upon the information that Mr. Vess may be keeping a young girl in his cellar, her quest for vengeance rises even higher and she begins a ruthless search for Ariel, determined to free her from this madman, and in turn, free all who have ever suffered from abuse. It is a battle of fierce wills, and a fight to the death between two insane people, one born that way, and the other driven by a fierce need to survive for all she believes in.	2002-06-17

Though I would not race right out and buy this book, perhaps you could borrow it, as it IS an easy-paced, well-written story. Lou and Oz are orphaned at ages 12 and 8, their father has died in a car wreck, their mother is hopelessly comatose. They have no family except a great grandmother, Lou's namesake, living in the Appalachian Mountains. She is thrilled to take them in, but Lou and Oz must adapt from a New York City lifestyle to that of mountain folk, whose chores are endless, and where nothing you need is ever store-bought. Lou harbors a deep resentment of her comatose mother, blames her, in fact, for her father's death, whereas 8 year old Oz adores his mother, and believes with childlike faith that with enough attention and love, his mother will get better. There are a couple of side conflicts to entertain you, but not much excitement. Even if it doesn't keep you up at night, it will occupy a few lazy summer afternoons.	2002-06-17

Christiane Northrup takes you down the long road of aging with some very strong facts and a lot of interesting side trips. The author touches all aspects of this time of change, including hormones, breast issues, hot flashes, dieting, exercising, emotional issues, empty nesting etc... However, she does not go into enough detail on the emotional roller coaster ride that women in this age group face. Because of this, much of the book reads like a medical journal, and can be quite boring. Christiane alludes a lot to some mystical aspects, but never explains them enough for the reader to enjoy her view. There is some mention of balancing chakras and some other spiritual mentions, but not enough. And unfortunately, some of her ideas are just plain whacko. Still, when absorbed cover to cover, much of it is helpful, written in plain English and not medical jargon, and supportive of women's issues. It's an average book that seems like it once had a point, but perhaps the author forgot the original point and wandered off into many different ones.	2002-06-13

I'm not sure I would say this book is full of passion, but certainly the writer has concerned herself with Artemisia's passion for art, and in that, the descriptions and feelings are endless and beautiful. The story is a good one, it flows beautifully into a reality you can absorb, and it is at times both intense and painfully shallow. Artemisia is not just an artist, she is a woman, a mother, a daughter, a person with deep insights and dark emotions. I think the author does a superb job of keeping the reader spellbound with this easy flowing story, and of joining both reader and characters together in an intricately weaved and artfully told environment. I could read it again, it's the kind of book you feel as though you could always learn something new from. There were parts I thought I should stop and write down, sentences and thoughts so beautifully phrased I wanted to preserve them. But I had borrowed the book, and an anxious next-reader was waiting. Read this book. It's excellent.	2002-05-29

If &quot;The Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; had been less like the Bible, I think it could have been insightful and educational. I wanted badly to learn more about my faith, but I had a difficult time understanding all the rhetoric, the talking in circles, the vague and confusing explanations. Plain English is what this book needs. There were many parts that intrigued me, and many parts I found beautifully written, but it sure was hard to follow for the most part and I think it could have been made a lot easier for the lay person with some simple explanations. So far, the best I have learned about my faith is in church. This book will more than likely confuse the person trying to learn about this beautiful faith.	2002-05-29

This really is not your average self help book. Dr. Phil is just so straight forward and easy to &quot;listen&quot; to, that this book really can hit the spot. If you are truly dedicated to reconnecting with yourself, with finding your 'authentic' self, then grab a notebook and a pen with lots of ink, because with this new and exciting book from America's Dr. Phil, you will definitely need it. I admit I did not do each and every exercise in writing, because I like to read in bed, but what I did not do in writing I tried to do in my head (not the same - I know!) and I actually did come up with some pretty startling revelations about myself! I do believe that if you follow Dr. Phil's advice, if you totally dedicate yourself to the task and really buckle down with the writing exercises, you can achieve the goal - finding and living your authentic self, instead of all those plastic personas we all wear in different situations. If you choose not to write the exercises, I recommend the book anyway, because Dr. Phil is never a waste of time, and his narratives in this book are no exception. A truly remarkable and in depth look at the human self, Dr. Phil has navigated his way into our thoughts - again!	2002-04-30

This book did not pack as much oomph as the others. For some reason, it just didn't hold my interest as tightly as the rest of the series. Still, it is intense, taking up where book number eight left off. Nicolae Carpathia has taken the throne, and defiled the altar of Christ. The Tribulation Force gains ground in this one, and you find yourself cheering them on as they fight against impossible odds against Satan himself. I was pleased to see a bit more of the handiwork of God in this book, as this is what has made the series so incredibly faith renewing for me. Occasionally you get a feel of unreality, as Nicolae's staff responds to him even when he is beginning to make himself look suspicious, but the author doesn't run away with that, it remains contained and doesn't quite cross the edge into unbelievable. In this one, it is time for all to choose, either the Mark of the Beast or God, and there will be no exceptions. This furthers the atmosphere of impossible odds for the Tribulation Force. My biggest complaint is the length of time between books, since by the time this one came out, I'd forgotten where the last one had left off.  The book could stand on it's own though, and that makes every minute you spend reading it worth it. You may find some prophecy here as well that relates to our current times, making the overall story even more frightening.	2002-04-25

I never would have thought such a factual, historical tale could be told in the fashion of a novel, and manage at the same time to keep the reader intrigued, interested, and dangerously fascinated. Author Michael Capuzzo has done an outstanding job of relating incidents of the first known shark attacks on the East Coast, while at the same time wrapping the historical data in such fascinating verbage that reading this book was an absolute pleasure. People and places along the New Jersey coastline come to life for us in this book, and even the shark attacks take on a life of their own.

What follows is a tale that is both funny and touchingly sad. Opal moves into a house next to Rose Nelson and her husband. Rose is a tragic character that never got over the death of her sixteen year old son. Rose has shut out the world for forever it seems, but nothing is forever in Normal, Massachusetts, and you will find yourself wishing this story did indeed go on forever.	2002-04-09
US	52789100	R3M6BO7FAGY3NN	0446527130	118908960	Envy	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Mildly confusing, but worth the effort to figure it out.	Sandra Brown writes an intense story, complete with a hostile writer who prefers to remain anonymous, even to the publisher to whom he sends his book, a high powered career woman with a lot of spunk trying to track him down, a villainous husband, a murder, illicit affairs, danger, excitement, and intrigue. To wrap all that into one book had to be tough, and though there were so many plots and characters I had to really concentrate on the book to keep it straight, but the ending is well worth the effort. You will enjoy the fictional character who goes at first only by the initials P.M.E., not all is as it seems with him, and Maris Matherly Reed receives his manuscript, knows it is good, but has no contact information. She is determined to find him, and as the story pours out thin streams of information, we are drawn into a mystery of immense proportions. This is definitely one of Sandra Brown's better books.	2002-04-09

I hesitated to begin this book, since I know nothing of golf and suspected it would be full of golf jargon I would have a difficult time deciphering. I was right, but the author so splendidly weaves a touching tale around the golf, that I fell in love with the story almost right away. Bobby Jobe is a professional golf player, playing the PGA tournament one day and being a pompous jerk to his caddie as usual, when suddenly a tragedy turns Bobby completely around. It doesn't help his caddie however, whom he calls &quot;Greyhound&quot; and whom he initially blames for the tragedy. &quot;Greyhound&quot; is actually our hero in this book and he is a figure to be reckoned with. He is as real and as life-like as an author can make a character, and he is also lovable and a great golf caddie. His real name is Henry Mote, he initially caddies for the arrogant and abrasive Bobby Jobe, until that one moment in time when a tragedy changes them both forever. The tides get reversed, and Henry finds himself in an awkward situation when he is asked to once again caddie for Bobby Jobe, but in a very different capacity. This book has everything you need for a great escape, buy it today!	2002-04-09

This is the fourth book in a story that begins when our protagonist enters a circle of stones and falls two hundred years into the past. All four books are incredible, but this fourth one is a mesmerizing, can't-put-down book.  It's amazing how Diana Gabaldon sews all of the books together. Having fallen two hundred years into the past, Claire Randall falls in love, deeply, with a Scottish Highlander by the name of Jamie Fraser. Forced to make an agonizing choice to stay in the past or return to her husband, the decision is finally made for her when Scotland goes to war with England, and she escapes back through the stones, narrowly escaping death, leaving her lover/husband behind to face a certain death. Three years have passed since Claire first fell into the past,but she knows she must go, for she is pregnant. Drums of Autumn begins in her present time, where she meets historian Roger Wakefield. Knowing Jamie Fraser to have died on the battlefield in Scotland, she now comes with her grown daughter Brianna to Mr. Wakefield for some research on what happened to some of the rest of the folks she knew and loved back \\"then\\". She had returned to her husband Frank in present day time, but he has since died. They had raised Brianna together, with Frank thinking Claire delusional every time she tried to tell him her story. Now with Brianna grown and Frank dead, Claire, a physician, asks Roger Wakefield to research a list of people she had known in the past, claiming just curiosity of Scottish history. Anxious to know what happened to her many friends and in-laws, she is shocked to know how many, almost all, died on the battlefield, but an even more shocking discovery leads her to tell Briana and Roger Wakefield the whole story. Now Claire must make a wrenching decision, and what she does now will alter Brianna's future forever, and change Claire's life in a way she never thought possible.  I could not put this book down. I finished it in the care, and it was so good thatI didn't notice until after we'd driven off we had not been stopped at a stoplight, but by the police! (Routine check). This author is gifted, this book and the entire series of books is a must-have.	2002-04-02

This is the third in a series of books about Claire Randall, an English woman who mysterious falls through a wedge in some ancient stones and finds herself in eighteenth century Scotland. All three books have been mesmerizing, and it is difficult to determine which so far has been the best. Absolutely saturated with adventure, mayhem  and story after story of breath holding moments, in Voyager, there is plenty of adventure on the high seas, including pirates and shipwrecks, marooners, slaves, English soldiers and even a bit of life onboard a slave ship.  Truly this author does keep you enthralled and a willing page-turner. The love story between Claire Randall/Fraser and her eighteenth century husband spans so much eternity it is hard to see past it. Even though the book separates itself so openly from reality, the fantasy is still there, and very much alive. It is not at all difficult, through the literary gifts of this author, to imagine these things actually taking place, and to find yourself immersed in a time of wonder and intrigue and plenty of danger. Our protagonist is a woman of much courage. In real time she is an actual surgeon, chairperson of the board at a prestigious hospital, and somehow Diana Gabaldon can amazingly link that life to our protagonists life in eighteenth century Scotland. Truly a great read, but I gave it four stars because of the intense sex, it just becomes a bit much. Still, Im ready now for Drums of Autumn, the last in the series.	2002-03-10

Dragonfly in Amber is the second book in the series that begins with Outlander. Outlander was mesmerizing, a true insomnia inducing book. This one is good, but not quite so absorbing. It is 20 years since Claire has left Scotland by plunging herself between the rocks that initially transported her to another century. Now she is back in her own time, with a grown daughter, believing that her husband in Scotland, a Scottish Warrior,  has died, leaving her pregnant and with no choice but to keep the promise she made him to return to her &quot;real&quot; husband in &quot;real&quot; time. The past won't leave her, though, and she simply must find out what happened to all those people in the 1700s that she knew and those that she loved. She hires an old family acquaintance to research the events of the last battle her Scottish husband fought in, and the results just might force her to return to Scotland, to finish unfinished business, and to look for a love she thought she would never see again. This book is nearly a thousand pages long, but it is worth sticking with it. Though not as exciting and adventure filled as Outlander, it is a great introduction to the next book in the series, Voyager, which I am starting to read. This series promises to be one that stays with you for a very long time.	2002-02-23

Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian.  Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way!  If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old!  For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"<br />From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray.  The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read.	2002-02-16

A young English woman walks between two rocks and winds up in another century, but the more I read, the more enticed I became, and finally, halfway through the book, it became magical and so enthralling I could not put it down. Claire Randall does indeed walk through two rocks and wind up in another century. She doesn't count on that, certainly, but she surely doesn't count on falling in love and wanting to stay there! Thrust into the 18th century in the middle of the Scottish Highlands, Claire endures trials and tribulations that will have you glued to each page. The love story that develops between Claire and Jamie Fraser is the best I have ever read. Truly, this book takes you away, all the way to Scotland, and you too are transported into another century. A must read! (I have already started the second book in the series &quot;A Dragonfly in Amber&quot;). It promises to be as great as the first, but that is a tough act to follow.	2002-02-09

This story is so potent and powerful it takes your breath away. Otto and Sophie, a married couple living in the 60's lead lives of such deep desperation that a single, seemingly ordinary event manages to bring out all that is truly desperate about their lives. Sophie is bitten by a stray cat, and worries about rabies. That one event takes us through one entire weekend with Otto and Sophie, and that one weekend tells us more about them and their lives than their own autobiographies could. Sophie and Otto are childless, and while Otto suffers the intense pain of the loss of a valued business partner, and Sophie suffers the near certainty that she is rabid, the author takes us into their hearts, around their souls, and through their lives in a journey that you won't soon forget. It is as though there is a deep, grey, chilling fog around the book itself, and each page absorbs you into the fog, until you too, are quite desperate to see what happens in the end.	2002-01-17

Leland Fowler is an attorney trying to raise a small daughter after his wife dies in a tragic car accident. He discovers he has this cold of sorts, sore throat, headachy, flu type symptoms, that he has had virtually since the death of his wife. He tries all kinds of remedies and seems to be forever sucking on throat lozenges and cough drops. After his doctor is unable to help, Leland discovers Clarissa Lake, a homeopath. Though he has never tried such a thing and doesn't have any knowledge of how it works, he visits Clarissa in a last ditch effort to just feel better. At this point the story becomes a love story and a legal thriller, as one of Clarissa Lake's patients dies after allegedly taking her advice. Clarissa and Leland are thrust into a world of sudden mistrust and tragedy. It is a true test of love and patience, honor and values, for Clarissa and Leland, and Chris Bohjalian does an excellent job of providing us with an intense and deeply moving story. Don't miss this one.	2002-01-17
US	52789100	RO6MCYI4FCVZI	0399146431	745329531	The Bonesetter's Daughter	Books	3	9	10	N	N	An interesting look at mothers and daughters.	Though this book is heavily based on the fact that Ruth Young's mother is Chinese in background, and much of the book takes place in Ancient China, where superstition rules and destiny is pre-ordained, the book still manages to take an intimate look at the relationship between mothers and daughters. Ruth Young is a ghostwriter for self-help books, fairly successful, when she comes upon a diary of her mother's written in Chinese. Her mother had given it to her some time ago, and now Ruth, learning her mother has Alzheimers, is filled with guilt for never having read it. Determined to have the journal translated, Ruth Young learns much more than she bargained for, and in the process comes to love and understand her mother more than she ever thought possible. It is a heartwarming story, and the ragged descriptions of LiuLing (Ruth's mother), her sister Gaoling, the horribly scarred Precious Auntie, and Peking Man will transport your mind to the time and place in ancient China when it all happened. Though warm and interesting, I did find the story colorful but somehow flat. It was not the kind of book that I couldn't wait to get to the next page, and I think that was because it needed more emotion. It makes a solid read and will interest you, but just doesn't make a bestseller for me.	2001-12-26

I find most mysteries confusing: Too many characters, too many plots and subplots, just a little too much work for a good read, but this one is okay. There's a murder, (of course), that takes place near a Scottish fishing lodge. Chief Inspector Barrett and Detective-Chief Superintendent of New Scotland Yard, Erskine Powell, are vacationing there and enjoying a premiere salmon-fishing spot when they are thrust into a melting pot of potential killers, shady characters, and suspicious suspects everywhere. The plot thickens and spreads it's arteries ever outward when a fishing buddy of Detective Powell's is also nearly killed in the same manner &amp; circumstances as the late Charles Murray, owner of Castle Glyn Estate, located nearby. What I truly enjoyed the most were the delicately embroidered descriptions of the Highlands, the fishing lodge, and Scotland itself. This author has a good relationship with adjectives. I would read Graham Thomas again, given the fact this was his first book, a good read, and with his writing style, he will be sure to get better and better.	2001-12-19

Peter Kreeft is indeed a very brave man to have tackled such a broad and seemingly unanswerable question: Why do we suffer? And where is God in all of our pain?  Peter Kreeft attempts to sort through the dilemma that is involved in being human, insert God, and then explain some of our misguidedness and confusion. It's a warm book with some very nice Psalms and thoughts to reflect upon even when we aren't suffering. This book is particularly relevant after 9-11. We all need to take a moment and look through this, it's very comforting.	2001-12-19

This book by Richard Andersen is helpful if you are unsure of your basic writing skills, but does little to help you out with being creative or playing with words, which is what I expected when I bought it. Still, it does complete it's purpose and explains some of the quirksome nuances of the English language that we all must conquer to be good writers. If you didn't master English in Junior High real well, you probably could use this book.	2001-12-19

I certainly like the writing style of Lee Child, and even most of the plot, but something about this story falls flat. I haven't read the series, and maybe that is why I found the character of Jack Reacher just too omnipotent and unbelievable. Jack Reacher came across to me as highly unlikable, arrogant, full of himself, and without any depth of human emotion. It's my idea that if you are going to create a character like that, just use a robot, it will make the story more understandable. But the descriptions of Texas were brilliant, they made me thirsty! And the tangled webs weaved were intriguing enough to get me to finish the story. With a little more heart, this story could make a five star tale.	2001-12-19

I bought it because it really sounded like it had promise, but the story just goes on and on and there is too little drama, too little of everything. Stefan Blau is a German immigrant to America at the age of 13. With savings from various waiter jobs and such, he manages to build a hotel (The Wasserburg) and turn it into an elaborate apartment building. He has a vision of a young girl that eventually turns out to be his granddaughter Emma, who will come to love and care for the Wasserburg and preserve it's heritage forever. But it doesn't work because that's all there is. The characters are lively enough and the story is well-written, but it's arid, with little substance. It felt very long to me and I picked it up to read off and on at random only when I was very bored. It started out as a nice idea, but I think Ursula Hegi should have added some excitement or mystery.	2001-12-19

Philip Roth is a decidedly delightful author who knows how to engage the reader without distancing his story.  This story is about a man who feels, from a very young age, that he will go nowhere and be nothing unless he denies his heritage.  Coleman Silk is a Negro, but light skinned enough to pass for white, so he informs his mother and sister and brothers that he is going out into the world as a white man. His mother will never know her grandchildren; his sister and brothers will never know their nieces and nephews. Coleman does at first make a vain attempt to bring home a white girlfriend, and it is a tragic failure. Coleman becomes an esteemed college dean, a brilliant professor of Greek mythology, marries and takes the chances of having children who fortunately for him are born white. When it all begins to go wrong, the irony of Coleman's downfall is a twist you will enjoy and a plot you will not soon forget. Enter Nathan Zuckerman, local author who is befriended by Coleman. From Nathan's viewpoint, we get to know Coleman as no one else does, and Philip Roth has a profound ability to make the reader feel a part of the story.  We first meet Coleman Silk when he is seventy-one years old, and is having an affair with a thirty-four-year-old cleaning woman.  It's an intriguing start, and the book gets better and better. You will find yourself wrapping yourself around the story like a snug quilt, so plan on some great hours of enjoyment from Philip Roth.	2001-12-17

This book will overwhelm you with the unbelievable abuses of power and position practiced by Hillary and Bill Clinton during their last days in office. It is tough to believe that this couple was allowed to get away with all that they did, yet every bit of infomation in Barbara Olson's latest book is verifiable. It is sad that William Clinton and Hillary took the highest and most honorable office in the U.S. and tried to turn it into a circus, but it is sadder still that they attempted to make laughing stocks of the American people. The one thing that Barbara Olson's novel teaches is what we all will never forget: We won't have another Bill Clinton in charge - ever! Sadly, Ms. Olson has passed away, on the hijacked flight that crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, but she has left an outstanding legacy. As an American, it is almost a duty to read not only this book, but her book &quot;Hell to Pay&quot; also.  A fabulous author who tells it like it is. She will be sorely missed.	2001-12-09

He brings us into their lives as children, when life gave them everything and &quot;want&quot; was an unknown word.  Then like separating the straight-edged jigsaw pieces from the inside pieces, we are left helping Richard put the story together, piece by piece. He makes it easy with his insight and perceptions of his three friends, and I loved the way this protagonist becomes real by speaking directly to the reader.  The writing style is pure and forthright, the two couples as real as the pages you hold.

Tlhis is the story of two couples, Sid and Charity Lang, and Sally and Larry Morgan, the former, wealthy and generous, the latter, rich only in love. Together, these couples form an unlikely alliance. Their friendship is woven into a story of incredible strength, and it is a friendship that will withstand much sorrow in the form of illness, mental &amp; physical, and long distances.  Charity Lang becomes our heroine of sorts, though she is but one of four protagonists. Charity is willful, at times unbearably so, yet mostly lovable, as she forces her indomitable will throughout life on all who know her.  Her attempts to mold her husband Sid into correct form and shape is much of the author's way of forming the character of Charity. Suddenly the very worst tragedy of all brings the couples back together after a long separation in a climax of who they all really are, and just how powerful and controlling is Charity's will.  I read with gluttony, unable to get enough of this sterling tale. This author's style is fabulously real and deeply moving. Don't miss this one!	2001-12-01

In a race for time, one man must pit his own computer expertise against the best, and hope with all his heart that he can stop the killing before Phate becomes master of the game. A stunning thriller, a little jargon that may confuse you, but a story with nightmarish possibilities. Enter at your own risk.	2001-11-15

Rebecca Davitch is 53 years old when she begins to wonder if maybe she hasn't made all the wrong choices in life. She has four grown daughters, is a widow, and has a small party-giving business that she isn't really sure she even likes all the time. Rebecca isn't even sure she likes the woman she has become, and sets out to find and perhaps reincarnate a long dead past. This is an interesting look into Rebecca's mind and spirit, into one woman's soul searching and becoming. I liked Rebecca, I could relate to her thoughts and her uneasiness about her life, but I found that the story didn't adequately answer all her questions, and didn't adequately solve her quest for meaning in life. Rebecca comes full circle, and the descriptions of her journey around this circle are full of meaning and depth, yet I was left with a mind full of questions, which can sometimes be what makes a book great, but which in this case made me wonder what the point of the story was. I adored Poppy, the withering but challenging old man Rebecca lives with and takes care of, and had he been the focus of the story, I think this would have been a much better read. Poppy is going to be a hundred years old, and if anyone ever had reason to reach back into their past and scrutinize it, he surely does. But Poppy is a picture of good humor and a strong constitution, and I fell in love with him as he toddles through life reciting a favorite poem, being occasionally forgetful, and just being adorable.  Rebecca finds Will, an old flame, and attempts to rekindle a past that was never clearly defined. Will has a seventeen-year-old daughter named Beatrice, who is an absolutely unnecessary character, as though Anne Tyler forgot to sprinkle salt on this story and threw Beatrice in at the last minute. Beatrice has zero connection in the scheme of things that I could decipher, and her minute appearance disrupts the flavor of the story to some degree. I wish Anne Tyler had thrown in some dilemma with meaning, orconflict with strong emotional depth, but in the end this story falls kind of flat.	2001-11-15

If you like stories dripping with tears, you will probably enjoy this story. The story is about a young woman who meets the love of her life, they marry, have a child, and tragedy is always just around the corner. There doesn't seem to be much uplifting about their lives, except perhaps that the memories they make are very  nice. This is a fine escape from reality for awhile, and an overall good read, but the story lacks depth, is too predictable, and is gift wrapped at the end, leaving the reader feeling as though it can be put aside and never thought of again. I prefer stories that leave memories with the reader themselves. Still, as Danielle-Steele-ish as it is, you may find that it is poignant in parts, and touches your heart in others.	2001-11-15

Doug Marshall has an overwhelming obsession to find the truth about what happened to an Arctic expedition in 1845. The story jumps back and forth between what actually happened on the expedition, and what is happening in real time. But undertones abound, and with Doug Marshall's obsession comes a sadness so deep I felt it in every page. Doug has a son, whose life is all but ruined because of his father's obsession, and it is his son whom the story eventually focuses on. In bizarre and unexpected twists, Jo Harper and Doug Marshall's son become linked in spirit and in time, and the story becomes a race against life and death as one son's life becomes dependent on another son's recovery from a broken heart.	2001-11-15

This is a slow moving story about a young boy growing up under the shadow of an outlaw brother, a runaway mother, and a horrible asthmatic condition.  There is a bit of action here when  eleven year old Reuben Land's brother kills two boys who have hurt his girlfriend and threatened his family. Davy is the older brother, wanted for murder, who busts out of jail to become an elusive figure throughout the story. Ned Land, father of Davy, Reuben, and a little girl named Swede, is a tragic figure throughout. He has no wife, but does his best to raise three young children. When the murder happens, all of their lives take a turn in a direction they could have never predicted. Torn between what is right and protecting Davy, the family sets out to find Davy, traveling through the Badlands, followed and watched by a sneaky federal agent named Mr. Andreeson, and state troopers everywhere. The story is told by eleven year old Reuben, who tries very hard to convince the reader that his father has God-like powers. The story centers around this theme, and it is hard to take anything seriously with this thought behind everything. Still, it is a nice story, a story of small miracles and acts of faith, of a family tormented by loss and tragedy. Leif Enger did a nice job of pulling all of the characters together, of somehow making this unlikely story work. It is no blockbuster, but it is a good read.	2001-11-15

Thomas Moore enters into the realm of spirit in this book, and he takes the reader with him on this wonderful journey through the human soul.  I never quite thought of the soul in the way it is presented here, but having reflected on Thomas Moore's path to enlightenment via the soul, I have to admit I found much to think about in this book.  In an extraordinarily imaginative way, we learn the myriad aspects of how to care for our souls.  This book teaches, entertains, and provides us with a plan of action to begin working on recognizing the soul's need for attention. Parts of the book were a bit dry, but overall this is a deeply spiritual and emotionally penetrating book.	2001-11-15

You never suspect, from the very beginning, how profoundly this story reaches into your heart. At first I thought it was rather silly, a woman gets evicted from her home over a silly tax billing error. Big deal. But it turns out to be so very much more. From that small plot point winds a tale so rich with message and so poignant that you will not soon forget it. The Behrani family, seemingly so simple and naieve, become real life characters that jump off the page and into your lap.  Our protagonist, a lady called Kathy, is evicted from the home her father passed on to her due to a simple tax billing error. She meets up with a police officer, who falls madly in love with her even as he is attempting to face trauma in his own life. In the meantime, an Iranian family moves into (and purchases) the bungalow, and from that point on the story dives deeper and deeper into the very dark and scary places of human nature. What starts out sounding like a yellow brick road type of novel, becomes a lesson in the frailties and hardships of life.  I'll never forget this story. Ever.	2001-10-28

What makes this different from &quot;Bridges Over Madison County&quot; or any number of other moving tales of love is that this one is told from the perspective of a dying woman, looking back over her very recent past.  Through her pain and her drugs, she is somehow able to remember vividly some very heart warming facts about the one and only time she ever loved, and was loved in return.  This is an easy read, and will leave you feeling strangely fulfilled and warm. This review refers to the hardcover edition of this story.	2001-10-17

I had never read this author before and the cover synopsis did not do it justice. I found myself almost immediately wrapped into the story. A young girl, raised in a brothel, goes away to school, determined to escape once and for all her scandalous past, create a new identity and lose &quot;the darkness&quot; that seems to live within her family tree.  All of the Pierron woman have been hookers, sinners, evil, and Hope Pierron is determined to break the cycle. Hope tosses away her past like a bad dream, and eventually gives birth to her own daughter. More than ever she is determined that the legacy of darkness will not inhabit her daughter, and what follows is a story of terror and suspense, well-written and enjoyable at the same time. The interwoven love story is moving, the plot enticing, and the the whole book a fabulous read.	2001-10-15

I have been researching the field of sleep for some time, and this is truly the best book yet that I have found on this elusive subject. William Dement and co-author Christopher Vaughan have outdone themselves in not only offering an authoritative and informational guide, but a truly interesting and fascinating account of their many years in this field. The average reader will not be bogged down with formulas and EEG readings, but with common sense and down to earth advice on managing your sleep.  William Dement focuses a great deal on the problem of a sleep deprived society, and teaches you a simple, easy to manage way to determine if you are one of the billions who owe a large &quot;sleep-debt&quot;, and if you are, how to miraculously (well, almost) &quot;work it off&quot; and become a healthier, happier individual. It was truly amazing to me what a difference the right amount and quality of sleep can make in a person's life, and how relatively simple it is to obtain it. If you feel you have a sleep problem, this is most definitely the book for you. It has wonderful insights into the amazing world of sleep and offers the most solid and focused guidelines to improve your sleep habits that I have ever come across. A definite 5 star winner, a not-to-be-missed book!	2001-09-01

Emily Graham, a criminal defense attorney turned multi-millionaire through a wise investment decision, feels compelled to purchase her ancestral home, a rambling but renovated old Victorian in the balmy town of Spring Lake, New Jersey. Emily has just survived a painful and ugly divorce, and the unwanted and frightening advances of a stalker, so the old home may be just what she needs to restore her sense of peace. It was not meant to be. Soon after Emily moves into her quiet place of refuge, and while the swimming pool foundation is yet being dug in the backyard, a human skeleton is unearthed. From trustworthy old souls to small town gossip mongers, each character is welcomed into the story that follows with backgrounds and skeletons of their own you won't soon forget.

It was tough trying to figure out what this story was really all about. Brendan Buchanan has so many different aliases it was difficult to decide who he was at any one time in the story. Ed Asner does the reading, and I wasn't thrilled with his voice, it sounded very throaty and clogged. Our protagonist's aliases are discovered at a cafe in Cancun Mexico, and at that point he remains in mortal danger for the rest of the story, never sure who to trust, even the members of the operations unit he works for. Despite lots of action and plot twists, what I think the story really was about goes deeper: Brendan Buchanan must unmask his own layers upon layers of aliases to discover who he really is, and in doing so, he falls in love, and must admit to himself he is, after all, just one person.	2001-08-25

A killer is on the loose, one who stalks and kills newlyweds on their honeymoons, a horrible stealer of innocence and hope. Lindsay Boxer, homicide detective, has her hands full at first trying to figure out the puzzle pieces left behind at the crime scenes. Then, all at once, the story falls into place, the identity of the murderer so cut and dried in the first part of the book you wonder why James Patterson bothered to write the rest of the book. All is not as it seems as James Patterson takes you into the seamy underside of a writer's mind, the sick, twisted avenues of a psychopathic sex fiend, and a story that will keep you guessing until the very end. Lindsay forms a &quot;Murder Club&quot; of sorts, just herself and three very talented girlfriends. Together they sift through evidence and sort through clues until what is left of the crimes is a map that leads them places they never wanted to go.

Nothing sets him off more than a litterbug, or someone trying to destroy flora to make room for condominiums. Twilly gets so angry when he sees these things, he will stop at nothing to teach the perpetrator a lesson.  This includes dismembering an already dead animal to make a point, kidnapping a live one, firebombing a bank, and even kidnapping the wife of a litterbug. The story was fairly well written, although as I read farther along, it became less and less real to me, and more of a cartoonish like tale.  The premise to the story is in itself a bit bizarre, but Carl Hiaasen takes the time to make it work, if only for a little while. The character of Palmer Stoat is very well developed, he is our resident litterbug, infamous for shooting \\"wild\\" animals for sport and tossing Big Mac papers out his car window. There is plenty of gruesome parts and not a little death, so the book keeps you interested until it becomes too prolific.	2001-08-22

His wife is asking for a divorce. They meet at the Gotham Cafe with his wife's lawyer for lunch to discuss terms. What follows is far worse than any craving for a cigarette or losing a wife can feel like. And a story you will not soon forget. In the second story, &quot;1408&quot;, Mike Enslin is a writer whose books are about all the nights he has spent in supposedly &quot;haunted&quot; houses, castles, graveyards. Now he is to spend the night in room 1408 of the Dolphin hotel. He doesn't believe anything different will happen to him here than what happened to him in all those other &quot;haunted&quot; places, namely, nothing. But &quot;nothing&quot; is far from what happens one dark night in room 1408 and Mike Enslin will not come out the same man who went into that room. In the third story &quot;In the Deathroom&quot;, Stephen King's talent for storytelling will have you believing that yes, you can feel the cold gray tile on the floor in this room, you can hear the steady hum of the torture machine, and you can smell the all pervasive odor of death that awaits a man named Fletcher, held captive here and being forced to tell all. In all three tales, told in Stephen King's own voice, the main character begins as one person, and ends up as quite another. All three men are changed profoundly, and all three men can link this change to smoking, or the cessation of. A brilliant trio of Stephen Kingness, you will at once find yourself grossed out at the Gotham Cafe, frightened to death in room 1408, and scared but hopeful in &quot;the Deathroom&quot;.	2001-08-19

Our hero is a lawyer, Joe Watson, content to drift in cyberspace doing legal research forever, when suddenly he is appointed a pro bono case. Joe Watson, married, two kids, nice home, must suddenly take on a case of such racial and moral indignities that it threatens to turn his whole life around. In trying to defend the accused, James Whitlow, it looks as though he is up against a losing battle from the start. James Whitlow is accused of murdering a black, deaf man whom he caught in bed with his wife. James Whitlow has a most unfortunate past, that of being a known bigot and a youth laced with criminality. He even has a tatto sporting his feelings about black people. Clearly, our hero will have a very tough time convincing a jury this is not a hate crime. While attempting to do so, we are introduced to some of the most colorful literary characters I have ever come across. Judge Stang is fierce, he is funny, in fact, he is hysterical, and he is a character you will not soon forget. Joe Watson's newest partner, Myrna Schwiech is also full of life and memorable. The writing is superb, the only aspect of the book that faded the story for me was the intense details of computerese and neuroscience. Had it not been for these diversions, I would have given it five stars, but there is just enough of this type of language to make several chapters quite boring.	2001-08-16

Read and written by the author, this audio version of a love story so passionate, so powerful, so potent, is a great mind escape for a few hours. I found myself lost in the soft lull of Robert James Waller's voice as he took me to Madison County, Iowa, and showed me the covered bridges, the fields and meadows, the sunrises and sunsets, and the truest love in the history of time. Francesca is an Iowa farm wife, who meets Robert Kincaid, writer, photographer, from Bellingham, Washington one hot, dusty day when he stops at her farm for directions. What follows is a love story so profound and so moving, you will wish you had experienced it yourself. It IS a bit sappy, and I wished for a lighter tone on occasion, to take away the inherent sadness that permeated the story turned fairy-tale turned story again. Francesca and Robert must make a painful choice, one of great sorrow and heartache that they will have to live with and abide by the rest of their days. The story was told to the author by Francesca's two children after Francesca's death. After reading her journals, looking at pieces of her life Francesca kept in a manila envelope and finally realizing the depth of what their mother had to say, Michael and Carolyn decide that this is a story that very much needs to be told. It is the Romeo and Juliet of the 20th century, two star-crossed lovers torn by family and love, separated by miles of responsibility and heart ache, words waiting to be heard. Francesca and Robert come to represent that part of us that lives for what we know we want, what we know we must have, and what a very few of us ever really find.	2001-08-15

When Sally Gray discovers a startling family secret that could topple the Gray Foods family empire, she does some unusual things, and doesn't quite act in the way you would expect a loving mother to act. Still, Blair Brown does a good job reading the story, it just is paced very slowly, and Blair Brown's soft voice gives it a quietness it doesn't need to have. The child, Tina, is a strong and willful character, but underdeveloped and abstract. Then, suddenly and without warning, the story is gift wrapped and tied with a bow, and you are left with a lot of unanswered questions. A good story for a lazy summer afternoon by the pool, but no blockbuster.	2001-08-14

This book is extremely well written, very easy to read, and full of advice that is sensible and doable. Sidney Simon does a great job of approaching that difficult subject, change. He offers examples, and solid alternatives and options, that all of us can use. I found it easy to read, the author was open and expressive and very real. In much of the book, it felt as though he was speaking right to you personally. The examples he provides are user friendly, and you can relate well to each. His in-depth probing of change and all of it's psychological barriers is astounding. The only parts I could have done without were the detailed step by step portions, but maybe that is because of one of my own psychological barriers to change! Much of what he had to say was so true in my own life, that I felt he wrote some of this book with me in mind. Regardless of whether you are contemplating a major life change, or simple changes to help you live better, or none at all, you will find this book useful and absorbing. I recommend you buy it and keep it on hand if you don't intend to follow it's advice right away, for all of us can use what is in this book at one time or another in our lives.	2001-08-14

This is a story about three friends aboard the Nautilus, a cantankerous submarine-like vessel that is commandeered by Captain Nemo, an elusive figure with a mind of steel and a impenetrable purpose in life. Captain Nemo has long ago turned his back on the world, building this vessel with the intent of making it his home, staffing it with the most loyal of crews, and arming it as though it were a fortress. And a fortress it is. Captain Nemo and his crew live beneath the sea in this fascinating underwater vehicle as solid as stone. They never touch land, and are prepared to spend the rest of their days living underwater. The world has learned of this vessel, but rumors of its nature abound. Most think it is a sea monster of sorts, and the great ship the Abraham Lincoln sets out on a voyage to find and destroy the Nautilus. On board are Professor Aronnax, underwater expert, his loyal subject Conseil, and a Canadian whale harpooner named Ned Land. These unfortunate characters are tossed into the sea while heavily engaged in a confrontation with the mighty Nautilus. Hours later, they are picked up by the Nautilus, having been clinging to it's topside for safety. They are held prisoner within, but never have prisoners of war had such luxury and freedom. What follows is Monsieur Aronnax' account of the adventures that abound as he travels around the world underwater, seeing sights never before seen, engaging in activities he once only dreamed of, and enjoying times never meant to be had by man. When his companion, Ned Land, becomes restless and wishes to escape the Nautilus, the story heats up. Throughout, Captain Nemo is a mystery you will wish revealed. The story has many dull parts too, and many unfamiliar words and expressions that may bore you. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating and marvelous classic - if you have not yet read this, you should.	2001-08-09

His brother Drew must find out the fate of Harry, who disappears mysteriously. The story encompasses the inner workings of Intelligence Operations from London to Paris to Washington to Berlin, and the Nazis are everywhere, waiting to execute their latest plan, a plan so vile and so destructive it will kill off political power figures in all the major cities in the world. The story is crammed with violent acts of murder, so many that I lost count, and the spies are in every crack and crevice. But who is spying for whom, and who can be trusted? Were it not for the many changes in venue and the overdone introductions of new characters every ten minutes, I might have been able to answer that question. As it worked out, I understood the story, and thought the plot was great, but had such a hard time keeping track of all the characters and events that I think I lost a lot of the effect.  There were four audio cassettes, with a running time of 6 hours, which was great, a good value for your money. There were plot twists that were brilliant and will surprise and delight you, but the best part about this story was Edward Herrmann's voice.  Don't look for the mini series soon.	2001-08-09

Jack Flynn is a newshound for the Boston Record who suddenly gets a call from the President of the United States, wanting him to play golf.  While at the Congressional Country Club playing golf with Clayton Hutchins, President, there is an assassination attempt that takes this story from dull to frightening to exciting in about 3 pages. With the country poised for a new election, the assassination attempt can only help President Hutchins gain national media coverage and encourage the sympathy vote.  While attempting to gather information on a certain presidential pardon, Jack Flynn is thrust into areas he never thought he would be involved in, and the name of the game is that nothing is as it seems to be, no one is who they say they are, and no situation is what it looks like. Well written, beautifully styled and executed with flair, author Brian McGrory pulls off a fine story of national intrigue, mingled with danger and plenty of action. In building the character of Jack Flynn, Brian Mcgrory takes us into what makes the man who he is. Few authors do this, and it was refreshing. The plot is smart, and takes the reader along with it for a bumpy ride through the channels of Washington, and throughout a national newsroom. You will not be disappointed.	2001-08-07

For Caroline and Ruby, sisters sharing Nora's painful legacy, they must face a childhood ruined, friendships destroyed, and a life spent trying to forget the pain their mother inflicted on them. A fabulous young man named Eric nearly steals this story, for it is through him and his brother that the story comes alive. You will enjoy this book, and it is perfect summer reading.	2001-08-06

This is the first (and last) book of the &quot;Alphabet Mysteries&quot; that I will venture to read. This is a jargon of characters, most of them highly unlikely at best, an even larger jargon of plots, and a convoluted mess of a story. I didn't like the style, the plot, the setting, or the story itself. In the beginning we are led to believe that finding a missing doctor is the plot here, and our heroine sleuth, Kinsey Milhone, is a private investigator hired by the doctor's long suffering ex-wife to do just that. Somehow there enters another story, of jewel thieves and murderers, that is not connected at all to the doctor's disappearance. I couldn't be sure at any one time which story I was reading. Our heroine comes across as a person with a screw or two loose, and she is just plain not real in any sense of the word. The ex-wife is underdeveloped as an eccentric older lady with a lot of bills, but that is all we ever really learn about this very vital character. The new wife, Crystal, is also vague, I never did get her place in the story correct until I was nearing the end, and when you add a totally unnecessary ex-husband to the new wife, a teenage daughter that isn't his natural daughter, yet he shares joint custody, the teenage daughter's friend who has absolutely no bearing at all, other than to validate the teenage daughter's character maybe..well, it just becomes a huge mess. Then the author throws in another story on top of that! It seemed as though Sue Grafton had some wonderful ideas for characters and plots and themes, would write them down, then forget about them and add new ones here and there. Definitely NOT an all-nighter on this one, folks, perhaps Sue Grafton should start again with the letter A and work her way forward.	2001-08-03

The most disappointing thing about this little story, which I listened to on CD, is it's length. Much too short! Stephen King wins my approval for his excellent voice as well as his familiar talent of story-telling, but this CD was only about an hour long!! The story was good, not one of his best, but good, and I enjoyed it. The ending was severely abrupt, but many of Stephen King's stories end this way on purpose, and I suspect this was one of them. It makes you think, which is what, after all, the Master of Macabre is all about. LT is a man whose wife has left him. They had two pets, one that LT bought for Lulu, his wife, and one Lulu bought for him. It starts out amusing and light and winds it's way into an unsolved mystery. It is clever and intriguing. Stephen King is definitely someone I would love to have read me a bedtime story, and this is just what he does with this audio CD. He reads like he writes, a pro. I recommend this for a short car drive or airplane ride, but the trip really has to be short. For content, it is aces as usual for the King.  For style and voice, fabulous. For length, your money is much better spent on longer stories by Stephen King. You will enjoy the very beginning, which is Stephen King's own voice and way of introducing his story, but I don't think you will care too much for the ending.	2001-08-02

Elizabeth Berg deserves a standing ovation for this one. This story is so real, so absolutely right on, that I was just absorbed into it from page one. Samantha is a woman in her forties, faced with an unexpected and unwanted divorce. The story evolves around everything Samantha must go through, emotionally and physically, as she attempts to face life without a smidgeon of security left in it. She must deal with Travis, her young son, and she must deal with such tremendous inner turmoil that the reality of it jumps off the page right into your lap. She has one good friend, Rita, who is quite a character herself, painfully honest but lovable, and her mother, referred to as &quot;Veronica&quot; who is just one crazy but endearing person. David is (or was) her husband, who basically decides the marriage is not working. Just like that. And Samantha is left to pick up all of the pieces. I found the skillful wording so poignant and the flow of the whole story so smooth. I could envision myself doing and saying and acting much like Samantha, and in the end, it is a story of one woman's search for who she really is, not David's wife, not Travis' mom, but who Samantha really is. You will hurt with her and for her, and you will not want to put the book down. At the end of the book is an interview with the author, which is such a great way to get to know her, and after that are a few Reader's discussion questions, which I have never seen at the end of a book before. I thought that was wonderfully clever, and I really look forward to reading more of Elizabeth Berg.	2001-07-30

From the cover to the end, it is full of emotion, joy and sadness, hope and disappointment, delight and misery. I never knew an author that could walk through these ranges so perfectly. Icy Sparks is a young girl that must grow up with a strange affliction, Tourettes Syndrome. In grammar school, she suffers bouts of arm and leg jerks, her eyeballs pop out wide, and sometimes she croaks in loud throaty noises. At times she will let loose with the wildest string of cusses. You can imagine what the other children think of her. She lives with her grandparents, who love her dearly, but they too have to admit she needs some help. Tourettes Syndrome is unnamed at that time, so Icy is shipped off to a rehabilitation center, where we are taken from her despair, through her anger and hurt and pain, and finally back to hope again. Though not yet diagnosed and no where near a cure, she returns to live with her grandparents, and her unpredictable &quot;fits&quot; continue. Throughout the story, Icy talks and thinks and acts like the spunky, lovable little girl she is. I grew to love her by the end of the first chapter. Her dear friend Miss Emily is one person you will wish you'd had in your life when you were a child. Icy's grandparents adore her, Icy's mother died shortly after her birth and her Father died also. Icy's coming of age is particularly poignant given her condition. You will feel for her as I did, and you will grow with her as I did. Icy Sparks may have Tourettes Syndrome, but it came with a courage I wish I had! The author keeps the characters down to a few loved ones, and in so doing, makes the story that much closer to your heart. There is Matanni, Icy's wise grandma, and Patanni, her grandpa, a man of few words but a very golden heart, Miss Emily, whose size speaks for the amount of love she is capable of giving. Mr. Wooten, the principal at Ivy's school in not a developed character, but I was fond of him nevertheless. The rest I will let you find for yourself, but this time, Oprah picked it right!	2001-07-28

A certain type of pollution is destroying lives, hundreds of them at a time, and it is left to the National Underwater Marine Agencys own Dirk Pitt, hero of our story, to figure out, and to try to stop, the horror that will soon become so widespread it will take on a life of its own. But first, Dirk must battle the formidable Arthur Dorsett, owner of Dorsett Mining Company, Ltd., one of the worlds foremost leaders in the world diamond market. Arthur is more than wealthy, he is inscrutable, a hardened block of unfeeling ice, and as resistant and impervious to penetration as can be. Undaunted, Dirk begins to learn more than he wants about the Dorsett family and their evil empire, until the horrible truth begins to unfold, that a link between Arthur Dorsett and the murderous pollution is a certainty. Dirk is not alone. Unfortunately, the one person he chooses to trust is one of Arthur Dorsetts daughters, Maeve.  Maeve Dorsett is the mother of twin six year old boys, boys that, with any luck, she can rescue from her fathers clutches and save the lives of hundreds of innocent people at the same time before its too late. Maeve, it turns out, is not cut from the same cloth as her sisters, Boodicka and Deirdre, who are, for all intents and purposes as evil and icy as their father.  What follows is a tale of adventure on the high seas, a familiar Clive Cussler setting. Maeve and Dirk and one companion must pit themselves against an unseen but slowly advancing death plague, and try to rescue Maeves boys while destroying Arthur Dorsett and his empire. With a little help from  NUMA, it might be done, but the odds dont look good, and in fact, the outcome is quite a surprise. If you want adventure, mystery, a bit of romance and a few hours of lively entertainment, this audio cassette set is for you. Four cassettes are read by James Naughton, whose voice is incredible, his inflections and tones making you forget you are listening to different characters allin the same voice. He is wonderful, he sets the mood for the story and has a gift for drawing you into it. I put on the headphones and enjoyed hours of drifting out to sea with Dirk and Maeve and NUMA on an undersea adventure helped along immensely by the voice of James Naughton. I highly recommend this trip!	2001-07-27

After reading Southern Cross recently, I was hesitant to waste any time or money on this one, but I sure am glad that I did. The Last Precinct ties up a lot of loose ends in the Kay Scarpetta saga, and this one makes Kay more human. I liked her so much better in this book, because the hunter becomes the prey, and she has feelings that Patricia Cornwell describes beautifully.  I absolutely loved detective Marino in this story. As a ten year friend/coworker/homicide detective with Kay Scarpetta, in this novel his frailties are exposed, his life explored, and he becomes the man you hate to love but have to.  Lucy, Kay Scarpetta's niece is also well defined in this story, and having \\"accidentally\\" shot her partner and nearly killing Kay Scarpetta's intruder, her judgement is questioned and she may be forced to leave her lifelong career. This spurs her to come up with an idea, an idea called \\"The Last Precinct\\", sort of her own law enforcement agency, where when all else fails, unsolvable crimes land in The Last Precinct. More than capable Lucy, her friend Teun, and maybe even Kay will try to enravel what the world's best law enforcement people could not. It is an interesting idea, and Patricia Cornwell weaves the story around it. Kay's ex-lover, horribly murdered, is a post mortem member of this last precinct already.  The descriptions of Kay at her best, in the morgue, are unbelievably graphic. The weak of heart will definitely squirm throughout this book, but the descriptions are what attaches the reader firmly to the story.  This is, without a doubt, one of Patricia Cornwell's absolute best ever.  You will turn page after page with increasing intensity, missing the story when you are unable to be reading, and contemplating it's dilemmas all day. Don't miss it!	2001-07-26

Though his writing style is still very much Koontz, the plot is bizarre, and not in a good way.  The story centers around Christopher Snow, a man who is living on borrowed time because he has a rare disease called xeroderma pigmentosum.  He is one in 1000 people in the world with this disease, which causes extreme sensitivity to light, any kind of light, and so the darkness is his world. Any contact with light puts him at great risk of all kinds of malignancies. His friend Lilly's son has been abducted, and Chris sets out to pursue the kidnapper. With a few chosen friends that are every bit as odd as Chris is, they begin to unravel a mystery that happened in their little town of Moonlight Bay, a mystery so profound that it can change the course of life as we know it. Chris's dead mother had been involved in genetic experimenting, and one of the retroviruses she isolated escaped. The results are frightening, and if Mr. Koontz had not gotten highly technical, I would not have been able to put the book down. I loved his descriptions of Wyvern, or &quot;Dead Town&quot; as Chris refers to it. It is the birthplace of the retrovirus, and the center of the story's evil.  Not all that came out of Dead Town is horrible. Chris' dog, Orson, was given to him by his mother, an experiment in intelligence, and indeed Orson is a highly intelligent Labrador mix that will have you rooting him on. A cat name Mungojerrie also helps decipher, and plays a leading role in the story's ending. Mungojerrie is also equipped with more than usual intelligence.  I enjoyed the way Chris and his friends talked in short monosyllables to each other, with their favorite lingo, it added closeness to the characters. I found myself losing interest only at the times Mr. Koontz tried to elaborate on the technical aspects of what was happening in Dead Town. The story left me with an eerie feeling, but not creepy enough to read it again.	2001-07-22

His humor is wonderful as he weaves it into this gripping thriller about a man accused of a double murder. The fact that the man was once his partner in a prestigious law firm adds spice to the story. Attorney Mike Daley is our hero in this story, and it is up to Mr. Daley to exonerate his old friend Joel Friedman, accused of the murder of an attorney and a woman working for the S &amp; G firm of attorneys. Mr. Daley starts off strongly believing in the innocence of his client, but as the facts unfold, he questions their friendship, their loyalty to each other, and the very core of his case. He is an exemplary lawyer in court, faced with a case that will have you turning page after page. Mr. Daley's &quot;affair&quot; with his ex-wife falls flat, but other than that, the book is a winner. I think Sheldon Siegel has broken into this genre with a smash hit, and I look forward to his next novel, which he offers a preview of in this book, &quot;Incriminating Evidence&quot;.	2001-07-17

I enjoyed this book because the authors spoke frankly and openly about the various aspects of women's sleep. I'm not sure the book lives up to it's title phrase of &quot;guaranteed solutions for a good night's rest&quot; but it is very helpful and does offer some solutions I had never tried. It was also interesting to note how many factors can affect a woman's sleep as opposed to a man's. The authors offer sleep solutions in all categories, including certain foods you can eat to help you sleep, supplements you can take and lifestyle changes that aren't too tough to do. There are helpful little lists along the way, like &quot;The top ten sleep busters&quot; and &quot;Stop the Snoring&quot;. The authors delve into the structure of sleep, explaining in layman's terms the various sleep stages and cycles, and how they can be affected by stimuli. One aspect of the book I did not like were the gray boxed areas that interrupted the reading. These areas, sometimes a few pages long, were very good reading, but they interrupted the flow of the book and often got you going on another sleep topic so that when you picked up where you left off, you forgot what you had been reading when you stopped. I also thought there was an awful lot of repetition, as though the authors were attempting to fill pages. At the very end of the book is a comprehensive listing of all sorts of sleep centers, sleep specialists, websites, and books for the sleep impaired. I thought this addition was great. If you are looking for some great suggestions and some new things to try, or just interested in this topic, this is a good book for you.	2001-07-13

The amount of data amassed on sleep in this one volume amazed me. There are such interesting things to learn on this fascinating subject! You can find out what goes on in the mind during the various stages of sleep, each chapter vividly describing the contents and results of some extraordinary research. Sleep disorders are discussed, narcolepsy, insomnia, sleep talking, sleep walking, and some you will not know existed. The history of methods of obtaining sleep data is also explored, and the value of dreams and REM sleep is researched thoroughly. Of particular value is the section on the effects of external stimuli applied prior to and during sleep on the sleep experience. The various accounts of animal research are disturbing for the animal lover, but have resulted in some amazing discoveries that will enthrall the sleep subject enthusiast. The effects of REM deprivation on various aspects of personality is a very deep topic, and interesting. What I did not like about this particular book was it's continual references to the various experimenter's names. Sentences and paragraphs are constantly interrupted with parentheses giving the researcher's names, I think all this could have been mentioned once at the beginning of each chapter and then expounded upon in the appendix. Also, unless you are a serious sleep student, much of the research methods towards the end of the book will boggle you, but since this book seems to have targeted the serious student, it is probably quite necessary material. Had the subject been targeted for the lay reader and the methods explained in simpler terms, I think this book would reach the best seller list in no time. The chapters are all separately authored, which breaks each category of research into nice little packages and exposes all sides of all viewpoints. All in all, a truly informative and comprehensive book, you will learn more than you ever thought you could on this subject! (And the book will NOT put you to sleep!)	2001-07-10

By the age of eight, Luke has witnessed two murders and the birth of a baby. His family lives on a cotton farm, and this year the crop is not going to make it. The graphic descriptions of the intense labor young Luke endures while picking cotton with the hired Mexicans and hill people, peppered with humor and good story telling, is enough in itself to keep the reader enthralled. But John Grisham takes the story further, telling us about Pappy and Gran, who live on the farm with Luke and his parents and who become loving, warm characters that will live in your heart long after you have read this book. It is a story of intense love, of willful and comical disobedience, of unshared and shared secrets, and it is a story that will invite you in and give you a cup of coffee.  Luke's house has never been painted, and an evil comment by one of the hill  people about the unpainted house leaves Luke with a bitter taste in his mouth. When the only hill person to be liked in this story, a handicapped boy named Trot, takes it upon himself to paint the house, it falls to young Luke to finish the job. The storytelling begins, encircles, and ends with the painting of this much loved home, but John Grisham paints more than the house. He paints the Mexicans, the hill people who come for the summer months to help pick cotton, the poverty-stricken neighbors, and even the Uncle who is at war in Korea that never actually enters the story.  There will be no doubt in your mind that John Grisham is capable of writing in any genre, and you will enjoy and remember this story for years to come.	2001-07-10

It is A.D. 738: The story opens with the death of the Crown Prince Ying, at the court of T'ang Minghuang, Imperial Emperor of China. So despaired of his son's death, the Emperor falls into a ghastly depression, ignoring matters of state and country, refusing to leave his bed but for the briefest of moments. His lifetime friend, mentor, and slave eunuch, Kao Li- Shih, becomes, at least for me, the hero of our story. He is a character with much sense and sensibility, with a heart that loves the emperor, and a loyalty unsurpassed. It is the age of eunuchs and slaves, of festivals of light, of royalty unbound. The descriptions of the palace itself are breathtaking, and the authors take the surrounding lands and recreate a mystical world that will live in your mind forever, whenever you think of China. Failing to roust the emperor from his depression, Kao Li-Shih watches helplessly as another man takes over, the dreaded Li Lin fu, feared by all, renowned for his complete absence of compassion. Li Lin Fu strikes fear into the hearts of the bravest men, and rules all of China and it's subjects with an iron hand. The man has an uncanny ability to predict the actions of his enemies long before they themselves do, and an even stranger ability to see into the faults of others. Kao Li-Shih realizes this calls for drastic measures. China will fall to evil lest he do something to rouse the great emperor. Having recently lost the empress at his own unwilling command, the Emperor suffers from a sadness and mourning so deep, Kao Li-Shih must act quickly. He does. Remembering a lady the Emperor once took a fancy too, Kao Li-Shih calls upon the powers of love to help the Emperor. He finds the woman, and what follows is a fantasy of delights, both real and imagined, an epic tale of fortune won and fortune lost, of lives interwoven forever in an unending story of magic. You will meet An Lu Shan, a barbarian from the north who manages to worm his way into the Emperor's heart, and the Yang sisters, who are as much rulers of China as the Emperor himself. This story is all story, you will be riveted to each page, and you will never think of China in the same way again.	2001-06-23

It was well written, the characters are lively, the plot is suspenseful, and it is an easy read. There is a nice twist at the end that will keep you wondering until the very last page. I think this author has some real talent. The story takes place mostly in the teenage world, where lovesick teenagers abound. One in particular has taken her crush on a teacher to a new depth, and another is actually having an affair with a scandalous character that is a teacher as well. When 15 year old Natalie Ouspensky winds up dead, the story unfolds like layers of an onion, peeling away one new twist after another. Natalie's best friend Kim knows something about Natalie that she wants to tell the police, but she has sworn to her friend (now dead) that she won't breathe a word. Without this information, the wrong person may be charged with the murder, and lives ruined as a result. The person I suspected all along turned out to be not the culprit, but every bit as conniving and evil. I think you will enjoy this book.	2001-06-11

I could not believe this was the same author who wrote all those wonderful Kay Scarpetta books. This book is terrible. Let me backtrack: In the very beginning, we are introduced to several characters such as Popeye, our main character's dog, who is presented as though she can think like a human. Some of the story lines come from the dog's mouth;  \\" Popeye licked her owner's face and felt pity. Popeye knew her owner was denying the grief and the guilt she felt about her late husband's death.\\" (How in the world could a dog, even stretching your imagination, know THAT?) Later, we meet Niles the cat, who has the same uncanny ability as Popeye the dog. There are other characters: Bubba (real name: But Fluck, wife's name is Honey), Smudge, Gig Dan, Smoke, Weed Gardener, Divinity, Wally Fling, Captain Cloud, Mr. Curry, Mr. Pretty, Mrs. Fan, ad nauseum.  We are expected to accept these characters as real people. Each time I came across a new name, I took the book less and less seriously. We then meet the chairman of the Governor's Blue Ribbon Crime Commission (whose name is okay but suspiciously similar to Amelia Earhart), Lelia Ehrhart, who talks like this:  \\" You're hanging out by a thread on a limb all alone on this one!\\". The only explanation we get is that Ms. Ehrhart was raised in Vienna and Yugoslavia and does not speak English well. I re-read several paragraphs, thinking my eyes had finally bought the farm, when I realized this was intentional.  The plot? You won't be sure what it is until well past half of the book, but it goes something like this: Police chief Judy Hammer (groan) is tasked to clean up the city of Richmond, Virginia in the span of a one year term. She is assisted by Officer Andy Brazil and Deputy Chief Virginia West. As a team, they will clean up Richmond and fix all of the police department's problems, with an ultimate goal of uniting all the police departments in the South, an okay (but just okay) beginning plot until you find they have one yearto do this.  Then you find that they intend to do it with a computer system, (ho hum).  There is, in all this, a murder, and it is told with the usual Patricia Cornwell aplomb, but there is never any mystery and this is not a whodunit. I gave it two stars because despite the distracting names and animal characterization, there WAS a story, albeit a small one. I ended up really liking the character \\"Weed\\", but found the villain too villainous to be believable. I think Patricia Cornwell should stick to Kay Scarpetta.	2001-06-08

A horrible disease wastes this girl until nothing is left but a bone. I would have liked to have seen Marya Hornbacher go into the psychology and background of her illness more, and this lack of input causes the book to be a tad incomplete.

It is set in stone from the beginning that they must meet. John Philpin and Patricia Sierra team up to write this incredibly intense page-turning thriller. It's a murder mystery from the start, as Lucas Frank, ex homicide investigator, now retired, is shot in his home and left for dead. He doesn't die, and neither does his assassin, who turns out to be a man he was sure he had killed a year ago in a deadly game of cat and mouse. Lucas and his daughter Lane, now a homicide detective herself, must convince the FBI that John Wolf, infamous serial killer thought dead, actually survived a tragic explosion at his own home one year ago. The FBI is not buying it, and Wolf's victim count begins to accelerate at an alarming speed.  Lucas Frank has studied and lived serial killers all his life. He is a legend at getting into the mind of killers, of thinking like they think, and being able to plan their next move as easily as they themselves do. Lucas Frank may have met his match in John Wolf. As the famous Dr. Frank searches for answers, the victim count rises, until Dr. Frank realizes that he himself may be the next victim.

The Mulvaney story is the story of any of us who once had a close family and lost it. Joyce Carol Oates writes with a flair and a depth that touches the soul. A one-time tragedy becomes a lifetime legacy, as the Mulvaney's struggle with emotions and feelings they never knew existed when one of their own is hurt. The tragedy affects each family member in such profound ways; you will find yourself alternately rooting them on and silently sad for their plight.  Each character is developed to perfection, even the supporting characters, and the story reads like a well-oiled machine. Most touching of all is Mike Mulvaney Sr., a man with so much love and so much promise, in the end a tragic figure as he struggles with his own role as a father, a husband, and a man. Mikey Jr, Patrick, Judd, and Marianne, the four siblings, are each in their own way connected to the one trauma the family just cannot sort out, and the far reaching effects branch out into their lives with a stranglehold. Our heroine is Mom, Corinne Mulvaney, and the twists and turns surrounding this strong yet mild character will keep you turning page after page. This is a sad story, yet one with more courage and more hope in its pages than you could read in a lifetime.	2001-06-05

Rose: by Martin Cruz Smith<br />* There was something about this book I think I liked, but I cannot put my finger on what it is.  For the most part, I found it extremely boring. A writer writes what he/she knows, and a very good writer will make it fascinating, no matter how boring the subject matter. Martin Cruz Smith writes well about coal mines and the life of coal miners, but falls far short of making it fascinating. We learn of a character he calls only \\"Blair\\", who is sent to the horrible town of Wigan to search for a missing Reverend. Blair doesn't relish the job, but needs it to make enough money to return to his beloved Africa. In Wigan, the townspeople are covered in coal, a major coal mine has just suffered a disaster that killed 76 men, and no one is friendly. As Blair's search for the missing Reverend Maypole unfolds, he remains an elusive character, yet interesting. The development of Blair's background, which Martin Cruz Smith only touches on, may have redeemed this story. No one in the town seems to much care what may have happened to the good Reverend, and a pit girl named Rose develops into a major character. She has no depth, however, and the reader feels neutral about her for the most part. The endless descriptions of the coal mine and the process of mining coal were lifeless. Bill Jaxon is the story's villain. He is better developed but too mythical and ridiculous. He suspects Blair of having an interest in Rose, whom he considers his girl, and he becomes Blair's arch enemy and a formidable foe.  As the story winds down, the ending, which was obviously meant to kick the reader in the solar plexus, is anti climatic and serves nothing other than to relieve you of the daunting task of actually finishing this 400 page trial. The novel is a cadaver of novels, and I would not recommend as even the most desperate read.	2001-05-30

The book begins with old classmates meeting at a reunion. A few of them decide to get together again to find out more about what is going on in their lives. One of the characters tells a cute little story about two mice and two people who lived their life running around a maze looking for cheese. Cheese, for the little people, represents success. The main metaphor is that the two little people get stuck in a rut once they find a place where the Cheese is good and will last them forever. When things change, the little mice run off looking for new cheese, but the little people have grown too comfortable in their new place and have a harder time deciding what to do. The story is clever in the way it personifies people's inability or unwillingness to accept change, but to me it just wasn't profound enough and didn't go into enough detail. Most of what you read here you will already know, you just won't be used to an author putting it in quite this way. This is actually a self help book told like a fairy tale, and I think the author would have done better just telling the facts and leaving out the cartoon like references. Also, the book can be read in one day, so it is very short, making it's contents not quite up to snuff in the self-help genre. It's not a bad book, just a case where the author forgot to elaborate on the story.	2001-05-27

This book is full of action and adventure, and most of it takes place underwater, which is kind of a neat setting, if you are a diver. Nina Kirov goes off in search of ancient ruins, and finds a possible relic that could rock the world, proving that Columbus was not the first to discover America. A sinister organization called &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; also is aware of this relic and will stop at nothing to ensure that this relic, and others like it, never surface (pardon the pun). What bothered me the most about this book is it's unbelievable convenience of action. Before long, Nina has every resource imaginable, including the U.S. government and every research boat she could possibly need at her disposal, along with the best professionals in the world helping her out. Though the research done to write this book must have been phenomenal, (it is typical Clive Cussler after all), it doesn't ring true and it doesn't ring believable. Each horrific encounter of NUMA and the brotherhood is described in fantastic detail, yet the outcome is more than predictable, causing more than a few ho-hums. The characters read like robots, they don't seem to have much emotion at all, even Nina isn't developed enough to spend sufficient time grieving over a tragic slaughter of her favorite mentor and others. I think Clive Cussler, like Tom Clancy, spends too much time focusing on technical jargon and research findings than on developing his characters to the point where the average reader can put him/herself in their place. If you can't place yourself within the story,then you can't relate, and this is a book I just could not relate to. On the other hand, divers, underwater fanatics, and especially marine biologists and oceanographers will love this book. Anyone with an interest in the ocean and ships will fall right into this book. If you are out for a simple pleasurable story, my advice is to look elsewhere.	2001-05-26

I had never read anything by this author, Tami Hoag, before, but I surely will again. With amazing depth and clarity, Tami Hoag plunges her reader into a nightmare time of death and destruction. The twisted plot looms large, and becomes tangled and eerier with each page. Dr. Garrett Wright, a renowned professer and outstanding citizen is charged with the unspeakable crime of kidnapping eight year old Josh Kirkwood. When yet another child is kidnapped in the sleepy town of Deer Lake, Minnesota, while Dr. Garrett is incarcerated, the county prosecutor has a tough case to crack. Ellen North is our story's heroine, and she is portrayed as a tough nut herself. She is Deer Lake's county prosecutor, and she must face the fact that there is every possibility that Dr. Wright will go free, for a crime she is sure he committed. A lone writer named Jay Brooks appears, and Ellen despises him for his need to welsh on other people's pain, but he plays a strong role in her life, and she must face him, along with a ghost from her past, and a town whose children it is up to her to save. You will not be able to put this book down, I know I couldn't. Tami Hoag builds her characters in such a way that they are never confusing, and the end of the story will have you squirming in your seat.	2001-05-23

Igor Komarov has become, to the Russian people, an Icon, a symbol of restored hope in the Motherland, a promise to wipe out corruption and free the enslaved Russian people from poverty and crime. He will win the presidency by a landslide of overwhelming support.  The story begins when a lone illiterate cleaning man steals a document from Igor Komarov's secretary's desk. The document comes to be known as the &quot;Black Manifesto&quot;, and in it are Igor Komarov's real plans for the Motherland. Plans so heinous and hideous they make Adolph Hitler look like Barney the purple dinosaur. The cleaning man's deceit is discovered, but too late, the Black Manifesto has reached the ears and desks of the CIA, and there is only one man deemed suitable for the job of making sure Igor Komarov never rises to power, and assuring the Russian people a new and cleaner government. Jason Monk is our James Bond, a spy of masterful proportions. His quest is the hardest of his career, he is tasked to change a country. Frederick Forsythe is a brilliant author, and he brings Jason Monk into this story with finesse and intrigue. Though many of the names and details get lost on the average reader, the story is woven tightly together, and the suspense builds with each page. The background research that must have been done to write this book is daunting, but Frederick Forsythe is a master at it. The characters are well developed, to the point of intimacy, which is the way it should be. I would have given it five stars but for the tangle of information, names, dates, places, etc.., that disoriented me at times. I believe authors should keep it simple but potent. Frederick Forsythe has mastered the potency part. If you are looking for danger, intrigue, excitement and suspense in a spy genre, you have found it here.	2001-05-18

Peter Macqueen has never gotten over the fire that destroyed his wife and two children. So much so that he keeps and plays with a dollhouse, whose figures he pretends are his wife and two children. Each morning, he sets them at the breakfast table. Each evening, he puts them to bed. He is a quiet man, living alone, tortured by the guilt of his memories. One day a lady named Elaine appears, pregnant, having run away from her husband, she needs a place to stay. Peter cannot have her in the house, he simply cannot face a woman's presence in his solitude. He fears Elaine will discover the dollhouse, which he covers with a towel while she is there, and think him mad. What follows is a story of a love that was never meant to be, of a tiny baby that decides the fate of four people, and of the torturous journey towards healing that Peter Macqueen refuses to take. Woven throughout the story is one woman's faith in God, sorely questioned, and one man's lack of faith in anything at all. Wonderfully written, beautifully phrased, this is a story that will touch parts of you forever.	2001-05-11

Luanne Rice is a very talented author, and in this book, her talent shines even stronger than in her other super novels. Daisy and James are a couple who have had their lives shattered when their three year old son, Jake, goes missing. The way in which this has affected their lives is written with intelligence, great emotion, and absolute beauty. Years later, Daisy must return to where it all happened, a place that James has never left because he could not leave his missing son. This time, their sixteen year old daughter is missing, and the heartbreak and terror they feel compares to none. Estranged for years, Daisy and James must nevertheless make a strong effort to appear united, and work through this newest tragedy. With strong undertones of mystic Indian folklore and spirituality, this book will have you turning pages and rooting for characters left and right.	2001-05-10

The mystery is a mystery like no other I have ever read, and the brilliant mind that is the killer's is fascinating. Women are dying, and Jack Reacher has a mind almost as cunning as the killers. For a long time, even the cause of death is not known, so clever is the M.O. It is a race against time as Jack Reacher has discovered the names of 11 women that are on this insane hitlist. Inside this twisting plot, lies another plot, that of Jack Reacher and his girlfriend, and yet another plot, that of Jack Reacher and the street mobs of New York. The author manages to weave it all together so brilliantly that you don't realize you have read three stories in one until you are done, and they all connect with a fluidity that is all too rare these days. It's a smash ending, leaving you breathless with excitement and waiting for the next Jack Reacher book. GREAT!	2001-05-09

This book is just 71 pages long, and though it did offer a few very nice tips for writing personal notes, such as Invitations, Sympathy notes, Congratulations and Thank yous, it was a pretty simple book that I think all of us could have come up with if we gave it a shot. The most helpful thing I found was the author's advice to send quick notes on paper for times when you just know the receiver's life is stressful, like when a family pet dies, or a person loses their job, or even for good times, a son graduates, a friend publishes a poem etc... I hadn't thought of all that. These days with electronic communication it is easy to forget how meaningful some lasting words on paper can be.

Of course, if we wish to be published, we cannot ignore some of the guidelines in this book. In that aspect, the book is helpful and truly has some wonderful ideas and things to keep in mind that may help you get your book published. My hope is that it does not deter the aspiring writer from plunging on from the heart, since a lot of what this book has to say can be daunting. At times I felt myself being drawn into worry that my own manuscript would fall way short of all these &quot;have to&quot; rules, and I would never be able to remember all this and incorporate it into my own story. If you keep in mind that all this information is to guide and not set in stone, then the book is very helpful, the exercises given are strong and will assist your writing efforts, and you will learn much from this book.

This was a touching and moving story about a man thrust into the position of being a single father after the tragic death of his young wife. Eddie Olczak comes off as a simple man, a church janitor and bell ringer by trade, his wife, Krystna, a charitable and sweet woman whose tragic death leaves him and the entire community in complete and utter shock. The two little girls she leaves behind are heartbreaking, and their experiences in the little parochial school they attend are real and wrenching. At first, Krystna's spinster sister tries to take over in the hopes of eventually realizing her dream of loving and being Eddie's wife and mother, but this character is underdeveloped and fades into the background fairly quickly. Eddie is lonesome but hanging in there when he finds new love in the strangest place. The author really does a fine job of soul searching, and the story is a good one. The only drawback is it's lack of a punch line, lack of oomph, if you will. Still, it is a good read on a rainy day.	2001-04-24

This is an easy read, and though the characters are lively and real, the plot lacks depth. The theme of the story is there, the plot is a good one, but the author doesn't pull it off. There is drama and adventure, as there should be when a notable scientist joins an art thief to save her reputation, but I could not get excited about any of the scenes. Miranda Jones is an excellent scientist in the art world, her specialty being that of authenticating some of the oldest and rarest pieces in the world. When her authentication is proven a failure not once, but twice, it begins to look as though someone is out to ruin her name. Then the ominous faxes begin to come in, threatening and evil, but she shows them to no one at first. Enter Ryan Boldarri, also of the art world, and a good love story, and you have the two of them joined at the hip to solve a mystery. Throw in a few unexplained deaths, some off site characters, and a mixture of romance, history, and mystery, and that is our novel. Sound good? It is. Except, I could not help but think that had it been written by someone other than Nora Roberts, it would have enticed me more and been a stronger page turner.	2001-04-24

Since the book is fairly factual in it's historical and geographical details, the reader comes to expect lots of fact, mixed in with all the good humor, the adventure, the fun, the mystery itself, and the unbelievable descriptions. When John Corey begins to take the homicide case on by himself (with the help of a female cop, Beth Penrose), the plot becomes shaky. In all, a wonderfully worthwhile read about a fabulous character, who is well developed and great to get to know. John Corey is a convalescing NYPD homicide cop, who finds himself involved, both personally and a little bit professionally, in a homicide case involving Plum Island, a very factual place with tons of history. Though way out of his jurisdiction and eventually out of his mind, the story is wild with action and absorbent with enough facts to keep you page turning. A great read, even when Nelson Demille, the author, does stretch it a bit.	2001-04-20

So many people felt lives would not have been lost without this book. This is wrong. A suicidal person will always find a way. This is a book that is intended to help the terminally ill who need an easy passing. Try to imagine yourself, suffering, in unbearable agony, your own suffering making all of your loved ones hearts break a little daily, no end in sight, just the knowledge that if you sleep at all, when you wake, the agony will continue, not just for you but for everyone. Often, too often, doctors will limit and provide dosages of pain relief that are inadequate, because there are times when the pain is untouchable by modern drugs. Ask yourself: Will your loved ones suffer more after your death than they are now? THAT, dear readers, is what this book means. It offers a glimmer of light for the terminally ill. That is all. It does not in any way intend itself for depressed people, but depressed people will buy it, and read it, and perhaps follow it to the end. They suffer too, their pain is as real as the physical pain of a terminally ill patient, do not expect the book ever to be banned to depressed or mentally ill patients only. I respect any terminally ill patient's decision to use the guidelines in this book to assist in an end that will allow them to finally erase the agony, the physical torture, the lives wreaked with havoc and pain because of their illnesses. Those of you who do not understand Derek Humphrey's motive should read this book again. Those of you who do not understand your relative or loved one's decision to act on the guidelines in this book need to make peace with yourselves, and put the blame where it really belongs, nowhere.	2001-04-17

I cannot get through it. It sounds like a bunch of gobbledy gook for the most part, and there isn't enough explanation to begin with about how the author(s) came to write this. It's like a Bible, even the paper it is printed on, and somehow, supposedly, the author(s) have been given this divine inspiration to write it. After you get through the first part, the rest is supposedly a course you take, and throughout the book I think the intent is to enlighten you spiritually somehow so you are prepared to leave your ego and self behind and become God or one with God.

This is a straight forward, wonderful book that addresses the question overeaters need to know most: WHY? Why do overeaters eat the way the do? Some of the reasons given are so practical you will wonder why you didn't think of them yourself, others you will realize with a start that they are exactly true. When you begin to try a few of these tips, you will be amazed at how well they work. Though I am not overweight, I do overeat at times, and this book helped me to do two complete life style changes: Give up sugar in my coffee (two spoonfuls each cup times 3 cups a day is a lot of calories) and switch from soda to mineral water. I wasn't in any hurry to lose weight, but knew that over time these changes would make a difference of 5 or 10 pounds, and they have. A very helpful guide with tremendous insight.

Our hero is Mr. Raymond Anthony Neenan, CEO and President of a large media corporation and multi gazillionaire,  who finds himself sitting on an airplane next to a big black man with an earring in his ear who claims to be what we earthlings call &quot;an angel&quot;, though prefers to be called a &quot;seraph&quot;. At first Mr. Neenan thinks the guy is a nut, and then he thinks perhaps he had too much vodka. When the plane is sent hurtling towards earth, luggage flying everywhere, nose diving into a certain crash, and then righted again, with everyone else on board unaware of what has just happened, Mr. Neenan believes. He is told he does not have long to live, and should sign this contract to save his immortal soul. He signs. What follows is humor, good fun, some sadness, and a lot of emotional turmoil for our hero. He now must right all of the wrongs he has done in his life, and he has only a short time in which to do so. As the story progresses, it becomes somewhat of a reach, but hanging in there is worth it. I did not like the ending at all, but of course cannot give that away. Instead, I recommend you read it for yourself and decide. All in all, I was happy with this book, found it very well written and an extremely easy read, and enjoyed almost every page.	2001-04-14

Truly this book is going to help every single aspiring author to free the writer within. After you read it, you will want to start writing right away, and I have started doing the exercises before I even finished the book. Ms. Goldberg really has a way of reaching into your fears and anxietys about getting those words on paper, and she is a very real person with some very solid advice. A Buddhist herself, she brings some Zen wisdom into the book also, which is meaningful and helps her to succeed in her attempt to get you to pick up that pen and go! She is successful at giving you the &quot;permission&quot; you need and telling  you how to begin. Authors suffering from &quot;writer's block&quot; will even find this book helpful. Those who never had an interest in writing will find they do after reading this. It's informative, there is humor, there is much straight talk, and best of all for me, it comes in an itty bitty pocket size wonder. Hurry up and get this one before word gets out and it sells out everywhere!	2001-04-11

Drowning Ruth is a mystery of sorts, but also a drama unlike most dramas new to the genre today. The book leaves you guessing until the end, and nothing about it is predictable at all. Ruth is a child whose mother drowns fairly early on in the story, but there are so many veins and arteries extending from that one plot line that you will find yourself immersed in thought and wonder as you read. Ruth is raised by Aunt Mandy, whose character is developed to the point where you would know her if you saw her on the street. It's a beautifully written book, the characters are alive and real, the plot and theme are rich and tasty throughout, and the writer's style is deep and thoughtful. I really enjoyed it from beginning to end, and highly recommend it for any reader.	2001-04-08

As murder mysteries go, this one falls short of a bestseller, but it does keep you turning pages, even if only to get through it. Our hero, Matt Cook, heir to the fortune of his famous father/author, is suspected in the death of said father. Matt himself is a journalist, hooks up with another journalist, and together they travel the world, ending up in exotic, off the beaten track places and becoming involved in a web of conspiracy, murder, and all sorts of action packed adventures. The theme of the whole story is too old though, we have all read mysteries like this before, and though the characters are lively enough, it just doesn't make for a stay awake at night book. Nearly every chapter is predictable, and though there is one fairly good twist, I suspected it as a twist immediately and still figured it out. At times there is some good humor, and some of the characters will keep you guessing, but there are just so many better murder mysteries and stories of this genre out there that I could only give it three stars. After awhile, I got really tired of the gang killings, which just went on and on and all of Matt's miraculous escapes. His journalist friend, Tina, is also very predictable, but she has spunk and at least that is appreciable. All in all, an average book with a little bit of spice.	2001-04-06

Not one of Robin Cook's best for sure, but it is an old one, and he has since improved. The basic plot is that a large Mafia type organization has somehow conspired to obtain an amazing amount of business with an in-vitro fertilization program, and our hero, Marissa, begins to smell a rat. I'll let the book take you from there, but I do have to say that when Robin Cook gets into the emotional and stressful aspects of the inability to conceive, he shows an enormous insight. I thought of all the racing around and drama and suspense, this insight was the absolute best portion of the book. I'm certain that few authors, or doctors, for that matter, could have done better with this aspect. For this reason alone I gave it four stars. I think couples undergoing fertility problems should read this book if only for that reason.	2001-04-04
US	52789100	R1W0WLY1LYYYU9	0061042943	653557085	Final Appeal	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Just okay.	This is the first of Lisa Scottoline's books I have read, recommended to me by a friend. I found it kind of funny at times, and certainly well written, yet not at all spellbinding. As legal thrillers go, it leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't feel a whole lot of suspense and drama going on, and this may have been because of this author's lighthearted style of writing. I'm not sure that I would race right out to buy another of her books, but would perhaps read one if there wasn't much else available. This book is a good time passer, and will keep you interested enough to erase a few minutes of your life here and there, but if it's suspense and legal thrill you want, I'd stick with John Grisham.	2001-04-04

This book is a cross between &quot;Tommyknockers&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; (the movie with Sigourney Weaver). Though hard to follow at times, the reader MUST maintain focus on the novel in order not to lose the thread that weaves it all together. It is a hard novel to keep up with, yet an act of brilliance so glowing in insanity and typical Stephen King that you will love both it's simplicity and it's complexity. Yes, folks, the aliens have landed once again, and where else but in Maine? This time, though, the aliens have and can give telepathic powers, as well as lay eggs and reproduce. There's a little bit of Stephen King's accident there too, which plays well with a character he calls Jonesey, but &quot;Duddits&quot; is our main character, and Duddits is a local retard boy that four local boys become friends and bond with. Years go by, and passages of time as in every lifetime, yet somehow, the master artist once again weaves it all together with a &quot;dreamcatcher&quot;, and when the world goes crazy, as it always seems to do in Stephen King's books, the dreamcatcher may be the only way out. You will love this book, and you will add it to your vast Stephen King library. Just remember not to lose the thread.	2001-03-31

This book is translated by a person named N.J. Darwood. It's simply wonderful. The tales involved are tales of the Persian Gulf, of Bagdhad, Arabia, and tales that we as adults should revisit for some enjoyable light reading that will make us smile and wonder at the old folklore of the Arabian Peninsula. Sinbad the Sailor is in there, as is Aladdin in it's original form, and the story begins of a king who is so upset by his wife's unfaithfulness that he will now only accept virgins for one night and then have them killed. A smart virgin begins her night with the infamous king by telling him stories, and she so fascinates him and enthralls him with her tales that the tales turn into folklore for readers of the ages. I won't tell you what happens in the end to the virgin princess, but you will find humor, enchantment, wisdom and fantasy for those times when stress becomes a factor in your life. I highly recommend the tale of &quot;The Historic Fart&quot; as a both funny and inspiring tale of human nature. Please buy this book and remember to become a nine -12 year old again as you read with curiosity and wonder at the fabulous enchanting, lively stories. I was beginning to wish my children were a bit younger so I could read these to them. Any child would enjoy these stories, and any adult will find them simply relaxing and a reflection of medieval Islam.	2001-03-27

The story begins with a young couple, camping outdoors on a romantic weekend with the hopes of overcoming their pain of not being able to have a child. Mysteriously, a child comes running from the woods, screaming, a toddler. The couple then becomes involved in a game of cat and mouse, a web of murder and drug smuggling, kidnapping, and intrigue. Their lives are turned upside down in a matter of an hour. The story is fast paced and interesting, and will keep you turning pages. The ending is....well, can't give that one away, let's just say it is an interesting turn of events. This author has a great grasp on how to entice and hold onto a reader.	2001-03-21

It includes all of the family secrets, all of the rough times, all of the good times, and a growing hatred between two sisters that will touch your heart. There is treachery of the worst kind, and love of the best kind. There is a kind father, a bitter mother, confused children, and an ending that will leave you very glad you invested your time in reading this book. Martha Claire is a character you will love and adore, and then resent, and finally despise, a trick I have yet to see any other author pull off so beautifully. The children will touch your heart, and a man named Grayson is one you will not soon forget. READ THIS BOOK!	2001-03-20

A pretty good story about a Federal Agent who loses his memory just at a point in time where he was on the edge of an important breakthrough. As the story progresses, the &quot;amnesia&quot; becomes suspect, as does our Federal Agent Luke. There's more, though, and the twists and turns will keep you wondering. I was left, though, with a feeling that the entire reason for the plot of the story could have been more meaningful somehow. Ken Follett is a good author, and I enjoyed the book, but I couldn't give it more than three stars. There was a depth of some sort that seemed to be missing, and it just didn't entice me the way other Follett books have in the past.	2001-03-20

There is Taylor, the fireman/remodeler, and Kyle, a cute and sensitive little boy, and Denise his mother. The story focuses on Taylor's never having gotten over and blaming himself for the death of his father, who died in a fire. Denise is an admirable and strong character. Kyle is a special child with special needs. Together, they must struggle through their own past haunts and fears, and try, in a world that has suddenly seemed to change for all of them, to pull together despite strong odds. At times the story is a bit soft, and I think emotions could have been delved into more, but it is a story to warm your heart and feed your soul for a little while, and couldn't we all use a little of that?	2001-03-17

Our main character is Cat Delaney, lucky receiver of a donor heart, but not so lucky when she finds out that donors who received hearts on that day are dieing of fatal &quot;accidents&quot; on the anniversary of their surgery. Sandra Brown does a super job of keeping you guessing, right until the very end. She also delves into the subject of whether donor recipients receive more than just an organ. Do they sometimes  receive characteristics of their donor as well? When Cat Delaney first receives her heart, she has, literally, a &quot;change of heart&quot; and goes from being a famous TV news personality  to running a program for adoptive children. Cat doesn't know her donor's identity, and doesn't want to, until it is much too late. You will enjoy every page and will want to keep reading into the night. Cat Delaney is not even a likeable personality, yet Sandra Brown pulls this story together as easy as pulling a drawstring. This is the first time I have read this author, and I intend to read her more often. Highly recommended.	2001-03-17

I normally love stories of the Second World War, which is what prompted me to buy and read this 1,360 page book. I thought I would never get through it. Though the authors did a good job on the atomic bomb section, the rest was pure drivel, a lot of speculation, unnecessary background information, and enough to put an owl to sleep at night. There are many great World War II books out there, but this is certainly not one of them. The inserted maps are pretty good, but other than that, the only thing good I can say about this book is that thank goodness I finished it. Not recommended at all.	2001-03-14

This book is extreme in it's descriptions, powerful in it's narrative, and explosive in it's plot. I couldn't stop reading it, even though it both disturbed and moved me. The author has performed a literary feat heretofore unknown to me. The very graphic descriptions are horrifying at best, and at times I was tempted to put the book down, so strong was it's effect. Yet I was glad I continued reading, and gritted my teeth through the worst of it, because this book will remain with me forever. It is a thousand times more moving than the Tribulation series, and the absolutely best book I have ever read on the end times. Any book that can evoke such strong images and emotions is a literary masterpiece. The fact that the emotions it evokes are ones of revulsion, fear, disgust and horror is another point in it's favor. This author is a rarity. Those readers who felt the book was too graphic and too descriptive and unnecessarily strong should stick with Danielle Steele. This story will take you away to places you never want to visit, but will keep you there with it's intensity. Get this book right away! PS: not for the squeamish!	2001-01-31

Extremely fast paced, with lots of adventure and excitement, this book will keep you on your toes, always wondering what will happen next. Our main character, Wheeler Cassidy, is well developed, and stronger than his initial description leads us to believe. He is the brother of Prescott Cassidy, who is murdered in his office. Wheeler must find the strength and the courage to avenge his brother's murder, but he has no idea what he is getting himself into. Teaming up with a tough lady cop from Asian Crimes Division, Wheeler sets out on a journey that will have international repercussions. Wheeler's mother is a strong character that will stay with you. The story takes you up many roads, bumpy and directionless, blindfolded. You will enjoy excitement and adventure while getting your money's worth. The only problem I had with this book was keeping all of the characters straight. Once the author gets into China and Hong Kong, you'd need a listing in front of you to understand who everyone is. Still, the plot is great, the story well written, and it's a very good read.	2001-01-27

This little pocket guide of thoughts is interesting and useful. Though the author claims self help guides do not work, she proceeds to write one that really does. Each segment is titled with a question, and the answer to that question is reasonable, makes sense, and is usually helpful. All of the questions are those we might ask were we seeking therapy for those times we have lost our way, and Susan McMahon answers them truthfully and with new insight. She offers many words of wisdom, and introduces paradoxes that cause us to stop and really think about the subject. Her concept of &quot;Social Interest&quot; falls short though, and I didn't really understand the whole idea behind that, but her concept of &quot;Self Esteem&quot; is described clearly and understandably. I liked this little guide, and I suspect I will refer to it often.	2001-01-21

It just kind of hum drums along, everyone is all sweet and nice to each other, no traumas or ordeals, just a simple start to finish story. Oscar has lost his wife and child in an auto accident, but that is the extent of the excitement in this book. The details of the accident are not given, and Oscar's grief is not elaborated upon enough for the reader to feel strongly for him. The word nauseating came to mind while I read this, but that is too strong a word for what I think was intended to be a simple story after all. It's fairly mindless, and if you have time to waste, it is not a bad choice. It is well written, but dull. The characters do not come to life, the story does not touch your heart, and the ending is predictable and boring. This author ties everything up with a neat little bow, and leaves the reader wondering why you didn't bother to write it yourself.	2001-01-14

This book is easily read, very smooth in style, and full of entertainment.The villain is not described in enough detail, so we are unable to savor the pleasure of hating that character, but Detective Starkey is quite realistic. She is our main character, and she has never gotten over a bomb that killed her LAPD bomb squad partner/lover and nearly killed her as well three years ago. Now she is faced with an inner turmoil, having to face the old trauma and add to it the possiblity of it all happening again.  The story wasn't strong enough though, and I think this author could have added more emotion. All in all a good plot, nice characters, and very easy reading.	2001-01-13

I was prepared to not like this book, thought it would be an attempt at rewriting a very old story, but it is a really cute story. Julie and Romeo are old, for one thing, but the whole family feud thing is there. The humor this author places in bits and pieces is fabulous, and really perks up the story. Both Julie and Romeo own rivaling flower shops, and both have families that hate with an intense passion. They meet after many years, neither one really remembering why they hate each other in the first place, and - you guessed it - they fall in love. Their families are horrified and the scenes to follow will have you chuckling. This author is incredibly clever and well spoken, and I recommend this book for a lighthearted escape - very worth it.	2001-01-13

It does have a bit of suspense, which makes you keep going back to it, but if you put it down and forgot about it, you wouldn't be missing a lot. Nell is our main character, the granddaughter raised by a highly political grandfather, with political aspirations of her own that are being suppressed by her husband, Adam. Adam is much too vague a figure, and when Mary Higgins Clark gets into the psychic-reaching-the-dead portion of the story, it flops. Still, the book was interesting enough that I did finish it, and some of the characters are clever and enticing. The story itself is pretty clever, although the land deals will have you scratching your head trying to figure it all out. A good read, but I wouldn't rush right out and buy it. Mary Higgins Clark has done much better.	2001-01-12

The sentences in this book are disjointed, as though the author was writing down random thoughts. I found this very disconcerting and it made the book difficult to understand, even though the author writes in layman's terms. There are some pages towards the end of the book where the author gets lost in thanking his peers, and this throws the book off kilter as well. His coping mechanisms are not very helpful either, since most of us cannot be world travelers or sing in nightclubs when we are depressed, but there are a few good pointers. The difficulty lies in selecting the pointers out of the jumble of words. I got the feeling the author needed to write for his own sake, and was not targeting any audience. As a result, we have a journal of random thoughts and a cocktail of suggestions here and there. I got a few good tips from the book, however, and so I cannot count it as a total loss.	2001-01-09

I just fell in love with Penny Daigle, the child star of this book. She is precocious, hard to handle, mischievous, and an overall delight to know. I admired her courage and her devilish ways. Each character is brought to light simply, yet revealed in intimate detail. There is Isabel, who I can picture in my mind as clear as day from the descriptions in the book. She is our resident religious fanatic intent upon forcing her views on the world and changing reality. Mahalia is a struggling teen, Penny's older sister, who acts as though she is just that, a struggling teen, vacuumed up by Isabel and unsure of her place in the world. F.X. is a fabulous uncle, I wish I had one like him. The mother's struggle with alcoholism tends to take a back seat to the story, even though I think it was intended to be the focal point, yet it is Marguerite's alcoholism that really starts everything. From page to page, the story is filled with drama and delight. It's humorous and sad, fluffy and deep at the same time. This author is a true find.	2001-01-08

I have enjoyed so very much traveling to Hogwart's with Harry for each school year, and now, in Book 3, Harry is growing up a bit, and the results are great fun! Harry still has an incredible penchant for finding trouble, and this book is no different than the other two in that respect. Harry must now fear Sirius Black, a sinister and evil sounding figure from his past that is searching for Harry. The magic spells, the potions, the divinations, the descriptions of it all - are just fabulous. I love when Harry looks at photos and the people in them wave back at him, and when trees strike back and owls deliver mail.

A bit of a fantastical waste, but an amusing and magical tale in its own way. This is the story of the Macinnes family, a Scottish family empowered with special powers of a sort. They have the ability to commune with spirits, ancestors of old, some telepathic qualities, as well as the ability to conjure up and see faeries and fairy dust in magical forests. The story begins when the father of the Macinnes clan is downed in a horrible plane wreck, and from there the reader is taken into lands unimaginable and fantasies galore. It was a bit too Wonderlandish for me, but a good escape on a quiet evening in front of the fire if you are so inclined. The romance aspect of the story is truly washed up and overused, but the rest of the tale is bouncy and magnetic.	2001-01-01

Barbara Kent Lawrence is both author and main character in this book. It is a story of her life with a severely anorexic husband. Her husband, Tom, is very ill indeed, and throughout the book I could not help but feel not only sorry for him, but anger at her. Her naivete and lack of compassion, I feel, contributed greatly to the escalation of his illness. I could not help but wonder if she would have been so ignorant if her husband had cancer or diabetes or a fatal brain tumor. Tom needed help desperately, and Ms. Lawrence chose instead to focus on her own needs during his troubled times. She shows an astounding ignorance in this day and age of the disease, of Raynaud's disease, which Tom claims he has, and of it's implications. Not surprisingly, her husband improves once she leaves him. Her selfishness seems unbounded. At Tom's very worst times is when she thinks of leaving him. There is no question her life was difficult living with this man, but there is also no question that Tom had a serious, life threatening, chemical imbalance that could have been helped a great deal with her support. I wonder what her purpose was in writing her memoirs. If it was to gain sympathy for her ordeal, she should think again. I admire Tom much more, and wish him a life with someone who will make an attempt to understand and secure help for him when he needs it. In all fairness I could not base my rating on how I feel about the subject matter. Others may feel very differently. So I gave the book four stars for the very fact that it IS thought provoking and well written. I just hope that Ms. Lawrence does not applaud herself too much.	2000-12-31

Dr. Jamison is an expert in her field of depression and manic depressive illnesses. She is also an expert on suicide, which this book is about. It is a profound and deeply moving book that addresses an ever increasing problem in our society. Dr. Jamison leads us on a disturbing journey through the suicidal mind, and brings us back again, a bit wiser, more enlightened, and hauntingly contemplative on this desperate subject.

Kay Redfield Jamison writes with a strong knowledge of the subject. In this book, she researches the question of artistic talent, creativity, and it's relationship to manic depressive illness. The facts are stunning. I was unaware that such a strong link existed, but it does make sense. Famous authors, poets, and painters are explored, and their struggle with this very debilitating disease is illuminated in these pages.  Manic depressive illness is portrayed as a double edged sword, one that destroys even as it creates. Ms. Jamison researches the question of treatment, and whether or not treating/eradicating manic depressive illness does not also involve the stifling of creativity. Some famous authors are even known to have said that their suffering is a part of who they are, and without it, they could not create. The forms of treatment are also explored, and the pros and cons of Lithium and other medication discussed. This author has done her homework, and this book will inform and delight anyone interested in this subject. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the statistics (though necessary) get boring.	2000-12-24
US	52789100	R3JHBO75X6EJ60	0316569321	613460974	White Oleander	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A novel that explores the soul of every misplaced child.	As I traveled along with Astrid, the teenage main character, I felt her emotions carry me into a world that should not, but most assuredly does, exist. This is the world of the misplaced child, the child who, for all intents and purposes, should fit in everywhere, should have a life with a promise of a future and security in love. Astrid does not have this, and as she grows from a young, fatherless girl whose mother gets a life in prison sentence, into a young woman making her own way in the world, she learns to be cold, and distant. Her beautiful, intense spirit becomes solid as ice eventually, and instead of growing in a world laced with acceptance, Astrid grows up and learns how to never attach, to never belong, to never feel permanence. It's a very sad story, and so well written that it evokes feelings you thought you had forgotten. I rooted for Astrid the entire story, and I related to her experiences as though they were my own. I admire her hard earned strength, and only wish these things did not really happen, but they do. Buy this book immediately, or borrow it - it is truly extraordinary.	2000-12-18

I recommend taking the trip with Harry back to Hogwarts and into the Chamber of Secrets, if only so you can enjoy being eleven years old again for a short time.	2000-12-16

But you really need to be in the mood for a rather mindless, uncomplicated novel to enjoy this. I much prefer stories with a little depth. I was able to read this story in two days, there isn't much too it, and I found it pleasant yet boring in many places. If you like Harlequin, or Danielle Steele, you will enjoy this book.

Ms. Jamison explores her own experiences with manic depression in a graphic and detailed account.  As a mental health professional, doing so is even more dangerous. She risks her right to practice clinically and her professional reputation to share with us her thoughts, feelings, and actual relationship with this horrible disease.  I believe by doing so, Ms. Jamison has brought this world one step closer to recognizing that mentally ill people are just that, ILL. The stigma surrounding mental illness needs to be erased, and Ms. Jamison has done a fine job of taking a bold step in that direction. I hope this book reaches every single person who ever scoffed at, sneered at, or looked down their noses at depression, mania, or other mental illnesses.	2000-12-09

I related to this story in so many ways, I was touched by it's honesty, it's purity, it's simple statements that jabbed my heart. This book's message is so very strong, yet it is said in the lightest of ways.  Somehow Ms. Berg manages to not overdo the fluff. She presents the story of a mother lost between two worlds while her family must pick up the pieces in a light-hearted, yet moving way. The two young girls affected most by the mother's behavior suffer with a bravery the reader is proud of, and the character of the mother is hated and loved alternately. The father is the kind of person one's heart reaches out to, and I found myself saying &quot;bless his heart&quot; more than once. At the end of the story, I am left with mixed feelings toward Marion, the mother, but one thing is for sure: This is a GREAT read.	2000-12-09

The original story is a good idea. A little boy goes to a private detective in the hopes of finding his father. The good ideas end right there. Between the graphic descriptions of the fighting (all the characters except the little boy himself are portrayed as expert Ninja type fighters), and the horrible choice of words, there just is NO hope for this book. Here's a good example: &quot;...his objet d'amour rolling away to perform an excretory function...&quot; or how about this one: &quot;Faces turned, lips curled into contumelious sneers.&quot; What the heck is contumelious? I didn't even bother to look it up. If you have to look up a descriptive word, the author should not have used it. And the best one: &quot;&quot;Groan,&quot; he said, onomatopoeitically.&quot; I am not kidding. This book was an absolute literary disaster. Author Leo Atkins should not give up his day job. I do not recommend buying or borrowing this book, and I am not even going to pass this on to my sister, as I do all of my books, it is going right into the trash.	2000-12-03

I know Mr. Sheldon has written a gazillion books, and I am certain that I once read one by him that I really liked, but I cannot remember which one, and it is MOST DEFINITELY not this one. This book is boring, slow-paced, and dull. Dana Evans, for one, starts out as a least likely mom type, which is how she is dropped into the plot, and true to form, turns out to be an awful Mom. Right away I didn't like her because of this and couldn't feel for her. She runs around the globe leaving her &quot;son&quot; with a lady she just met, but she does call once in awhile. Dana Evans' next sin is to tolerate the unheard of relationship between her fiance, Jeff, and his ex-wife, who just happens to be a perfect ten in every way. Dana questions in her mind, to her credit, but she sure is a whole lot more patient than any American woman I know. As Dana chases a murder story that winds up getting top government officials to tell her things that they have never told anyone (and this while she is a Star Reporter!), her son is first a troublemaker and then neglected at home. Nonetheless, our heroine plunges forth, reveals all, and there is a nice, homey, happy ending that - well, that left me nauseated. Don't waste your time on this one, I imagine Sidney Sheldon fans are pretty disappointed, because I would hate to think this is a sample of his work.	2000-11-11

Ms. Kingsolver is more than adept at putting feelings into words, and matching words with feelings. The story is about a family living in the Congo with an extraordinarily insane father whose sole reason for being there is to change the Congolese into Christians. With that goal in mind, he is oblivious to the slow, torturous ordeals of his family, and remains oblivious to the steady destruction of their lives. The trials faced by mother and daughters are so uniquely described you will find yourself absorbed. I took this book with me everywhere I went, I could not be without it. It's a beautifully woven tail. I could smell Africa and the Congo, and I have never been there. I could taste the manioc, and I don't even know what it is. Mostly I could feel the hearts of the family in peril. This book is worth much more than five stars, and you should rush right out and buy it today.	2000-11-10

Sybil Evans does a good job with some very real and very frustrating situations. Her task of helping us deal with Anger is a large one, and after reading this book, I give her a thumbs up.  The Anger Management techniques are good, and a lot of the book is about learning to recognize our own &quot;hot buttons&quot; or &quot;pet peeves&quot; as I call them. I think Ms. Evans should have thrown in a few more helpful tips, I felt the book did come up a little short, but it is a good book and well intentioned. I think the phrase I will remember most from this self help book is &quot;when anger rises, think of the consequences.&quot; (Confucious). That has just got to be the most difficult, but most helpful advice I have ever heard! Thank you Sybil Evans for some good pointers and some self awareness you gave me. This book is not a problem solver. I think the theme is &quot;alternatives, not answers.&quot; Self help junkies around the world should find it useful.	2000-11-07

If Betty Balsam's purpose was to bring to light a horrible mutilation practice still going on in today's world, she really has done wonderfully. But this book is about so much more than that as well. It's about oppression of women, so strong and so very factual in many ways that it will make you shudder. In trying to express Sarah Sultan's tremendous task of instituting schools for females and males, Ms. Sultan does a fine job of teaching us, the readers, how very difficult life is for women in the Middle East. The only reason I gave this book four and not five stars, is because of it's poor editing. Spelling and grammar leave a tremendous lot to be desired, and can take the reader's eyes off the flow of the moment, it's disconcerting. At times the use of phrases that are spoken wrong actually add to the flavor, but mostly the many spelling errors are bothersome. Still, I have just finished another book by this lady, and that story is fabulous also. I will definitely add her to my list of favorite authors.	2000-11-07

I liked this book, but wish the main character, Andrea, was more believable. If she really was a college graduate in America, no way would she have tolerated day one in Iran the way it is described in the book. Supposedly Andrea had never been overseas, so that makes her incredible tolerance (of her mother-in-law, her husbands extreme and instant behavior change, life in general) unreal. From the time she gets off of the plane, Mani, her husband deserts her. Yet he is described as the perfect loving father and husband when he is in America. Any woman would have been suspect at least. Yet Andrea doesn't question for a long time, and I found myself wishing she had some spunk. The daughter Kelly doesn't figure much either. Her purpose as a character is left dangling. Then there are dangerous political undertones smacking Andrea in the face, yet she wants to learn the language and socialize. When she finally catches on,(and by this point I was thinking she must be a real idiot), it is way too late in the story, for her, for her daughter, and for the reader. She doesn't even find out until the very end that her marriage isn't recognized there. She could have left all along! Something about the story does flow though, and I kept reading and found the cultural and political descriptions fascinating and well written. Andrea's ultimate survival is too bizarre, and her perseverance at this point is not to be admired, but to be questioned mentally. A good story, all in all, but difficult to relate to. I live in the Middle East, so it isn't being an American and naive that causes my discomfort with the plot. I think it is just a fairly weak plot, but I'll admit that the author does a good job with trying to make it work.	2000-11-07

From the very beginning, a classic war between good and evil. First we think it is the Nazi's, a horror created by man. Yet the evil goes deeper than that, drawing the reader into a spellbinding black tale. Page by page we learn to love some of the characters, hate others, and fear for the fate of mankind. The author superbly weaves us into the tale, until ultimately we are caught up in the battle ourselves. I was left wondering, was this a tale of mythical proportions or was it an attempt to force us to see what our very humanness is capable of? Either way, the story gets my vote.	2000-10-26

This book was so very intense and mind capturing, that at times I found myself disturbed and almost not wanting to read on. As a die-hard lover of horror and suspense, this book is one of the best I have ever read in that genre. Though not as down to earth as Stephen King, Dean Koontz writes with a style and a flair few in this genre can claim rights too. From page one, I was drawn into the plot and the characters, feeling sensitivity for Skeet, the drug saturated half brother of Dusty, and alarmed for Martie, as she begins to sense an irrational fear of her own shadow. I could have cried over Susan, whose fate made me both angry and intensely sad. When a writer can touch those emotions in a reader, when he/she can bring out raw feeling such as Dean Koontz did in this book, then truly the book is a work of art, a nothing-less-than five star story. The character of Dr. Ahriman is drawn completely, with no details untouched. For him I felt disgust, and also some anger, mixed with the very smallest bit of compassion. The entire subject of mind control is elaborated on here with such an exotic twist, that reality for the reader becomes mixed with a sense of knowing this all couldn't possibly happen, yet wondering...What If?	2000-10-22

I will never understand why most historians who deem to become authors do not write with the idea that the general public is their audience. If I were a historian myself, I may have found this book interesting. I, however, am an average reader who happens to enjoy the subject of World War II, wanting to learn but also wanting to be entertained. Unless you desperately need facts, don't buy this book. It will not entertain you in the least, it will bore you to tears. The few interesting facts you do gain from it as an average reader are okay, and I did come away with a better sense of how a leadership such as Hitler's was &quot;allowed&quot;&quot; to happen, but I do wish Ian Kershaw would have written the book with a little feeling behind it. Not only that, half of the book, towards the end, is taken up with &quot;notes&quot;, so that the reader feels cheated. I will not buy the sequel to this one, and I only recommend it if you have a history exam coming up.	2000-10-22

And it's new title should be &quot;When smart people read dumb books.&quot; I thought it would be a helpful, informative book for those of us who really do work for inadequate leadership, and instead it was a jumble of whiny people complaining about their workplaces. The conversations of employees did not seem to be edited, so a lot of what was said was incomprehensible to the reader, since you couldn't be there to read body language or decipher the situation. The book offers absolutely no help on what to do if you happen to be the victim of a &quot;dumb&quot; boss, and I can't decide why the authors wrote it in the first place. It spends an awful lot of time on workplaces in the health care field and education, leaving anyone else in the dark.

If this author was attempting to sway the general public's opinion towards the Ramsey's guilt, he may have done just the opposite. He freely admits how badly the D.A.s office and Boulder Police Department botched the investigation, and even admits that he, himself did not stand up and speak for fear of losing his job or other retributions. If that is the case, then this detective is making an excuse for having done a poor job. He is totally right in saying that BPD failed JonBenet, but after you read his book, you realize that he personally failed her too. For this, there is no excuse. Not only that, he cited so many reasons why the Ramsey's had to be guilty, and called into play so many questions about their behavior, it began to seem that he was looking for things to pick on. No matter what answers the Ramsey's had, they were not good enough. In fact, it seemed like ALL of their answers were suspect. I don't know whether or not the Ramsey's did it or not, but I do know I wouldn't buy this book again, and I CERTAINLY would not want this detective on my case if it were my child that were murdered. He'd insist on a family member involvement no matter what. The only good thing about this book is that he states he resigned.	2000-09-23

For history lovers everywhere, Stalingrad will not disappoint. I especially enjoyed the graphic details of the hardships of soldiers, both Germans and Russians, and marveled at the style in which Antony Beever was  able to portray this information. Citing from genuine eye-witness accounts,  confiscated letters and various historical documents, Beever is able to  come up with a grinding tale of life during the siege of Stalingrad.  Accurate insistence on detail completes a stunning portrait of this most  horrific battle, and the page by page drama unfolds into an epic chronicle  that could not be told in a better way. Stalingrad is easily depicted as  the taproot of the turning point of World War II history. I highly  recommend this novel.	2000-06-15

Tony Hillerman's Hunting Badger was the 412th book I have read since 1997 (I am keeping track). It is also the first and last I will ever read by this author. I finish everything I read, regardless of it's content, but  this one was a struggle. Maybe if I had some of the background other  readers have had with this author, I would have enjoyed it. But it is my  contention that a good book can be picked up anywhere, at any point in the  story, even within a series, and be enjoyed, even gripping. This story  falls way short of that. In fact, I didn't keep the character's straight  very well, I  hardly followed the plot line, and I struggled to put it all  together. I found Joe Leaphorn seriously unlikely, and the other characters  bland and without taste. Even the scenario descriptions of Navajo country  were disappointing, because I know how beautiful it really is. And of  course, the editing was so atrocious I found myself wanting to grade it,  and I'm not even a teacher. I don't think there was much Mr. Hillerman  could have done to ameliorate his efforts, though, the whole idea behind  the plot was not interesting. In all fairness, I'm willing to concede that  if I was a fan of the series I may have gotten more out of this read.  However, I don't plan on buying the series or any of the books in it to  find out.	2000-05-19

This isn't a book I would race right out and buy, but it is an easy flowing story, and interesting enough to keep you turning pages. Dianne Robbins plays Super Mom, raising a hopelessly and terminal child, taking in  a foster child, working and being a single mom. The grandmother is kind of  cute, she lives with Dianne, and makes a few happy appearances. The love  story behind all this is a little strange. Dianne and Alan only had one  date, yet they seem to have always 'longed' for each other. Dianne married  Alan's brother, who left her pregnant when he found out the baby was  severely deformed. Luanne Rice tries to convince us that Dianne hates Alan  because of what his brother did, but it doesn't wash real well, and the  outcome is predictable. And throwing in the part where the deformed child   has her say kind of puts a fakeness on the whole story. I hated the ending,  I think you will too. I got the feeling that the author had to end it in a  hurry and used whatever means available to do so. But it's okay. If you are  bored and nothing else is around, you might like it.	2000-05-17

Peter Straub and the infamous Mr. King meld their respective talents as authors, and the finished product is a story of great depth, with many morals and many  endings and many beginnings. Jack/Jason's journeys and trials throughout  the story are infinitely interwoven. The narrative descriptions are  phenomenal, leaving the reader with a vivid mental image of the various  scenes. A battle between good and evil such as the world has never seen  before, and, hopefully never will, ends with not one, not two, but several  twists. I was dazzled by each chapter in a way, and each character came to  life with ease for me. Weaving the characters together in mind, I don't  think I will ever forget this book. I only wish I could write like that.	2000-05-15

Mary Manin Morrissey is tremendously gifted, and this is evident from chapter one throughout the book.  Somehow she reaches into the souls of those who have lost their way, had their faith shaken, or given up hope. I  would recommend this book to any lonely or forlorn individuals looking for  a light at the end of the tunnel.  Mary Manin Morrissey can show you the  way to that light, and she can also, with her magical words, help you  through what may seem like an endless struggle to reach your own field of  dreams.	2000-05-02

Filled with incredible facts, a great sense of humor, and a lot of interesting verbs, George Page does a super job of making the subject even more interesting than it is on it's  own.  Do animals think? Feel? Communicate?  The answers to these and other  fascinating questions can be found inside these pages. You will be amazed  at what you learn.  I think George Page knows his stuff, and I think his  years with the PBS Nature series has paid off in a fabulous display of  animal empathy, inquisitiveness, and knowledge.  After perusing this book,  you will never look at an animal in the same way, be it house pet, zoo  creature, or wild beast.  Take the time to explore each wonderful page, and  learn a lot about animal nature, and maybe even human nature.  I would read  this book again and again and again!	2000-04-26

It was hard to believe that Ms. Fisher was really attempting to pull this story off as believable. The beginning of the book was slow, and the pace did not improve much.  Dr. Slater was particularly annoying as  the  &quot;mad scientist&quot; character. Occasionally the characters were  confusing, and the story line zig zagged around too much.  The reader is  unsure if the main character's former alcoholism is the important feature  for awhile, or if he/she should focus on the criminal ongoings of the  hospital. Normally, this kind of bi-theme works, but Ms. Fisher played it  badly, and neither event would sell any tickets. I think I will stick with  Robin Cook from now on.	2000-04-16

The author does a nice job of keeping the story active, and the reader does keep turning the pages, but this book falls flat sometimes. A supposedly first rate detective investigates the DEA for homicide of a  scumbag.  The plot has some twists, but the twists never come full circle  really, and too late in the story a new curve appears that fizzles the  ending.  With the introduction of the whole Indian tribe deal, I think the  author may have blown what could have been a true grit kind of book.   Instead, I was left finding the book sort of predictable at that point, and  then a little ridiculous. The main character is noble, sincere, and  unrealistically honest for his field of work. The ex-team leader turned  suspect is formidable as well, and the courtroom drama is very good.  The  author's style is impressive, this is the first novel I have read by this  author, and I found the book easy to read and pleasantly cushioned with  understandability.  It took me about 4 days to read it, and I rate it  average.  You won't be wasting your money really, but it could be better  spent.	2000-04-10

I liked this book, and I would have given it five stars, except the ending kind of fizzled. The plot was suspenseful and kept me hooked from beginning until I was three quarters of the way through, and then it just sort of  faded. Ariel is quite the character, but the references to her weight are  never sewn up tightly. I truly expected her to be &quot;someone else&quot;.   The story leaves many details unexplained and offers a multitude of  conjecture that doesn't satisfy the reader at all. Some of the story was so  unlikely it was hard for me to absorb and accept as fact. Still, I kept  turning the pages, and spent a few extra hours in the evening reading, so  four stars is applicable.  The book left me not sure if I would read this  author again, so I give it a big Maybe.	2000-03-27

Put up your feet, throw a warm afghan around you, and brew some hot chocolate, because this is a book you will sit with for a while. It's delightfully entertaining.  The story flows quite magically, and the  characters are funny and important all at once. Vivi is an insane kind of  person, one who attaches herself to that little bit of insanity in all of  us.  She's fantastic in a very strong sort of way, and her daughter is off  balance enough to make us love her.  I enjoyed the sense of friendship and  loyalty the author was able to portray, while maintaining enough flow in  the story line to magnetically keep the reader involved. I gave this book 5  stars, there just seem to be so few books of this nature these days, ones  that you can sit with and enjoy and that stay with you awhile.	2000-02-23

A federal judge who finds a child in the woods, beaten and sexually abused, and DOESN'T involve the feds or even the cops? In fact, he  &quot;kidnaps&quot; the girl himself. A six year old child who is smarter  than an adult? Some of the responses this child made to questions or  situations that arose made me shake my head and wonder if Catherine Coulter  could possibly have any children of her own.  How about a mom who  singlehandedly rescues the child and confronts the &quot;kidnapper&quot;  all alone? How about a rock singer father who just happens to stop existing  as soon as the story needs him to? How about a maternal grandfather  who....I could go on and on, but it's not worth it.

I sensed no plot, the characters were weak at best, the story didn't flow evenly, and I got the feeling the author wrote it for something to do in his spare time. Most stories evoke feelings in  the reader, this one evoked only boredom. The author never even explained  who or what &quot;The Legacy&quot; was. From reading other reviews, I  gathered there is a TV show, but the author should have opened his mind to  those of us who are new to his series. Nothing concrete was explained, the  evil Mr. Hunter even seemed vague. And after attempting to build Mr. Hunter  into an ominous subject, he is melted with a dash of holy water.  Puhlease.... Not once was it mentioned how Mr. Hunter planned to carry on  what was his life's work and meaning after he slaughtered his comrades  either. Don't waste your time on this ugly manifestation of literature, it  speaks only to the weakest of minds. Evan's mother was a joke, what was  that &quot;fog&quot; she supposedly carried around? And WHO, if not Evan,  was speaking to her? If we got the TV show here in Saudi Arabia, I wouldn't  even bother to watch it after reading this book.	2000-02-11

Ms. Binchy is trying to show us the inevitability of lives that cross, trying to show how each and every encounter affects us in so many ways we will never know them all. Each story in this book leaves you wanting to say  &quot;So?&quot;, yet your heart knows the answer to that. The stories  aren't profound, nor are they even exciting in any way, yet they are more  real than our own perspectives on life. If the author is attempting to make  us stop a moment and look back on those insignificant small pieces of our  past, like the time we talked with that stranger on the airplane, or that  man we ran into in the bank who reminded us so much of Dad, or the lady  behind the counter at the 7-11 who knows how we like our coffee each day,  then these stories succeed in doing just that. Did those encounters help  shape who we are today? Maeve Binchy has done a superb job of magnifying  the impossible.	2000-02-07

This was a delightful novel, full of wonderment and surprise, as well as some predictability and some humor.  Every aspect of every character was developed entirely, until the reader had no choice but to recognize  him/herself. Along with the wonderfully colorful characters was a decidedly  historic adaptation of black vs. white, an interesting and profoundly  beautiful version of this never ending struggle between the races.  Scrambled into all this is a young boy trying to grow up. His name is Peter  Joseph, but they call him &quot;PeeJoe&quot;.  He tells the story as he  reminisces about his youth.  I felt I was there, I loved every moment.  I  will definitely revisit this author.	2000-02-07

This book has to be read slowly in order to absorb the full effect, but the end result is a totally beautiful account of Intimacy, with all of it's warts, imperfections, and  purity. I congratulate the author(s)for remaining true to task and offering  a factual, reality based assessment of this most personal state. I am  amazed at the genuine insight into the human psyche revealed in this book.  The pages speak to everyone, everywhere, and in such a manner that nothing  is lost. I suspect most of the information is stuff we already know, yet  this book brings that information to the conscious mind, revealing our  innermost thoughts and feelings. Absolutely superb!	2000-01-08

I understood the idea that in attempting to blow up a Sudanese sight, two B-2 pilots were captured, tortured, and a rescue was planned. I even understood the minute intricacies of the rescue  plan. But why was the character called &quot;Meredith&quot; never explained  or developed? What was his part in the whole thing? Were there two stories  going on? I think the author attempted to mix politics with  action/adventure and failed. Technicalities and legalese were mixed and  confusing as well. In all, it was a very difficult story to follow. Many  pages I read just because they were there, and I felt as though if I read  them over and over again I still wouldn't get it. If you are truly bored to  tears and there is no other book available, you might enjoy some of this  book. Otherwise, forget it. It sucks.	2000-01-03

There's not a whole lot of substance in this novel, yet it moves along, the plot is interesting, and the characters know-able. I had some difficulty stringing the characters together, and my mind wandered a bit  during less than interesting pages but it was enjoyable nonetheless.  Mr.  Pearson has an unusual way of forming sentences at times, and this tended  to throw me off balance as I had to read some sentences over again. All in  all, a good way to pass the time, but no bestseller here.	1999-11-17

I thought it was very well written and I had never heard of this author before. Claire Heller Chapman is an outstanding character, with  plenty of spunk and smarts, but we could have done without the irritating  little six year old daughter, I'm not sure what she had to do with it all.  Her character description and dialogues made me think the author was not  very familiar with children of that age group.  Overall, I think the child  should have been left out.  Also, my paperback version of this book was  missing pages 149 - pgs 180!  It's a brand new copy - but given to me by  someone as a gift, so I cannot return it.  The author did so well with the  writing and flow of the story though, I was able to keep on reading and not  feel like I missed too much.  Without those missed pages and the little  girl, I would have rated this book five stars.	1999-11-07

I think that some of us can love ourselves and lead very  fulfilling lives without permanent partners.

I loved the book, but I can't help but wonder, can it REALLY be that wholesome mentally to wander so much back into time? Opening up old wounds  may be beneficial to some, but to others, who wouldn't be reading the book  were it not for some difficulty emotionally, I think it could be downright  dangerous. I managed to dredge up some old pains, and I recognized the  connection between the old and the new, however, I believe that the book  would have led me to my conclusions without the trip down Memory Lane. If  you are reading this book because there is great pain in your life over the  loss of a love, I wouldn't recommend all the sad memory exercises without  the help of a professional therapist. Depending on the outcome of your  journey back into time, you could end up believing that you have suffered  nothing BUT pain all your life and it isn't any better now. A depressing  place to be, at best. Without the back in time excursions, the book is  beautiful. It touched my heart and spoke to my soul. The advice given is  heartfelt, sincere, and makes perfect sense. John Gray truly has a window  into the human psyche, and writes about it fluently and with great  expertise. I recommend this book only for the mentally stable, or with the  help of a trained professional.	1999-10-31

Author Iyanla Vanzant speaks mostly about the importance of &quot;living in the now&quot;, something we all know but are too busy to practice. She does a nice job too of comparing the Western style of &quot;Doing&quot; as opposed to the Eastern style of &quot;Being.&quot; Linking the two cultural  aspects could not have been an easy task, and I applaud Ms. Vanznant for  having the courage to reach into a women's soul, and to draw out the  ugliness that lives there. She is well informed as an author who knows  women's most intimate feelings. Men would do well to read this book as   well. She is able to consolidate religion, psychology, and psychotherapy  all in one book. It is truly an amazing story.	1999-10-12

This author is incredibly insightful and intelligent, and made this book easy to understand while remaining on a therapist-patient level. What an amazing view of the world  and the it's problems, as well as individual insights and patient's  stressors this author has. I came away with an entire new outlook on life,  and I hope and am going to put into practice as best I can what this author  recommends. There are no illusions here, no magic bullets, yet it seems  doable, and I for one am willing to try. It might be likened to the twelve  steps of alcoholism, but there are only seven steps, and a lot of soul  searching. I feel slightly empowered now, which is a huge lift from what I  was feeling when I picked up the book. I recommend this for anyone  &quot;down in the dumps&quot; or feeling overstressed. It's main  message  is to look within. You truly will be amazed at what you find.	1999-10-10

The last of the great series that has kept me enthralled for two months now. I have read eagerly like a sponge absorbing water, and I am sorry to see the series end for now. In this one, I did occasionally have a tough  time sorting out some of the characters, but other than that, I stuck to  the story line like glue, and prayed with the others when the  &quot;Jerusalem-Twosome&quot; prophecy came to pass. I am hoping as though  it were real that Chaim Rosenzwieg has a cross on his forehead before his  end, and I can even relate to Hattie Durham's need for revenge. Hell hath  no fury .... I wonder who indeed the assassin was in the end, but I have my  sights on Abdullah the pilot.

I found one of them a little dry, I think it was the second one, but since then am hooked again and am now reading &quot;Apollyon&quot;, which looks to be as interesting as the others. These  character developments are outstanding. The anti-Christ is sinister and  very frightening in a too nice kind of way, the worst kind of way. I'm  concerned over the recent pregnancies announced though, what will happen to  the children, who can only live to age five if at all? The books draw you  into issues such as this, they make you wonder about the characters and  situations during the day while at work, at home, it stays with you. To me,  this is a sign of excellent writing. I was told after &quot;Assassins&quot;  there won't be another until spring of 2000 and already I am obsessing over  that. Keep reading this series folks, you won't regret it. And God bless  the authors for finding a most unique way to allow people to inspect their  own faith.	1999-09-27

I loved the first book so much I couldn't wait for this one. Though it explains Revelations in ways I never could have understood otherwise, it is getting predictable and dry. The authors are doing a good job building the  characters, but Nicolae is just too predictable and insane. Surely the  population at large would know by now, or at least have an inkling who he  is. I'm now reading &quot;Nicolae&quot;, which is not a whole lot better,  but it is keeping my interest, kind of like a soap opera with one drama  after another.

A friend introduced me to this series, and I am awed. After reading &quot;Left Behind&quot;, the first book, I am already questioning my faith. The prose could be a bit deeper, but it's fluffiness makes it all that more  readable to the average reader. The characters are well developed, with  feelings and instincts that are totally understandable. Rarely has a book  made me reflect inward, this one certainly has. I've already started  &quot;Tribulation Force&quot; and I'm anxious to see where it leads me. I  haven't looked forward to a sequel so much since Stephen King's &quot;The  Green Mile.&quot; I recommend a quiet room, reading light, a cup of tea and  plenty of time - you'll want to keep turning the pages on this one.	1999-09-08

After reading this 1300+ page drama, I feel intimately connected with Lata, and Haresh, and Malati and Maan and all the wonderfully colorful characters brought to life in these pages. As if by magic, India became a  real place to me, and the customs and cultural voyages the author takes are  beautiful and very well written. Sometimes I could smell the paan, other  times I could feel the political hostilities in my veins. Vikram Seth's  occasional slippage into the homosexual realm can be easily forgiven, as he  doesn't paint the novel with it, merely taps the subject, jerking the  reader into an awareness of it's existence, and then leaving it. My life  became somewhat entwined with Seth's characters, I feel I know them now,  and I feel as though I always will. This novel is not a page turner,  stay-up-late kind of book. Rather, it is a friendly companion, able to take  you away at a moment's notice - but not too far away. Read it. You'll make  new friends.	1999-08-31

It took me months to buy this book, because I thought Snow Falling on Cedars was a little too soft for me, but then I saw this over and over on the bestseller list, and decided it must be good. Wrong!  What IS the author's point? I couldn't feel sorry for Ben, I think I would  have respected and liked him more if he had gone on with his plan. Ben is  not even developed to the point where one could identify with him, instead  he is written about as though he was never really supposed to exist anyway.  The beginning of the story holds a little, but begins to fade in the  middle, when Ben's exploits and adventures (if you can call them that) are  being described, and the ending is really stupid. I'm horrified that the  hardcover edition of this book costs $17.50! It isn't worth $2.00 at a  bargain basement. Still, I gave it two stars instead of zero because it  filled a few hours of my time, and anyone interested in a mindless trek  into nothing might just enjoy it.	1999-08-02

Each soldier, each individual grows in a way  we can all relate to, and each character finds a part of themselves they  were not aware existed. Despite the overwhelming number of characters the  author chose to develop, the reader has no problem at all identifying with  each one. This is no easy feat. I have read many war stories, and none  touched my heart and my interest so greatly as this one. Five stars and a  gold medal, thank you James Jones!	1999-08-02
US	52789100	R3NO4YD2T8JGQF	0451192249	280101697	The House	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A twisted bizarre tale of horror sprinkled with suspense.	It is as though the author took every weird dream he ever had and consolidated it into one huge story. Intensely sexual, almost disturbingly so, but Bentley Little does not take that aspect over the edge. Character  development was supreme. Despite the number of characters, the author  brought each one to life vividly and portrayed both their dark and light  sides. There is even a bit of romance, and a bit of sadness mixed in with  striking horror and outlandish scenarios. Hats off to Bentley Little, I  don't think even Stephen King could have pulled this one off. I would  recommend this book as a page turner and a definite dose of horror.	1999-07-24

It was lent to me by a friend, and I am HOOKED.  H. Jay Riker does a terrific job of telling it like it really was.  I felt as though I was in the  jungles of Vietnam right alongside these guys, and halfway through the  book, that's just where I wanted to be. The characters are well developed,  and the setting is described to perfection, so well in fact, that I almost  smelled &quot;nuoc mam&quot;!  Many thanks go out to this most terrific  author for taking me on a journey I won't ever regret.  I can't wait to  read the other 3!	1999-07-10

Not facts about the murder, there didn't seem to be enough of those, but facts about the personal and business lives of the various detectives, investigators, DAs, etc. WHO CARES? Readers buy this book to learn more  about the JonBenet Ramsey murder, not about the officials involved.  Were  it not for all these mundane trivialities, which kept me confused  throughout, the book would have been terrific.  I got the feeling the  author felt he had to fill some pages. Still, no one could read the book  and NOT form an opinion, and the facts of the murder were presented in a  clear, unbiased manner. It's totally obvious that the author is attempting  to remain unbiased, and that must have been difficult given the facts  presented. The Boulder Police are a joke, and the DA can't keep his own  facts straight.  This is a shame, because if it were not for these  unprofessional individuals, maybe JonBenet would have had her justice by  now. I tried to remain unbiased as well, and couldn't do it. Let the facts  speak for themselves. Would the murderer have replaced the pen he/she used  to write the ransom note back in the little cup by the telephone if he/she  were a stranger? If you woke up to find a ransom note and called 911, would  you then answer the door with all of your make-up on and fully dressed?   These are just a couple of the many questions the reader is left with at  the end of this story. My prayers and thoughts will now stay with JonBenet,  with the fervent wish that her killer(s) be brought to justice soon.	1999-07-03

I don't know if it was that the book was not well written, or just that the thoughts seemed disjointed, but I had a very difficult time following the ideas.  First of all, it is really hard to digest the fact that I may  be at fault for all of the issues I need to have difficult conversations  about.  This book would have us all believing that we should not only  always look at the other person's side, but often sacrifice our own views  and desires in the interest of making a difficult conversation easier.   Secondly, I am sure there must be a better approach than this. I had to  strongly disagree on many occasions with the author's recommendations  because when I applied them to my own life, I found myself having to make  excuses for wrongdoings that others did to me!  Definitely not for people  with low self-esteem!	1999-06-28

The coping strategies in this book are refreshing, and there are a lot of novel ideas that are truly helpful. Dr. Potter seems to know her stuff, and the book is informative as well as pleasant. I don't know that it will make  you stop worrying forever, but trying the various strategies for dealing  with worry and anxiety will be fun, and they certainly can't hurt.  I would  recommend this book for anyone who has a problem with excessive worrying,  or even for the occasional worrier who needs a lift.	1999-06-14

Who in the world could get past the technical jargon to enjoy the story? Was there a story?  Is Tom Clancy writing for the general  population of readers or only for the select few who can understand his  technical journeys?  I have suffered through three or four Clancy novels,  and this is absolutely the last I will put myself through. This one was  given to me by a coworker who could not get past the first 50 pages. We  threw it in the trash. Don't waste your money and don't even waste your  time on a trip to the library.  This book is totally BOOOOOORING, even for  the military action-minded. If I could have rated it zero stars, I would  have!	1999-06-07

Though Ernest Hemingway does a fine job of coordinating events for the reader, it is difficult to follow the conversations between characters.  At time surreal, some of the conversations plasticize the character, and some  are just completely incomprehensible.  Did people really ever talk that way  to each other? I found the book mediocre for the most part, and I was able  to follow along and keep up with the story, but couldn't get too excited  about it. The ending, however, almost managed to pull the entire story  together.  It was a fabulous ending, not predictable at all until the last  chapter or so.  &quot;Tenente's&quot; ability to deal with everything so  casually does seem a bit fantastic, but the ending saves this character  from a life of dullness. Overall, the book did not leave me wanting to read  any more of Mr. Hemingway's work.  I would only recommend it during a  reading slump, or when there is nothing else available.	1999-06-05

The inserts by the author himself, in his own words, add a wonderful touch to a completely true story that will shock and move you. I couldn't put the book down. It is an absorbing tale about a young boy  forced to suffer unbelievable knowledge of horrors and to live amidst these  horrors, all the while trying to grow up.  The author's description of the  hunger experienced by himself (he is the young boy the story is about) is  graphic and poignant.  I doubt I will ever be completely free of the memory  of this story. Many thanks to the author for a truly memorable experience -  I highly recommend this book, but not for the squeamish.	1999-06-01

The plot was mysterious enough to keep the reader guessing throughout, and the author did not give away a single secret. As the plot developed, so did the  tension and drama.  The characters were well rounded and believable, adding  to the distinct flavor of anticipation. It was difficult to put the book  down, and I was able to read it in just two days. I recommend this book to  anyone interested in a strong read, and willing to dedicate several hours  to a most interesting story. The ending is supreme!	1999-05-30

A friend lent me this book, and at first I didn't like it at all because of the use of British slang. After about the first two chapters, I didn't notice the slang anymore and I became engrossed in the story. This is a true story of the most incredible bravery I have ever heard of. I could not help but wonder what I would have done given the same situation, but I am certain I could not have persevered as well as the author and his friends. I recommend this book to readers of all genres, as it has a little bit of everything for everybody. A real page turner, hard to put down kind of novel.	1999-05-30

The author writes with supreme knowledge on the subject of fear, it's causes, it's origins, it's nature. Biologically and emotionally, he takes us step by step through this sordid emotion, leaving us with a better  understanding of our nature. Though a bit too technical at times for the  average reader, still an excellent study and an emotional journey through  our darkest side. I was anticipating a bit more advice on how to overcome  fears, however, and would have preferred more discussion in that area.  I  recommend this book for anyone interested in human emotion.	1999-05-19

His characters were lifelike enough to be believable, and with the background setting of Washington D.C, were able to spring from the pages, each chapter  more and more intriguing.  &quot;The Abduction&quot; is very well written  for the average reader, full of suspense, and taut with mystery. I did  figure out who the villain was earlier than the author wished it known, but  I enjoyed it just the same. The ending was a bit too quick, as though the  author had already tired of the story, and a lot of loose ends were left  dangling.  Still, a worthy book, well worth the money and good for some  nightly entertainment.	1999-05-11

I began reading this book thinking surely a Nobel Prize winner must be great, and ended up wondering if I'd missed something along the way. Though the general theme of the book became clear about midway, most of the fact  presentations were disjointed and unclear. When the author switches to a  little bit of what might be considered poetry, towards the end of the book,  the reader is tossed into confusion.  The author really should have  considered the fact that most readers are not MIND-readers and could not  possibly decipher the hidden meanings behind some of the passages. I  wouldn't recommend this book too highly to anyone, and as far as Oprah's  recommendations, I haven't yet found one worth it's salt.	1999-05-08

Stephen King has digressed and veered so far off of his original style that I was beginning to wonder if he would ever come back.  I am thrilled to say he's back, and  just as good, if not better, than ever.  His vivid descriptions of nine  year old Trisha's experiences in the woods are hair raising at best, and  the element of &quot;something out there&quot; adds flavor to an already  suspenseful twister.  This story needs no salt, Stephen King's flair for  the bizarre and his brilliant, innovative mind will capture the reader just  as in the King days of old.  DON'T MISS THIS ONE.	1999-04-28

Techno thrillers are definitely not my cup of tea, however, this one is written so well and so clearly, that I was hooked after the first chapter. Most techno thriller authors get so caught up in technical details that  they lose the average reader quickly.  Not so with Chris Stewart. He  captures the reader's attention from page one, and explains all the  normally boring technical details in such a way that I never got tired of  reading about them.  This book was given to me by a friend, and now I am  ready to buy more of this author's work.	1999-04-26

I don't normally read Danielle Steele because I find her novels sooooo sappy, but this one was a gift from a friend. I enjoyed the love story between Francoise and Sarah, and I liked the way their love eventually  affected the relationship between Francesca and Charlie. Danielle Steele  does a fine job of not going overboard with the romance stuff, and the  novel ends up believable and pleasant reading.  It isn't a  stay-up-all-night novel, but it's good reading for something to do.  I  thought the author carried off the ghost part well too, not making it too  fantastic but just enough to keep the reader intrigued.  All in all, a good  (not great) job by Danielle Steele.  Whoever found that photo of her on the  back cover needs to not give up their day job.	1998-11-08

First of all, no one would put up with Annette, the bumbling old fool of a woman who interferes with everyone's lives but then is portrayed  as a sweet, tolerable, darling. UGH! Secondly, the syrup drips heavily when  an extremely unlikely accident claims the lives of a pair of twins, and  when another little girl falls in a frozen lake, you can not only see the  ending clearly, everything from that point on is predictable and  ridiculous. I can't figure out what the point of the whole story is. I  began to feel bored when Annette's young friend condones her wishes to plan  a surprise get - together of enemies, and I nearly fell asleep trying to  keep this motley crew of characters straight.

Her character descriptions are lively and charming, the characters themselves are very vivid and alive throughout the book. Her  description of the effect of Tee's sordid affair with a younger woman, and  mostly the conflicting emotions that follow in it's aftermath, are  wonderful.  I found myself truly relating in it's entirety, and I plan on  reading more of the author's books. The underlying message I received, loud  and clear, was that a family is really just a group of joined hearts, and  can be found wherever there is love.	1998-11-05

Ms. Fielding writes like a real person, her characters  worm their way into your heart by the end of the first chapter. The plot  was interesting enough to keep me wanting to turn the pages, and exciting  enough to have me thinking about it when I wasn't reading it. I enjoyed her  descriptions of life with teenagers in the house,and I even fell in love  with her eccentric, almost-crazy sister.  Who can NOT relate to how she  feels when she almost has an affair?

We can all benefit and relate to the story of Mary Anne and David Parkin's  love, for we have all been there before.  In this final book in &quot;The  Christmas Box&quot; trilogy, we are taken once again into David Parkin's  world. The characters are ghostly and almost mystical in nature. The lost  child Andrea looms like a magical spectre over the story, while David and  Mary Anne must continue to face life after loss. This novel reminds us all  that we are far from perfect in dealing with tragedy, and it teaches us all  that life is the only statement we ever make.  I did find that David and  Mary Anne's obsession over their dead daughter was unhealthy at best, but  Richard Paul Evans does his writer's best in trying to illuminate their  struggle, and their eventual quasi-victory over their terrible loss. I was  left with the impression that these were very sad people, and I only wish  the author could have uplifted the story a bit more.  A beautiful story,  but depressing nonetheless.	1998-10-16

Before reading this book, I was fairly neutral  on the whole Bill Clinton thing.  After reading this book, no one can  remain neutral! Carefully and with great skill, Ann Coulter outlines for  the average reader the shocking crimes Bill Clinton has committed against  America. At times, it's tough to keep all the names straight, but what  matters is that the reader comes away with a straightforward account of  just who Bill Clinton really is, and it isn't good.  We learn that this  isn't &quot;just about sex&quot; at all, as the truths about the Clinton  administration and their outrageous slanders against the American people  slowly emerge.  From illegaly confiscating hundreds of FBI files to  allowing nuclear secrets to be passed to China, you will be justifiably  outraged at how the President of the United States has redefined that  office.	1998-10-12

First of all, Rosemary  awakens from a 27 year coma to find her son a world famous  &quot;leader&quot; of sorts, and when she confronts him with his past, he  gives her a two second explanation of how he has totally ignored his  Satanic upbringing and is now working for the good of mankind and she  readily accepts this. It gets worse from there. As the reader is swept  along in an entirely unreal environment, the atmosphere becomes more and  more predictable. Though Ira Levin offered a nice twist at the end, it  flopped miserably and reminded me very much of the Wizard of Oz.  The  characters in the story don't even behave as humans would given their  circumstances, and often the dialogue is disjointed and thoughts come out  of nowhere.  My best advice - if you must read this book, borrow it, don't  waste your money.	1998-10-12

A new perspective on why women with eating disorders, compulsions, obsessions, and self abuse disorders act out in self-harmful ways. In order to understand these women, it is necessary, says the author, to understand TRS, or Trauma Reenactment Syndrome.  All of the women in this book were subconsciously reenacting experienced trauma in childhood. Once made to comprehend that, the women were given a &quot;program&quot; of sorts to help them find their way out of the ever progressive syndrome of self abuse.  This book made me look at this syndrome with new eyes and a clearer understanding of the courage the women she writes about have. This book will provide assistance for the many women out there who live with the shame of their obsessions, and will provide hope for a brighter tomorrow.

Though at times very sad, the reader can relate to the inner struggle for affection that Alice undergoes, searching for a self that isn't judged by an outer appearance.  Alice is bare bones, just herself, and she doesn't like the shell of weight and skin to get in her way.  In searching for herself, she finds more than she bargained for.  I read this book in two days, and came away from it contemplative about the psychological basis behind anorexia.  Once the reader begins to understand Alice, an understanding of the triggers behind the disease is not far behind.	1998-07-07

I read this book in two days, and I don't like love stories!  This book touches deep inside the reader to a place that exists in all of us.  As our heroine, Caroline, awaits the return of her soldier husband, the reader waits too, feeling her pain and wishing with each page for him to come home.  This story tells about the kind of love that transcends time and lives on in the face of incredible adversity. It reminds us that hope really does have a place in a lover's heart.	1998-07-02
