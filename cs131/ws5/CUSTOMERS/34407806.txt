Yet he knew some important factor was missing. Improvement was slow. Recurrences happened too frequently.<br /><br />Midway in his forty years of practice, he became convinced that medical care must be supplemented by the spiritual laws in order to effect a complete change in his patient's emotional and inner nature. In case after case, once emotional strain and chronic resentment were brought out into the open, and dealt with through the application of the spiritual laws, the active disease subsided and remained quiescent for unusuall long periods of time.<br /><br />To effect the necessary release from harmful emotions, Dr. Swaim led his patients through two-way prayer to an understanding of God as a reality, not just a Power. He taught them, not just how to ask for what they wanted, but also how to listen to find out what God wanted and accept His wisdom and guidance. In order to help them, he made them pray out loud. The results were phenomenal, as the many case histories in this book attest.<br /><br />In this inspirng book Dr. Swain opens to thousands of arthritics and other sufferers, and to the doctors who treat them, a Power beyond medical science, wqhich offers physical relief, emotional stability, and spiritual enlightenment.  --from book's dustjacket	2005-10-14

Once more he proves that he is a superb spinner of tales. But in this book he chooses the metaphor of theater to illustrate the funny, the foolish, and the profound stuff of which our lives are made. Deftly, with the skill of the master writer that he is, he weaves together the relationship between the sometimes dramatic, sometimes silly, sometimes tragic occurences that take place behind the floodlights.<br /><br />What makes this book stand apart from his earlier ones is a strong autobiographical section which is revealing, sad, and sometimes outrageously funny. But this is not a \\"funny book.\\" As always with Shelly Kopp, this book instructs. After reading the provacative material in such chapters as \\"Pretend You're Not Pretending,\\" \\"Mis-Casting,\\" \\"The Good Guys,\\" \\"And the Bad Guys,\\" one of the instructions we receive is how to not take ourselves too seriously.  -- from book's dustjacket	2005-10-14

The Lesbian relationship between the mother J-wild, lost, beautiful - and competent Aunt V, a business woman, reveals itself to the reader as \\"the talking room\\" becomes the sounding board for endless fights, endless reconciliations. V's desperate search for the beloved J through the nights of waterfront bars is lightened by wildly comic excursions reminiscent of our great American humorists. With wit, poetic clarity and compassion, Marianne Hauser explores the paradoxes of our age - the need for love yet flight from love, search for self yet self-destruction - a dilemma shared alike by today's heterosexual and homosexual world. The author's multifaceted view defies dogma or simplification as her characters draw us into their turbulent and deeply human drama.  - from book's back cover	2005-10-13

As the same time, I no longer crave a hot fudge sundae over a mango. Would it be hard to turn down my favorite junk food, the chocolate brownie? I don't know because I don't live for brownies anymore. If one stumbled into my path, I know one thing for sure. Eat it or not, I move on with a life that has passion beyond food.<br /><br />That philosophy evolved over the last 30 years. I was never a size \\"large.\\" But like so many of us, I was ruled by food. And I have worked with scores of persons who weren't quite as lucky as me. Their cravings for food were inextricable from weight gain and constant dieting.<br /><br />It seems that our emotional make-up perpetuates a desperate search for that one diet that defies failure. My search has been a different one. As a biochemist and registered dietitian, I pondered the mystery of why the process of dieting is ineffective - in the long run. This investigative process has spanned decades, and the answer has been surprising. Quite simply: Life causes obesity. Food is the vehicle. You become the victim.<br /><br />In today's world it's nearly impossible not to overeat too often and sit around too much of the time. But that's not the whole story - it's just the most obvious scenario. You are the target of more than worldly food temptations, spectator sports, and internet searches. You are at the mercy of an ancient brain struggling in a very different world, where food allows a few minutes of serenity, peace, or a \\"bite\\" of joy.<br /><br />These are exciting, yet scary times. The exposure to worldwide news 24 hours a day unveils the alarming increase in obesity as well as the shocking rise in anxiety, depression, violent behavior, and suicide. Is this a warning that life needs mending?<br /><br />In 1998, the medical professional acclaimed tht health care providers should counsel overweight patients to stop gaining weight. But as a health professional. what do you say? Do you suggest another diet? Will we continue to work blindly on calorie intake and body fitness, while the brain wallows in what might be called an unfit status for today's world? How can we stop gaining weight in such a state?<br /><br />Until now. the success rate for weight management is limited to a pitiful 5%.

A thorough discussion of anaytical differential equations, differential equations analytic in a parameter, variation of parameters, integrals of differential equations, and analytic implicit functions is followed by a full analysis of the problem of elliptic motion, the sine-amplitude function, the classic problem of deviation of falling bodies, and the damped gyroscope. Successive integrations and numeric solution of differential equations are treated on an exact logical basis. Applications to problems arising in astronomy such as orbital problems are particularly rich and varied.<br /><br />In the remainder of the book, the author covers Cauchy-Lipschitz process, generalities on linear differential equations, linear differential equations with constant and periodic coefficients and their applications, and the complete treatment of an infinite universe by the application of infinite systems of differential equations in infinitely many variables. In every case the point of view assumed is that a complete analysis consists of; (1) definite  formulation; (2) proof of existence of a solution; (3) determination of the properties of the solution; (4) practical means of determining the solution. By applying this fourfold process throughout, the author develops a powerful and widely useful mathematical machinery of a high order of logical precision.<br /><br />Historical notes. 10 figures. 222 problems at chapter endings. 4 apendices of mathematical theorems.

This is the story of Squadron ONE ELEVEN.<br /><br />First established on 1 August 1943 as VB-111, the squadron would do battle with enemy submarines from bases in England and North Africa. Redesignated on 1 October 1944 as VPB-111, the squadron would search out and destroy the enemy on the islands of the western Pacific, on the Philippine Sea, the South China Sea and in their harbors and bastions on the coast of Asia.<br /><br />Upwards of two thousand men would serve in the squadron during these years - aviators, navigators, aircrewmen, staff and service personnel. Many of these men had proved their mettle with other squadrons, but most had been civilians just a short time before. They were young, many barely beyond their teens, and they came from a variety of backgrounds from every section of the country.<br /><br />There were never more than three hundred of them serving in the squadron at any given time or place, so those who struggled to fly their airplanes to  the squadron's first operational station at St. Eval near Newquay on the Cornish coast of England, were strangers to those who celebrated the war's end on the island of Palawan in the Philippines.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all who served share a comradeship which is born of the common experience of taking a PB4Y, Liberator or Privateer, against the enemy - a comradeship which is nutured by the pride of having served in the squadron whose achievements were so often cited as \\"in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Navla Service.\\"  - from book's introduction	2005-10-06

The \\" object\\" of this book is to provide the reader with ANSWERS to health concerns and improve the quality of the reader's life. Hopefully, these are the reasons you are reading Young Again.<br />Your author's approach to health and longetivity is total and BASIC! He does NOT believe in band aids or magic bullets. He wants readers to understand how loss of control of the body's terrain occurs and exactly whaat must be done to experience aging reversal.<br />It is not the author's intent to be absolute or overzealous. Few people will be able to comply 100% with all the suggestions contained in these pages. The reader is encouraged to advance in personal knowledge at his/her own pace. Do not feel doomed because you are unable to follow all the suggestions at once. Please realize, the material presented represents the BEST you can shoot for - the goal - the ideal!<br />The ideal world of health is a lifestyle that includes wholesome food, pure water, moderate exercise, adequate rest, low stress, a clean body and a strong mind. These things are worth striving for even though the perfect lifestyle is very difficult to \\"live\\" in a world where disease and human suffering are the norm.<br />Hopefully this book will help the reader find a middle ground where enjoyment of good health can be realized and perpetually maintained, consistent with one's circumstances.<br />We live in an imperfect world, and we fall short of the ideal. Sometimes we are subject to events and circumstances beyond our control. Yet, each day, we DO have the opportunity to make \\"choices\\" that effect our lives an health - and the lives of those arounsd us - for good and bad. We must strive to make the BEST choices we can each and every day of our lives.<br />The reader is reminded that health and disease are cumulated states of being, and the alternative to good health is a sorry existence indeed. Poor health cheats us of happiness and of \\"life.\\"<br />Aim high - and do the very best you can.

It is intended as a guide to the knowledgable as well as the novice. Considerable effort has been spent in reviewing certain basic concepts of renal function in an attempt to correlate abnormalities with specific clinical conditions.<br /><br />The urinalysis procedure is perhaps the single most important of all laboratory tests ordered by physicians for the diagnosis of their patients. It is exceedingly cost effective and often provides considerable information regarding the condition of the patient. For this reason, the urinoscopist must be able to accurately identify the elements present in the sediment, both normal and abnormal, and convey these findings to the clinician. To do this effectively and efficiently, the urinalyisis procedure must be standardized and the results obtained reproducable. Quality assurance procedures in the urinalysis laboratory should be commonplace - but, unfortunately, they are not. Perhaps this Primer will encourage its readers to institute strict quality control measures in their laboratories to help to assure the attending physician that the results obtained from a urinalysis are as accurate and reproducable as those obtained from any other section of the laboratory. In this way care of the patient will be improved by effective diagnosis and the ability to follow treatment and accurately predict prognosis.  - from book's preface	2005-10-02

It illustrates vividly through real-life examples, a method of emotional release work that can change your life. Author Pam Robinson found a way to emotional freedom by using this process, and so can you. Traveling this healing path opens the heart to release anger, grief and unforgiveness; it brings joy, peace and personal power one never dreamed possible.<br /><br />You will read what happened to Pam as she began to live again after years of emotional turmoil and depression. Her story is living proof that the power to reopen hearts after they have shut down can be as real for you as it was for her. Since she became a facilitator, Pam Robinson has traveled with thousands of people to their hearts using the process described in her book. Every heart has the capacity to heal, to forgive, to live to struggle on and never give up, and to turn even the worst events into blessings.<br /><br />This process combines knowledge and information from healing modalities that have been around for many years, including MRT (muscle response testing), guided imagery, NLP (nero-linguistic programming), speak out feelings, role play, inner child work, charka balancing, and visualization. When you put all this information together and use it collectively and affirmatively, old wounds can truly heal. Energy you have been using to suppress old emotions is freed up into energy you can use in present time.<br /><br />The human spirit often lies asleep within; however, by learning the structured technique in this book you can wake the sleeping giant and bring back to life the greatness of your soul. You will learn to awaken by traveling into your heart and releasing the negative emotions that may be keeping you bound. The powerful closure, unique to this process, will assist you in letting go of the pain. This closure will help move your mind and heart into a place of understanding and forgiveness, which brings wholeness and healing.  - from book's back coveroleness and healing.  - from book's back cover	2005-09-12

La Jolla is a lovely place but infested with gaudy grey geezers. The greeting among these creatures is \\"What did you do?\\" meaning back when one was alive, real world. The response \\"FBI\\" provokes a reply incorporating \\"interesting\\", the dreaded description often applied to one's heirs and artwork. Well it was interesting, fascinating. If it was all that interesting there should be material for a book. Wait, wait, come back There are tales to be told, who killed JFK, was J. Edgar a sissy boy? For some thirty years I was proudly and purposely a criminal case agent, meaning not one of those Washington weenies. A damned good agent, among the most decorated.

This carnivorous volume contains such a distressing story that consuming any of it's contents would be far more stomach-turning than even the most imbalanced meal. To avoid causing discomfort, it would be best if I didn't mention any of the unnerving ingredients of this story, particularly a confusing map, an ambidexterous person, an unruly crowd, a wooden plank, and Chabo the Wolf Baby. Sadly for me, my time is filled with researching and recording the displeasing and disenchanting lives of the Baudelaire orphans. But your time might be better filled with something more palatable, such as eating your vegetables, or feeding them to something else.
