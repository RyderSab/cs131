Indeed, anyone who thinks that archeology is just about digging in the dirt will be surprised -- pleasantly -- by \\"Aku-Aku.\\"     In this account of his 1955-56 expedition to Easter Island and other Polynesian islands, Heyerdahl presents a series of mysteries: Where did the great stone statues on Easter Island come from? Who made them? How did they move them? Where are the hidden caves of Easter Island and what secrets do they hold?    Heyerdahl is not a great writer, but he is usually good enough. His weakness lies in portraying people; even the most prominent character of the book -- Easter Island's mayor -- comes off as just a simplistic caricature. An odd quirk of the author is that he refers to some characters almost solely by their titles -- \\"the photographer,\\" \\"the skipper,\\" \\"the doctor.\\" After awhile you begin to wonder if these people have names.    But Heyerdahl is passionate about his work and his enthusiam shows as he presents -- and, mostly, solves -- mystery after mystery. He is relentless, for instance, in trying to get the natives to reveal their secret caves, even when it means he has to eat a chicken tail, strip to his underwear, and climb down a sheer cliff without a rope.       (The caves are a curious form of secure storage on this island that seems to lack locks. Note to self: Open self-storage franchise on Easter Island.)    A couple ethical issues occur to me, although I can't claim to have the whole picture from just one book. Did Heyerdahl adequately reward the islanders for the artifacts they gave him? He mentions some gifts but it's unclear whether all of them received something and how much. Also, he resorts to some trickery to get the natives to give him things -- is this fair? (I'm sure Heyerdahl would argue that he had to immerse himself in the natives' world of superstition and ghosts to communicate with them successfully.)    The bulk of the book is about Easter Island but the last two chapters discuss the expedition's visits to other islands. The story of the dig on Rapa Iti is particularly good, and I would have enjoyed a bit more on these other islands.	2005-07-25

Like the author's hike along the Appalachian Trail, it has its ups and downs. But Bill Bryson has such an easy and inviting writing style that you can't help but be carried along, chuckling, sympathizing, understanding.  This is the kind of book you might pick up and before you know it an hour has gone by.    <br /> <br />Bryson is witty, observant, and succinct. Unlike some outdoors writers who feel they have describe every leaf in the forest, Bryson shows that much can be told in short, colorful passages. When joined on the trail by his sometimes-hiking partner Stephen Katz, Bryson's narrative is at its best (we need more Katz!). Even in mundane settings, at cheap motels and muddy camping shelters, the author manages to have interesting encounters and describes them well.  Along with the pains and travails of his hike, Bryson mixes in some history and an occasional lesson in natural science.  He reminds us that much of what we take for granted is fragile, temporary and fleeting.    <br /> <br />He even manages to make the theory of continental drift entertaining: \\"The continents didn't just move in and out from each other in some kind of grand slow-motion square dance but spun in lazy circles, changed their orientation, went on cruises to the tropics and poles, made friends with smaller landmasses and brought them home.\\" <br /> <br />I do have some quibbles. Sometimes, Bryson goes off on an opinionated tangent (e.g., the National Park Service stinks) that doesn't fit in well. Also, some of the dialogue is just too perfectly funny; I have no doubt that he used plenty of literary license. Those are minor complaints, though. The book is a pleasure to read.	2005-06-08

Researchers who have been there point out the often unreported side of science in the wild: natives who threaten to kill you, poisonous snakes in inconvenient places, bureaucrats who block you from doing your work, bad food, animals that steal your food, animals that consider YOU food, and unreliable boats, cars and airplanes that have a habit of breaking down in the worst of situations. <br /> <br />And that's just some of the examples.  <br /> <br />While \\"I've Been Gone Far Too Long\\" offers 21 different stories from different authors, it manages to maintain a remarkably even level of quality. Each of the stories are pleasantly, but not spectacularly, engaging. Each offers some folly, misadventure or misunderstanding, but usually these are mild rather than outrageously wild.  There are plenty of chuckles, but few gut-busting laughs.  <br /> <br />In particular, I liked Dorothy Cheney's story of a researcher trying figure out the puzzling behavior of Kenya's Maasai tribesmen (who are themselves puzzled by the researcher) and Monique Borgerhoff Mulder's story of taking some tribal elders to find an ancient grave site in Tanzania. The only story that I thought fell flat was A. Magdalena Hurtado's stiff description of her work in the Paraguayan jungle. <br /> <br />To be fair, this book may paint a picture of scientific fieldwork that overemphasizes the problems. Some of the authors do stress that even amid the difficulties there are rewards. One character says: \\"Fieldwork is an adventure that is filled with anxiety and despair, the routine broken only occasionally by moments of sheer exhiliration.\\" <br /> <br />One final note: I'd suggest reading the Afterword by Nigel Barley first, or at least not waiting until the end.  It offers some observations that put the stories of the book in some context.	2005-05-25

So why isn't it an incredible, amazing book? <br /> <br />In November 1994, Peter DeLeo's plane, carrying him and two passengers, crashed deep California's Sierra Nevada range.  With a broken ankle, broken ribs and a broken shoulder, he hiked out through deep snow in 13 days, eating only bugs to survive. He didn't make it out in time for his two friends, Wave Hatch and Lloyd Matsumoto, to be rescued. Both died at the site of the crash. <br /> <br />Survival story fans can live vicariously through DeLeo's ordeal, testing themselves on whether they would make the right moves in order to survive. He offers careful detail about each step of his hike, helping the reader picture where he was and the decisions he had to make.  <br /> <br />DeLeo shows that he had to be smart to survive. He chose his route carefully to avoid going in circles. He learned to pick a good shelter (a rocky cave -- too cold; the hollowed out trunk of a tree -- good). He made sure to dry his clothes in the afternoon sun. I sometimes questioned his choices -- at one point he spent several hours climbing a tree to get a better  <br />view -- but the fact is, he made it out under almost impossible conditions, so he clearly did something right. <br /> <br />Still, questions nag at this book. For starters, the author often seems just too cool and analytical about his horrible ordeal. A normal person would be saying, \\"My broken bones are killing me! I've only eaten bugs for days and I'm starving! I'm wet and cold and just plain exhausted!\\" But DeLeo instead portrays himself as carefully analyzing the crust of the snow, the angle of the sun, the droppings of wild animals, and the color of his urine (many times). Is this the way he really is, or is this just the way he wants to portray himself? <br /> <br />Was it really necesary to show DeLeo's whole hiking route in the map in Chapter Three, thus giving away much of the story? <br /> <br />And why was it DeLeo and not Wave who walked out?  DeLeo describes Wave as having just a bruise on the forehead after the crash. DeLeo had 16 broken bones. Wouldn't it have made a lot more sense for Wave to have gone for help?   <br /> <br />I might have been able to let that one go if it hadn't been for the postings of some other reviewers on this site who pointed out that DeLeo left out some important details.   <br /> <br />For starters, DeLeo never mentions the important fact that the investigation by the National Traffic Safety Board found that the crash was his fault for flying too low in a box canyon.  <br /> <br />Second, while DeLeo mentions making a plan with Wave to use the emergency locator transmitter from the plane, he never mentions, even in the epilogue, that the ELT was found still in the plane, not turned on and lacking a required antenna.   <br /> <br />True, DeLeo doesn't *lie* about these things but he clearly dodges them -- because both make him look bad.  <br /> <br />Now, you might note that the book isn't really about the crash or the ELT, it's about DeLeo's survival ordeal. So, does his evasion on those two topics really matter to the rest of the book?  Yes, they do.  In this type of book, you're completely dependent on the author to recount events honestly -- there are no other witnesses. So you've got to trust the author to be giving you the straight story. Unfortunately these issues cast just enough doubt to make readers wonder: \\"How much of the truth am I getting?\\"   <br /> <br />	2005-04-27

While it's titled \\"Five Favorite Dr. Seuss Stories,\\" you actually get EIGHT stories.  That's because there's three extra ones (\\"The Zax,\\" \\"Too Many Daves,\\" and \\"What Was I Scared Of?\\") included with \\"The Sneetches and Other Stories.\\" <br /> <br />It's hard to say enough good things about this book. You have a collection of delightful stories, fun wordplay (\\"I'll go to the far-away mountains of Tobsk / Near the river of Nobsk, and I'll bring back an obsk\\"), nice life lessons (\\"A person's a person no matter how small\\"), and some of the most imaginative artwork anywhere. I enjoy these as much as my kids (ages 3 and a half, and 2).  <br /> <br />The only negative I can think of is that the book is rather large for a child to easily rest on his or her lap. If you're reading to your child, that's less of an issue. <br /> <br />If I HAD to pick, I'd say that \\"Sneetches\\" is our household's favorite story in this collection, followed by \\"Horton Hears a Who.\\" But occasionally we'll opt for one of the others. It's good to have a selection of stories, because kids' interests change and they can suddenly decide a different one is the one they want to hear all the time.  <br /> <br />Most of these stories are good for reading to your kids right from birth, because the rhyming play and colorful pictures are fun no matter the level of comprehension. The one exception is \\"Bartholomew and the Oobleck,\\" which is a bit more involved story that probably is best for ages five and up.	2004-11-16

Yes, says Heyerdahl.    \\"Your mother and father will be very grieved when they hear of your death,\\" says the official.    It was a reasonable assumption.  What Heyerdahl and his five Norwegian friends were proposing was beyond audacious -- it was foolhardy, by any standard.  Here were six young men, none with sailing experience, who were building their own Inca-style raft out of balsa logs and hemp ropes and planning to sail it across thousands of miles of ocean from Peru to the South Seas.     Surely, they would die.     Of course, they didn't.  For over 100 days, the Kon-Tiki bobbed along like a cork in high and low seas making slow but steady progress before eventually landing the men on an island in French Polynesia. In doing so, Heyerdahl, an anthropologist, had made his case that it was possible that the South Sea islands had been populated by immigrants floating on rafts from South America.     It was a remarkable accomplishment, and while it is a tale imperfectly told, \\"Kon-Tiki\\" is quite worth reading.    This is a book where the events carry the writing. For the most part, Heyerdahl does an able job of presenting the story, but he curiously skips over some parts.  For instance, he doesn't explain clearly why he allowed the voyage to begin by having the Kon-Tiki towed out of port and many miles out to sea. After all, wasn't the point of the expedition to show that the raft could make it all the way on its own?  (There may have been a good reason -- perhaps to avoid shipping traffic -- but he doesn't say what it is.)    Because the trip actually turned out to be easier than expected, the middle section becomes somewhat flat.  The crew had plenty of fish to eat, and collected rain water to drink.  They found ways to make the craft easyto steer.      Also, while Heyerdahl is detailed in his descriptions of the fish they saw while crossing the ocean, he fails to illuminate the personalities of his five crewmates.  Even by the end of the book, they remained indistiguishable in my mind.     These are weaknesses, yes, but hardly fatal ones, and the overall boldness of this adventure is what carries this book.  There are exciting moments -- when one of the men falls overboard and is nearly lost, and when the Kon-Tiki dramatically crashes into a reef at the end of its voyage. And the crew's short stay on an island inhabited by just 127 villagers is memorable for its idyllic picture of the South Seas lifestyle.	2004-07-16

Salinger's lively narrative makes &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; irresistably funny and fascinating, as well as troubling.   Salinger shows a terrific ear for dialogue -- not just spoken conversation, but also the fast-spinning thoughts of Holden Caulfield, the book's 16-year-old protagonist.<br />Caulfied is a teenager overflowing with negativity, sarcasm and cynicism. He seems to hate almost everything, including movies, actors, cheap luggage, guys who shake hands too hard, friends who yawn when asking for a favor, and people who say &quot;good luck.&quot;<br />It might seem that such relentless negativity would drag a book down, but Salinger offers just enough glimpses beneath Holden's bitter exterior for the reader to discover an endearing, but troubled, boy underneath. For example, he takes a curious interest in what happens to Central Park's ducks when winter comes.  Though this book was written in the 1940s, you can't help thinking -- in light of the Columbine shootings and other teen violence -- about how it can help us understand today's troubled youths.   <br />There are two things that keep me from giving this five stars.  First, despite all he experiences in the course of the story I'm not sure Holden changes much.  Sure, his sister and a teacher both challenge his attitudes in the latter part of the book, but he still hates the &quot;stupid questions&quot; everyone asks. Second, while Holden's comments and observations are so often funny and insightful, he sometimes seems far too wise for his years.  I know I wasn't this introspective and people-smart at age 16, nor do I know anyone who was.	2003-09-10

So if there is something spectacular in the remainder, I'm sorry, I missed it. But judging from what I read, I saw no reason to go on.<BR><br /><BR>&quot;On the Road&quot; is a rambling series of disjointed episodes as the protagonist, Sal, travels across the country by bus and by hitchhiking. While Sal keeps moving, the story has little  direction. <BR><br /><BR>The fragmented nature of the book could be forgiven if the individual parts were interesting, but few are. I did enjoy the image of Sal and other hitchhikers clinging to a flatbed truck as it speeds across the plains, but that's about it. Sal's conversations with fellow hitchhikers and motorists who give him rides are brief and inconsequential. His time with friends, drinking beer and whiskey and pursuing women, are mostly juvenile and pointless.<BR><br /><BR>Worst of all, Sal and the other central characters are only barely likeable, so the reader has little reason to care about them.<BR><br /><BR>I embarassingly admit that I read this book thinking that it was nonfiction. Only once I put it down did I see that it is fiction.  But this confounds me even more. When I believed it to be a true account, I could somewhat accept the uneven story -- after all, life is uneven. But now that I know this is fiction, I am puzzled: Why would Jack Kerouac include so many scenes and characters that offer so little to the reader?	2003-09-08
US	43631343	RALPQNYX1GPVY	0786711604	602853508	Hunted	Books	4	6	6	N	N	An amazing story -- perhaps TOO amazing?	This book leaves me with mixed emotions.<br />First off, it's an amazing story.  The last 60 pages, especially, are a gripping page-turner as author David Fletcher battles for his life against a grizzly bear.  (True, you might find the story dragging a bit midway through, but just hold on -- it gets better). .<br />Still, two issues put some shadows over this book. First, Fletcher was at least partly to blame for his troubles.  He ventured off on his climb of Alaska's Mt. Hess alone, by itself a risky move. Further, he had purposely avoided learning much about the climbing route beforehand so he could have a &quot;pure&quot; climbing experience.  And he seemed to have little awareness going in about the possibility of a bear encounter.  When you combine these elements with the natural perils of the Alaska wilderness you have a recipe for things going wrong. <br />Second, a voice in the back of my mind is saying that Fletcher's story is just TOO amazing to be true.  The escalating battles with the bear grow in intensity and build to a big climax -- just like in a movie.  I can't help but wonder if parts of this story are made up, or at least exaggerated.  The fact that he waited 22 years to put this story to paper also make you wonder about how much can be accurately remembered.  And where are the pictures?  There are no photos in the book and Fletcher makes no mention of a taking a camera.  But wouldn't you think that someone who had long planned this kind of trip would have brought one, if only to record the view from the summit?<br />It's impossible, really, to know if this is fact or fiction. Fletcher was alone, so we have to go by his word.  In his defense, I would point out that he includes a lot of odd details in the story -- random changes in the weather, quirky equipment problems, even litter in a glacier lake -- that you wouldn't think would just be made up. <br />I wish Fletcher had put in more personal background. The book gives no clue how old he was when he did this climb.  He gives no information about his family or loved ones. Those sort of details would have helped round out a fuller picture of him and why he was undertaking this adventure.<br />Readers should also be aware that while the bear encounters dominate the title and cover descriptions of this book, at least half of the book is about mountain climbing.  Climbers may enjoy these parts;  others may wish to skim through. <br />I want to believe this story is true.  Perhaps it's best to just suspend disbelief and go along for the thrill ride.  I just wish I could know for sure.	2003-08-02

These uncharted regions were in northern Alaska, and for Robert Marshall the chance to be the first to set foot in them was irresistable.    \\"Alaska Wilderness\\" is the surprisingly engaging story of Marshall's visits into the unknown reaches of the Alaska's Brooks Range.    On the face of it, this book doesn't seem to have a whole lot going for it. There are only a few moments of peril and drama, and just a sprinkling of humor.  Marshall's descriptions of the people he meets and travels with are fairly one-dimensional. Mostly, the book is a chronological account of Marshall's hikes and boat trips, with the author spending a lot of time describing in detail the mountains and landscape he discovers.  It seems like this should be dull.    But Marshall is such a likeable guy and his enthusiasm for nature is so genuine that you can't help but enjoy going along with him on his explorations.  Before long, the reader is just as eager as Marshall to find out what is over the next ridge or around the next bend. The book's good maps help the reader follow Marshall's travels.    Marshall valued exploration just for the sake of exploration and his plain-spoken opinions on the subject are refreshing.  For example:    \\"There is something glorious in traveling beyong the ends of the earth, in cutting loose from the bonds of world-wide civilization. Such life holds a joy and an exhilaration which most explorers today cannot understand, with their radios and aeroplanes which make the remotest corners of the world just a few days or even hours away in distance. Modern mechanical ingenuity has brought many good things to the world, but in the long list of high values which it has ruined, one of the greatest is the value of isolation.\\"    Or:    \\"As I see it, Peary's discovery of the North Pole, Amundsen's journey to the South Pole, Byrd's junketing in Antarctica, or theimpending ascent of Mount Everest do not make the road of humanity as a whole the least bit happier. In fact, one could argue, the net result of these activities is to make mankind a little poorer because when an exploration is made there is that much less possibility left in the world for others to experience the joy of exploration in hitherto unknown regions. The justification, if one is needed, for present-day exploration, therefore is almost exclusively the selfish one of giving oneself the exhiliration of that most glorious of all pastimes, setting foot where no  human being has ever trod before.\\"    We are lucky that one of the first men to explore the Brooks Range was such an able writer as Robert Marshall, and that he so honestly shares the experience with us.	2003-07-23

While the book is not quite as extraordinary as his ordeal, it's still pretty good. <br />Simpson takes the reader along practically step-by-step as he and partner Simon Yates make a difficult climb up the mountain Siula Grande. He falls and breaks his leg high on the mountain, takes a 100-foot fall while trying to descend, then crawls and hobbles for three days to camp after Yates leaves him for dead.  He openly shares his emotions and pain as he repeatedly faces what seem to be certain-death situations.<br />It's an often gripping story. Even though it's clear that Simpson ultimately survives (how else could he write the book?), I still read eagerly on to see exactly how he would do it.  A nice addition to the tale are some small portions written from the perspective of Yates. <br />That said, I do have a few issues with the book. First, even though it's only 172 pages, it's too long.  This really should be more of a long magazine article, rather than a short book. Most of the first third of the story -- the climb up to the summit, before Simpson breaks his leg -- is probably of interest only to serious climbers. Also, while it is nice to that Simpson shares his experience in so much detail, he overdoes it. As he struggles agonizingly toward camp, his descriptions of his pain, his doubts and his fear of death get repetitive -- I found myself skimming ahead to the next key event. <br />I was disappointed in the photos in the book, which are printed on plain stock, rather than glossy, paper. As a result, many of them are dark and murky.<br />Finally, the book comes to a strange and abrupt end.  The brief postscript is too short and rather cryptic, and doesn't include any information on what ultimately happens to the other figures in the book, Simon Yates and their campmate Richard.<br />Still, if you like adventure stories, you'll find a lot to likein this book.	2003-05-14

(Actually, it's not much better known today.)  But while her travels may have been pioneering, this account is surprisingly dull and mundane. Stark travels from village to village, briefly meeting the locals, eats a meal or two, then goes on the next day to repeat the process. There's rarely a spark of excitement or adventure -- just a dry recording of events and observations. <br />Stark's aloof writing style doesn't help. She seems to keep the reader at arm's length from the characters she meets, offering just a superficial look at most of them. <br />The first half of the book is further handicapped by a lack of maps. As Stark travels about, she casually rattles off the names of landmarks and places as if the reader were intimately acquainted with the area.  In fact, frustrated readers will soon discover that it is impossible to tell whether she is traveling east, west, north or south -- or just wandering in circles.  The second half of the book has three maps, which helps, although you'll need a magnifying glass to read one of them.<br />I don't want to make it sound like there is NOTHING interesting in this book.  There are a few moments of tense encounters, and occassionally she shows off a dry wit. But these are too few and far between.  I can only recommend this book to someone who has a scholarly interest in this region of Iran.	2003-04-30

I can't really recommend it for parents -- there's too much technical and scientific background and not enough specific insights.<br />Students or researchers interested in the infant brain from a scientific perspective might get more out of this book.<br />Unfortunately, the book is poorly organized -- the author seems to drift from one topic to the next with no clear sense of where he's going. But just when you're ready to give up, he'll offer a nice bit of information on the curiosities of how babies think.	2003-03-25

Not disappointed in the book, but rather disappointed by the fact that I knew how the Lewis and Clark expedition turned out. Had I not known, I thought, this book could be a tantalizing will-they-make-it adventure story.<br />But surprise: This is a great adventure story anyway. Lewis and Clark's expedition had to overcome so many obstacles that the reader, even knowing the ultimate outcome, can't help but be engaged.<br />I was struck by how often Lewis and Clark almost DIDN'T make it. Their boats nearly overturned, they were attacked by grizzly bears and Indians, they ventured onward despite near starvation, harsh weather, sickness, accidents and various wrong turns. Stephen Ambrose seems to include just right pieces of information to keep the drama going.<br />A tip to readers: Try not to peak ahead in the story by looking at the maps too early. You'll find more suspense in the tale if you're not totally sure where they're going.<br />The integrity of the book is enhanced by the thoroughness of Ambrose's research. He doesn't make up quotes or try to add artificial color -- he gives us only what can be supported in the historical record. Ambrose does adds important commentary at critical times, assessing Lewis's personality and providing historical perspective on the accomplishments of the expedition.<br />One nitpick: I wish Ambrose had done more to describe the physical characteristics of the areas where Lewis and Clark traveled. E.g.: Was it a pine forest? Open prairie? Thick brush? Too often I had to build that image on my own.<br />It's important to note that this is not just a story of the Lewis and Clark expedition, though that is the bulk of the book. This is a biography of Meriwether Lewis. The expedition section is the best part of the book, and it might be tempting to skip over the other parts.  But the beginning offers nice background details about Lewis, describes his close relationship with Thomas Jefferson, and gives the reader a foundation for understanding the purpose and importance of the expedition. The ending describes Lewis faltering post-expedition life. This, unfortunately, can't help but be sad.nship with Thomas Jefferson, and gives the reader a foundation for understanding the purpose and importance of the expedition.

US	43631343	RQG4VKZ74M4WW	0553381350	678579754	The Right Stuff	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A great ride	Tom Wolfe's rollicking style (exclamation points!) can take a little getting used to, but once you settle in, you'll find that this is not just a fun-to-read book, but a well-written one too.<br />First, Wolfe clearly did his research, filling the story with details and facts which prove illuminating (I do wish he included dates more frequently; sometimes it's hard to tell when an event is taking place). His detailed descriptions of the flights of Alan Shepard, John Glenn and Chuck Yeager practically put you in the pilot's seat.<br />Second, he manages to capture the emotions and feelings of the time, showing the competitive nature that drove the astronauts, how their wives wanted respect, and how the public adored their new space heroes.<br />Finally, he ties it all together with some good philosophical insights. The Right Stuff! Single Warrior Combat!<br />My only lament about the book is that Tom Wolfe makes it look so easy. Too many writers since then have tried to imitate his style -- but without doing the fundamental research that makes a good story. The result can be tedious and superficial writing.	2002-12-11

She carefully pulls together pieces from diaries, old news accounts, and official records, and even throws in insights into human and camel physiology when necessary.<br />The story moves along with interesting characters and sometimes heartbreaking events.  Importantly, Murgatroyd grounds everything in historical research, giving her account valuable credibility.<br />If there's a weakness in this book it is only because the author does so well bringing the reader close to the events.  You want the book to go one further step and recreate the conversations among the explorers, but of course it cannot do that. <br />This is a great book for anyone interested in adventure or Australian history.	2002-10-30

For any serious student, anthropologist or researcher interested in the history of the Plains Indians, this is clearly an important book. Catlin offers detailed, first-hand descriptions of Indian culture and customs of the 1830s, preserving in text and pictures a way of life that would soon disappear.<br />For the more casual reader, &quot;Letters and Notes&quot; still offers much, but you will need to be more selective. Catlin, for example, provides meticulous descriptions of the Indians' clothing, jewelry, weapons, cooking instruments and other artifacts. The reader can get bogged down in these sections, so unless you have a particular interest in any of these things, it's best to skim past them.  <br />Skip ahead to the action. Find the sections where Catlin recounts events that he witnessed or directly participated in. Catlin's account of buffalo hunting, for example, is vivid and exciting. Some other parts are funny, such as the dog feast.<br />Above all, be sure to read the description of the Mandan religious ceremony. It's grotesque, to be sure, but you'll never forget it.	2002-07-30

By the middle, you'll find yourself engaged and trying to guess how it will all turn out. By the end, it became a gripping page turner that I could not put down.  <br />This is more than a sailing story; it's a story of people and personalities.  Nichols has thoroughly assembled all the pieces  but he's coy about not giving away the ending.  Indeed, there are some jolting surprises along the way.<br />The one quibble I have concerns the use of sailing terminology and I give Nichols half-credit on this.  Some authors of sailing books and articles bury the reader in so much yachting jargon that it can be incomprehensible to the average person.<BR>Nichols does slightly better. At some points, he stops the narrative to carefully explain sailing principles.  But at other times he's not as vigilant and the reader can get lost amid sailing phrases and terms. <br />Still, you can easily work you way through that, and follow the race as it develops. Even if you're not a sailor, you'll feel like you're along for this highly engaging ride.	2002-06-29

If you've thought at all about cycling coast-to-coast, you can live vicariously through the experiences of Bill and Dave. This book isn't deep, nor are the adventures particularly wild, but there are some nice vignettes and interesting observations about the people and places the authors encountered.	2002-05-11

In some ways, it seems like an old movie with, say, Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed in the starring roles. <br />While Osa Johnson does well describing their amazing trips, her weakness is in describing people. Many of the characters in this book come across only as caricatures -- the crusty sea captain, the gentlemanly british national living in Kenya, the faithful-but-slightly-comical African servant. This isn't a book where you get inside the heads of people.<br />Still the Johnsons had remarkable adventures, and since any one of the trips probably could have been a book in itself, you'll likely be left wishing for more details. Also, the book offers an interesting historical perspective on a period (not that long ago) when the world still had many mysterious places to be explored.	2002-04-20

Despite its age, this account is quite readable. The smaller segments describing Townsend's visits to Hawaii, Tahiti and Chile are also enjoyable.<br />Since this is a diary, it does have some flat spots (not every day can be an adventure), but mostly Townsend fills his descriptions with details and color that bring his encounters alive. You can sense Townsend maturing as the journey goes on. One suggestion to the editors: If a new edition is produced, it would be nice to include a map of Townsend's travels, because in some places it's hard to tell where he is.<br />A tip to the reader: Skip the introduction, since it's mostly just a summary of what you'll be reading. It does, however, contain a description of what happened to Townsend after the book, so go back and read that once you finish.	2002-02-26

I never had that can't-put-it-down feeling. Plus, there's only so many ways to describe a hike in the woods, and after awhile Peacock's bear quests begin to sound repetitive. <br />This may be a book that's better read in small bites, rather than one gulp. Read a chapter or two, then put it down for a month or so. When you're ready to be transported back to the woods, pick it up again.	2002-01-11

By the end, it fell into the can't-put-it-down category. I really liked the descriptions of life at the South Pole (the difficulties of living there were far beyond what I imagined), and became caught up in her battle over cancer.<br />There were a few things I might quibble about: Her relationship (or lack of relationship) with her ex-husband and children hangs mysteriously in the background without resolution. Clearly, there's more going on there than she explains. Also, in describing life at the station, she seems to overemphasize the parties. At times you wonder: Aren't these people there to do some work?<br />Still, it's a compelling story driven by colorful characters, day-to-day dramas, and the cancer and eventual rescue that you know is coming at the end.	2002-01-03
