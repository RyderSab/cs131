It is just SO weird. Of course I - and both my sons - had been introduced to Alice via Golden Books as so many children have been for so long. So there are recognitions all the way through. But the strangeness seems intensified because of that. Some of it is the dated language (looking glass instead of mirror), the dated social customs (like the telling of stories in poetry). But the humour is not of the 'ha ha' type, it is definitely of the peculiar type.<br /><br />Despite those reservations my son enjoyed the book, as he did 'Sylvie and Bruno' which we read earlier (even weirder and certainly less familiar - but it might be more inventive too).	2005-10-11

Dick	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Philip - I am alive, but perhaps you are too	At the start I wondered about this biography - how personal it is. It's like those documentaries of dinosaurs and alien worlds that are so realistic, so convincing - I have to keep reminding myself that they aren't real - they're just imaginative realisations. So it is with Mr Carrere's biography. Because I have devoured all of PKD's works - over and over again - he made SUCH an impression on me - I was concerned that I might have hated this psuedo biography.<br /><br />But, in fact I loved it. It is so much easier to read than the excerpts of the Exegesis that I have read. It struggles to make sense of those rambling thoughts of a man who, by all measures, was not an ordinary thinker. And the 'imagined' insights into PKD and the way his life developed have a validity generated from the fact that the novels and short stories (and I know these so well) are a source of these insights.<br /><br />What is especially pleasing about this biography is that it doesn't pretend to understand PKD's extraordinary beliefs and behaviour, neither does it gloss the man or try to turn him into a saint.<br /><br />Read Lawrence Sutin's biography - 'Divine Invasions' - for a less imaginative study of PKD's life (not to say unemotional - Sutin's biography drew more emotional response from me that did Carrere's), but add to it, by all means, with Mr Carrere's biography.<br /><br />Of course, there is absolutely no substitute to reading PKD's own writing. Don't think the movies are a substitute either although they are a wonderful indicator of respect for PKD - and I can't wait to see what they do with 'A Scanner Darkly'.<br /><br />recommendations:<br /><br />all the short stories of PKD<br /><br />all the novels of PKD (including the mainstream novels - not SF)<br /><br />'Divine Invasions - A Life of Philip K Dick' by Lawrence Sutin<br /><br />the movies 'Blade Runner', 'The Minority Report'	2005-10-10

So when I saw this short novel by Percy Shelley - her husband, but written before he had met her - I had to read it. I was also intrigued that the anti-hero of Percy's novel was named Matilda, a name Mary later used in one of her short novels ('Matilda', which may be  autobiographical). For much of this novel I rated it at a 2 - but the ending did lift the rating. As far as prose is concerned I believe Mary was a far better writer than the youthful Percy.<br />There is a puzzling relationship in this novel - that of the character whose name identifies this novel - Zastrozzi - and Matilda. But it concentrates on Matilda and her irrational passion for Verezzi - on and on it goes. Totally distracting me from the other issue. Shelley is entirely successful at this for me - obscuring the ending. But he was much less successful in sustaining the impetus of the novel, and keeping me interested.<br />It is a novel worth reading, although I see no relationship between Percy's Matilda and Mary's - could Mary have possibly seen herself so negatively if her Matilda is indeed autobiographical? Perhaps it is so - although it doesn't read that way to me - Mary's 'Matilda', that is. 'Zastrozzi' is also quite short, so it's not really a labour to read.<br /><br />other recommendations:<br />'Matilda' by Mary Shelley<br />'Caleb Williams' by William Godwin (Mary's father)	2005-09-08

Perhaps it will be useful to readers of 'Against the Grain' - and act as a vector to the other reviews of this novel under the alternative title.<br /><br />This is an extraordinarily self-indulgent work, a tirade by the author against all those sensual things that we enrich our lives with - food, wine, literature, religion, music, travel ..... And yet, in the end, the hero of the story, Des Esseintes, fails in his attempt to isolate himself and cocoon himself in all these things he treasures so much - he becomes ill and has to abandon the attempt. So why does this 'novel' work? It is a very strange one, but it is certainly a novel(ty), perhaps even a nova! Is it the fluidity of the writing (and the translation I read by Margaret Mauldon)? Is it the content that connects in so many ways, in so many directions? For me there was a special fascination although the basis for me as I had lived my life was totally different to Des Esseintes. His experience was a withdrawal from the world after extravagant and self-damaging, self-indulgence. For me, I had imagined doing exactly what Des Esseintes did (but my life turned in a different direction), but my basis had been one of rigorous but perhaps equally self-damaging, self-denial. Would the outcome have been different? I can only speculate but I suspect not. I think Huysmans is right on the money!	2005-08-17

Thus complains Rudin, apparently modelled after the Russian anarchist Bakunin whom Turgenev knew personally. Strangely my own reading of the two great Russian anarchists, Bakunin and Kropotkin, it was Bakunin who seemed to be the man of action, Kropotkin who was the great writer.<br /><br />I took this book with me on a short working trip to Tanzania, a place I had never been to before; knew little of. What greater contrast could there be than Turgenev's Russians and other East Europeans compared to the open, uncomplicated welcome of the Tanzanian people. Rarely have I felt so absorbed and integrated into another society, and so quickly. I enjoy Turgenev's writing and have been reading him for some time now. The struggles he documents - Rudin and Natalya, Insarov and Yelena - are, for me, however, very remote. (Of course, I do realise Tanzanians probably have levels of complexity in their lives that were completely obscure to me in my short visit.)<br /><br />Take Yelena in 'On the Eve' for example and her admirable love of the Bulgarian Insarov. She draws love from him just as he is trying to leave her, to withdraw from her, because he sees he is so unworthy - an entirely characteristic feeling expressed by many Turgenev characters. Yelena leaves everything behind for Insarov - family, friends, entirely satisfactory suitors, and, most of all, Russia itself. But what does she get? As if to justify Insarov's view (he is a revolutionary just like Rudin in the first of these two stories) Turgenev plunges Insarov into critical illness so that, when he and Yelena leave Yelena's homeland together - having confronted awful partings - Yelena is also leaving behind health and vitality. The price is too great! But, of course, we all do have to make decisions in our lives.<br /><br />I recommend these stories as well worth reading - they are very rich experiences. On the other hand I can't help but think 'Thank God for the Tanzanians!'<br /><br />other recommendations:<br /><br />'Virgin Soil' - Ivan Turgenev<br />'Fathers and Sons' - Ivan Turgenev<br />'Under Western Eyes' - Joseph Conrad<br />'Dark Star Safari' - Paul Theroux (for some travels in Tanzania)ers and Sons' - Ivan Turgenev  'Under Western Eyes' - Joseph Conrad  'Dark Star Safari' - Paul Theroux (for some travels in Tanzania)	2005-07-31

And yet, for all that, she has been totally dwarfed by her one famous novel - 'Frankenstein' - but even here it is not really Mary Shelley. The novel firstly became famous - not as Mary Shelley's story but as a theatrical adaptation.

I have just withdrawn my earlier review for this novel because Amazon does not like the same item to be reviewed by one reviewer more than once. But I have just reread this novel and the light of my life experience has exposed so much more in it. Philip Dick is my absolute favourite writer - ahead of such others as Ivan Turgenev, Joseph Conrad, WH Hudson, Anna Kavan, Mary Shelley.... Not only is it his mind-bending plot lines, his dead pan humour, his gruelling descriptions of disaster (almost minimalist but enormously effective) but also his research - philosophy, theology, psychology. When I read 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' he taught me all about empathy.<br /><br />This novel is about a psychopath - hidden until the very end, but impacting everywhere. There is a remedy for the disastrous personal collapses the psychopath triggers and how I wish I had just such a remedy for a colleague of mine! Not for me, but for her and all those who work and live around her. I suffered a recent bout of bullying in the workplace which alerted me to the fact that this bully might be something much worse and his impact in our community of workers may be much wider than just against me.<br /><br />By chance a television program alerted me to a book, just published, called 'Working with Monster' by John Clarke and published by Random House Australia. Reading Clarke's book - not only about the workplace psychopath but also about his or her victims - has shown me how well Philip Dick plotted these characteristics into his novel. There was, for me, another inexplicable link between my workplace candidate psychopath (I cannot diagnose it - I am not a professional in these matters) and 'Ubik' - so spooky as to suggest to me that there are messages for me in this - but from where?<br /><br />'Ubik'is a great novel, and its foundations are very sound. Read it and laugh at Joe Chip's fight with the autonomous doors and other devices, be fascinated at the wonderful pen picture of Wendy Wright, be horrified at Joe Chip's stagger up the stairs under the unsympathetic eyes of Pat Conley, follow the speculations of the characters in this thriller that takes you back from the future of 1990 (as it was imagined by Philip Dick in 1969) all the way back to 1939.<br /><br />My heading to this review is the question posed by so many psychopath's victims - and it is a quote from 'Ubik'.<br /><br />What did I write in the earlier review?<br /><br />*********************<br />After scanning some reviews of 'Ubik' I was appalled. There are people who believe Philip K Dick couldn't write, couldn't plot a story!!!! Now I don't claim to be a technical purist in these matters but I can certainly tell great writing when I read it. Here are two things to look out for in 'Ubik'. Firstly there is a character description of Wendy Wright that starts 'As always, when the opportunity arose, Joe took a long astute look at the girl whom, if he could have managed it, he would have had as his mistress, or even better, his wife.' and ends with '...... She had too much control over herself and outside reality for that.' And then there is the chilling collapse of Joe Chip at the start of Chapter 13, watched by an apparently unsympathetic Pat Conley.<br />I recommend those who have not yet experienced 'Ubik' to read it with an open mind and a preparedness to let the plot take you for a ride - whatever you do, don't try to make your 'solution' to the twists and turns as they unfold THE only possible resolution.

(p 48)<br />I had a vague knowledge of George Sand before I read Belinda Jack's biography of her. In learning more about Sand I grew to admire the determined individual that she was. But I never really felt any liking for her - unlike, say, what I feel for Emma Goldman or Mary Shelley. Sand's novel 'Indiana' did excite me despite some of its melodramatic aspects. 'Mauprat' on the other hand, wasn't to my liking much at all. 'The Devil's Pool', however, is such a short novel - a novella really - that I was willing to give it a try. And I am so glad I did.<br /><br />This is a simple pastoral novel, but Victoria Glendinning's Foreword mislead me. I thought I was about to enter the rural world of W H Hudson ('A Shepherd's Life' or 'Idle Days in Patagonia'), which was not a bad prospect for me as I enjoy Hudson's writing a lot. But Sand is different altogether - this rural environment is gripping and tinged with horror and despair.<br /><br />Here's another quote:<br />'..... everyone has a story (and everyone would be able to rouse interest in the novel of their own life, if they had really understood it.....)(p 15)<br /><br />Other recommended reading:<br />'George Sand': Belinda Jack<br />'Indiana':  George Sand<br />'Living my Life': Emma Goldman (she must have really understood it!)<br />'A Crystal Age': W H Hudson (for a different type of pastoral world, but just as challenging)	2005-06-13

For me they did seem to have less drive and purpose than 'Frankenstein' or 'Matilda' but the writing is vivid and atmospheric. They are, like all of Shelley's writing (that I have so far read), about loss and separation. Like Philip K Dick who apparently blamed himself for the death of his twin sister when he was just two days old, Mary blamed herself for the death of her mother days after she was born. That people can carry such unfair burdens that they place upon themselves is tragic, that they can rise above them to produce great works of art that we can all benefit from is miraculous for me.<br /><br />Other recommendations:<br /><br />'Matilda' by Mary Shelley<br /><br />'Caleb Williams' By William Godwin (Mary's father)<br /><br />any of the fantasy writings by E T A Hoffmann	2005-06-05

My heading for this review is a quote from this engaging novel. In some ways I now understand that indeed the greater truth may exist in the things that haven't happened, where the actions of people are imposed upon by their personal constraints - often to the detriment of all. But what a sentence for the writer to produce!!<br /><br />This novel is told from the perspective of three people - Nikhil, his wife Bimala, and the activist (in the name of national India) Sandip. By hearing the story from each of them we understand their individual constraints and the drives they have, or lack, to realise their ambitions and desires.  Rabindranath Tagore has not written this novel from the perspective of an all-seeing observer and this leads us - the readers - to be deeply entrenched in the individual characters' drives, passions, doubts, uncertainities and failures.<br /><br />For me this is a very personal expose of my own drives, passions, doubts and failures. If only I could have the views of those around me similarly exposed - if I had some indication of their drives, passions, doubts and sense of failure I am sure that I could respond to them with greater confidence. But, of course, Nikhil, Bimala and Sandip do not have knowlege of each other's innermost thoughts (unlike we, the readers) so their struggle - all three of them - is just as difficult for them as mine is for me.<br /><br />Did I end up liking any of these characters? Did I admire any of them? Was I appalled by any of them? These are questions I will not answer - read the book for yourself and you will develop your own views which may be as different for you as my constraints are as different from yours.<br /><br />Here is another quote:<br /><br />'What harm if you did have a wholesome fear of me?

(Turgenev said that 'everything depends on them'.) They can grab our attention in surprising and commanding ways. We can see them as imposing themselves on us, as being alien to us, as being something we have to rationalise away. We don't design to have feelings - although some feelings are immensely pleasurable. So why do we have these extensions of simple sensory awareness?<br /><br />In this book we learn that the feelings - or emotional responses - are things that we should honour in ourselves. These are immediate responses to our environment and they way it affects our view of how we sustain ourselves in the face of challenges. When we face a problem we can be rational about it - look at options, look at strengths and weaknesses, look at possible outcomes to different courses of action. But at the outset we will have an emotional response that tells us what our immediate assessment is. This emotional response is as important as any other form of evaluation.<br /><br />Nussbaum uses emotionally evocative materials to demonstrate her points of view - music, literature and poetry. This is very effective and avoids losing the drive of her thesis in philosophy, psychology, psychoanalysis and the like. I was not convinced in this when she talked of Mahler's music, but her discussion of Mahler's use of words was very revealing to me.<br /><br />There is philosophy in this book - lots of it. And, for me, that was far more to my liking that large anmounts of psychology might have been. I was fascinated by the discussion on compassion - is it real or an invention? For me it is real, but following the arguments philosophers and schools of philosophy have made was very instructive. I was perhaps less convinced about the ascent of love. Maybe this was psychology interfering. For me sex and love have to be separated. This is difficult because sexual activity is generally associated with the trust that genuine love creates. But, of course, this is not a necessary outcome. Most of the people we love we do not have sexual activity with. Don't even want to have sexual activity with. So to embed the ascent of love with sex does seem to me to be making two distinct matters unnecessarily entwined and probably to the detriment of the understanding of both.<br /><br />It took quite a while for me to read this book.

This was just a coincidence to me as Hudson is one of my favourite authors.<br /><br />I partially enjoyed the novel for its open easy-to-read style, but there was too much drinking in it for me (written in prohibition years?), and bull-fighting is not at all to my liking. I'm also not that comfortable with women who - despite regret later on - realise they have treated some men of their acquaintance particularly badly. But the mystery of what happened to Jake (ever so 'funny' but causing him to cry himself to sleep) and why it keeps he and Brett apart is so tantalising. The coincidental reflection in the clinging of Robert Cohn to Brett adds significant pathos.<br /><br />And now I read the novel again and there is another author mentioned midway through - a name that meant nothing to me on my first reading - Ivan Turgenev. This is getting to be too much of a coincidence!! Anyone who has read my reviews of the last year will have noticed that I have recently 'discovered' Turgenev and was very moved by the four novels that I read in fairly quick succession. And in Turgenev - but structured completely differently (Russian eyes compared to Western eyes?) - we find this same separation of men and women who perhaps never should have been separated.<br /><br />Now there is another book I simply must read - it will be my second Hemingway novel.

Not from the novel initially but from the film starring Mary Pickford (and for the dismissive reviewer comparing Pollyanna to Rebecca and Anne - it's maybe worth noting that Mary Pickford acted in all three stories - I wonder what her view was?). The movie appears to have had great influence in my life - it must have reached me at such a vulnerable moment. Looking back I have no doubt that I have always played the 'glad' game - although I didn't call it that. Did I already have a predisposition for that? Who can say. My life is also littered with so many Annas - Annes, Roseannes, Dianas, Mariannas, Annas ......<br /><br />Of course all this is about me. When I decided to read the book as a bedtime story to my boys I was dealing with other people's reactions. Perhaps they would find it unengaging, perhaps it would be too dated for them (especially the preachy parts), perhaps they would not be able to identify with the little girl or the different social customs of the days of the novel. But it just wasn't so. They were interested in the novel. Each night when we left off reading they would speculate on what would come next, what we could intimate from the next chapter title. Whether they will take up playing the glad game themselves I couldn't say. Perhaps my reading will be less impressive than Mary Pickford's acting!<br /><br />Pollyanna was named after her mother(Jenny)'s two sisters Polly and Anna.

Including: 'the mind ... had impressed her as alien ... clearer than hers, sharper, without that capacity for protective self-sympathy which shrouds and guards the Western brain against the impact of undesirable truth.' I was also unsure about the resolution of the drama -was it in fact resolved at all?<br /><br />Felix Forrest (better known later as the science fiction writer Corwainer Smith)took on the challenge of writing from the perspective of a woman - and he does it well. Or so it seems to me - another male.  Most of the novel is a recollection of Ria when she was fifteen years old - and I think the author reconstructs the thinking of the young woman convincingly.<br /><br />There are many cross cultural characters in this novel and they add considerably to it.

And there was no shortage of fascinating books about dinosaurs to develop my interest. But for me the most ingruiging aspect of dinosaurs is not their end - what caused their extinction - but why, whatever it was, didn't cause other species to disappear. Crocodiles and turtles, some small furry mammals, these survived. But not one dinosaur (excluding the possibility of radical evolution to birds, as some have suggested) - not the big fierce predators, not the small fast scavengers, not the slow-moving armoured hulks, not the vegetarian giants, not the flying dinosaurs, not the sea-going dinosaurs (Nessie excluded!) managed to survive. There must be something to learn about the extinction event from the SURVIVORS - they must have had some feature that distinguished them from the dinosaurs and allowed their survival.<br /><br />So, when I saw 'Trilobites!' I was immediately interested. Here was another far-reaching, long-lived, diversified species that is as extinct as the dinosaurs. Perhaps here there would be some clues by looking at what made the trilobites - all of them - extinct.<br /><br />When I started reading I was surprised to be clambering along a Welsh cliff top with Thomas Hardy quoted at me. Later on in the book I am in a much more familiar territory - an Australian outback pub, experiencing the discomfort of being assailed by those who have had just one or two drinks too many. This all seems far from trilobites. And yet, for me there was something of a relief in it too, because I was spooked by these strange ocean-going creatures. They looked too much like spiders or other unloved creepy-crawlies!! Just looking at the fossil illustrations gave me the heebie-jeebies.<br /><br />But there was so much more in this book than the description of the types of trilobite, the geography of them (cephalon, thorax, pygidium), the exploration of how we (the Human Race) have got to know them. In this book you will learn about the role of Museums in scientific discovery, the naming of species, the shaping of the planet over geologic (almost astronomical) time. But the book is a vehicle for a much stronger message.<br /><br />On page 207 E O Wilson's idea of consilience is introduced - consilience is the unification of knowledge.

'Equality is the great thing, equality is everything.'<br /><br />Extravagant? Yes it is! But what a wonderful type of extravagance. This is a fantasy novel like no other. I first read this novel many, many years ago and shared it with some of my special friends. And then, when I got married, I so loved reading it to my wife. Since then I have seen the television series ('Gormenghast' - based on this novel and its sequel). Now I picked the book up again and it's as enthralling, fascinating, captivating as ever.<br /><br />Many novels introduce us to one or two memorable characters and detail their interaction - the tensions and the bonding. But in 'Titus Groan' Mervyn Peake creates a whole galaxy of characters - all extravagant and extreme - and then constrains them in such a tight environment. You could compare Gormenghast to another isolated society; that described in W H Hudson's 'A Crystal Age', but these worlds are very different. The interactions are thus intensified. For all their extremeness I wondered if Gormenghast and the people living there were no more than an analogy of a family - a group of people that allows itself controlled intimacies that it does not offer to the wider world.<br /><br />'Titus Groan' separates itself from that other great fantasy world of 'Lord of the Rings' by its constrained boundaries. This is not a travel story ranging across wide horizons. It is a travel story of the human mind. It has horror, it has madness, it has dedication, and above all it has the most extraordinary vision and humour. There are four great scenes not to be missed - the burning of the library, Titus's first Birthday, the battle between Flay and Swelter, and the earling.<br /><br />Other recommendations:<br /><br />'Gormenghast' by Mervyn Peake<br /><br />'Titus Alone' by Mervyn Peake<br /><br />'Peake's Progress' which contains plays, short stories, drawings and wonderful poems all by Mervyn Peake<br /><br />'A Crystal Age' by W H Hudson<br /><br />'Lord of the Rings' J R R Tolkeinerful poems all by Mervyn Peake <br />'A Crystal Age' by W H Hudson <br />'Lord of the Rings' J R R Tolkein <br />	2005-02-28

My title is actually an excerpt from a longer quote: 'naked people are strong, weak people make jokes, say nothing and you have secrets'.<br /><br />All four stories are about youth and age. About the foolish confidence of youth before social constraints come into play, and about the frail vulnerability of the aged - yes, they too can - and do - make mistakes. For me, the title story of this book was far too ugly for me to really enjoy. For a while I liked 'An African Story' best. But there appear to be jokes - things that made me laugh - does that make Mr Theroux weak? - or was he trying to make the lead character appear weak? The sad thing about the mistakes of the aged - shown several times in these stories - is that often they do not have the time to throw their arms in the air and say 'How Fascinating!' as Benjamin Zander would recommend (the fascination being the opportunity to learn).<br /><br />These stories are exotic and often erotic - although I would certainly avoid making any recommendation based on the erotic aspect of the stories. Repeatedly I found the sadness of the uncertainty of youth - the desires and dreams that probably will never be fulfilled, the acceptance of constraints - and the sadness of aging which occurs with such regret - why can the adventures of youth not continue?<br /><br />Here's another quote - this time from 'An African Story' - 'People who read are not happy or else why would they be alone in a room with a book in their hands?'<br /><br />Other recommendations:<br /><br />Milroy the Magician - Paul Theroux<br />any of Mr Theroux's travel books (such as 'Riding the Iron Rooster')<br />The Art of Possibility - Benjamin Zander	2005-01-26

I refer to the Penguin edition of this book with an introduction and notes by Jeri Johnson.<br /><br />This is not my favourite Virginia Woolf novel. It is too shapeless for me - perhaps that's what Virginia Woolf was trying to demonstrate - that life is shapeless in its continuation from generation to generation. But to show any meaningful drift to sameness and change I believe we need a much greater perspective than we get from the Pargiters. And when there isn't much direction, much sense of approaching a climax, then, for me anyway, all Virginia Woolf's fine detail and acute observation becomes a tedious reiteration of the ennui of life which I prefer to avoid in literature rather than be reminded of over and over again.<br /><br />The notes to this novel are quite comprehensive but I was uncommonly annoyed at one point. There is a novel by Philip Dick that I remember reading in which the author explains the correct pronunciation of the main character's name half-way through the novel. Murphy's Law almost guaranteed that I had selected the incorrect pronunciation and had to resound the character's name from that point on. This was a bit annoying. But not half as annoying as when Virginia Woolf tells us that the character North - again half way through the novel - was having his name pronounced incorrectly as if it were a point of the compass. This, of course, is exactly how I pronounced it in my mind. But what other way is there? Neither Virgina Woolf nor Jeri Johnson tell me. I am still mystified.<br /><br />And perhaps this is the nub of my disenchantment with this novel. Perceptive as the writing might be, I feel an alien in this company, out of my depth amongst a batch of people who know the proper way to pronounce North.	2005-01-19

It follows the reading of three other Turgenev novels - from which you can guess I like this author a lot. In the three earlier novels ('Fathers and Sons', 'Spring Torrents' and 'Virgin Soil') there is one constant theme - men rejecting women - not because they see the women as inadequate, but because they see themselves as unworthy. In this novel it is the woman who does the rejecting - and the person she rejects is herself - instead of withdrawal we now face self-sacrifice. But why did she see herself as so inadequate when she lined up the group of suitors any one of whom would have accepted her much to the envy of all the others? And her self-sacrifice - why is it to the person to whom it is made? Without any regard to the effects on others - they too are all sacrificed.<br /><br />If you enjoy the company of women as I do, perhaps you will be repelled by lines such as 'fear the love of women; fear that bliss, that poison....' On the other hand this novel - despite it troubled ending - is wonderfully readable and it gave me a lot to reflect on.	2005-01-10

Dick	Books	4	15	17	N	N	forget about the movies	The short stories of Philip Dick perhaps do not reach the levels that the best of his novels do. However they are just as inventive, just as challenging, just as stimulating. For those readers who claim his characterisation is poor, and his descriptions are insufficiently well formed I suggest you let your own mind fill in the details - it is not necessary to have every detail spelled out by the author. In fact, I find it a far graver insult to go the other way and describe, describe, describe - as Henry James sometimes does.<br /><br />As an example of writing that approaches genius there is a description of the aftermath of a nuclear explosion - 'The World Jones Made'? - in which he doesn't say of the character who climbs out of the basement that has protected him 'he could hear in the far distance a car horn blaring continuously in the uncanny stillness'. What he does say is that everything is quiet and suddenly a car horn sounds (there are other living people?), far in the distance (are they reachable?), continuously (and we see in our mind someone slumped dead over the steering wheel). Of course the bracketed comments are mine - but what a journey we are so quickly taken on - hope, doubt, despair. All without the author 'explaining' anything. Compare that to the bland alternative description and you can see that this man is using writing in a very evocative way.<br /><br />When you sit down with these stories, please forget the movies - even the good ones - let your mind go on its own adventure!	2005-01-10

I have been reading Cordwainer Smith stories over and over for many, many years. There aren't that many of them - but they are so wonderful they can be read and read and read again. And they never lose their freshness for me. I read 'The Game of Rat and Dragon' to my wife one night when she was having trouble getting to sleep. Perhaps it's not his greatest story, but it is so humane, so all-encompassing of the best of humankind and so wonderful to the animals that we share this world with - specifically cats in this case (and for anyone who has been fortunate enough to share at least part of their lives with cats it will probably raise so many memories).<br /><br />So I took down my favourite anthology - the 1970 Panther Books edition published under the title 'Under Old Earth' and started to refresh the Cordwainer Smith experience. As I read the wonderful 'A Planet Named Shayol' (there is nothing like this anywhere!) the tears rose in my eyes again. This involuntary response told me so much!!! Here's a quote:<br /><br />'It's unfair,' cried the half-man. 'They should be punished as we were!'<br />The Lady Johanna Gnade looked down at him. 'Punishment is ended. We will give you anything you wish, but not the pain of another.'<br /><br />What a vision! The only comparable one I can think of is the words Gustav Mahler wrote about the day of judgement scene in his second symphony. After the trumpets sound and the dead are raised Mahler reasoned that there would be neither reward nor punishment - only God's heavenly love would remain.<br /><br />I cannot compromise the five star average rating for these stories. I agree with one and all! If you haven't read these stories you have a wonderful experience in store. If you, like me, know them already  - just enjoy again and again as I do.	2004-11-28

How can this be so? Mary Shelley creates a scenario - so similar to aspects of her own childhood - that makes sense of this. The love expressed in this ever-so-ambiguous word is, in this case, the inappropriate form of love. What disappoints me about this is that no-one recovers from this situation, and others continue to be damaged/hurt. Once again, as I've seen in so many other works of fiction, the 'damaged' person is given no chance of recovery, of rising above the disaster.<br /><br />Mary Shelley is such an interesting person (far more interesting than the popular interpretations of her novel Frankenstein suggest) but to appreciate her, even in part, I believe you need to consider her parents. Her father was William Godwin, perhaps the real originator of anarchism (although I don't think he used that word). He was a firm believer that people acting alone can achieve more and better than is achieved by having them controlled and imposed on by laws and governments. Mary's mother was Mary Wollstonecraft - a champion of equal rights for women. When Mary became pregnant, Mary and William chose to get married - not for themselves - they didn't believe in the institution of marriage - but for the child. Sadly Mary Wollstonecraft died in childbirth and William was left with a new baby (whom he named Mary after her mother) and a slightly older girl, Fanny.  All of William's beliefs that people should live their own lives in their own preferred ways was challenged by Mary - especially in her relationship with the poet Percy Bysse Shelley whom she married (hence the name Mary Shelley).<br /><br />When Mary lost her own baby boy William (named after her father?), she got some of her grief out by writing Matilda. But it appalled William and he refused to allow it to be printed. Even the strongest philosophies will fall apart!! But if you read Matilda and recall the facts of William and Mary's lives, you will see why.<br /><br />This is a valuable book, containing not only Mary's short novel Matilda, but also two works of her mother.<br /><br />Recommended other reading:<br /><br />Frankenstein - Mary Shelley (this is a thoughtful and serious work)<br /><br />Enquiry Concerning Political Justice - William Godwin (this is very long but is also very thoughtful and a great lead in to reading more accessible anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin, as well as less accessible ones like Max Stirner)<br /><br />Caleb Williams - William GodwinWilliam and Mary's lives, you will see why. <br /> <br />This is a valuable book, containing not only Mary's short novel Matilda, but also two works of her mother. <br /> <br />Recommended other reading: <br />Frankenstein - Mary Shelley (this is a thoughtful and serious work) <br />Enquiry Concerning Political Justice - William Godwin (this is very long but is also very thoughtful and a great lead in to reading more accessible anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin, as well as less accessible ones like Max Stirner) <br />Caleb Williams - William Godwin   <br />	2004-11-22

The ending with its multiple perspectives - those on the boat, and those on the shore - is wonderful, and with just the right mix of the visionary. It's almost a ghost story, but nothing like any other ghost story I've read.<br /><br />No matter where I picked the book up, and took up reading again, I was fascinated. I could feel the holiday the characters were experiencing as if I was there at the seaside even though I have only had one short holiday in Britain. But, then, I suspect that family life and the desultory holiday experience was very similar here in Australia. I don't really mean desultory, but the routine holiday venue with its hours of no-work, no-school often had a strange feeling of tedium mixed with the 'excitement' of something different from routine. Unfortunately, reading this book also resurrected the feeling in me - the book too well records the feeling - and I quickly found myself drifting off into my own private world and not regarding the words as well as I should - only to be fascinated again as my attention snapped back.<br /><br />The book is wonderful for its multiple perspectives. Here is an example of a change of view mid-paragraph (this sort of thing often had me re-reading as my attenton drifted).<br /><br />\\"What damned rot they talk, thought Charles Tansley, laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate, which he had swept clean, as if Lily thought (he sat opposite her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to make sure of his meals. Everything about him had that meagre fixity, that bare unloveliness. But nevertheless, the fact remained, it was almost impossible to dislike any one if one looked at them. She liked his eyes: they were blue, deep set, frightening.\\"<br /><br />The stream-of-consciousness writing style used by Woolf as closely as anything I have experienced imitates the greatest attribute of fine music - counterpoint - the ability of the mind to track and appreciate many strands of experience at the one time, to flick back and forth between many voices. With music you can listen to the same work many times and explore the multiple voices in different ways each time without compromising your appreciation of the whole. I suspect you could do this with several readings of 'To the Lighthouse' too. Unfortunately it takes a greater commitment to re-read a book than it does to, say, listen again to a Mozart symphony.<br /><br />Woolf does have a great ending to this novel - a really memorable mood piece. Unfortunately, to extend the musical analogy, I found her melodies not strong enough, the development of ideas at times pedestrian (detail got in the way), the orchestration inadquate and the harmony not strong enough (although there is one very strong moment in the novel).experienced imitates the greatest attribute of fine music - counterpoint - the ability of the mind to track and appreciate many strands of experience at the one time, to flick back and forth between many voices.

Often novels give me cause to reflect on my life and my place in the universe, but this one is so personal to me that I wonder if my recommendation can be meaningful to others. You see, the narrator of Under Western Eyes is an English speaking man, an older man, an observer, who becomes a possessor of secret knowledge which reflects on the things he sees taking place around him - of the one holding the secret, of the ones ignorant of it. But the second most important character is a young woman, Natalie Haldin, living away from Russia with her mother (in Geneva). And by chance I have a work-based friendship with a colleague who happens to be a Russian woman living away from Russia (in Australia). The last chapter telling of the final meeting between Natalie and the narrator - for quite personal reasons (but it is so well written) was an emotional torment for me, my final meeting has yet to occur - I hope!<br /><br />The most important character in the novel (I discount the narrator, as I would myself, although he is of great importance - you may think the greatest) is a young student, Razumov, who betrays Natalie's brother and then is imposed on by the powers to spy on Russian dissidents in Geneva. There he meets Natalie and others who are totally unaware of his role in Natalie's brother's betrayal and subsequent execution. But it is known that he was a fellow student of Natalie's brother so they are drawn to him. Would Natalie and Razumov become romantically allied? Only if the secret is kept?<br /><br />I will not answer these questions. But I will say that Razumov, weak throughout the novel with the same sort of uncertainties that challenge me, turns out to be the most courageous of characters and, in fact, is afforded one tiny morsel of reward.<br /><br />Conrad is a great user of words although he does say very early on that words are the great foes of reality (page 1). The title of this review is a quote. Here are two more):<br /><br />The man who says he has no illusions has at least that one (page 188)<br /><br />There is always something to weigh down the spiritual side in all of us (page 122)<br /><br />While the novel may not have the same personal impact for you as it did for me, it is very engaging and rewarding.

He is such a wonderful novelist that the things I dislike about some of his female characters (he must have had SUCH a tough time of it!) tends to get obscured. Surely there can't be women in the world that manipulative and self-obsessed! But I'll avoid the risk of confusing things - yes, the title of my review is a quote - and just mention that there are nice women in each of the novels that I have read, as well as the less attractive, but ever so alluring ones.<br /><br />Common to all three Turgenev novels that I have read is rejection - rejection of women by men. But the rejection has nothing to do with the men thinking the women are inadequate. It is the men who see themselves as unworthy and, for me with my Western eyes, their 'reasons' are SO tenuous. And yet, for all that I do see the 'sense' in it - I have seen the world in the same way myself.<br /><br />The outcome for me of this novel was unsatisfactory for another reason that I will not attempt to explain. But it is understandable for me why this outcome was plotted by the author - unlike that of DH Lawrence in another book I reviewed recently.<br /><br />Perhaps Joseph Conrad is correct in 'Under Western Eyes' and those of us with Western eyes will never really understand the Russian - I have certainly tried both personally and in literature. And I have to say I am floundering a bit.

As a white Australian I don't profess to any special understanding of the Aboriginal, but I do know that it is wrong to try to measure their success or failure in terms of European cultural traditions. What matters is that Aborigines are honoured for what they are, for their own culture. I feel that I need to make the same effort with the Aboriginal culture but it is difficult since it has been dominated so much by Europeans. What exactly is the Aboriginal culture - one of the oldest isolated cultures in the world? We should not fall into the trap of assuming it to be a homogeneous culture across such a vast empty space, and one that lived in harmony with nature - always complimenting and never changing the environment. A great place to start getting some empathy with Aboriginal people is Josephine Flood's 'Archaeology of the Dreamtime'<br />Chatwin's 'Songlines' is colourful and worth reading but to me it was also disappointing, seeming to apply a far too European explanation to what he 'observed' or, at least, interpreted. If it is your step into further exploration on the culture of the ancient race of the Australian Aborigines then read it by all means.

Although what Lawrence describes is formidably bleak, nevertheless he describes it well - even the minor warmths that sustain the people. And it's not that he is not perceptive either - there were moments when he could have been writing my story, used exactly the same words I did to describe the same feelings.<br /><br />It was the characters I didn't like at all, especially Paul Morel (moral?). In the first half of the novel we learn a lot about his mother - in fact for a long time I thought the novel was about her. In the second half of the novel the story moves to her third child Paul (the second, Annie, is minor; the last, Arthur, almost trivial) and his 'loves' for Miriam and Clara. Miriam is pure and initially Paul leaves her that way, only activating the relationship later when Clara tells him he had never really tried with her. But once the relationship is sexual Paul retreats. Clara, the alternative woman, is separated from her husband and Paul experiences real passion in winning her over, but she too is unsatisfying to him. Is it his mother's love for him, and his love for her that is to blame? But who are these two women who we have little knowledge of to give us a foundation of understanding of their behaviour as we do of Paul and his mother?<br /><br />What really distressed me was the selfishness of Paul - one of his last acts in the novel - with his sister Annie - is truly appalling (it's not sexual). So what is Lawrence's reason for drafting the novel as he did. Many people experience disturbances to their sexual awakenings, but I would like to think that outcomes do not necessarily have to be as bleak as Lawrence portrays. This is a novel - it doesn't have to faithfully represent people's awful experiences. By doing so for his characters I can't help feel that Lawrence is fatalistic - if things go wrong for you, bad luck, you'll end up a derelict and there is no help for it. I cannot accept this.<br /><br />The most moving parts of the novel both involve Paul's mother - related to the death of her eldest child William and her own death.<br /><br />Other recommendations:<br /><br />Wedekind: Springtime Awakening<br /><br />Turgenev:  Spring Torrentscept this. <br /> <br />The most moving parts of the novel both involve Paul's mother - related to the death of her eldest child William and her own death. <br /> <br />Other recommendations: <br />Wedekind: Springtime Awakening <br />Turgenev:  Spring Torrents	2004-09-07

This challenging novel contrasts the two forms of love that the Russian Sanin is confronted with - his beloved Gemma and the 'free' woman, Maria Nikolaevna. Maria warns Sanin that he will have to be able to forget as she diverts him from Gemma for her own pleasure - the frenzy of physical love.  For Turgenev this was clearly not an easy matter - he wanted the purity of untarnished love - apparently what the French call 'amities amoureuses'; erotic but not genital. But Sanin is a man - how can he resist the passion when the opportunity arises, the passion that all of nature calls to action? Having been sullied by his actions - in his own eyes - he flees his Gemma, fails to forget, and slips into an unsatisfactory existence. But Turgenev is kind to us - and Sanin, because at the end of the novel he allows Sanin to make contact again with Gemma (then living in America) and to be comforted by her mature forgiveness and learn that her life has been good despite the disaster of Sanin's abandonment. Perhaps the hardest of all human experiences is just not knowing .....<br /><br />By chance I was reading D H Lawrence, 'Sons and Lovers', at the same time as I was reading 'Spring Torrents'. And here is another experience - the struggle between the maturing love of Paul for Miriam, and the inability of Paul's mother to approve of Miriam or to release Paul. It amazes me that great writers can point to the terrible traumas that initiating sexual activity causes, and yet it is the very cornerstone of survival of the species. But why does it have to be the way it is - why are humans not more like bonobo monkeys (another surviving species) and be promiscuous in a way that removes all these traumas and uncertainities - relieving men such as Turgenev from that set of troubles in their lives? But would we be the poorer for not then having such great novels as 'Spring Torrents'?<br /><br />If you do read this novel - and I heartily recommend it despite some of its bleakness - you should also read the essay by the translator, Leonard Shapiro. It is very readable and gave me a lot to reflect on.<br /><br />Other recommendations:<br /><br />Turgenev - 'Fathers and Sons'<br /><br />Wedekind - 'Springtime Awakening'<br /><br />Lawrence - 'Sons and Lovers'd also read the essay by the translator, Leonard Shapiro.

It was not a book that I might have selected for myself but had been recommended for me. I learnt a lot about the English character at the start of World War II and also about the reality of the encroaching war - its progress in a day-to-day basis especially in countries like Rumania and Greece had been quite obscure to me previously. The evil of the fascist States is always an approaching threat in these novels and yet its reality barely imposes on the Pringles - are they courageous or foolhardy? When a few of the many well crafted characters lose their life or disappear alarmingly, disappointingly, perhaps I realised that the extent of the characterisation had perhaps diminished the depth of characterisation - I didn't feel the pain as much as I thought I should have.<br /><br />But I did feel Harriet Pringle's uncertainties as she comes to grips with how poorly she knew her new husband, Guy. How he was so honourable and sincere with everyone, but in many ways a failure as a husband. How she is attracted by friendships with others - women as well as men - and is encouraged in all those friendships by Guy. Does he see no risks in this? But mostly it is her loss of a kitten in Rumania, and the need to abandon a cat, that may have been lost anyway, in Greece that really hurt Harriet. 'The poor cat' she grieves as they have to flee at the end of the three novels.<br /><br />I am sure that much of these novels is autobiographical and I trust that Olivia Manning did not distort history for dramatic reasons. That would be inexcusable for me. But I am unlikley to do the research to find out.	2004-08-15

The pastoral nature of this novel is such a disguise for it ends with the toughest, grittiest and most challenging ending I have ever read (stronger than Kafka's 'The Trial', or Christopher Priest's 'The Separation'). As a human being facing what we all face this ending is truly awful.<br />But what is Hudson telling us in this novel? Is it a Victorian approach to telling things that are otherwise inexpressible - that affection is not enough? That real love with all its manifestations must be honoured, because without it there is only death?<br />Here I find a challenge to psychoanalysis and all the techniques of psychology: 'I only discovered, what others have discovered before me, that the practice of introspection has a corrosive effect on the mind, which only serves to aggravate the malady it is intended to cure.' (If only I could stop introspection ......!) ) [page 279 Dutton edition of 1917]<br />But here the common man, Smith, plunged into this affectionate pastoral society, bemoans what he has just learned - that the young woman he loves can never love him as he wishes - 'I wish that I had never made that fatal discovery, that I might have continued still hoping and dreaming, and wearing out my heart with striving after the impossible, since any fate would have been preferable to the blank desolation which now confronted me.' [page 303-304 of the same edition]<br />I wonder what woman of Hudson's acquaintance he had to put aside with such enormous regret that he expressed these words!<br />Search this book out.

This is such a wonderful novel about two young men returning home from University - Arkady Kirsanov and his friend, Yevgeny who is known mostly as Basarov. Firstly they stop at Arkady's father's poor farm - but he is a landowner. Arkady's father's name is Nikolai and living with him is his brother Pavel. What contrasts we immediately meet - Nikolai whose wife has died (Arkady's mother) but who is living with one of the local peasant women (Fenitchka) and has a son by her, and Pavel whose playboy life collapsed when the princess he hoped to marry rejected him.<br />So here we have two young men with all the potential of their living beings contrasted with Nikolai and Pavel and their strange life outcomes. What complicates the matter is that Basarov is a nihilist - someone called him the first 'angry young man'. He is cynical and argumentative - prepared to accept Nikolai's simple innocence and honesty in living, unprepared to tolerate Pavel's Anglophile airs and graces.<br />The young men move on to Basarov's parent's place (simple folk living a traditional old age) but on the way meet Madame Odintsova - quickly called Odintsov (presumably because she is widowed). They spend some time with Odintsov and we learn her name is Anna Sergyevna. Anna lives with her younger sister Katya and and older aunt. The contrasts are once again evident. Anna has no feeling for Arkady at all and quickly Arkady and Katya become friends as Anna and Basarov fascinate each other. But Basarov is appalled at his romantic feelings - not what he expects a nihilist should experience! And when Odintsov's flirting causes him to express that love he has to flee to his parent's place horrified by what he has felt.<br />But he is no more at home with his parents whose love and affection overwhelms him, so the young men return to the Kirsanov's farm, stopping briefly at Odintsov's country residence where they are not really welcomed. However Arkady, home again, is ill at ease and has to return to Odintsov, leaving Basarov behind. What happens at Odintsov's residence is perhaps not unexpected, what happens at the Kirsanov's farm - with Fenitchka and Pavel is remarkable. Eventually Basarov joins Arkady at Madame Odintsov's before returning home. The outcomes I will leave to Turgenev.<br />As a mid-fifties person myself I can readily identify with Nikolai and Pavel who see themselves as old, although they too are only fiftyish. But we all have memories and I can see myself as Basarov and Arkady - in some ways each of them, but in no ways entirely either of them. While, as a young man, I too had ideals (anarchist rather than nihilist) that I used to obscure other things in my life, subsequent experiences in my life have lead me to regret that path my life took for a while. Turgenev's outcome for Basarov is entirely in accord with my view.

And that made me wonder about the signs the character had missed in his wife's decline that lead to her suicide. Should he have seen them? Did the writer plot them into the story in a meaningful way? Did I miss them? So I got off to a bad start with 'The Periodic Table' when I read that Promo Levi ended his life in suicide. Should I try and see the indicators in this novel that were pointing to that - as it turned out - inevitability? What a task to put on oneself!<br />Much of 'The Periodic Table' is entertaining in the quirky way of modern fiction; quirky and annoying for me. Even trivial. It may be interesting to learn a bit about a chemist's occupation, especially a chemist of the past, but this does seem to be an artifice to carry the novel - unless it carries some deeper allegory.<br />And allegory is important for me here. I have a story to tell myself but I will not tell it the way survivors of Auschwitz keep telling theirs. I need an allegory and I have yet to find a satisfactory one. I don't doubt that we did need stories of Auschwitz to inform the world - stories from survivors, stories from workers in the camps, stories from the liberators, even imagined stories from those who did not survive. But 'The Periodic Table' was written in 1975 by an author who had already written of his experiences. It seems to me that this is too late to keep telling the stories - it is time for allegories. 'What happened to me is described elsewhere (p122)' is an annoying quote for me.<br />I also take issue at comments like 'so this is what it meant to be different: this was the price for being the salt of the earth (p104)'. I don't doubt that Jewishness does carry a weight that imposes especially on young people. And Jews like Levi experienced terrible times. But then so did Gypsies, so do people in today's times in many places all over the world. For me everyone is 'different' and has to accomodate their own special differentness and cope with the constraints it imposes on them.<br />Finally, I return to the matter of Levi's suicide (and you can probably guess that the whole notion of suicide is anathema to me, inconceivable - but perhaps I am lucky in that).  There is no doubt that the best chapter for me in this book was the second last one in which Auschwitz does impose on the time of Levi's writing in an entirely justifiable way. I leave it to the reader of this review to decide for themselves when they read the chapter if they can see any pointers to the author's suicide.<br />Other recommendations:<br />Schubert's song cycle 'Die Winterreise's times in many places all over the world.

I enjoy Mr Pinker's books - this is not the first one I have read.A nd yet I find myself balking at some of it. Indeed I have a personal characteristic, not unique of course, that separates me from a lot of what is said here. A physical characteristic, not an emotional one. Consequently I keep finding myself challenging, defending, objecting .....<br />Previously I had read 'Why Sex is Fun?' by Jared Diamond and during this book I realised that the title is totally misleading. It suggests that sex was developed by a conscious entity who thought - 'How can I make this work? I know, I'll make it fun.' For me this is back to front. We are here - our species - because sex just happens to be fun. If it were unpleasant or a chore we probably wouldn't be here.<br />So here we are again looking at evolution and trying to justify human behaviour as somehow driven by genetic imperatives - as if the genes are trying to meet objectives. For me, this is crazy. The genes are the accidental vehicles that keep the species going, but they don't do it by design.<br />And midway through the chapter on families in Mr Pinker's book I realised something new. All we can tell about our existence from evolution is that the species is still here, and something about the way we do things has contributed to that. But Bonobos are here too and they behave in an entirely different way - despite that, they are successful in terms of evolution. But as soon as Mr Pinker talks of the individual male wanting to promote his genes in advance of another man's I know the argument has gone off the rails. We are now talking about - not persistence of the species (which is demonstrable), but persistence of the particular family (which I suspect is not demonstrable). As far as the species is concerned what difference does it make whose genes are being contributed as long as there is variety.<br />OK, men do not like to be cuckolded but I don't think that that is an evolutionary matter. The psychological studies need to look elsewhere.<br />I recommend this book because it will get you thinking, not that I agree with it necessarily.<br />Recommended other reading:<br />'Why is Sex Fun?' by Jared Diamond<br />One that you might like to consider, but I hated:<br />'The Red Queen' by Matt Ridleyes need to look elsewhere.<br />I recommend this book because it will get you thinking, not that I agree with it necessarily.<br />Recommended other reading:<BR>'Why is Sex Fun?' by Jared Diamond<br />One that you might like to consider, but I hated:<BR>'The Red Queen' by Matt Ridley	2004-05-14

This triggered my enthusiasm for reading the book because I have some experience with depression - although I am not myself depressed. But the book is not really about depression at all. In fact the depressed person is dead right at the outset of the novel and we only learn about them through the memories of the grieving partner. But these memories are fragile uncertain things, and as he gets closer and closer in his memories to the day of death he becomes more and more confused and doubtful. What has he missed? What signs did he not see?<br />So this book is not about depression - about its signs, about indicators, about failure to see, about failing management.....<br />This book is about grief and grieving - about how unsettled the grieving person can be - perhaps even mad to a degree. It is a wonderfully inventive book but many of the steps taken by the grieving person I could not myself imagine taking - but then I have yet to grieve in this way so maybe I should not be so sure. I also think that the writing is far superior in the telling of troubled times - so many writers seem to struggle with their descriptions and explanations of good times.	2004-05-13

Yes, this is my experience of life and it comforts me that there are unexplainable things - things that I cannot explain and in a real sense can never be explained.

Sadly it didn't measure up to the first, 'Indiana', for me. It is too long and the mannered society of the characters is too formal and stilted for me. And there is so much scene setting - it goes on and on and on. In fact I put the novel down for quite a while before I picked it up and read to the finish. And the ending does have more momentum than a lot that went before, but - perhaps a reflection of the time - I am perplexed at how an individual can be charged with murder when no-one has died and, indeed, even be sentenced to execution and, in the end, an execution does take place - still in the absence of a death.<br />But Bernard - brought up badly by the bad side of the family - is rescued and nurtured by the good side where he falls in love with his second cousin Edmee. And for seven years Edmee resists him - for two of those years he actually flees to America (and yes, I couldn't blame him). Of course, had he been raised in a supportive and caring environment perhaps he could have withstood Edmee's 'indifference' (initially she is betrothed to another, but she is released from that), but with the terrible upbringing he endured Bernard is torn apart by this apparent rejection in the heart of the part of the family that has adopted him.<br />So why does Edmee keep Bernard at arms length? It is not at all clear to me unless - as is indicated at times - she sees Bernard as mentally unstable (perhaps schizophrenic) and cannot take on the burden of caring for him, physically or in her heart. But she does not send him away either! There is one other possibility that Sand does not explore and that is that Edmee has an unseen physical disability that distracts and torments her in the face Bernard's love. But this is just making excuses for inexplicable behaviour.<br />Strangely for me, the sanest words in the novel come from the 'murderer' who comes upon Bernard and Edmee 'lost' in the woods. He says that the conversation he overheard nearly made him scream with laughter - Bernard with his childish pleas, Edmee with her haughty indifference. And that is exactly how I saw these two and in the end I really didn't need to spend as much time with them as George Sand has put me through.<br />It is an interesting novel but for me tedious in its extent and at times laboured in its prose.

It was a bit long for them really, especially the younger one. And yet it is a very engaging novel that had them periodically laughing, or breathless with their eyes popping out. It is at times a bit grim, and at times a bit farcical. It's also pretty hard to read aloud with all those accents and voices. But it is above all a story of resourcefulness, of conscience and of survival. And, of course, it is sufficiently exotic in time and place for modern Australians, as we are, to add an extra dimension to the enjoyment.<br />If you plan to read it to your children, allow yourself plenty of time, be prepared to pause and discuss some of the issues (such as slavery, which we no longer tolerate and yet it was not necessarily the worst of outcomes for some people).

Is this the complaint of all men for women? The strange drawing together of the isolated man (so much as I once was) with the resourceful but unexpected woman so shocked the 'world', those who missed out, that evil had to come of it. But this novel is called 'Victory', Conrad saw it as upbeat. And it is in a strange sort of way. I was profoundly disappointed at the end, as indeed I am disappointed by the end of every life that is a part of my own.<br />Considering the nature of this novel - the strength and support of man (ineffective, but well meaning) for woman, and the wisdom and courage of woman (committed, but perhaps foolish) for man, the end is still inevitable. But Conrad manages to craft an ending that is a victory - one in which neither party compromises their view of the world despite the threats it imposes on them.<br />In Heyst - the 'hero' I saw much of myself. In Lena, the heroine who fails to succeed where success was impossible, I see a particular courageous woman in my own world. Perhaps you too will be able to find one?<br />There are wonderful characters in this novel, but I do regret the lack of any native Indonesian flavour to the story - place is well portrayed, peripheral people less so. But, perhaps in Conrad's time - colonial times - this is just the way the Europeans were - blind to the people around them, not seeing them as truly human.	2003-12-21

I enjoyed this book very much - it is fresh in expression and introducing complex ideas - even humourous at times! And yet for all that there is a sense of some lack of achievement also, although this may not be a failing of Mr Wilson.<br />As a mathematics student - and I have studied quite a lot of mathematics - it seems to me that proofs came in three kinds. There are the mind opening 'obvious' ones that are so stand-alone that once you read them there is nothing to learn. The blinkers have been lifted from the eyes and the world is a different place. Then there are the proofs that take such a lot of work to assimilate and for a long time you just don't see it. Perhaps you never really do, but you do come to accept it because the mathematics community is convinced. Then there are the proofs that even the mathematics community struggle with. The four-colour problem's proof is one of these. Consequently there is left a nagging doubt, which I gather is quite widespread amongst people far wiser and knowledgeable than me - than Mr Wilson also I suspect.<br />The curious thing is that a conjecture like the four-colour mapping, or Fermat's last theorem, or the conjecture that all even numbers can be made up of the sum of two prime numbers, is so powerful AND there are no counter examples available to challenge the conjecture. So why can they not be proved by some elegant insight such as Fermat claimed for his last theorem but never showed the world before his immanent death in a duel? Why can the four-colour problem only be proved by such inelegant computer-assisted means as this book describes? Perhaps Mr Wilson's greatest achievement is in exposing the doubts and dissatisfactions of the current proof of the four-colour problem despite the appearance that it may well be adequate (this goes for the proof of Fermat's last theorem too).	2003-11-18

It wasn't easy to find some, but I did manage to buy 'Indiana' and 'Mauprat' through a second-hand dealer. 'Indiana' is an interesting story of relationships especially between husbands and wives, men and women, nobility and commoners, family and strangers. The central marraige is uncharacteristic of modern Western society in that an older wealthy man has married a young woman for the status of it - he is no more than her friend, and often not even that. But there are many ways in which marraiges can fail either the woman or the man in modern Western society and consequently, for me,  the symptoms of what goes on in this novel - even if not the causes - are current in modern society.<br />Sand's story is engaging and generally well paced. It does seem a bit like a soap opera sometimes. It also rushes to an unsatisfactory ending - a bit like the end of 'Well of Loneliness', which appalled me. But then Sand has a surprise for me - although I have a sneaking feeling that it might be an afterthought, a rewrite. What is distinctive about Sand's writing is her ability to create a visionary scene - like the one where Raymon rails against the picture of Indiana's cousin Ralph hanging in Indiana's bedroom (Raymon is there with his lover of the time - Indiana's serving girl Noun). And then there is the extraordinary scene where Indiana almost drowns in the river only to be rescued by Ralph - we see the world transform itself from Indiana's perspective in the most unsettling way.<br />I enjoyed this novel immensely and look forward to reading more of Sand's writing.	2003-11-05

I certainly did. The title really is very captivating. In fact it was so captivating for me that I didn't realise this book espoused Buddhist philosophy until I actually started reading it. In some ways I have never been comfortable with comforting texts, but I have always tried to keep an open mind about other people's cultures and traditions. Pema Chodron walks a fine line of encouraging and stimulating, for me anyway. But the book is by no means comforting with its messages of living with hopelessness, letting things go, refraining from doing things and so on. My perspective changed in many ways as I read - perhaps not fixedly, but nevertheless I greatly value the shifts that occurred and their impact will not disappear even if I continue much as I have in the past.<br />And, as I read, I realised that the past is the problem with its regrets but so is the future with its urges for satisfaction. The only real problem with the present is that it last for such a short time!	2003-10-27

Christopher Priest is a consistently fine writer, and, for me, this exceeds his two immediately prior novels, and they were good reads also ('The Extremes', and 'The Prestige'). If you have not read Christopher Priest previously I would also recommend the earlier novels 'A Dream of Wessex', 'The Affirmation' and 'The Glamour'.<br />There is always something unsettling in Mr Priest's writing - something to remind the reader that we all create a 'firm' understanding of the reality we live in, and yet we all know that we are often mistaken, deluded, fooled.... You could see this novel simply as an alternative history novel in which the outcome of World War 2 (our real history)is contrasted with a believable alternative. But it's nothing like Philip Dick's wonderful 'The Man in the High Castle' which is a post-war alternative history, because Mr Priest actually describes the war coming to an alternative resolution during the war. So there are real people in the novel - notably Winston Churchill and Rudolph Hess. And I could well believe in both of them. But the story centres on identical twins - both of them being JL Sawyer. Perhaps we were meant to get them confused, but one of the slight weaknesses for me in this novel was a failure to separate the twins adequately - well, they were diametrically opposed in their attitude to the war, but it was their mood and personality that got confused for me.<br />Mysteries abound in the narrative and only a very dull mind would not be actively searching for resolutions, explanations. But the story keeps turning away from possible explanations and yet keeps coming back to itself with different views of the same incidents - there's a bit of ground hog day in it! And the ending of the novel is something I have seen before too - in WH Hudson's 'A Crystal Age' - not that I saw it coming in 'The Separation' for all that. Hudson makes no effort to rationalise or justify how the ending could be the way it is - Mr Priest hangs out a technical artefact that you could configure as an 'explanation' if you so wish - an option not available to Hudson, although he could have resorted to a occult 'explanation' if he'd wished. Let me just leave it by saying in both novels that the ending is very strong.<br />At the end of the novel I was left wondering - perhaps there could have been a better outcome for World War 2 (not something our side is ever likely to countenance) - or at least, a less bad one.<br />Finally, and not with regard to the novel itself, I am left wondering why a search for 'The Separation' brings up nearly 2000 items but this book is no where near the head of the list (it's last on the list of 44 publications under 'Christopher Priest'). I realise that it is not available everywhere yet, but it is in the database of titles and it is open for reviewing.

As I have a mathematical background I would have liked some hard science details in the book - how does triangulation work with its dimensions of measurement (horizontal and vertical), how can independent checks be made by using astronomical sources, and so on.

Mr Boulter details the effects of continental drift in the evolution of species in a much more regarding manner than many other writers. And the book does detail an analytical method that suggests not only that evolution and change are inevitable, but also so is extinction. Inevitably it will come to humankind in its turn - or will it? Perhaps evolution will cause change rather than extinction just as it is now believed many dinosaurs - rather than dying out - changed to become birds. So the message of the book is not necessarily gloomy even though it does talk of the 'end of Man'.	2003-08-26

However, I do know of the woman by her link to Frederic Chopin. I suspect many readers of this biography - me included - will pick the book up because of their interest in music rather than literature.<br />George Sand's life was certainly extraordinary, just as she was. And there is no doubt now that I will read at least one of her novels. In those regards this biography is demonstrably a success. But in other ways it failed me.  I have named this review 'Lelio' by the name Hector Berlioz (a contemporary of Sand) gave the sequel to his Symphonie Fantastique.  (Berlioz is mentioned three times in the biography but only one of these references is indexed.) What is the link with George Sand? Belinda Jack does not explore this. George Sand wrote a short story 'La marquise' in which there is a character Lelio. She later wrote a novel called 'Lelia'. What does the name mean and are there any connections? Music lovers would probably like to know.  I turned to David Cairns translation of 'The Memoirs of Hector Berlioz' and he reveals that Berlioz' work came after 'La marquise' and hence may have been inspired by it, but before Sand's novel 'Lelia'. It is notes of this type that greatly enrich works. I suggest that Belinda Jack has failed to provide this type of enrichment in her biography. Here is another example: Delacroix spent a lot of time with George Sand and we are all familiar with his portrait of Chopin - unfinished though it is. We are less familiar with the fact that he painted Sand as well (even more unfinished). The question to ask is why was it not finished. Even more, in the illustrations to the biography why do we only get Delacroix's portrait of Chopin? (You can find the portrait of Sand on the internet.) At another point Belinda Jack reports that Sand's reading included a bunch of writers - one of whom is called Hoffmann. ETA Hoffmann I wondered? No - the index told me it was Ernst Hoffmann, someone I have no knowledge of. By telling the reader upfront that it was Ernst Hoffmann might help avoid possible misunderstanding. But at least it was in the index. There are many people referred to in this biography whose name means nothing to me and it may have been useful to have short summaries of them and their significance. I happen to know who Proudhon was (libertarian anarchist) but I suspect many readers won't. And again, uncommented is the strangeness of the Sand family having a servant with the unlikely name of Carl Maria von Weber - especially strange to music lovers.<br />But despite these quibbles I value reading this biography and rate it well.is called Hoffmann.

I refer to the Pan Book published in 1963 under the title 'Voyage to Venus'.  The visual experience so richly experienced by readers of 'Out of the Silent Planet' is even exceeded here. Although it is less varied, it is more magical and evocative. The story itself contains much philosophy and religion much of which I am uncomfortable with, unsure of, or confused by.  I am left with too many questions, and there are too many alternate paths for the story which are not excluded by its own inner logic.  We all know the first few bars of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. It is unthinkable that it could have been an ascending phrase rather than a descending one. The inner logic of the symphony demands it to be the way Beethoven wrote it. With 'Perelandra' this is not so for me. The story could have gone in different directions and at the end I am unconvinced by the direction C S Lewis did take it.  But, having said that, it is a wonderful vision that has remained strongly with me since I first read the book while I was at High School and was great to renew (and the rediscovery of 'Out of the Silent Planet' at High School when I had read it even earlier in my life was similar) .	2003-08-05

This is an extraordinarily self-indulgent work, a tirade by the author against all those sensual things that we enrich our lives with - food, wine, literature, religion, music, travel ..... And yet, in the end, the hero of the story, Des Esseintes, fails in his attempt to isolate himself and cocoon himself in all these things he treasures so much - he becomes ill and has to abandon the attempt. So why does this 'novel' work? It is a very strange one, but it is certainly a novel(ty), perhaps even a nova!  Is it the fluidity of the writing (and the translation I read by Margaret Mauldon)? Is it the content that connects in so many ways, in so many directions?  For me there was a special fascination although the basis for me was totally different to Des Esseintes. His experience was a withdrawal from the world after extravagant and self-damaging self-indulgence. For me, I had imagined doing exactly what Des Esseintes did (but my life turned in a different direction), but my basis was one of rigorous but perhaps equally self-damaging self-denial. Would the outcome have been different? I can only speculate but I suspect not. I think Huysmans is right on the money!	2003-07-26

In the body of Dick's novels it is more intense and varied than most. I remember immediately liking it when I first read it in the 1970s - in fact it probably went a long way to starting my life-long love of PKD's works. The idea of someone burying artefacts to make it look like Earth once had alien invaders - well, visitors anyway - is so intriguing.  And with PKD's novels you never quite know if there won't actually be a twist in which alien invaders - visitors, I mean - turn up.  But PKD has a different surprising twist in store for us! Perhsps this is what disappointed some reviewers - they felt a bit let down by there not actually being any invaders.  But for me it is the levels of reality that are of interest - the reality of life in the tanks, the reality of life above - and how these realities are perceived by both populations. Joseph Adams is the archetypal PKD underman, but there is more variety in the other characters than often appears in PKD novels - especially David Lantano, but also Verne Lindblom.<br />For this novel I recommend ignoring the critics and their nitpicking about grammar which never offended me in the slightest. Go ahead and read - I think you will enjoy it.	2003-07-24

It also shows how a member of a radical group of artists can be driven by the same passions that probably afflict all of us during our lives. This passion of Breton's is extraordinary in its own way but I suspect we all have these seemingly unusual encounters in our lives. It takes a creative artist such as Breton to bring it to life. But in some ways he only brings it half to life. While he does have a fascination with 'Nadja' - the name being the first part of the Russian word for hope - his wife remains firmly in the background and not withheld, and yet her involvement is completely untold, even unspeculated on.  What type of relationship Breton and his wife had we can only speculate about. In the end this is quite a sad story, but then I suspect most of the passions we all feel for the 'extras' in our own lives are inevitably tinged with sadness and unfulfilment. So for me, Breton has captured something here that is quite magical.	2003-07-22

And isn't that all of us as our everyday lives infringe on the events of the world - infringe rather than impact?<br />As in many Philip Dick novels there are logical challenges which may compromise the story for people who are unable/unwilling to accept a basic premise of the novel.  In this case it is the power of a drug to actually move people temporarily in time - forwards or backwards - or across parallel worlds. Not make it appear that they move, but actually move them. The descriptions of characters in the influence of the drug are so fascinating - for me anyway - that the logical discontinuities disappeared into the far recesses of my mind. And now I realise that there are many logical problems for me in the REAL world that I have trundled away in the back of my mind so that I can get on with life.<br />Philip Dick's graphic and extending speculations on the natureof reality certainly push hard into my reality and how I understand it. And here's a quote: '..... you've only got one tiny life and that lies ahead of you, not sideways or back.'	2003-05-21

And my admiration of the Frenchman - Champollion - who achieved this attracted me to these diaries of his travels through Egypt to collect more transcriptions to refine his understanding of this ancient civilisation. As  diary writer myself, I enjoy reading the diaries of others. Sadly I found these diaries less engaging than I hoped. It's not that they are dull but it is rather like looking at the monuments through a fog.  No matter how well Champollion describes his endeavours I still craved a visual record, not just description.  The written language - especially the Egyptian hieroglyphics - is such a visual medium.  Champollion's lack of interest in the architecture is also a problem because it is the monuments that carry the script that are most immediately distinctive - for me anyway.  Also there are the monuments, artwork and scripts that Champollion  describes as substandard - after the peak of Egyptian achievement.  But I cannot see these - I cannot agree or disagree with Champollion.<br />There is a lot of interest in these diaries but they also disappointed me in other ways.  Perhaps an illustrated version of the diaries would work better.	2003-05-05

It does show its age somewhat and yet it still contains some excellent research on Biblical documents and what we really have from close to the time of Christ.  There is some good research on Roman times too.  Strangely there was less on the apocryphal books of the Bible than I expected - I was certainly stimulated into reading some of these extraordinary documents by my first reading of 'The Word'.<br />However, I found the investigative role of the PR man from within the publishing group of the new New Testament - Resurrection Two -  stretched my credulity far too far for my liking.  And what a man this investigator is! Not only does he squeeze past some moments of impasse with the most amazing luck (more incredulity - but it does make a good yarn) but he has an unbelievable way with the ladies.  This is what I disliked about the novel most - that and the characters left hanging (what did happen to the woman whose leg was miraculously cured? - ah, but there's the rub - there is no truth that can tell us).  Most of all I could have done without the sexual olympics (scattered not too liberally it has to be said) through the novel - they might be titillating for the reader but I couldn't see how they had any meaning for the characters.<br />In the end Mr Wallace's own belief or lack of belief jumps up and hits us in the face.  Our investigator-hero solves his case but gets no satisfaction of his objectives.  The world goes on not the way he wanted, but does it matter?  Yes, he goes on too and there's good in that as well.  But is there any truth? Is the Bible we know and trust something we should believe in? Does it matter if it is true or not if it produces positive outcomes? But, now I see that I don't have the truth about Mr Wallace's intentions either.  All I know is that I enjoyed his book despite it shortcomings.	2003-05-01

But inevitably, it seems, for every proposal and positive test result someone else will come up with another test for the same proposal and the results will be negative. In the end there are so many questions without firm answers that it becomes hard to know which, if any, or which combinations of these questions, would resolve the matter. It seems that Archaeopteryx had feathers (although there is discussion of those who thought the feather impressions were forgeries). It seems that it was a dinosaur (not a bird). But was it 'proaves' the precursor bird? Apparently the fossil record of primitive birds is too poor for us to know - I would have liked more details about these early fossil birds. Was Archaeopteryx warm blooded? Were any dinosaurs? Could Archaeopteryx fly or were the feathers merely for heat insulation? For me I would have liked more on 'pro-feather' - the precursor to feathers. At the very end of the book we learn of a find in 1996 in China of a dinosaur that did not have wings but appears to have feathers on its back and sides. Other flying creatures are discussed - pterosaurs, insects, bats (surprisingly from the fossil record quite recently evolved) and gliding mammals such a sugar gliders. There is also some aerodynamics in this book as researchers try to determine if Archaeopteryx could fly. The result of their aerodynamic studies? As always - uncertainty!<br />I am reviewing a paperback copy of this book published by Wiedenfeld and Nicolson. It's a handsome book but I cannot understand what possessed the publishers to put a pterosaur fossil on the front cover rather than Archaeopteryx. To be fair, they do point this out on the back cover which is how I finalised realised this - but who pays much attention to back cover blurbs?	2003-04-01

As a cat owner (fellow traveller, anyway) I approached this book with some expectations.  It has always puzzled me that cats - loners - associate so well with people. Obviously the cats - loners, as I've said - can't see people as just big cats as apparently dogs see people as big dogs. So what's going on with cats?  Unfortunately Mr Budiansky doesn't know or can't tell us, and neither can the researchers he quotes.<br />What is certain is that cats don't NEED people. Mr Budiansky has some great statistics to show this. Cats just do so well as feral animals, they get on quite admirably often to the disadvantage of other animals. But this is not a fault of the cats - just the people who manage them, or should be managing them. But cats don't automatically become feral if they are abandoned - they sometimes employ other strategies, which is something Mr Budiansky and his researchers apparently haven't considered. We were adopted by a cat who lived with us for nine years. We didn't want a second cat, and neither did our already resident cat.  But the stray endeared herself to us in such a way that we could not deny her - although there was never more than cool tolerance between the cats.<br />Sadly this book descends into lists of anecdotes and veterinary responses to behavioural aspects of a cat that may not be acceptable to human owners - fellow travellers. But even in this there are great omissions - for example, no discussion on the effectiveness of the strategy of making cats wear bells to warn birds.<br />So, cats remain a mystery to me. Even living with them doesn't really help. But it is enriching. If you don't know much about cats you may find this book interesting to read - even informative.  But if your knowledge of cats is not superficial - especially if you live with cats - this book may disappoint you as it did me.	2003-03-13

I have read and enjoyed most of Mr Theroux's travel books, not to mention novels and short stories.  I enjoy the way that he observes the world around him, but also his own reactions to it.  And he has such a lively sense of humour and sense of place.  Well, in 'Dark Star Safari' I certainly got the sense of place as usual - but where was the humour? We read in this book about Mr Theroux's milestone birthday and it occurred to me that, not only did he flee home and family where it might have been celebrated, but also that he returned to places and journeys of his youth.  Perhaps the lack of humour has something to do with his being depressed about aging?<br />And in the light of this I wonder if Africa's decline is quite as severe as he portrays in this book.  I don't doubt that it is rough - and in places dangerous - but I wonder if the Tanzania and Uganda described by Mr Theroux have fallen quite so far as it appears from this book. It also interested me that he chose to retrace the paths of earlier explorations he took in Africa, rather than venture out in new exciting directions where the freshness of his view might have displaced his apparently persistent sense of decline.<br />There is also the matter of aid to Africa which Mr Theroux blames for the decline he sees in the country.  In this he convinces me. So perhaps the decline is as he observes, and that it is not mixed up in the decline that aging is bringing to himself.<br />My final observation is a testament to how powerful I see Mr Theroux's observations, how uncompromising and revealing.  It happens that I had two trips to Johannesburg in 2000 myself and as I read 'Dark Star Safari' of Mr Theroux's journey towards South Africa it suddenly occured to me that when Mr Theroux reached Johannesburg I might suddenly find myself reading about myself!  This was rather exciting and a bit daunting too.  How would he see me? As remorselessly as he sees himself?  Perhaps I was disappointed, perhaps I was relieved, but we didn't meet - or I was just too dull to be included!<br />Read this book for a great view of the variety of Africa and even more of the people of Africa.

Like Bach claiming his work was 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.  What clearly comes through in this book is that Gaudi was an extraordinary man - a creator of unique structures and visions.<br />I have always felt a fascination with things that seem to have some unexpected, almost alien, aspect to them.  In architecture this includes the temples at Angkor and the Hindu temples of India; are these the works of humankind?  So it is with Gaudi. Where are the precursors? Where are the followers? Perhaps there are no followers because what he did was so exceptional no-one dares takes the same path.  And then there is the man Gaudi as described in this book - he is no less alien; banishing intimacy with women from his life, being absorbed in catholicism,  following a rigorous vegetarian diet.  I didn't want speculation - I hate that in biographies - but I would have liked more information. For example, why was Gaudi a vegetarian - was it a religious tenet he was following, was it a moral one, was it health-driven?<br />Other reviewers have been disturbed by Mr Hensbergens command of the English language. This did not offend me. Perhaps the paperback version I am reviewing had been further edited.  But I did find the book slow to capture my attention.  Perhaps it was Gaudi and not the prose that finally engaged me - but engaged I was.  Another feature that initially annoyed me was the placing of the four sections of illustrations.  It seemed to me that I was forever hunting for an illustration for the text I was reading.  But by the end of the biography this didn't offend me at all; in fact I grew to love hunting back and forth through the illustrations because as I did so I grew to know Gaudi's architecture better and better.	2003-02-26

Sadly, I didn't like the way Goleman presented his thesis. Like much of popular culture these days it is just short easy-to-assimilate grabs - depth is lacking in the writing. To be convincing - and I wanted to be convinced - I needed more substance and less of the yarns and anecdotes.  For example, on page 90 there is a quote from a composer who is not named (although the source of the quote is cited). Because I have an interest in music I did find the name of the composer elsewhere in the book - another citation from the same source -not that I'd actually heard of him, which diminishes the credibility of the quote. I suspected, of course, that the composer was not Beethoven because the author would just have written: 'Beethoven describes ....' To quote an unnamed composer - not to introduce who he is - is just plain sloppy to me. And reduces my satisfaction at what I have read.	2003-02-09

It does bare some resemblance to 'The Life and Opinions of Tristam Shandy' but is markedly more inventive, more engaging. Partly it is because it is two stories entwined but also disengaged. And each is of great complexity - the one being a truly captivating mystery but one that progresses ever so slowly, almost catching me unawares and making me wonder - for a while - if this wasn't the first detective story, and the other being the musings of the character of the title - Tomcat Murr. Yes, a cat actually writes the story! By the end of the novel - and it was a long and slow read for me - every character was someone I felt totally at sympathy with (which is not something I could say for the characters in Tristam Shandy). ...<br />I found this novel a long, hard read - the ideas and interrelationships are dense. But by the end of it I loved all the characters, they are part of my family. It is no wonder that Hoffmann had such a great impact in the world of music - his writing can get right under your skin - well, it certainly got under mine. I will read this novel again. It is simply so good, so captivating...	2003-02-09

In it he proposes a science of nexialism. Here is van Vogt's definition of nexialism - '... the science of joining in an orderly fashion the knowledge of one field of learning with that of other fields'. In this age of specialisation I believe nexialism could be very profitable - there are too few polymaths these days.<br />So why did I start this review of a novel by James Blish with commentary on one of A E van Vogt.  Both of these writers are, of course, science fiction writers and I enjoy re-reading the 'classics' of science fiction to see what excited me so much when I first read them.  For example, I recently re-read (and reviewed) A E van Vogt's 'The World of Null A'.  Sadly this disappointed me despite its engaging introduction to 'Science and Sanity' and its P K Dick-like twists and shifts. I was not at all disappointed by 'A Case of Conscience' - this is immensely readable, inventive, well-structured and surprising (even when I knew roughly what was coming).<br />One of the great pleasures of science fiction is the way it can engage (but doesn't always do so) many fields of human endeavour. The political insight of Ursula LeGuin (such as in 'The Disposessed'), the metaphysics of P K Dick (such as in 'Ubik'), the studies of paranormal phenomena (such as Robert Silverberg's 'Dying Inside'), the studies of time travel (such as Alfred Bester's 'The Men Who Murdered Mohammed').  In each case there is nexialism at work - the combining of one aspect of human endeavour with speculations about it.  'A Case of Conscience' draws theology into science fiction and I am sure that every reader of this novel will take away more than just the memory of an engaging yarn. It opened my mind to theological questioning and debate that i suspect I may never have approached otherwise.	2002-12-29

It tells of Maurice Hall (which immediately made me think of Radclyffe Hall's classic 'The Well of Loneliness) growing up with an awareness and horror of his homosexuality.  As I struggled to develop a 'oneness' with characters who were so alien to my own natural preference an amazing thing happened in the story.  One of the two main 'gay' (Forster does not use this word) characters suddenly decides he likes women.  Does this happen, I wondered?  Or was it an excuse used by one 'gay' (or bisexual) person to disengage from a partner they no longer enjoyed?  For me, of course, it drove another knife between the remaining 'gay' character and myself. It seemed that homosexuals could be changed/change - they could all be like me!  Was this a literary device of Forster that aims to modify the responses of readers - making the job harder for heterosexual readers to identify with Maurice, making homosexual readers even more keenly feel the alienation of society (especially when the book was written)?<br />In an afterword Forster explains that his book had to have a happy ending (despite great trauma suicide is mentioned only once throughout the book). This made me think again of Radclyffe Hall's 'Well of Loneliness' with its remorseless and, for me, unsatisfyingly negative ending.  Hall wrote her novel about lesbians in 1928 and it created a furore in its time.  That Forster was sitting on his novel at the time is an intersting thing to me. Was he tempted to publish? Perhaps he felt he could not join the same storm. Perhaps he originally had the miserable ending Hall wrote, and changed to distinguish his novel. In the end, these can be little more than speculations.<br />When I read Richard Fortey's book 'Trilobite' I complained in my review that I never really got to like trilobites as Mr Fortey obviosly does, despite enjoying the book immensely. The case is the same here.  Forster's writing is inventive and rich, but I am left feeling just as alienated from homosexuals - I am simply not one of them.  Am I more sympathetic? Perhaps. But the best that I can hope for is probably to be more tolerant.e.  Forster's writing is inventive and rich, but I am left feeling just as alienated from homosexuals - I am simply not one of them.

Perhaps in the early parts I was engaged by the newness of the story (which is just what 'novel' means - 'new'). Perhaps in the middle I was envious of Siddhartha who made significant changes in his lifestyle and changed the whole basis of his life - something I have been unable or unwilling to in my life. But in the end I was so attracted to the personal message because it is my philosophy of life. We must make our own decisions, take our own actions - it must always come from within. Following someone else's path (such as the path of Gotama the Buddha which Siddhartha's youthful partner Govinda takes) must always leave an emptiness. A feeling of incompleteness. But as Siddhartha's story tells it, the path of personal enlightenment is such a difficult one. May it always end with the transcendental courage of Vasudeva, the enlightened one who shared with Siddhartha but did not lead, did not evangelise, did not try to convert or convince - just showed the way.<br />The title of my review is a quote from the novel.	2002-11-23

He started life as a composer and then moved to writing stories. There are several of his sketches reproduced in this book and these show flashes of great talent too (you can see one on the cover).  Hoffmann's influence is enormous in the musical world (Tchiakovsky, Delibes, Offenbach, Wagner all drew inspiration from Hoffmann).  And there is something timeless in these stories even into the 21st century - there are psychological puzzles, studies of behaviour and myth, stories of automata that Philip Dick, Cordwainer Smith or Isaac Asimov would have been proud of, there are links not surprisingly into the world of music (you mustn't miss 'Rath Krespel') and the world of art (see 'Tobias Martin, Master Cooper').  Somehow Hoffmann makes ancient technologies and methods fresh and exciting - barrel making, sailing, alchemy, mining.  Unfortunately the most famous of Hoffmann's stories (Nutcracker) is one of the weakest for me, and the one with the greatest reputation ('The Golden Flower Pot') suffers in this anthology by a translation that didn't engage me as well as those of other stories.  My favourite stories are 'The Sand-Man', 'Rath Krespel' and 'Tobias Martin'. Here's a brief quote from 'Tobias Martin' that appealed to me especially:  'It sometimes happens that the deepest sorrow, if it can find tears and words, dissolves into a mild melancholy, so that perhaps even a gentle shimmer of hope begins to beam faintly through the heart.' Hoffmann is often sentimental but this is more than offset by an unpredictable exoticness.	2002-11-21

Now it was the turn of 'Flow My Tears'. This is a very pacy novel that generates great impetus with its engaging characters. And it resolves into such a typical PKD ending - enigmatic and open-ended. Did PKD have difficulty with endings, or is it we, the readers, who have difficulty with his endings?<br />There is one point early in the novel when Eddy, the hotel clerk, takes Jason Taverner to the forger Kathy. But does Eddy stay or leave? It appears that he leaves but then he is still there. This seems to me to be a case of poor editing - I would have expected that a good editor would have picked up this inconsistency and given PKD the chance to correct it. But then I don't know how difficult PKD was to work with.<br />From p39 in the Daw edition there is a great quote: 'He felt sympathetic. The truth, he had often reflected, was overrated as a virtue.' On p61 there is an original word 'thungly' - or is that a misprint? It doesn't conjure up any immediate impression for me - but I really don't mind an author creating words and 'kipple' from 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' is definitely part of my everyday vocabulary.<br />I have previously reviewed a marvellous biography of Brahms by Jan Swafford. In the evaluation of Brahms and his place in musical history Swafford aligns Brahms with the classical tradition - Mozart, Schubert, Beethoven of the fourth symphony - and opposed to the 'moderns' of his day - Beethoven of the Pastoral Symphony, Berlioz, Liszt and especially Wagner. And then he links Brahms into the future via - of all composers - Schoenberg. What does this have to do with PKD and 'Flow My Tears'? Well let's consider this quote from p95 and you may wonder, like me, just how perceptive PKD was. 'He detested Wagner. Wagner and those like him such as Berlioz, had set music back three centuries. Until Karlheinz Stockhausen in his \\"Gesang der Junglinge\\" had once more brought music up to date.' For those who do not know modern 'classical' music, Stockhausen is a whole step further advanced along the avante garde than Schoenberg but the drift of ideas is clearly the same as the one ventured on by Swafford. PKD continues to surprise in surprising ways! The next time I reread a novel I fully expect a new revelation that will only then become apparent from some other reading I've done in the meantime.<br />There is one serious anachronism in this novel. It relates to phonograph records - even the term is so outdated. Perhaps a future publisher should do PKD the service of reworking the text to replace phonograph with compact disc.

Often when I reread my own writings I cringe at my ideas and philosophies when I was young and it takes some time for me to empathise with myself and regain a feeling for the person I was. One of the great features of these diaries is that they  truly express the voice of the nineteen-year old, they have not been edited to provide a more sophisticated voice.  Perhaps Mahler-Werfel cringed a bit at herself in the way I do, perhaps that is why she never published these diaries during her lifetime, although we do know she gave it some consideration.  But I think it is important that we heed the voice expressed in youthful writings because it reassociates us with the people we once were, and hopefully gives us greater empathy with the youth of today.<br />The most challenging aspect of these diaries is Mahler-Werfel's revelations of her growing sexual awareness with its contradictions, rapid changes of view, hesitancies, self criticism, and intemperate admissions.  This is emotional and at times erotic writing.  While we can allow Mahler-Werfel the licence to say what she wants about herself, it is less readily acceptable that she describes the behaviour of her partners - some of them quite historic figures.  But this is the voice of youth going through very tumultuous personal times. Most people move through these times with varying degrees of ease and distress.  Mahler-Werfel's writing reminded me of Wedekind's play `Springtime Awakening'.  The awakening is not satisfactory for all - and is sometimes disastrous.  For Mahler-Werfel we can only speculate.<br />Mahler-Werfel associated with many great artistic figures - in the times of these diaries there are Gustav Klimt, Alexander Zemlinsky and Gustav Mahler.  Her reflections on these figures make them more alive than many histories. For her, they were living pulsing human beings and we see them in that way.<br />But was Mahler-Werfel extraordinary herself? I find it hard to decide.  She obviously was not your average woman of the time, and yet it is possible to see her as just a spoilt rich girl who happened to have a pretty face.  In her diaries she speaks of writing a song (lied) in a day, playing the whole of Tristan on the piano in an evening.  And yet her musical examples noted in the diary are so poorly notated and often so inaccurate that it is hard not to think she had little genuine talent.  Perhaps someone else completed the lieder from her tenuous musical ideas.  But equally possible is that she was a real talent and, as popular history tells us, was suppressed by Mahler in their marriage.  To me, however, there is another reading in that marriage to Mahler enabled her to renounce her musical ambitions, which she knew would never match those of Mahler no matter how hard she worked.  To be fair about her musical notation however, we need to remember that all her writings border on the unreadable (perhaps that was deliberate - a sort of code?) although the single-minded line drawings she included are quite fine in a limited way (are they all of pretty Alma herself?).<br />Another way to judge her musical astuteness is her reviews and critiques of the many concerts she attended.  At first look they seem to match the views of the day - wildly supportive of Wagner, dismissive of Bach, Saint-Saens and even Mozart. Was she just copying the view of the day? But then there are the changes of view - suddenly the opinion on Mozart changes, she starts to see some flat spots in Wagner.  This does seem to suggest self-awareness in her musical views and even if it is selective acceptance of different critical opinion she shows a capability to make the change.  There is one final thought that came to me as I read the diaries - perhaps her influence was so great (it certainly wasn't trivial) that she went some way to actually forming the critical view of the day.<br />I was immensely fascinated by these writings.  If you are interested in human development and artistic creativity I recommend you do not overlook them.  One thing is certain - Mahler-Werfel was an impassioned writer as a young woman.went some way to actually forming the critical view of the day.<BR>I was immensely fascinated by these writings.

But in the end I hated them. It's just that the first person character is a male who takes liberties in his relationships and then bristles at suggested whiffs of engagement of his partner or partners with other people - even if the implied infidelity is far from established. I find it very hard not to identify the character with Edmund Wilson himself, and then it's so hard to avoid a real repugnance for the man and the hypocrisy displayed by his character.<br />I have met this feeling before with Paul Theroux, even in his travel stories which are openly autobiographical. I'm sure I could never expose my thinking in the way Mr Theroux does. But, on the other hand there are extenuating circumstances with Mr Theroux and he does recognise the unfairness of his attitude, even regrets it. This doesn't happen with Edmund Wilson's character who seems not to think that his self-centred behaviour should be questioned - he's a man and he can do whatever he wants - not so those who associate with him. His entreaties to the women he seduces seem so [weak] to me - and yet they are successful in the novel - 'You know you're the only woman I've ever wanted to marry!'<br />And inexcuseable (for me anyway), towards the end of the novel there are pages and pages in French. I understand that multilingual people do sometimes switch between languages but I think this is appalling behaviour by the writer and the publisher when many, if not most, readers will not be able to read these passages. What are we expected to do - go out and hire a translator to translate the text for us?<br />The stories are engaging, even amusing, perhaps enlightening. But in the end I just didn't like them for the arrogance of the character, the vulnerability of the women he associates with (none of them stand up against him), and the self-indulgence of the author.	2002-09-09

I would also have liked more of the short stories to have been discussed - some of the great stories not yet made into movies, plays or operas.<br />And finally, in a critical analysis like this I would have liked some explanation of how Mr Butler determined his ratings, and I would also have liked some considered opinion as to why PKD has such a great following that far exceeds, apparently in number and reputation, such other SF stalwarts as Simak, van Vogt, Asimov and Heinlein.

My first attempt was rejected because I exceeded Amazon's allowance of twenty quoted words. And that tells you something about what I think about this novel - there are so many great words and expressions that deserve quoting, that - I expect - would stimulate the readers' interest. Having said this, I need to point out that this book is not a great story - but it is fabulous writing, almost poetry.<br />Here is my one quote (so hard to choose):<br />'And now I ask, \\"Who am I?' I have been talking of Bernard, Neville, Jinny, Susan, Rhoda and Louis. Am I all of them? Am I one and distinct? I do not know. ......' (p222, Penguin Books, 1992)<br />If you think the quotation marks are strangely placed here it is because Woolf uses a very strange voice in this novel - an experimental style - in which all the friends address the reader almost personally but in a way that merges their self in some way. Perhaps for me this was the least successful aspect of the novel - the friends were insufficiently distinct and identifiable - their voices were too similar. But the quote above suggests that perhaps this was deliberate.<br />Other pages that I would have liked to quote are:<br />p36, p38, p45, p60, p68, p90, p94, p96, p124, p136, p148, p150, p164, p179, p190, p192, p216 (not all of these were in my original review!)	2002-08-24

This is not one of my favourite reads.  In some ways I found it a labour as it went over the same material again and again, albeit in very diverse areas.  I understand the power law that Mr Buchanan describes and its implications, but it seems to be such an after-the-event view that can have little material impact on modern endeavours.  It proves futility.  It is as if what is ubiquitous is our necessary failure to achieve.  But I'm sure we do do better than that.<br />On the other hand there was one revelation in this book that truly fascinated me.  I have always been interested in the dinosaurs and their extinction.  Books like 'The Dinosaur Heresies' by Bakker and 'Hot-Blooded Dinosaurs' by Desmond developed a genuine need-to-know-more.  But the matter of extinction is so challenging.  There are strong suggestions that an impact of an asteroid caused such havoc that the dinosaurs became extinct - all of them, the small ones, the large ones, the carnivores, the herbivores, the pterosaurs (flying dinosaurs) and the plesiosaurs (sea-going dinosaurs).  And yet, for all that, other animals - notably mammals - did survive.  What allowed them through the window of extinction?  In my reading I have encountered this debate many times and most writers do have a preference for one theory or another.  But even those who do support the impact theory do not have evidence of an impact associated with each of the great periods of extinction that have occured through time. So, the thesis of 'Ubiquity' does provide an alternative - that sometimes the effect of even a small change will cause monumental alterations to the world according to the ubiquitous power law. What was the small change that extinguished the dinosaur SPECIES but allowed others to survive, and in the absence of the dinosurs, thrive?  It seems to me that knowing what this small change was would fundamentally advance our knowledge of what the dinosaurs really were.<br />The most powerful voice in the campaign for popularising the impact theory of dinosaur extinction is Alvarez who discovered the site of the impact that occured 65 million years ago just about the time the last dinosaur walked on the Earth. What Buchanan points out, that so few other writers do is this ....<br />'...the bulk of the long 1980 paper by Alvarez and his colleagues was 'confined to the geological and physical evidence for an impact, and the physical results of the impact.  The discussion of the biological results of the impact occupies only half a page. (quoted from M. Benton) The reason is simple: no one really has much of a clue about what an impact would really do to life all over the planet.'<br />This is perhaps the strongest argument I have read against the impact causing the extinction of the dinsoaurs.  Not that it couldn't have, but that the opinionated science community is so set on Alvarez' findings that they have taken the most tenuous suggestions from Alvarez' paper to support their theories.popularising the impact theory of dinosaur extinction is Alvarez who discovered the site of the impact that occured 65 million years ago just about the time the last dinosaur walked on the Earth.

(There is an excellent record of this group called 'The Inklings' by Humphrey Carpenter.)  Another member of the group was JRR Tolkein.  It's a while since I have read 'Lord of the Rings' (and I haven't seen the movie) but I did recently reread 'The Hobbit' and Tolkein is an engaging writer but does show a tendency to British parochialism.  Another member of the group was CS Lewis and for me he is by far the superior writer - for SF fans see 'Out of the Silent Planet' and 'Voyage to Venus' (aka 'Perelandra'), for fans of children's literature see the Narnia legends, and then there is all the Christian writings, such as the Screwtape books.<br />Charles Williams in his novels (such as 'Place of the Lion' and the one I am reviewing here) explored less of fantasy (Tolkein) or speculative/philosophical writing (Lewis) but concentrated on the occult/spiritual world.  In this novel there is a character who has 'conquered' death by power of the mind and self discipline. There is also a strangely unspecified threat/invasion from Africa (in some ways this perhaps foretells the waves of illegal immigrants) but it is a curiously dissipated threat.  The greatest weakness in the book for me are the archetypal characters that are all overwhelmingly British - even the African 'king'.  Not only that, but they are archetypal of the thirties when the book was written - hardly to be identified with now.<br />It is an interesting novel, if a bit slow, but I suspect most of today's readers will find it badly dated in a way that you wouldn't see with Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf or Anna Kavan.	2002-07-31

It is mostly about the discoverers, but also reveals a lot about what they discovered.  And the mysteries that remain.  The ancient Harappan civilisation - so developed and yet so static - the Hindu culture and the Buddha who grew within it (but where have the Indian Buddhist gone today - how were they driven away or why did the philosophy become unfashionable), the Jains - a sect of the Buddhists? And then there are the aboriginal peoples of India, the Moslem invasions, and, of course, the British.<br />I have had the good fortune to visit India on several trips - visiting the Taj Mahal, the caves at Elephanta, and Mahabalipuram.  But the most spectacular site for me is Khajuraho.  All these places are mentioned by Mr Keay (and, of course, many I have not visited) and I found it interesting to read about how each has a context in Indian history and helps us to understand better this continent of enormous population, of refined culture, and of such diverse mixtures of race.  But the most amazing thing to me is the realisation that so many of these sites were abandoned ruins that had to be found, explored, restored, conserved.  What rich pickings there were for those British colonials who took the continent to heart, and were not repulsed by its alienness.<br />Khajuraho is a case in point, where the erotic nature of much of the adorned temples was a real shock to early explorers.  And yet Mr Keay has some great words for it:<br />\\"No pin-up ever approached the provocative postures, the smouldering looks and the langourous gestures of the Khajuraho nymphs.  Serene rather than saucy, intent rather than ecstatic, they go gracefully about their feminine business, adjusting the hair, applying eye shadow, removing a splinter, approaching their lovers; then the kiss, the caress, the passionate love-making of first aquaintance, and the erotic experiments of a mature affection.  Here there is love and beauty, passion and joy, instruction even and inspiration; but anything less sordid it is hard to imagine.  One can only feel sorry for those generations of Europeans whose own sexual inhibitions prevented them from seeing it that way.\\"<br />Mr Keay explores literature (such as the Ramayana), the leftovers of earlier civilisation (such as coins), architecture (Buddhist, Hindu and Moslem), and paintings.  There are a couple of add-on chapters that seem a bit out of place, concerning flora and fauna.  But I was a little disappointed that there was nothing of mathematics, astronomy, music ....

Dick Volume 4: The Minority Report (Citadel Twilight)	Books	4	14	19	N	N	all those posters - I had to read it again	With the appearance of the movie I just had to read the story again.  'The Minority Report' is a clever story and it does show tentative grasping at topics that were later to become so seminal in all of Philip Dick's work. What is real? Would an ability to see the future consolidate reality before it even happened?  Not so according to this story, because there are ways of seeing and times of seeing.<br />With 'Blade Runner' a successful movie with a 'cops'n'robbers' theme, I guess this one just had to follow.  I haven't seen the movie yet, so I make no comment in advance, but I am encouraged that the title is preserved (unlike 'Blade Runner' or 'Total Recall') and so is the lead character's name. Unfortunately the renaming of the precogs, as I have read in reviews of the film, does seem rather weak.<br />Of course, in all collections of stories, different readers will have different favourites.  In this collection I particularly like 'Autofac' but for sheer humour and unpredictability my favourite is 'If There Were No Benny Cemoli'.  Now, what a movie that story could make!<br />I have often seen hawked about the notion that the work of Philip Dick is a precursor to cyberpunk.  Personally I loathe cyberpunk and yet Philip Dick is my favourite author.  Have I missed soemthing here?	2002-06-25
US	49353662	R1M5AKZDSXUP95	0300088639	358007320	Grammars of Creation	Books	3	37	41	N	N	Inventive or Creative	I enjoy Mr Steiner's writing very much and I also enjoy reading about language and its impact on culture - so there are two basic reasons for my approach to this book. Even when Mr Steiner is not making sense for me - and I'll explain why below - his writing is clear and a pleasure to read (even though he does occasionally use a sentence structure with an inserted phrase that does not read well for me - requires me to read again and try to rephrase in my own mind).<br />Why does Mr Steiner not make sense sometimes? Well, I suspect that most readers will not have the breadth of knowledge that Mr Steiner draws on in this book. Arguments that appeal to Dante, say, do not convince me because I simply haven't read Dante (yet). By chance, arguments that point to Stravinsky or Schwitters are ones that I can support or challenge. But it is my belief that all readers will only have a subset of Mr Steiner's knowledge and so, more or less, some of the book will not 'make sense' to some readers. But there are areas which Mr Steiner covers and admits less background than he would like - mathematics for example. At one point he suggests that mathematicians are less likely to be 'mad' than other creators, but I would maintain (and perhaps I have a more developed knowledge on mathematics than Mr Steiner - although I hesitate to think this might be possible) that eccentrics like Ramanujan and Erdos (who Mr Steiner does refer to) show all the same extremes as are shown by creators such as van Gogh. Should Mr Steiner not have written of this area - is his scholarship, for once, lacking? Since his main arguments centre on the differences between creation and invention the book would not have been possible without him doing this.<br />But the most annoying aspect of this work for me was one of editorship. There are so many quotes in foreign languages that I certainly can't read. These are truly without meaning. Even if the timbre of the sounds (and without knowing how to pronounce the words this will never be accurately expressed in the printed word), or the flow of the words - rhythm and shape - were the keys to the quotes, I believe that, as a courtesy to all readers, translations should be provided. Surely it can't be suggested that these quotes are untranslatable?<br />So what did I get out of the book? I found a valuable discussion on the difference between invention and creation. A wonderful quote \\"The whispers of shared ecstasy are choral\\". And another: \\"If, as Galileo ruled, nature speaks mathematics, far too many of us remain deaf\\". And a thought provoking discussion on the difference in the life of created works - Schoenberg does not cause us to abandon Monteverdi - Dali does not discount our appreciation of da Vinci - Rushdie does not cause us to no longer want to read Shakespeare. And yet, Einstein in some ways does cause us to overlook Newton (although we do not disregard Newton for all this - and the Newtonian understanding is often adequate to solve problems) - Euclid has been supplanted by later geometers, we would never spend time reading Galen when modern medical texts are more appropriate.<br />My last comment about this book is also an editorial comment. I would have liked a bibliography to quoted works, both primary sources and secondary ones.ords this will never be accurately expressed in the printed word), or the flow of the words - rhythm and shape - were the keys to the quotes, I believe that, as a courtesy to all readers, translations should be provided.

They are less strong than Edgar Allan Poe's stories of a similar vein - almost childlike in some ways.  Invariably the expose at the end of the story is tame, rather trivial.  And I don't think I have ever read the words 'horrible' or 'horror' so often.  To be truthful about it, I don't really like being told something is horrible - I need to be shown. Often Lovecraft absolutely declines to do this.  Take for example 'The Statement of Randolph Carter'.  This is a engaging yarn but we never know what the horror is, we just have cries of anguish reporting it. Is this carelessness or laziness?  Or is it like a sound heard in the distance - peripherally - unrecoverable and disturbing, keeping you on the edge of the seat waiting just in case it sounds again?<br />Despite, for me, the poor structure of the stories and the weakness of their endings, I find it impossible to criticise Lovecraft's imaginativeness.  These are very creative stories.  It is commonly believed that Poe showed great psychological insight in his stories, but what does Lovecraft use as the trigger for his imagination? Is it a dread of science - an irrational fear? I'm not at all sure that I know and perhaps this adds to the intrigue of these stories.<br />I also enjoyed the notes to these stories with their historic and critical insights.  (Although what this statement means puzzled both my wife and I: 'The seemingly straightforward story of an explorer ....... appears more complex than it seems.')	2002-06-12
US	49353662	R30V3IFEE9IYUA	0679734465	131170192	Valis	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Again	I have reviewed this novel already, but here I am reviewing it again, and rating it the same. Why would I do this? - well, it's because I have just reread 'Valis'.  In the time since my last reading of the novel I guess I have changed, I have learned more about myself and more about Philip Dick.  But this novel is still mightily intriguing despite the pages of obscure philosophising which, to use another reviewer's expression, I just don't get.  But then I have said that before - admitted it - and speculated that the novel like the universe itself may not be knowable at any specified level of detail.<br />I admire the works of Philip Dick.  I like this novel, but I do not think that it is his masterwork and wouldn't recommend it as a first read of the author - it is too complex, has too many shifts of perspective.  But, for the reviewer who saw it a amateurish with unacceptable shifts from first to third person - I guess they just didn't get the fact that Philip, the author himself, is a character and even more important is his alter ego, Horselover Fat.  Philip gets 'cured' of Horselover, but before the end of the novel Horselover is back, suddenly reappearing ever so gently, as if he had never really gone.<br />When we read a novel like 'A Passage to India' (Forster) we are often left with a key outstanding puzzle. In 'A Passage to India' we ask if the alleged assault did take place in the caves on the ill-fated expedition into the Indian hills.  For the reasons of a novel, one question is enough to generate a whole world of incidents and speculations.  And at the end, we may still be no closer to a definitive answer (I read somewhere that Forster himself claimed that he did not really know the answer - perhaps, perhaps not).<br />Of course life is not like that.  We are all enmeshed in a Universe of the inexplicable - things we have to rationalise so that we can get on with our lives.  It seems to me that Philip Dick, while concentrating on key issues for himself - such as what is real, and how can we separate reality from fantasy or misperception - immerses his writing with many of life's mysteries.  Consequently I expect from his writing a fair degree of chaos - not answers, but questions.  And I also expect that the speculations of my mind as I read his works  are probably different to any other reader.  I recommend that you explore the works of Philip Dick - he is not a labour to read - and take yourself on your own journey of discovery.  Philip Dick was certainly a great guide even if he had far more questions than answers.  And, ultimately all answers must come from within ourselves - it is we who have to make conclusions and assimilate points of view.self - such as what is real, and how can we separate reality from fantasy or misperception - immerses his writing with many of life's mysteries.

Anna Kavan is one of my favourite writers - up there with Joseph Conrad, Philip Dick, George Eliot, W H Hudson....  'Let Me Alone' (search for it by title at Amazon, not author - it appears under one of Kavan's other psuedonyms) is one of THE novels for me.  'A Scarcity of Love', 'Eagles Nest' and 'Ice' are all very strong novels too.  But I was disappointed in this book.  The chapters are so short and disconnected in characters if not in theme.  I found it hard to identify with anything in the novel - collection of short stories, whatever this is supposed to be.  I understand, of course, that no one character could have experienced all the bleak outcomes in these items.  And yet I wonder if they are not all autobiographical in some way.  Perhaps Anna Kavan did feel herself to be a victim of these dreadful fates.<br />By chance I started to re-read 'Valis' by Philip Dick as I read 'Asylum Piece'.  In this novel Philip Dick does include autobiographical details exposed through both himself and an alter-ego, Horeselover (which is what Philip means in Greek) Fat (well, you can work that one out for yourself).  I don't think that 'Valis' is the masterwork some people like to champion it as, but is engaging in a way that 'Asylum Piece' was not for me. (This despite there being some very unclear philosophising in 'Valis' - at least, it is unclear to me.)  Now I know that Kavan, like Dick, can be a very engaging writer - but she fails this for me in this work.<br />And then there is the remorseless gloom of the thing.  For me all of this was mastered by Schubert in the song cycle 'Winterreise', in which one individual does suffer greatly and is beaten down continually by nature which seems to taunt him.  All the characters in 'Asylum Piece' suffer greatly, often at the hand of those who should love them most of all.  But Schubert ends his song cycle with an extraordinary vision, that of the hurdy-gurdy man.  This is someone even worse off than the hero of the song cycle and yet he is stoically going on, challenging nature, challenging fate, persisting in spite of it all.  This vision gives me great courage in my life.  'Asylum Piece' offers no insight - it just catalogues misfortune and injustice.d yet he is stoically going on, challenging nature, challenging fate, persisting in spite of it all.

Nobody knew of craters on the moon, of Saturn's rings, of the moons orbiting Jupiter, of galaxies or nebulae, of the types of stars..... until the telescope was invented.  What fascinates me about this is that it was such a modest telescope that first started revealing these wonders.  And once we started to see, we have refined our ways of looking which leads to seeing more, looking harder, seeing more ..... Perhaps if we saw nothing new we would stop looking but that just hasn't happened.  In some ways, it seems to me that the rewards for looking are immensely greater than the effort required to see.<br />Our understanding of stars as being huge thermonuclear explosions constrained in space by the force af gravity is so simplistic.  (But even that is a very refined view compared to the understanding prior to a knowledge nuclear physics.)  In 'Extreme Stars' we are taken for a journey to the limits of what it actually means to be a ball of gas - not necessarily hydrogen - that is ignited to nuclear burning by the force of gravity.  We learn of stars that are big, bright (big does not necessarily mean bright), small, young, old, dirty, decreasing in size as they shed gas via a stellar wind, decreasing in size as they expand and shrink - leaving behind a ring of gas.....<br />We also learn of the generation of the elements as they are created in the fires of the nuclear ovens that the range of star types create.  We learn of stars that collapse to nothingness in a black hole, that blink out in a final extinguishment of their nuclear reactions, that explode leaving tiny remnants that are truly extreme - neutron stars and pulsars.<br />When I stand outside on a clear night and see the stars gleaming down - distinguished by brightness (which may be due to the star's properties or simply its closeness) and colour only - I marvel at how our understanding of these remote and tantalising objects has developed.  This book enormously enhances that sense of the marvellous.This book enormously enhances that sense of the marvellous.	2002-05-08

'Life' is vast in its perspective - it is geological and astronomical as well as palaeontological.  Perhaps it suffers from this - it is just too much of a mouthful, especially when Mr Fortey adds those delightful personal and literary allusions.  I am all in favour of this humanising of science particularly in books that are not intended to be texts, but are nevetheless educational.<br />There are parts of this book that I found slow and unconvincing, but this might be because our knowledge is deficient or confused in these areas - like when life first ventured onto dry land.  But maybe this is exactly where Mr Fortey could have made the story more exciting, more questioning.<br />Perhaps I missed it, but it seemed to me that there was little reference to the breakup of Pangaea/Gondwanaland - both of which are well described early in the book. Australians are aware of the impact of the creation of Bass Strait separating mainland Australia from Tasmania.  After this happened (but well before European colonisation) there was second (at least second) wave of immigrants (presumably now immersed in the Aboriginal population, but it is possible they displaced the earlier immigrants) and these people brought with them dingoes - the first dogs on the continent.  Because these new invaders did not reach Tasmania (or at least didn't take their dogs) the island state kept some of its native fauna - the Tasmanian tiger (thylacine) which didn't disappear until Europeans hunted it to extinction, and the Tasmanian devil which thrives today - but these are gone from the mainland because of the impact of the native dogs.  So changes in geography certainly effect life.  And yet this is not discussed much in the book.<br />And then we come to the extinction of the dinosaurs.  We all know too much about this.  We all have prejudices and opinions.  I loved the way Mr Fortey approached it from film impressions - 'Fantasia' and 'Jurassic Park' - comparing the way we view dinoaurs as time passes and scholarship improves.  But here are some questions that no-one has ever considered for me.  Perhaps one day a palaeontologist-writer will venture here? Perhaps you have your pet questions too?<br />1.  It is stated that a world-wide iridium-rich ash is deposited as a result of the K-T boundary impact.  But how much iridium would the object have to be carrying to do this?  And why do meteors, asteroids etc have this iridium anyway?  Could it be that the planet was impacted by a cloud of iridium that has left a covering on other solar objects?  I have read some astronomical books that describe the formation of the elements in supernova, but nowhere has iridium been especially mentioned.  Perhaps there is a clue to something here.<br />2.  I understand that some animals/plants actually did survive the K-T boundary event; little furry mammals that were to evolve even into ourselves, but also larger reptiles such as crocodiles and turtles.  If we forget the animals rendered extinct for a moment, perhaps a study of the survivors will give us some further insights. How did they get through the event when so many others - not individuals, but species - died.<br />This is a very colourful, educative and entertaining read.

There is even a suggestion that there may be mixtures of robust and gracile forms of early humankind in their makeup - perhaps uniquely of all races.<br />The whole issue of human development, of arising consciousness, is one that fascinates me.  I keep thinking of the strange hypnogogic and hypnopompic experiences I sometimes encounter and I wonder if in the dreamtime - in humankind's early beginnings - these shadowy forms of consciousness were all that early people experienced.<br />Josephine Flood explores the mysteries of Aboriginal peoples - such as how they could have so early in human history have reached so far south (such as at Lake Mungo). Compared to the colonisation of the American continent, the colonistaion of Australia is so much earlier and yet the continent is certainly not an immediately appealing destination. And then there is the mystery of why the isolated Tasmanian Aboriginals quite suddenly stopped eating fish and seafood.<br />Not all these explorations are encouraged by the modern Aboriginal people and yet I am sure that a true understanding of their uniqueness will return some respect to Aboriginals for being just that - Aboriginals - rather than trying to massage them into some creditable position in what is largely an alien society.<br />This is a wonderful story of discovery, of posing mysteries and suggesting possibilities.	2002-04-04

Dick: The Dream Connection	Books	3	7	8	N	Y	Valuable, interesting but someone else's personal experience	The are two parts of this book that I particularly value, and a long section that I just let wash passed me.<br />The interview with Philip Dick is a great record to have - it's almost like me being with him and chatting to him. (Although I might have directed the discussions differently - if Philip had allowed it!)  I also appreciated Robert Anton Wilson's essay at the end - it's provocative, informative and a credit to this book with its challenge to Mr Apel's personal experience with Philip Dick, after his death (i.e. after Philip Dick's death, not Mr Apel's - I know that neither of those options make much sense to twenty-first century people - imbued as we are with rationalism and scientific method).  Mr Wilson's philosophy of believing nothing mirrors my own except that I believe EVERYTHING - or at least, everything that I personally experience.<br />So what of the remainder of Mr Apel's book?  His own experiences of 'connection' with Philip Dick after Philip Dick's death. The wole idea of life after death - or at least existence after death - is so tantalising, so seductive, that it is easy to be absorbed in someone else's testimony.  But to me, we have a mind to use and we should use it for our own evaluation of the cosmos we are embedded in.  My 'faith' is based on my experience and I will be neither uplifted nor crushed by someone else's experiences or harangues - no person and no written text.  Consequently Mr Apel's narrative is of interest but is essentially meaningless to me - I can neither believe nor misbelieve - it might just as well be a fantasy or the history of Atlantis or a theory about what wiped out the dinosuars.<br />But for all that I am not offended by Mr Apel telling his tale - we all have the right to speak and to hear. And in line with this I will tell a story of my own.  My fascination with Philip Dick grew from the mid sixties.  The puzzles the plots often present, the unique humour, the unexpected twists and so on are part of the appeal the novels have.  But there is something else.  I read and re-read the novels and short stories so that now I know the twists, I have some grasp of the puzzles, I've experienced the humour before - so it's not surprise that tantalises me.  And yet each time I start re-reading I find myself engrossed beyond any rational explanation.  I know that Philip Dick has technical skills as a writer (although some critics seem to like to decry certain aspects of Philip Dick's grammar or plotting as if language and the structure of stories are static things and alternative techniques cannot be used or accepted).  But I'm sure it's not just technique that attracts me.  One of the last of Philip Dick's book that I read (so late in publication) was 'The Broken Bubble'.  I was startled by a paragraph in it.  It seemed that I had written this - it was my voice that was speaking.  How could Philip Dick - who I never had the privelege to meet - know these thoughts of mine?<br />And what of life after death - what does my experience tell me? I suggest a study of Mahler's last three great orchestral works is revealing (and Mahler was a composer who Philip Dick referred to at times).  The eighth symphony is the traditional view of salvation (reward, not punishment - Mahler had excluded punishment in the Resurrection symphony - 'there is only God's heavenly love'); 'The Song of the Earth' is the resigned acceptance of separation; and the ninth symphony - well for me it contains a great outburst of a dying person looking back in their last gasp at the world they are leaving and connecting with those left behind.  I have experienced that same gasp - not from dying persons - but as if it has been left at particular places in the fabric of the cosmos ready for any mind that passes that way and is so attuned to grasp, regardless of the time of their passing.

There were some real revelations even for me even though I had read many of the source documents (including the published excerpts from the Exergesis).  I particularly liked the story of Philip Dick writing letters critical of some people who were actually his fans and sending them to the FBI by posting them in the rubbish bin.  If the FBI was going through his rubbish (as he expected) these letters would surface (which they did - but perhaps via his own carbon copies), but if his rubbish was not being examined no harm would be done.  He was an unusual man - perhaps in some ways unstable, and yet the body of his work remains to point in other directions.<br />The negative of this book is some of the pompous academic language used in the reviews.  As a testament to academic review the book is not a great advertisement.  Perhaps it tells us something of the people who actually deigned to review science fiction - but I am glad they did - I would have just preferred that they use the same open style that Philip Dick did himself - their own style rather than taking on an academic style as if that gives some extra creedence to their words.	2002-02-26

But it was too good not to review.<br />OK, from a mathematician's point of view there is no proof here that numbers and counting will never make us happy.  But the sequence of efforts described by Mr Boyle - from Jeremy Bentham to David Pearce - have all met the same fate.  A definite improvement in our understanding of ourselves and our social condition (although not without serious misrepresentation too).  But, in the end, there is always the realisation that the initial objectives - so powerfully believed in - are not achieved, that the shortcomings in each method of analysis leave us crying out for just another try.  Will we ever tire of trying? Will we just give up and move on to other human endeavours?<br />As I read this book, and met historic characters I probably hadn't given a thought to since I did High School British History, I couldn't help thinking that there is another book to be written.  'The Tyranny of Bits: Why computers can't make us happy'.  For all their achievements computers, like the tools of analysis described by Mr Boyle, can't help exposing their own shortcomings.  But does the world - especially the politicians - know this yet? Computer output is so seductive - we desparately would like to have some sort of tool that will take away - reliably - some of our own fallible judgement that we so often have to rely on. As Mr Boyle shows it is not numbers that can do this - I suspect its not computers either.	2002-02-07

And as we do it - sometimes with intimations of things to happen, sometimes with firm and dreadful 'knowledge', and sometimes with hopes - we are alone in our journey, despite those around us.  There is only true solace in looking back at the past, in seeing what we have experienced that no-one can take away from us.<br />There is little humour in this vision, little hope, little respite.  Always an aching emptiness prevails.  But for all that it does have a crystalline beauty - a clear and shining crystal with cold, sharp edges.  Read if you dare, but brace yourself when you do.

'A Scarcity of Love' is not as strong a novel as 'Let Me Alone'(for me it hardly could be) but it is very rewarding.<br />If you search for 'Let Me Alone' at Amazon.com you will not find it with the other Anna Kavan works.

And the absent-minded professor is such an archetype.  But Galois - the subject of this novel - shows himself to be the distracted genius.  What could he have achieved if he had been supported properly by his peers - mentored as Ramanujan was?  What might he have achieved if he had lived in a more stable political environment?<br />I enjoyed this novel although at times I thought it was a little long for the story it was telling.  And Galois was depicted as such an unattractive self-assured but doubting person. I particularly didn't like his attitude towards people - especially women - as portrayed in the novel, anyway.  It seemed that the negative in human behaviour had such a powerful influence that the positive - and surely he must have encountered some - was swept aside.  But that would lead to, say, never eating an orange because one day one came across a bad one.<br />But I do have a philosophical objection to what this novel is - or isn't.  Although I was attracted to the idea of dramatising the life of a mathematician because I believe it is imperative that we overcome the cultural acceptance of an inability to do mathematics - even a pride in not being asble to do mathematics - that seems to be all around me.  And one step in this direction is to put people back into the subject.  Who were Cauchy and Poisson whose names are attached to theorems and processes - and all the others so named.  Cauchy and Poisson I mention because they are minor characters in 'The French Mathematician', and I hope Mr Petsinis has not done them an injustice with the bad press he has given them.<br />In 2000 I attended a seminar in Orlando, Florida.  My wife and I took our two young boys (aged 4 and 6) with us so that they could experience some of the States, including, of course, Disneyland and Universal Studios. But later, when we reached NASA, we had to try and assure tham that this was real - not just another theme park.  And then NASA undid the good work by showing a 3D movie of life in a space station - in the next century.  Reality was confused with make believe again.  What does this have to do with 'The French Mathemtician'?  Well, it seems to me that the historic novel as this is - it is not history, a biography - is rather like a theme park.  It does have elements of the real but these are so buried in the author's imagining that it becomes difficult to determine what is reality, how close the imagining comes to the way things really were.

Dick: Selected Literary and Philosophical Writings	Books	4	6	6	N	N	More of the extraordinary - but then I am a fan	PKD is my number-one writer, both for style, but more particularly for ideas.  There is so much in this book that shows the man was a thinker, an explorer of ideas not just for the novels and short stories he could generate from them.  With PKD, ideas developed a unique philosophy which is why his fiction is founded on such a firm basis.  Even when his ideas change and we can see the change (for example 'The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch' and 'A Scanner Darkly') there is no contradiction involved, just a clear evolution.  For PKD fans who haven't yet read his non-SF novels I encourage you to do so - I would be surprised if you were disappointed.<br />PKD has also left a great legacy of pithy quotes - such as 'reality is what is left behind when you stop believing in something'.  My favourite, however, he wrote in a forward to one of the anthologies of short stories.  He said that science fiction is not about 'what if ......' it's about 'My God! what if .....'.<br />There is a lot of this in his philosophy too.	2002-01-16

With the immanent release of the movie version of 'Lord of the Rings' following the release of 'The Philosopher's Stone' I wondered if my son was ready for 'The Lord of the Rings'.  I had read 'The Lord of the Rings' several times many years ago and my memory of it was that it was a bit gruelling for a young boy to appreciate.  'The Hobbit' seemed to be a more gentle approach to the mythology of Tolkien.<br />I was also interested in how the older book compared with Harry Potter.  I have no doubt that it is much superior despite the fact that some aspects of 'The Hobbit' have dated and are a bit local in their English feel.  My son was quite engrossed and had no trouble refreshing the story each evening before we set off on a new chapter.<br />We finished reading the novel at our holiday house by the beach over the Christmas break, and this meant that our younger son was exposed to the end of the story too (he's just 5).  But he appreciated the story and both boys took to weaving Middle Earth stories about the adventures of their holiday.<br />This is a great story for sharing.	2002-01-13

Why did the woman have to have that adulterous affair at the start - was all that followed just a punishment? Did GoodNews have real powers, but if so, why were they so confused? (But he did perform 'miracles'.) Why did the husband have his transformation which was so problematic? The only character I really liked was the rapidly dismissed preacher - at least she did have some wisdom if not peace of mind.<br />But the eccentric GoodNews reminded me so much of Paul Theroux's 'Millroy the Magician'. Theroux's 'miracle' worker, however was full of eccentric but wonderful alternative views of the world. My family are vegetarians (not vegans) so we had some common ground with Millroy - I quickly adopted Millroy's saying - we don't eat anything that had a mother.<br />There was another curious linking of these novels. I noted when reading Millroy that two minor characters were called Phil and Dick - minor characters that were closely linked. Had Mr Theroux, I wondered, been reading my favourite author Philip K Dick? And suddenly in 'How to be Good' I came across two minor characters called Christopher and Hope - Christopher Hope is another author I have read and enjoyed.<br />'How to be Good' is entertaining in a confused way - but I didn't like its reflections on morality (it seems to me that adultery is a poorly understood 'misdemeanour' that is used to justify all sorts of outcomes - mostly unsupportable). If you like eccentric 'miracle' workers, with alternative views to the way we should live our life, read 'Millroy the Magicain' instead.	2002-01-13

The twists and bends of reality manipulated by the misguided psychiatric experimenter Haber revolve around Haber and the central character who may be any one of us - and his 'partner'. Indeed, for a while I thought that Haber may indeed be an allegory of God - and perhaps it is so. Haber does not have real power, but he can influence, cajole, manipulate. And perhaps this is the way of God with us - guiding, influencing, even threatening, but it we who have the power invested in us by our free will to take whatever path we choose.<br />But the mountains are also powerful characters in this novel - especially Mount Hood. In 1989 I happened to travel passed Mt St Helens well after it had blown its top. But here in this novel there is reference to the perfect cone of the top of St Helens.  Without looking at the publishing history, I wondered if this was the clue to relaity in this novel.  Perhaps when St Helens' shape was changed we would be back to familiar reality.  But of course the book was written before the eruption of St Helens and so my reality was confused with the reality shifts in the novel.<br />There are two very powerful apocalyptic scenes in this novel, and one shadowy one that is not described but hinted at in a most tantalising way. The blurb on my paperback edition (SF Masterworks 44) says this novel is one to read again and again. I do like rereading novels, but generally I take little notice of blurbs. In this case however, I think it is spot on.	2001-12-24

So, was Leonardo a scientist because he used an inquisitive eye to gain inspiration from nature?  We are told he was poor at mathematics - even for his day - and indifferent at languages.  Both characteristics I suggest leave Leonardo more of an artist and less of a scientist despite Mr White's claim.<br />Leonardo was, of course, profoundly enquiring and Mr White's biography does go some way to describing his life, travels and interests.  But I was left feeling remote from the man, less engaged than I would have liked to be.  Perhaps it was Leonardo's speculated homosexuality that caused Mr White not to delve too far, but I would have liked more research from Leonardo's comtemporaries to try and flesh out the man more fully.	2001-12-16

And he was bemoaning the fact that most of our potential relationships are frustrated, incomplete, never fulfilled. And that so much of what we feel and hear is rumour, stories from elsewhere, second-hand versions that we cannot verify or validate.<br />I have read a few experimental novels and I do find them hard going. This one was no different and until I got some interpretation on what was happening - correct or otherwise - I found progress slow and difficult.  If you arer looking for a quick easy read this probably isn't it. Like me, you may find this book to be hard work.	2001-12-12

My review is based on rereading the Ace book edition of 1970, a paperback plagued by misprints.  Mostly these don't matter but I struggle to make any sense of the third paragraph of page 140 - perhaps someone else can resolve it for me.  I was also a bit confused about New Men - sometimes they seemed to be marked by huge heads, but at other times their identity as New Men was obscure as in the case of Thors Provoni, the returning astronaut bringing, well, was it God - our friend from Frolix 8.  But then another character (it had to be Nick) was involved in this dialogue:<br />'God is dead,' Nick said. 'They found his carcass in 2019.  Floating out in space near Alpha.'<br />'They found the remains of an organism advanced several thousand times over what we are,' Charley said. 'And it evidently could create habitable worlds and populate them with living organisms, derived from itself.  But that doesn't prove it was God.'<br />'I think it was God.'<br />Of course Thors is the name of a god, albeit a Norse one and he is supposed to be bringing salvation for Old Men (and Under Men, the underground resistance) against New Men and Unusuals.  But nothing is simple in the worlds of PKD.  The ending is magical as characters entwine in unexpected interactions, the last few pages seem to go on forever - there is so much potential and I kept wondering how can I be so close to the end of the novel - so much could still happen, and what does happen is so unexpected - like Beethoven introducing a new theme to the last movement of the fifth just before the symphony ends - opening further possibilities.  Of course, just like life, things are rarely resolved and even if one thread of life does resolve, it can only do so in the presence of an infinite variety of other ongoing threads.	2001-11-26

This is an interesting book with its insights into the shape of letters and how they have evolved.  And yet so much of it is reporting other sources.  I wonder if there is any original material at all - perhaps this is just a compendium of ideas.  If this is so, I find it disappointing.  Using earlier sources as a basis for current study is obviously important, but I think it is beneficial that the current product offers something new - an addition to existing knowledge.  Perhaps I am wrong about this, but it is definitely the feeling I got.<br />And then there were the missing things - areas where I re-read because my interest was triggered but Mr Firmage apparently didn't have the same thoughts, or chose to ignore them.  For example, when we got to the letter G, or g, and looked at its typography and the way it represents different sounds (hard g in which it is unique, but also soft g which it shares with j) it occured to me that there is another pronunciation of G that Mr Firmage doesn't touch on, and yet is very interesting (at least it is to me - perhaps to others as well).  What about silent G as in gnome.  How did this come about? If people just stopped sounding the g in g-nome, why did they not similarly drop the G in spelling?  It's not as if there is any confusion with other words - we have no 'nome' with which ambiguity might arise.<br />In summary, this is was an interesting book for more but it seriously lacked completeness.	2001-11-18

Is this the multi-tasking that Mr Gleick writes about in this book?  But to me it is just maximising my pleasure rather than an active pursuit of greater use of limited time.  Of course, I recognise that I can live only my own life and it is difficult to tell if my thinking patterns are distinctly different - faster - than the thinking patterns of my ancestors.  Perhaps it is so - we may have been inculcated with faster thought patterns and processes, and they are now second nature.  But my major complaint about this book is that I'm not really convinced by the argument.  There is a wonderful passage in a novel by Robert Silverberg ('Dying Inside') in which the mind of a peasant farmer is invaded by a youth learning about his 'talent' of mind reading - which is rather uncontrollable at the start.  When the young man enters the farmer's mind, quite without expectation (or rather, with an expectation of a very limited mind and intellect) he discovers quite unexpectedly a radiant world of empathy with nature and the cosmos in which we are all embedded.  Somehow this view of thinking impresses me far more than the idea that early people were just SLOW, which is what Mr Gleick appears to be suggesting (or at least that we are fast and getting faster).  My suspicion is that all people in all times have filled their minds but with different things.  If we are faster in thinking, then we must have sacrificed something in achieving this.  I think I would prefer that cosmic identification to blind multi-tasking just on the off-chance that the person on talk-back radio I'm listening to will really have a new perspective on the topic being discussed.<br />There are so many short chapters in this book that I suspect it was designed in short grabs just like modern news stories.  I guess by now you realise that this isn't really my style at all.  I am far happier listening to a Brahms symphony - even one by Mahler or Bruckner - rather than a short pop song.  But then again, I do find Wagner long-winded and seriously in need of editing, and I do have a place for short pieces too - in fact, Mozart's 'Ave Verum Corpus' is my all-time favourite piece of music.- rather than a short pop song.

There are some interesting flashes, but too much of it is philosophising in a preachy sort of way, and when science fiction takes its stand with Chimborazo it seems almost out of place.  Most of this novel seems to be set in a desert anywhere on the Earth - I had none of the real alien feel that Mars should give, as so well done by Philip K Dick and C S Lewis in radically different ways, even Ray Bradbury - and who can forget Samuel Delany's 'Triton' - these were real places to visit, really alien and challenging.<br />And then the people in 'White Mars' seem to be placed there in the ethnically acceptable mix just as they were in 'Star Trek' - a pretty old scenario in present times.  I also wonder why so many utopian or alternative societies have to be built on deprived or degraded environments.  Even imagined societies I admired immensely, such as Ursula LeGuin's anarchic society in 'The Dispossessed'. About the only way of avoiding the difficulties of evolving a society from where we are today, seems to be by setting it vastly in the future as in H G Wells's 'Time Machine' and W H Hudson's 'A Crystal Age.'  To me, I would be much more impressed to have a new social order develop under my nose as I read about it, from the base of our current world and mix of societies.<br />I am also displeased in that an 'alien' influence seems to be required to 'help' people develop their social skills.  Humankind may not be the ideal society we would dream of, but we have achieved enormously and I have confidence that we can keep pushing forward, even through the dark times, into a new and better world and by our own initiative.<br />In all, I was disappointed in this novel, partly because I have admired so much of Mr Aldiss's earlier work.	2001-11-02

And mostly he succeeds. It was a surprise when I first encountered this book to discover what a great writer the man was with words too - and this book is so diverse with its historical accounts, its unscrupulous critiques of the then currently popular music, its humour (don't miss the story about the piano contest), its reporting of the musical world of the time, its insights about great works (Mozart, Gluck - but also Spontini!)..... It's a sort of Decameron of music!<br />I have subsequently read the Memoirs and these are not to be missed either. Berlioz was an extraordinary man and so neglected in his native France.<br />For music lovers generally, I would also draw your attention to Jan Swafford's biography of Johannes Brahms - it is very insightful and wonderfully well written.	2001-10-28

Conrad is a wonderful writer in style and the manner in which he tells a yarn - how then has this novel become so 'lost'?  It has wonderful lines ('Don't be in a hurry to thank me,' says he. 'The voyage isn't finished yet.' p22 Oxford World Classics), great insights (women respond to the smallest things, which immediately had me nodding in agreement from my own experience), spectacular descriptions ('Yes, I gave up the walk [along a cliff top with the intention of killing herself],' she said slowly before raising her downcast eyes.  When she did so it was with an extraordinary effect.  It was like catching sight of a piece of clear blue sky, of a stretch of open water.  And for a moment I understood the desire of that man to whom the sea ans sky of his solitary life had appeared suddenly incomplete without that glance which seemed to belong to both of them. p231).  The characters are admirable in behaviour sometimes, victims sometimes, regrettable in behaviour sometimes, or just plain confused - just like real people.  But one thing I really like is the way the narrator of the story is an observer, barely a participant of the events being described.<br />This may not be the perfect novel, but I urge you not to miss it. The chapter 'On the Pavement' by itself is worth the read!	2001-10-10

I liked this novel for its fresh style and evocation of a New York I had visited previously ('Time and Again' by Jack Finney - a wonderfully evocative novel enhanced by some great photographs from the time). But then the novel bogged down. I didn't like the literary way in which Martin told his tale. No-one would tell a story like that - reliving the events in the sequence in which they occured. People jump to the punch line, and then fill in the details - harder to manage in story telling, but if you are going to have a character tell a story it is important, to me, that things are managed realistically.<br />I was also haunted by another book I had read ('Bug Jack Barron' by Norman Spinrad). Was this story heading in the same direction? It sort of did, but in a more refined and thoughtful - if less engaging - way. For a while I thought our narrator may have ..... but that's another story!<br />I'm happy enough to have spent some time with this novel but its not one that I think I will remember fondly for a long time.	2001-09-21

In this book we find the tedium of endless rain, endless hotels and boarding houses all described in remorseless and unforgiving attention to every flaw, endless indifferent meals, endless penny-pinching ..... I thought I would scream if I read just one more formless complaint about the built environment and especially about changes - there are always changes. Complaints and complaints and complaints - trains and buses, fellow travellers, - it goes on and on. But then there are the almost unbelievable enthusiasms popping up. How can we believe them in the face of all the griping, all the apparent misery?<br />But then you may note I have given this book four stars. How come? Well, simply, it's one of the funniest books I've read in ages. It's Mr Bryson who is boring - not his writing. At one stage Bryson travelled through a series of Welsh towns whose names all sound 'like a cat coughing up a furball'. In fact, Bryson has a wonderful perspective on place names, which I gather he has carried all around the world. (My personal favourite names are not the wierdly humorous but the evocative - especially Canadian ones like Medicine Hat and Swift Current - but I do like Bryson's perspective.)<br />I have only visited the UK once but I did visit some of Bryson's tour destinations - Stonehenge, of course, but also Edinburgh, Ludlow and Morecambe. I don't think Mr Bryson really added much to what I knew of these places (except Morecambe perhaps) but I did enjoy passing through them again.<br />I enjoyed this book but I much prefer Paul Theroux as a travel writer (and he's very funny too), and Mr Bryson doesn't hide the fact that he too has read Theroux.	2001-09-07

And one of the women - shock, horror - had invested her hopes in her son who mysteriously disengages himself from the family. Of course I tried not to be influenced by the feminine in the message - and I have read many women writers (Anna Kavan is one of my favourite dozen writers and 'Let Me Alone' one of my top ten novels) - but I found myself trying to suppress the masculine in me, trying not to object to the way many men are portrayed in this novel.<br />In the end there were too many tears, too many disappointments, not enough mathematics, too many twists and turns, too many identical viewpoints. I have never actually attended a mathematics convention (and I wonder if Ms Woolfe has either), but I found the one described in 'Leaning towards Infinity' totally unconvincing.	2001-08-29

But having said that, the book is certainly not arduous to read. (My favourite books on language are the series Pelican Books published in the 1970s or 1980s - I remember especially 'Stylistics' by G Turner, but there were great books on phonetics, semantics, grammar, syntax etc etc - a fine indroduction to the study of language.)<br />The first half of Mr Bryson's book seemed to me to be well formed and had direction and inner logic that drove it along.  But the latter half seems to be more of a grab-bag of bits and pieces (although I did enjoy the very last chapter on word games a lot).  I was also disappointed at the emphasis on American English.  Important though it is there are many other Englishes that ought to be considered.  Unfortunately the small concessions to Australian English were often incorrect (for exasmple, Australians still call cookies 'biscuits' - although we may use the term cookie as well - we never call scones 'biscuits' as the American's do - this is certainly the mistake of an American perspective, not a British one!)	2001-08-06

But it was a great surprise to me to find George Eliot writing of this so long ago - and I think there is little doubt where her sentiments lay (but then the issue in 'Silas Marner' was clouded by the involvement of the innocent and victimised, versus the guilty and self-possessed - but I'm sure that was written by design to emphasise a point).<br />For a while 'Silas Marner' is a detective story.  I had always thought Edgar Alan Poe was the originator of the detective story - but perhaps 'Silas Marner' may have been a trigger.  This is an interesting mystery because we know who the culprit is and who the victim is - but will the culprit be exposed? and if so, how?  For me, the circumstances of the crime was a little contrived but it did create a stimulating situation.  But then the events of the story overtake the mystery and displace its resolution.  When the resolution does come it is a real shock, not only to the reader but to characters as well - the ending is gripping and brings forth such desires for the four principle characters that I found it quite breathtaking to read.<br />Some reviewers have bemoaned the use of this novel as a student reading text.  I agree with them.  I remember struggling through books inappropriate to my time when I was a student.  It is only when people get older that they start becoming attuned to their history and the background to their society.  The first George Eliot novel I read was 'Adam Bede' and its portayal of the Methodism I grew up with as an innovative cult was fascinating.  But, as a youth, I'm sure it would have been just wierd.  What would I recommend as a student text?  Something current and engaging.  As I have suggested elsewhere Philip K Dick's 'A Scanner Darkly' with its non-judgemental observations on the tragedy of individual destruction by the use of drugs, might have many levels of value to a student learning about literature.arkly' with its non-judgemental observations on the tragedy of individual destruction by the use of drugs, might have many levels of value to a student learning about literature.	2001-07-31

There are some similarities that spoiled the Conrad for me - especially because Conrad's treatment of the opening did not have the surreal and creative flair of Chesterton (the end wasn't as inventive either, but that's another story).<br />Both of these books are about anarchists and yet anarchism as a philosophy is not justified at all - I suspect anarchism was the unjustifiable terror of the time just as communism was to become later.  And yet this did disappoint me.  About twenty years ago I read 'The Syndic' by CM Kornbluth and in this there is a great rationale for anarchism (not that I think Kornbluth was an anarchist).  It got me reading some of the great anarchist writers - especially Emma Goldman and Peter Kropotkin.  For me, one of the greatest benefits of reading is broadening one's point of view, entertaining new ideas.  So Conrad and Chesterton both disappointed me in having characters I found it difficult to identify with because they espoused philosophies without in any way supoporting them for the reader.  (Another more recent example for anarchism is Ursula le Guin's 'The Dispossessed.)<br />Having said that, I found reading 'The Secret Agent' a labour, just as other reviewers reported.  It is so unlike Conrad's other books (although some of his novels I have found difficult to read, but not for reasons of triviality as this one seems to show).  But around page 100 things change.  The remainder of the novel I wouldn't have missed for anything.  It's the great luminous writing of 'Victory', 'Heart of Darkness', 'Lord Jim' and 'Almayer's Folly'. Quite suddenly the characters are engaging in a very personal way, and the events of the novel are surprising and revealing.	2001-07-18

It evokes so well the atmosphere of Hamburg in Brahms' youth (which added to what I had read of an earlier period in 'Anton Rieser' by Moritz) and later of Vienna. It has so many friends - other composers and musicians, and then there are the pieces of music that are so familiar to modern music lovers - the serenades, the symphonies, the Requiem, the songs and chamber music, the concertos.  Any sense I had that Brahms was less productive than the great giants he saw looming behind him - Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven and Schubert - was altered when I read that he had destroyed many of the works he was dissatisfied with, as well as a lot of biographical material, such as letters.  Fortunately some resources remain and Mr Swafford uses these continuously.<br />Brahms was a man as well as a composer/musician and I greatly admired the gentle way Mr Swafford narrated the story of the relationship of Brahms to the women he was so attracted to, but kept at arms length - especially, of course, and tragically Clara Schumann.  For me there was a secondary biography here - that of Clara Schumann.  She was such a courageous woman to sustain the friendship and the stream of musical advice that Brahms so needed, after Brahms had rejected following the death of Robert Schumann.  In my experience, few women are capable of sustaining such a friendship in the face of their own emotional disappointment. Mr Swafford describes Brahms' behaviour without any hint of criticism or speculation - the facts speak sufficiently for themselves.  Another aspect of this biography is the explanation of the schism in music caused (precipitated?) by Beethoven's musical experiments - a symphony with a program (the 'Pastoral') and one with words (the 'Choral').  Berlioz took Beethoven's lead and wrote an especially influential programmatic symphony (the 'Fantastique') as well as less successful symphonies with vocal elements (such as 'Romeo and Juliet').  This was taken on enthusiastically as the new wave - emotional rather than academic music.  Liszt and Wagner were the great leaders in Germany of this modern school.  In the meantime there was a reargaurd action lead by Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann to try and retain the historic development of music and reject radical change (Mendelssohn's revival of interest in the music of JS Bach is an example of this).  Brahms arrived in this schism and was immediately championed as the future of music by Robert Schumann - was this the cause of Brahms' rejection of women - a sense of duty to Schumann's prediction?<br />Like all biographies that are chronologically described there is always a deep sense of sadness as we read of the end of life. But after the gruelling and sad description of Brahms later life and death, Mr Swafford ends the biography with an essay that explores Brahms place in history and explores why we still enjoy the music despite the general decline in musical appreciation that Brahms could see coming.  Was Brahms the end of the historic development line in music?  Did Liszt, Wagner, Bruckner, Mahler and Richard Struass win the battle of the schism?  It seems that Brahms' music was fostered by his political wisdom (despite some personal abrasiveness), but if that were the case the music would have disappeared along with that of all the composers Brahms admired (with the exception of Dvorak).<br />But there is another school of music - that of Scheonberg, a composer whom I have grown to admire recently more than I would have expected twenty years ago.  But Brahms and Schoenberg?  It's an interesting speculation and Mr Swafford does reflect on it with an insight that adds measurably to the biography.nd Juliet').

According to this book all of us have an organ in our nose that responds to airborne signals, but these signals may not have smells.  So, the fact that much of this book is about smell may confuse - it certainly took me close to the end of the book before I realised that Jacobsen's Organ responds not necessarily to smell but to other vapours.  The fact that the olfactory nerve does respond to smell demeans Jacobsen's Organ if it too responds to smell.  But what if Jacobsens' Organ responds to vapours that do not smell?  This is a very striking possibility.<br />Experiments have been done on animals that also possess a Jacobsen's Organ and Mr Watson describes the data gathered from such experiments - inferring extensions to human beings.  We know that animals respond to chemical signals called pheromones.  Are there similar messages passing between people?<br />For those of us who do have a sense of small (most people) I like to call smell the 'involuntary' sense - we must breathe so we must smell whatever is carried in the air.  There is no other similar sense except touch - and that only in the blessedly rare occurence of torture.  We can always cover our eyes or ears, keep our mouths closed.  But we cannot stop breathing for any length of time.  Consequently I was interested in Mr Watson's information about smell - its types, and our reactions to them.<br />But the real value from this book didn't come, for me, in the descriptions of smell (which I found rather rambling), but in the description of Jacobsen's Organ - of which I had been totally ignorant.  And the possibility of sensing non-smelling signals - pheromones perhaps - that circulate involuntarily between people is startling.  Is that sense of instant bonding that occasionally occurs when I meet someone caused by messages passing between us, sensed by our Jacobsen's Organs and immediately modifying our mood?	2001-06-13

His novels often become absorbing despite flat passages and parts that, for me at least, are bordering on the unacceptable - the actions and thoughts of characters sometimes seem contrary to behaviour that seems at all natural to me.<br />I missed the sense of the exotic in this novel that I got from 'A Passage to India' and 'Where Angels Fear to Tread' - and yet the world of the priveleged in the UK and the cloisters of Cambridge University are exotic for me.  It's just that they are so gloomy in this novel - gloomy and troubled.  Even the countryside is blighted by the freight trains that repeatedly claim lives as they tramp the landscape.<br />This novel also has melodramatic elements that stretched my sense of credibility, however revelations of surprises are wonderfully managed.  While my thoughts were heading in the right direction with the major revelation, when it did come it brought a true 'aha!' feeling - it made so much sense and yet I, like the characters in the story, had not seen it coming.<br />But, perhaps for me, the most disappointing aspect of this novel is its attitude towards the 'disadvantaged'.  As in the movie 'Edward Scissorhand' the 'distorted' person, while capable of receiving small 'gifts of love' (as Morike put it - see Hugo Wolf's song 'Verborgenheit') it seems from these views of life that the realistic approach to the 'distorted' is that they are incapable of true happiness or fulfilment.  This is a view I certainly don't subscribe to.	2001-06-03

These comments, however, are based on an impression which is not fresh in my mind.<br />Hence, when I started reading 'Words and Rules' I had a slightly negative preconception to fight against.  But I was surprised. 'Words and Rules' is both entertaining and insightful.  It's discussion of the forms of past tense in English - both regular and irregular - gave me a lot to think about.  It 'explained' some of those curiosities that I had wondered about for many years - 'slept' but not 'sleeped', and yet both 'learnt' and 'learned' are acceptable.  Unfortunately I did become bogged down in the book as Mr Pinker uses more and more avenues of research to support his hypothesis that both words ('slept', 'learnt') and rules ('-ed' as in 'learned') are functional.  Anf that rules may be modern inventions gradually displacing the much older irregular forms.<br />From a philosophical point of view this book did make me reflect on how academic research often comes up with two hypotheses and so often both are proved to be partially correct.  Even when they seem to be mutually exclusive, such as the wave and particle nature of light.  Is it a reflection on the power of the human mind and its ability to support its hypotheses even in the face of opposing hypotheses? If that were the case, Mr Pinker is presenting no case at all.  A much more revealing document would be one that took either of the two theories - words or rules - and justified it in exclusion to the other.	2001-05-25

But he does something else, something that many of the best SF writers do - he is an educator.  But where other SF writers educate their readers about the latest scientific discoveries and technological developments - and the implications of these for individuals and for the environment and society of humans - Philip Dick takes on deeper things - the nature of reality, the psychological functioning of the mind, and in this novel, God and religion.  These are topics that Philip Dick certainly doesn't trivialise.  He obviously spent much time researching and understanding the philosophy of these ideas in a way that enables his novels to be a foundation for readers who are interested - and his novels have a way of making you interested.<br />I suspect that the average reader of novels - even literary novels - would be surprised by some of the background material that Philip Dick weaves into his stories.  In fact, I'm surprised myself when I realise I'm deep in some theological arguments that were probably 'lifted' from some research source and then brought to life in such an engaging way.<br />In this novel you, like I, might be confronted for the first time by a really tangible God, something drawn together from the ideas of generations and generations of philosophers.	2001-05-18

He explores ideas that many of us shove into the back of our mind as too complex or too distressing to spend any time with - they might clutter our lives too much.  But they are there always, nagging away in the background - how do you decide what is real? was that smile from a pretty girl really an encouragement to me, or am I fooling myself?  how can I tell?  does my wife really love me? do my children? is there a God? and how can I manage the terror of death - my own and the death of those I love?<br />This novel is more than an exploration of the ideas that Philip Dick worried about that we all do (Dick is forever quoting other worriers - Mahler, Dowland, the I Ching etc etc) - it is a very personal almost autobiographical sharing.  I read the novel, and read it again.  I don't believe I will understand all of it ever.  Perhaps some of it is not understandable in any meaningful way (Clifford Simak wrote a wonderful short story about things that may not be understood, called 'Limiting Factor') but it is such a wonderful trigger for my own racing mind as it explored its own journey amongst ideas.<br />...	2001-05-18

By all measures this is an extraordinary novel.  Part of its strangeness to me - its personal strangeness - is that anarchist philosophy has always been close to my heart.  But this novel is not an anarchist manifesto - it doesn't refer to Proudhon, Kropotkin, Goldman or even William Godwin.  But that's not to say the arguments are not surprisingly engaging.  I can't believe that Chesterton was an anarchist but anarchism does give an individual the personal power to exercise their religious beliefs as they see fit (or as instructed by their God) and we certainly know that Chesterton was a Christian.<br />So why does Chesterton use anarchism as a vehicle in this novel?  Perhaps it was to shock the reader into considering something seriously that they might not have done otherwise - to open the horizons of their thinking.  Not that this is a serious novel though - it is full of sparkling wit and humour.  One thing that anarchy does provide for Chesterton is a 'no holds barred' framework in which the story itself - its plot - can take whatever whimsical (and illogical?) turn that the author chooses.<br />Take the ride of this thriller with its confusion of parts - all the anarchists that aren't but leave you wondering if everyone else isn't an anarchist.  This ride is a real roller coaster with wild dips and climbs, twists and turns.	2001-05-18

I enjoyed this book and yet at times found it irritatingly slow, and at times it seemed to just scratch the surface of deeper issues.  Mr Winchester speculates at some issues and speculation is fine, but I was left wondering if he'd done insufficient research.  Surely something could have been established rather than just leave the speculation hanging.  In fact, from a philosophical point of view, perhaps historical writers should refrain from speculation if they can't establish any evidence in support of their supposition.<br />Did Mr Winchester have to engage in speculation to try and pad out the story?  And yet, whenever I did find the story start to flag, another incident would be narrated that showed what an extraordinary story this is.  The question that isn't addressed is the validity of Dr Minor's contribution to the OED, considering his insanity.  Was there any attempt to validate Dr Minor's contribution - or, in fact, any of the contributors?<br />This is an interesting story combining surprising elements - linguistics, English academia, the American Civil War (some of the best writing for me), London in the 1800s, mental illness and its management.  But for me the book was not entirely worthy of its subject.	2001-05-05

Here's what I wrote the first time:<br /><br />I came to this novel after being mildly disappointed by'Ice'.. (I have since revised my impression of 'Ice' after reading it a second time.) Whereas 'Ice' is a cold and bitter novel about futile struggle, 'Eagles' Nest' is hot, exotic and hallucinogenic. The naturally occurring 'drugs' that distort reality from time to time in the heat of the remote location our hero has fled to, create an eerie and lasting vision. And the flight from this place of apparent refuge returns the reader to the cold reality of everyday life - for me, with quite a jolt.<br /><br />I noticed as I read this time where the apostrophe should be in the title - and corrected my error. I can't correct Amazon.com's.<br /><br />This story is strangely hallucinogenic for me. I was left with lasting images when I read it the first time. But where were they? I didn't seem to encounter them again - something like them, but not the same! And now I have new striking images in my mind. This is very strange!!  And, as I was reading the novel I dreamt, amongst other things, of a cloud suddenly dropping over me from a hugely precipitous height. I didn't remember that from my earlier reading of 'Eagles' Nest' so when I got to it I was immensely surprised - deep down I must have remembered it. This is a very strange novel, but also very engaging.<br /><br />Other recommendations:<br /><br />'Ice' by Anna Kavan<br /><br />'Let Me Alone' by Anna Kavan<br /><br />'A Scarcity of Love' by Anna Kavan<br /><br />'The Tartar Steppe' by Dino Buzzati<br /><br />'The House on the Borderland' by William Hope Hodgson<br /><br />'A Crystal Age' by W H Hudson	2001-05-02

Some strengths are good - some are selfish and unforgiveable.  Some weknesses are awful flaws, but others are precautions that help an individual avoid greater disasters.  The characters in this novel are fascinating.  I kept hoping I would find one I could identify with unequivocally, but found myself cringeing at some of the outcomes and then forgiving the character because no decisions are ever made without reason and feeling.<br />I came to this novel from several other novels by Anna Kavan that I hold in very high esteem.  This novel doesn't disappoint, but doesn't quite reach the exulted heights of 'Let Me Alone'.  Kavan's fresh writing style has not dated at all and its vivid imagery takes one back to the time about which she writes, and the place as well.  But its in the charcaters and their interactions that Kavan shows her true insights.	2001-05-02

For years I searched for 'Science and Sanity' by Alfred Korzybski but it was well out of print. (Now that I have the resources of the Internet at my fingertips I'm sure my search will be more productive.) I did learn more about General Semantics from various books I read on linguistics. I'm still interested in the Null-A concepts but on re-reading this novel I'm not as satisfied in it as a lead in to General Semantics (but then it did trigger my initial interest).  Science Fiction writers do often take up ideas and educate the readers with them - often technological or scientific ideas - but not always.  Philip K Dick introduced the concept of empathy to me ('Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep') in a way that I will never forget.  Unfortunately I do not believe Mr van Vogt does such a good job here.<br />As for the story - it's a good yarn with some really radical ideas and excellent imagery.	2001-04-26

For the rest I found the story appallingly ugly. Was Mr Rucker using bodily functions and, especially smell, that most pervasive of all senses, to demonstrate a symbiosis developing between humankind and the moldies (an invention of humankind)? But everytime I found some part of the story that seemed to catch a bit of my interest I found it snatched away by the ugliness again. There was also the matter of the time sequencing shown by the dates at the start of each chapter - I found myself having to go back again and again to try to understand how the events actually unfolded. (One of the aliens at the end of the novel does have a time independent (?) existance that Mr Rucker might have been trying to prepare us for - but I just found it a labour). A novel with a really interesting time sequencing is Piers Anthony's 'Chthon' and this unusual word - chthon - does pop up in 'Freeware'.<br />I was disappointed in this novel because I enjoyed Mr Rucker's book on infinity, 'Infinity and the Mind', with its fascinating concepts of different sizes of infinity and the elegant ways in which these can be demonstrated. I also enjoyed his novel 'White Light' which is quite different to 'Freeware'.	2001-04-26

OK, so it's about children, but then so was 'Lord of the Flies'  OK, so I did study 'Lord of the Flies' as an adolescent at school (and hated it).  'Holes' actually made me think of a very grim adult novel that is one of my favourites - 'The Tartar Steppe' by Dino Buzatti.  It has the same sort of deprived and remorseless undertaking of apparently futile tasks.  But 'The Tartar Steppe' remains remorseless and grim whereas 'Holes' unfolds to a satisfying resolution.<br />I read this novel after reading a recommendation on a discussion thread.

Like Brian Aldiss' 'An Age' which I reviewed recently it has the rather coy device of referring to the lead female character by her first name whereas all other characters are referred to by their family names.  Generally the novel is not at its strongest in its human relations.  Many of the ideas kept recycling other things I'd read too - notably 'Solaris' by Stanislav Lem and 'Drop Dead' by Clifford Simak.  The vision of an apparently virginal and pastoral world is very captivating - recovering our lost environment? - and hidden mysteries add to this.  In 'Fifth Planet' the Misters (Mrs!!!) Hoyle - maybe it should be the Mr Hoyles - have created a novel in three parts - the preliminaries, the journey and exploration and the aftermath.  For me, I felt very flat when they characters fled Achilles with all the mysteries unexplained (which makes me think of another wonderful Simak short story - 'Limiting Factor') but the last third does become more engaging despite the melodrama.	2001-04-07

My only complaint is that it is about a topic with no resolution - it is a catalogue of attempts that have all met with failure.  But it is instructive that so many have tried to create the perfect language, and are still trying.  Perhaps it is the hand of God from the moment of the tower of Babel that is blocking success.<br />When I first started reading linguistics (triggered by an SF novel by Sam Delany called 'Babel 7') I soon learned that the origins of language were taboo.  Linguists had decided the topic had been subject to so much questionable and unsuccessful research that they would concentrate their work elsewhere.  But in this book Mr Eco explores these early searches for the pre-Adamic language that all human kind were supposed to have evolved with (provided evolution was allowed anyway). Of course Hebrew was THE candidate in the West, but even Chinese was considered by some.<br />When this line of investigation petered out the philosophers tried to develop generic languages that could be understood by all people and to do this they had to think carefully about the logic of naming things and the logic of the grammar that connects ideas. The categories of knowledge and the development of encyclopedias were triggered by these endeavours.  As I read this book, gradually I could see forming in the corners of my mind just what these people were doing, just what they were trying to create.  And I suspect it could be successful if we were taught with it, grew up with it.  But it is such a daunting task and always the expressiveness of natural language - what we have grown up with and what has grown with us as need has required - makes it seem a thankless task.<br />I guess this type of perfect language - unambiguous and universal - has never cemeted itself in anyone's mind - it has always been a dimly glowing ideal on the periphery of understanding.  Perhaps we are not genetically equipped for this type of language.  I value the effort Mr Eco has put into sharing these ideas with us, and value the time I have spent trying to grasp them.fort Mr Eco has put into sharing these ideas with us, and value the time I have spent trying to grasp them.	2001-04-05

It doesn't pretend to be comprehensive but does highlight various issues in an almost topic essay style.  The topics - why don't men lactate? why do women experience the menopause? why do human females have hidden ovulation (and associated continuous interest)? ......<br />However, I am disturbed by one aspect of this book - the thesis that evolution has developed a strategy for an outcome.  My behaviour is certainly not one designed overtly to perpetuate the species or to pass on my genes.  It seems to me that people - and far less animals - are very unlikely to have developed strategies that have resulted in us being where we are today.  Much more likely is the possibility that we are here today - and the other animals - because we happen to have certain behavioural characteristics.  Is it important?  What if, as a species, humankind had behaved differently?  My suspicion is that the variety of (successful) animal behaviours described by Mr Diamond and others, indicates that behaviour may not have such an important role as might have been suspected.<br />My other concern is that, for people anyway, Mr Diamond seems to suggest that human behaviour is consistent - that we don't change as we age, as we develop family ties and responsibilities. What is the role of parenthood in our behaviour and its changes? Perhaps someone needs to write 'Why Parenthood is Fun?'  It is undoubtedly a terrific challenge to gestate and then rear a child, but it is also so rewarding even when it impoverishes other aspects of our life.<br />'Germs, Guns and Steel' - one of the worst titled books I think I've ever come across - was one of my top reads in 2000.  I think that the book I am reviewing here shows again Mr Diamond's clear thinking style of prose that is a pleasure to read.	2001-03-26

Firstly, about the publication - it desparately needed a good proofreading, there are just SO many typographical errors!  I re-read this novel because it made a big impression when I read it first - at least ten years ago.  I still like the novel, but perhaps not as much as I originally did.  There is a bit too much of philosophising and pseudo science for my liking.  But it does have a very original idea that is explored well.  Unfortunately 'when all is revealed' and the explanations and speculations start at the end I suddenly saw a lot of what Philip Dick did in 'Counter-Clock World' come back to haunt me.  To be honest, I don't know which of these novels came first.  They are both well worth reading although, for me, the Dick is stronger and more inventive.  In the Aldiss, I was also put off by all the male characters being known by their family names and the main female character being called Ann - it seemed a bit coy and cute to me, too unbalanced from a sexist point of view.  Something I thought a good editor may have advised against.	2001-03-23

This is a serious, steady novel that lacks the shifts and reality twists that are so common in Philip Dick's works.  It has a broad range of well fleshed out characters that we, the readers, can identify with.  Their traumas and misadventures become ours.  Although the novel is driven by a pilgrimmage to meet the author of 'The Grasshopper Lies Heavy' it is the incidents around the pilgrimmage that give the novel its content.<br />Philip Dick was a great stylist as a writer, but his most distinct attribute was his ideas.  It was an interesting enough idea to have a novel about America divided by an iron curtain between Japan and German occupied zones after the allies had lost WWII.  Interesting but hardly astounding.  The way Philip Dick writes, especially about Japan occupied America, creates a real alternate world for the readers - a convincing image.  That, again, demonstrates technical competence of the writer - but many writers can achieve this level of creativity and detail.  When Philip Dick adds the component of having a writer in his imagined world write a novel about an alternative world to him - our world - now, that's a real innovation.<br />Many critics have felt flat at the end of the novel when the pilgrimmage rather peters out.  The author of 'The Grasshopper Lies Heavy' (the novel that depicts our world in Philip Dick's created world) turns out to be rather a disappointment.  There are no revelations here that we, the readers, might have hoped for.  But that made me look back into the novel - what is it all about?  And I settled for the moment when the Japanese politician - elderly, frail, compassionate - experiences the one reality-shifting moment in the novel.  A flash of light off an item of custom jewellery momentarily blinds him at a moment of physical weakness and vulnerability.  For several well chosen paragraphs this Japanese gentleman is in our world - the world of 'The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'.  Suddenly the reality of the alternative world that Philip Dick has created in this novel is overlaid by a greater reality - one every reader can readily identify with.  Is Dick wondering what triggers there might be in our reality - the reality of our lives - that might expose us to a greater reality? (See 'The Doors of Perception' by Aldous Huxley.)  Perhaps the 'I Ching' is a way to revelation - Philip Dick wrote about this in his personal life and my own experiments were a bit challenging to accomodate.<br />So what of that fade-out ending?  I don't think it is any accident that the object of the pilgrimmage is an author, and one of some disrepute.  I suggest that Philip Dick was leading the reader to himself and saying - 'Look, don't come to me asking me what it all means.  I just write the stuff.  Read the words and find what you can from them yourself.'- the world of 'The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'.

However, for me, there was a tension of frustration.  I knew there could be no resolution of the uncertainties (who had dishonoured Angela before her wedding? why was Nasar prepared to accept this? who was he protecting? why did Angela point at Nasar anyway?) because for these to be revealed at the end would have required the author to have engaged in the device of having the narrator withhold information from us.  It may, in fact, have been more satisfying as a STORY had some answers been given.  But in the almost journalistic (albeit a sophisticated journalistic) style adopted by the author this would have been unacceptable.  So why did the author adopt this style?  Perhaps, as EM Forster claimed with 'A Passage to India' the author didn't actually know the truth of the matter.  The narrative helps in the telling of the  story in a manner that disallows a resolution - the reader has to speculate just as the narrator has.  But this did gnaw away at me as I read the novel and compromised my enjoyment somewhat.	2001-03-15

Visiting Khajuraho and Mahabalipuram in India made me feel even more deprived of the opportunity to visit Angkor - Cambodia is such a dangerous place to travel to. Consequently I have satisfied myself as best as I can with books.  And so many of these refer to 'The Royal Way', a novel by Andre Malruax that it is claimed recreates the atmosphere of Angkor better than anything else. Consequently I felt even more aggrieved to find the book is just about unobtainable.  Recently, however, I did get a copy which I have just finished reading.<br />'The Royal Way' is a strong novel with good characters and ideas.  It is not a happy story however.  Hardship is barely rewarded for the characters.  This novel is NOT about Angkor despite the bibliographies to books on Angkor that cite it.  The two principle characters spend a short time on the causeway at Angkor, but even that is in the darkness of night. The novel does evoke great images of the jungle and the tribal people living there, as well as one temple from which the characters strip three huge carved stones.<br />I could speculate that Malraux deliberately didn't write about a brilliant glowing Angkor for the very reason that he didn't want people stripping sculptures from it as his characters (and himself as a young man) did from 'lost' temples overgrown in the jungle.  This is a good novel of struggle against nature and with ethics, but you should not read it for the feel of Angkor or any of the other major temple complexes in Cambodia.	2001-03-15

I have always enjoyed Mr Lem's writing and this novel starts so magically with the arrival back on a changed Earth.  I felt as mystified and perplexed - even childishly naive - as Bregg did on his return.  Do all children feel this way as they grow to know the world around them?  And the unfolding of the story was logical and interesting to me.  But where was it going?  Could Bregg ever integrate usefully into the new world.  Clearly he rejected the possibility of a return to the stars.  There is only one other possibility available to him.  What disturbed me about this novel was the sequence of unlikely events and revelations - built one on top of the other they left me unconvinced in the novel as a novel.  However it is a good yarn and has some very interesting observations about what makes a human being, casting some doubt that the result would still be human if some radical changes were made.	2001-02-27

The writer of this novel is better known as Anna Kavan - the name of a character in one of her earlier novels that she later took for herself.  There must be some hidden significance in that!  This is probably the strongest modern novel I have read.  The start is captivating and brilliantly exposed, the middle is a bit flat and rather remorseless, but the ending is electric. At long last the principle character feels an iota of remorse for her actions against an unlikeable victim of her actions.  I wonder how a woman could have written this novel - is it a brilliant psychological expose - almost a thriller - or is it a wonderfully personal account of a life written with startling naivete?	2001-02-25

I wonder how much they are censored by hidden rules of the mind, just as I am.  There are things that, regrettably, I find difficult or impossible to write.  But Philip Dick was no ordinary person and I have always admired the lucid way in which he can convey complex thoughts.  In fact, it seems to me that his writing ought to be tedious if not boring, but somehow he has managed to make interesting the inner musings of his characters without getting bogged down and impeding the progress of the story.  Here, in the Exegesis extracts, we see his own inner musings, and at times they do get tedious, almost embarrassing.  But there is so much of interest, material for an in depth study of an unusual mind for someone equipped with the skill and will to do it.

I have always been interested in the sex drive that I live with.  It is so persistent and yet it is impossible to know how it compares with the experiences of other people.  Perhaps Mr Ridley's book would shed some light, give some understanding of the drive and what it is.  But I had, of course, already given some thought to the subject.  It seems to me that there are three basic reasons for our society's attitudes to sex (which, incidentally, I think are appalling with regard to assisting young people).  Firstly, there is health of the actively sexual person and the health of the child that they may parent.  Secondly is the care of the child that may result, and finally there is the social impact of interfering with relationships which are, it seems to me, evolved to provide child support. Mr Ridley gets so involved in comparing the mating behaviours and sexual relationships of different species that these common sense points are glossed or missed.  He doesn't explain that sexual relationships are often associated with minor health problem at their commencement - and that health issues might extend to major problems such as AIDS.  It seems wise for people the have one sexual partner with whom their body becomes familiar.  He does discuss the incest taboo but almost dismisses the likelihood of genetic impacts except for children born from union between children and their parents.  The matter of unwanted pregnancy is anthema to Mr Ridley's thesis that the genes drive the sexual urge.  Consequently there is no mention of contraception.  If the genes are running the show why would we have ever developed contraception, ever had the will to do it?  It irritated me immensely to read that the genes want to push on into the next generation (not unique to Mr Ridley}.  Genes do not think, they do not actively attempt to do anything.  It may seem so to us from our perspective as the latest generation of the species.  But we are here only because the chemistry of the genes allows it, and that chemistry is automatic and spontaneous. People do make conscious decisions to have children - ask any couple who has had to resort to adoption or IVF to achieve this end.  Of course some children are not planned but moderm man does have the capacity to control the birthrate, and this was done in ancient civilisations and in some modern societies by infanticide - surely, again, counter to Mr Ridley's thesis.  Finally there are the social issues.  I disliked (but perhaps the research that indicates this is correct) Mr Ridley's thesis that humans have evolved in a manner that leaves man with a desire for promiscuity (to scatter his seed) but woman with a desire for monogamy (affairs will not greatly increase her chance to parent children 'as the genes demand').  This seems to be an apology for the behaviour of some men (note: some) and ignores the behaviour of some women.<br />I suspect that, with a better control over health and pregnancy risks in sexual activity, the social aspects of sex will change, that close friends will cease to deny themselves that final expression of commitment and caring.  I suspect that partners will becomes less jealous and that we will all engage in more intimate adventures, more sharing encounters.  But that is the future - generations from now.  While Mr Ridley spends a lot of time in the past (where none of us live) he gives little thought to the future where we and our children will live.<br />Some reviewers found the first few chapters of this book difficult to read.  I found all of it a labour, but perhaps that was because I was increasingly disappointed in what I was reading and what wasn't covered.  To note that human society, as far as sexual relations are concerned, most resembles the societies of some birds seems to have no value to me at all. At times Mr Ridley notes that research he is quoting is controversial.  I got the distinct feeling that he was not describing with even handedness current research into this subject - but that he was selecting research to foster a pet theory of his own.this subject - but that he was selecting research to foster a pet theory of his own.	2001-01-30

Its lively style and thoughtful content make it valuable, but it is heavily US-biassed.  While Wells and Ballard do get some mention, the absence of reference to other British writers such as Aldiss are perplexing (unless their underlying philosophies conflict too much with Mr Disch's preferences).  And at a wider level how could Stanislav Lem not be discussed in the section on aliens (especially, but not exclusively, see 'Solaris')?  I accept Mr Disch's suggestion that Poe might be the source of SF - but it is only an opinion.  To denigrate Mary Shelley by saying she is unread is foolish - I have certainly read 'Frankenstein' and found it no more difficult than 'The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym' - which I think is a wonderful novel.  Now, if I was arguing against Mary Shelley as the source I would point out that she only wrote one novel that could be considered SF - we might just as readily claim William Morris as the source.  Mr Disch wins my favour as a reader because of my respect for the work of Philip Dick for which Mr Disch seems to have similar respect.  I have read Lawrence Sutin's biography which Mr Disch refers to frequently.  Indeed I was flabbergasted to read a quote from Sutin of a meeting between Philip Dick and Mr Disch.  Surely Mr Disch could have given a more immediate and insightful report of this encounter! (see page 153 of the Touchstone edition). Does SF change the way people see things (SF readers anyway)?  I sensed a great shift from the military as heroes just after the Second World War, to something more ambivalent (see 'The Voyage of the Space Beagle') and, finally, to open distrust (see 'The Invincible').  But, was SF ahead of public perception or responding to it? I'm not sure that SF defused the bomb, as Mr Disch suggests, and, in consequence, reserve my view on other suggestions and observations that he makes.  But this book is worth reading, and is certainly no effort to do so.so.	2001-01-06

I suspect a lot of the culturally acceptable failings of people with mathematics is that the subject has been taught primarily without people, without history.  This history of zero should be part of any mathematics course, as should Rudy Ruckers 'Infinity and the Mind' - curiously absent from the bibliography here.  The fascination of Fermat's last therorem (and of the man himself), of genuises like Gauss (and, yes, it is good to note that there were problems that even he could not do!), of eccentrics like Erdos, will go a long way to motivating a study of mathematics.  There are a couple of places where mistakes have crept into the text but it's fun to suspect these and then assure yourself that these are indeed mistakes.  On the whole, however, I could not recommend this book enough. I do happen to have a mathematical background - it would be of interest to me to see how a mathematics novice would grasp the ideas in this book - my suspicion is that they would be carried along just like I was.	2001-01-03

'Almayer's Folly' is an engaging novel that kept my interest despite being read in a haphazard way during travel.  My favourite quote from the novel is: 'But a man busy contemplating the wreckage of his past in the dawn of new hopes cannot be hungry whenever his rice is ready.'  I enjoy the convoluted paragraphs that Conrad constructs that are surprisingly transparent for the reader - an extraordinary achievement for a man with English as his second language.  He really does show the power of the language to richly counterpoint ideas of place and people.  What, I wonder, was Conrad's skill with his native language?  'The Return' is a story of such mundane environment that I wondered if I was reading Conrad, but the unfolding of the narrative soon restores my impression.  is there some Anna Kavan here? (or is Conrad in Kavan?).	2000-12-06

Somehow (was it the blurb or the title?) I expected this book to be a complement or development of the ideas in Rudy Rucker's 'Infinity and the Mind', or som3e of the works of Raymond Smullyan.  But it shied away from technical aspects in preference to more general exposition. I thought, on starting the book, that I might have learned more about those mathematicians who work without reference to differential or integral calculus because of underlying difficulties in the rationale for using limits in analysis. However, I did enjoy the book and it did have insights that interested me.	2000-10-30
US	49353662	R3ESTCN92OJ8T1	072061029X	38343890	Ice	Books	4	16	20	N	N	Ice by Anna Kavan	When I first read 'Ice' (from Brian Aldiss' published recommendation) I enjoyed it but didn't think it was great.  It seemed to me to be about Kavan's struggle with drugs - a struggle she couldn't win.  But this was a  bit remote for me since I have never taken drugs.  Some years later I read  another Kavan novel - 'The Eagle's Nest'.  This is a hot novel in  comparison to the coldness of 'Ice' and, perhaps, more akin to my own  personality.  Anyway, it encouraged me to read 'Ice' again and now I saw it  as so much stronger because it's (to me anyway) not about a futile struggle  against drug addiction but something much more cosmic - the futile struggle  that we all embark on against death.<br />I have read more Kavan since then -  'A Scarcity of Love' is great.  'Let Me Alone' is something else again.  Will I ever dare reread it?	2000-06-15
