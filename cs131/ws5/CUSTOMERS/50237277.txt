US	50237277	R1FGGZC3NF929F	0743273559	950793123	1912: Wilson, Roosevelt, Taft and Debs--The Election that Changed the Country	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Why the US isn't such a progressive country	The premise behind James Chace's book 1912 is that the election held that year shaped the current political landscape.  The late government and public law professor and former editor of Foreign Affairs argues that the victory by Woodrow Wilson led to the Democrats embracing progressive reform, as seen through FDR's New Deal and LBJ's Great Society.  The split in the Republican Party was caused by Taft's conservatives versus Theodore Roosevelt's reform-minded Progressive Party, yet when TR encouraged his Party to vote for Charles Hughes in the 1916 election, he helped kill the party he founded.  Hence, the pro-Taft Republicans went on the conservative route as embodied by the likes of Ronald Reagan and the current usurper of the White House.  And Chace's book succeeds well, providing the background of each of the issues and candidates leading up to the election, and their aftermaths.<br /><br />TR is hands down the most ebullient and charismatic character, even when he was shot by a would-be assassin.  He gave his speech as planned before seeking medical treatment.  Yet he believed in the reform and not the erasure of industrial capitalism.  He embraced Herbert Croly's The Promise of American Life, which was against the Jeffersonian concept of \\"limited government and uncontrolled individualism,\\" but wanted to revamp Alexander Hamilton's attachment of the government to the people so that the whole people and not just a minority elite was in charge of the welfare of the country.<br /><br />Yet of the four parties, the champion of the little man was the Socialist candidate, Eugene Victor Debs.  His transformation from pragmatic labour leader to labour radical came with his imprisonment in the wake of the 1894 Pullman Strike, for conspiring to interfere with interstate commerce.  Debs also championed unskilled workers, many of them African-Americans, of the American Railroad Union, pitting him against Samuel Gompers and the skilled white workers of the AFL, and he advocated women's suffrage.  Of the four candidates, his is the noblest voice that fits the political climate most needed today.  He thought to achieve his brand of socialism by legitimate political means, at the ballot box, to overthrow a corrupt competitive and capitalist system.<br /><br />The political platform of the Socialists speaks much:  \\"shorter working hours, adequate insurance and safety rules, and an end to child labour,... direct election of the president and vice president.\\"  Some of the proposals are radical, such as eliminating the Senate, presidential veto over legislation, and making the Supreme Court unable to declare laws unconstitutional, but they embody the voice of the Congressman as the anointed voice of the people.<br /><br />As for William Howard Taft, he is portrayed as a weak incumbent torn between his friendship with TR and his loyalty to the conservative wing of the Republican Party.  His attacks on Roosevelt were counterpointed by his weeping at the loss of their friendship;  fortunately, the two reconciled after the election.<br /><br />Indeed, on 22 July, he had written:  \\"I think I might as well give up so far as being a candidate.  There are so many people in the country who don't like me.\\"  Just as well, as he hadn't originally aspired to the highest office in the land.  At his wife's Nellie's insistence did he agree to become TR's handpicked successor in the 1908 election.  No, as a jurist, for him, the ultimate satisfaction was as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, something he eventually got under President Warren G. Harding.<br /><br />Of the four presidential candidates, Chace looks the most unfavourably towards Woodrow Wilson.  Wilson is seen as a political opportunist who shifted position for power.  His well-known egotistical stubbornness, his tendency to begrudge anyone who disagreed with his position, and his refusal to change his position, however misplaced it might be later, is covered, but Wilson, hailing from Virginia, was a Southerner, and he vehemently denied any parity for the African-Americans with the whites--yes, he was a racist to the core.  A conservative Democrat, his refusal to pardon an ailing Debs, imprisoned for protesting WWI, demonstrates his spitefulness.  The only laudable thing I can say about him is his insistence on trying to tear himself away from the political party machine, i.e. Tammany Hall.<br /><br />Chace's book lifts Debs to the hero status he deserves, but also shows TR, whose Mahanism and imperialist tendencies turned me off, as someone who I favour after his political rebirth, especially in the final years of his life, when he fought for women's suffrage.  Today, what we need is a Debs, a champion for all workers, with a progressive movement that helps farmers, industrial workers, and those in the retail and service sector challenge and defeat the Carnegies, Rockefellers, and robber barons of today.on, hailing from Virginia, was a Southerner, and he vehemently denied any parity for the African-Americans with the whites--yes, he was a racist to the core.

Cross Love Hina and Harry Potter, and you'll get a manga series like Negima, which in Japanese is Mahou Sensei Negima!, or Magical Teacher Negima.  So far, six of the fifteen part series have made it to the US.<br /><br />Ten year old Negi Springfield is a sorcerer graduate who wants to be a master wizard, yet his diploma decrees he is to teach English at a Japanese junior high school, the Mahora Academy, to be precise, as part of his training to be a Magister Magi.  And yes, it happens to be an all-girls' school.<br /><br />He's not allowed to use magic at the school, yet there are times when he tries to use it to help others.  Some fan service comes out from one of his powers.  His sneezes are so powerful, they create a breeze, which causes girls' clothes to be blown off save their underwear, or at the very least, a Marilyn Monroe a la The Seven Year Itch.<br /><br />Arrangements have Negi boarding with two of the girls.  One is the nice black-haired Konoka Konoe, the granddaughter of the school dean.  The other is Asuna Kagurazaka, who has issues with him.  For one thing, he's replacing Mr. Takamichi Takahata, a teacher she has a crush on.  And as for him boarding with them, she derogatorily says, \\"We're supposed to learn from him, and wet nurse him.\\"  So much is her resentment that she plays practical jokes on him in class.  However, she ends up humiliated for every-time she bullies Negi, including a funny scene where she ends up bottomless!  In fact his attempts to help her out and make things easy lead to comic situations.<br /><br />The other students think he's adorable, and he becomes kind of like a mascot.<br /><br />Negi though has the support of the school dean, Takahata, his advisor, the chesty Shizuna, and Ayaka, the class rep, who says of Asuna, \\"Girl's got more issues than the Japan Times.\\"  Ooh!  Needless to say, she and Asuna are often at each others' throats.  But there is a party-type atmosphere when the class come over to Konoka and Asuna's dorm room for a study session, much to the latter's chagrin.<br /><br />The resemblance to Harry Potter isn't emphasized too much.  Negi does say some Latin spells as in Hogwarts.  And once, when he is seated on his broom, he tells Asuna, \\"Just...no Quidditch jokes, okay?\\"  And the mention of a love potion that takes four months is akin to the Polyjuice Potion in HP.  Another pop culture joke is in reference to certain low scorers on pop quizzes.  One of the five playfully says of herself and her failing comrades, \\"Welcome to the Mighty Morphing Baka Rangers,\\" baka meaning Japanese for stupid, with placards of \\"baka red,\\" \\"baka blue,\\" \\"baka yellow\\" and so on.  Guess who's one of them?  Yes, Asuna herself!<br /><br />One exciting episode involves a dodgeball tournament against the bullying students of St. Ursula Girl's High School, where the winning team gets Negi as their teacher.<br /><br />And yes, Akamatsu recycles some of his characters, mostly from Love Hina.  Negima is clearly an elementary school version of Keitaro.  Asuna is a variation of Naru, Konoka is a nicer version of Motoko, Nodoka, the library nerd, is like the cute Shinobu except with a quiff of hair that covers her face.  Fei Ku, one of the MMBR, is clearly based on Kaolla Su.  Like Keitaro, Negi gets into some circumstances of misunderstandings, but he isn't punched sky-high like the former.<br /><br />Yet that's nothing compared to the thirty-one students in Negi's class, their faces listed per a yearbook in the manga, with scribbled notes.  As he says, \\"Wow, how will I remember all this?\\"  Part of that is solved in that each chapter focuses on two or three of the students.  I like this better than Love Hina given the magic, multitude of girls, sheer fun, and fan service than LH or AI Love You.orm room for a study session, much to the latter's chagrin. <br /> <br />The resemblance to Harry Potter isn't emphasized too much.

They're perfection.\\"<br /><br />\\"You hear about it all the time.  A guy finds a nice girl, takes her home.  Then it turns out she has some sort of special powers, and she'll fall madly in love with the guy.\\"<br /><br />So in Chobits, presumably set in a future where persocoms are computers created like beautiful women, seems to be a next stage in evolution, kind of like the Stepford Wives.  And persocom designers have to be men, given the location of the on-switch.  Yes, it is down there!  Yet there is the mention of a man persocom, so who knows, maybe women design those!<br /><br />Struggling cram school student Hideki Motosuwa wants one; they are darned expensive, but as everybody has one, he feels out of touch.  He says, \\"I want someone to read me my e-mail.  I want to play games.  I want to download the latest porn!\\"  Ok, calm down, Hideki!  But it's frustrating, and besides, as he says, \\"It's not like you find persocoms lying around.\\"<br /><br />Well, that's exactly what happens!  He finds a cute-looking persocom with amber eyes and long wavy platinum blonde hair thrown amongst the garbage.  He finally activates her, but all she can say is \\"Chi.\\" He names her that, but despite being unable to speak much, seems to understand him, and even hugs him after a flying leap when he compliments her on how she looks in her clothes or .<br /><br />In consulting with his cram school classmate Shimbo, the beginnings of a mystery emerge.  Persocoms are unable to move without an OS, yet Chi does.  And when Hideki tried to plug her in, he got \\"No data\\" as a response.  Shimbo tries to connect his own laptop, Plum, a cute pint-sized persocom with Arabic style pantaloons, for some first-hand diagnostics, but Plum gets fried.  The same happens to the persocoms of Shimbo's computer-literate prodigy colleague, twelve year old Minoru Kokubunji.  It's Kokubunji who thinks Chi might be a Chobit.  Chobits are supposed to be artificial intelligences who can operate without an OS, meaning that they are as autonomous as people, not reliant on outside programming, but that's more an urban legend.  Whatever she is, she's still an unregistered persocom, so is she a homemade unit?  Yet, there is some self-installed teaching software in her, as she accurately recites Hideki's phone number.<br /><br />Chi's blank slate innocence and sheer cuteness is one the appealing things about her that makes her yet another of my favourite manga/anime characters.  Her tendency to imitate Hideki's gestures of frustrations is funny.  Hideki's attempts to teach Chi lend to the comedy.  When Hideki tries to tell her his name, by pointing to himself, she equates pointing at objects to \\"Hideki\\" and pointing at everything in his room, says \\"Hideki\\" much to his exasperation.  But Hideki gets help from his landlady Ms. Hibiya, who gives Chi some hand-me-down clothes.  One scene is followed by Chi imitating a scene from a porn DVD, pointing to the actress and saying, \\"This is a tasty side dish (okazu in Japanese).\\"  She then points to the landlady, \\"Is she a tasty side dish?\\"  Hoo-boy!<br /><br />Minoru warns him, \\"No matter how cute she is, no matter how human she seems, don't fall in love with her.  She'll only make you cry.\\"  Yet Ms. Shimizu, Hideki's cram school teacher sadly says, \\"No wonder so many people would rather live with persocoms than with real people.\\"  Heck, it wouldn't take me a minute to choose between a persocom and a real person.<br /><br />This classic manga spawned an equally classic anime series.  One variation is that Hideki is already working at the \\"With Pleasure\\" in the manga, whereas he gets hired in the anime.  But they parallel each other closely.

Love You, Vol. 1	Books	5	9	11	N	N	A namba wan with me	Okay, what do you get when you cross Love Hina with Video Girl Ai, with a bit of Weird Science and Chobits thrown in?  Chances are you'll get A.I. Love You, the manga by Ken Akamatsu, the mastermind behind Love Hina and the Harry Potter-ish Mahou Sensei Negima.<br /><br />Part 1 of 8 goes as follows:  Hitoshi Kobe is unpopular in high school, being picked on, bad at PE, and looked down on, especially by the vixen and popular class rep Kimiko Aso.  He's a whiz at programming, and given how his parents are gone overseas, has their computer equipment to himself.  The friendless Hitoshi creates AI programs, or Artificial Intelligences, of virtual girls whom he has conversations with, conversations he saves on 3.5\\" floppies (remember those?).  One day, an electrical storm plays havoc with his computer during a conversation with 30, as in AI program 30, and presto, she emerges from the screen and becomes solid.<br /><br />30, or Saati, as she's called (Saati, thirty, get it?) changes her creator's life around.  She reminds him of a promise he made that if she became a real girl, he would let her be his girlfriend.  However, she is something of a ditz, a blank slate (like Chi in Chobits), a total flop at cooking (Ai in Video Girl Ai-well at first anyway.), as she uses paint to duplicate the colours she sees.  Oh, and she gives her last name as Namba.  Namba Saati, number thirty, get it?<br /><br />Her computer abilities are intact even solid, as she scans a magazine and presto, via program option No. 4, changes into any bunch of outfits, including a high school uniform.  Once there, Hitoshi is noticed, as Saati helps him in math and PE with her mathematical abilities, and he begins to be admired by his formerly scornful classmates.  And she can manipulate machines, including soda dispensers and at one point, her master's bank account!  However, she's such an individualist that when she wants to join school clubs, she has difficulty adjusting.<br /><br />However, the most exciting episode comes when a vicious computer virus hits poor Saati, and Hitoshi's computer skills are put to the test as he fights to protect his girlfriend, whom he doesn't want to erase.  Sure, he could restore her from backup, but it wouldn't be the same, as he'd have to start over.<br /><br />There are repeated themes from previous mangas, such as the poor lonely guy gets a pretty girl who turns his life around (e.g. Ai Yori Aoshi, Chobits, and Video Girl Ai, to name a few).  Another is the guy who's alone while his parents are gone overseas (e.g. Video Girl Ai, and later, Midori Days).<br /><br />Akamatsu also made the comment that Saati is just like Naru in Love Hina, except that Saati has thicker eyebrows.  And, I might add, is less violent, much nicer, and more fun to be with than Naru.<br /><br />The original Japanese title for this manga was Ai Ga Tomaranai, or AI's won't stop.  However, Ai also means \\"love\\" in Japanese, so that could also be a play on that word, seeing as how in future volumes, he gains more and more AI girls.  So, \\"love won't stop?\\", eh? That makes this a namba wan for me in this sci-fi/techno/romance comedy.e most exciting episode comes when a vicious computer virus hits poor Saati, and Hitoshi's computer skills are put to the test as he fights to protect his girlfriend, whom he doesn't want to erase.

Volume 2 (v. 2)	Books	5	23	26	N	N	Yotsuba& a whole lot more funny stuff	The funny adventures of Yotsuba Koiwai continue in Kiyohiko Azuma's second manga series of the precocious little girl living with her single parent father and the fun she has with the gentle hyperthyroid Jumbo and the Ayase family next door, including the mother and the three daughters, the tall and attractive blonde Asagi, Fuka, the responsible daughter who often ends up the butt of Yotsuba's antics, and Ena.<br /><br />Things start with Yotsuba, Ena, and her friend Miura going out drawing together, and the difficulty of being honest about how one draws (or can't draw) without hurting one's feelings.  Ena is torn between her friendship with Miura and not wanting to hurt Yotsuba's feelings.  In this case, it's the way Yotsuba draws, which is in outlines without detail.  Hey, she's just a kid.<br /><br />Things get funnier afterwards.  After watching a gangster movie on TV with her father and Jumbo, the ever impressionable Yotsuba takes her water pistol after blasting them both, then makes her way to the Ayase household, causing all sorts of silly mayhem and speaking the gangster talk, and blasting everyone in sight.  \\"Ha ha ha ha ha!  Water came outta your nose, Fuka!\\" she says.<br /><br />The most hilarious adventures involve Yotsuba and a magic marker.  Yotsuba is minding the house while her father is taking a much needed nap.  After drawing a picture of her father on her cardboard box of personal things, a.k.a. the Yotsubox, she includes a beard on the picture, and then, on her sleeping father!!!  Her laughing expression upon her prank is just precious!  Fearing she'll be scolded, she tries to erase it, but hey, they don't call'em magic markers for nothing, right?  And since when is mayonnaise supposed to wipe off magic marker drawings?<br /><br />\\"CAKE CAKE!\\"  Playing house with Ena leads to Yotsuba getting a hankering for cake so she, Ena, and Miura go to the bakery, oddly named Mercredi (French for Wednesday).  I've never seen Yotsuba more animated than here, from the delightful look on her face in the bakery, to eating it at the Ayases'.  However, there is a reason why Ms. Ayase does not want Asagi to witness their cake eating.<br /><br />Yotsuba and the gang have fun at the local pool.  Jumbo's infatuation for Asagi is seen, as he brings some flowers, anticipating her joining them, but gets a bit upset when instead of Asagi, Fuka joins them.  Nevertheless, the funniest moment has Jumbo tossing Yotsuba in the pool in sight of a scandalized Fuka.  Ironically, Yotsuba is the only one who can swim, and she has the most fun, tipping over people resting in their lifesaver rafts to jumping off the lifeguard's chair.<br /><br />While Yotsuba does not repeat the stunt of releasing cicadas inside the Ayases' house, she brings back a frog to show Ena.  However, things get funnier when Miura, knowing of Yotsuba's fear of the giant balloon eyes that frighten birds, wears one of them, and goes to the Ayases.  Now if Miura wore a hat, she'd be one of the Residents! And no, Boxerman does not return, but we see the silly Daddy Dance.<br /><br />The last episode has to do with Asagi's return trip from Okinawa, where she brings all sorts of things, and the family wonders what it means for something to be Okinawan style.  There are a few references from Azuma's previous manga series, Azumanga Daioh.  Asagi's souvenirs from Okinawa include a toy shisaa, the lion-dog guardians of Okinawa and sata andagi, fried donut holes, which was what the teenagers in AD experienced during their school trip.  And in the beginning, Fuka is seen wearing a T-shirt with the orange Azumanga Daioh cat, or Chiyo-chan's fantasy father.<br /><br />I don't know what it'd be like being a parent or a neighbour of a girl like Yotsuba.  Part of it would be thinking what she will do today, but the other part will think, boy, she's so full of energy and reminds one what it was like to be young.  So donmai, donmai-(don't worry about it)  This volume is a worthy followupto Azuma-san's series.a worthy followup to Azuma-san's series. <br />	2005-08-02

Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts is his most challenging yet, as he and his fellow sixth-year students, having gotten the results of their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels), are taking their N.E.W.T.'s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), which is the advanced studies that sixth year students must take.<br /><br />Dumbledore and Harry recruit a retired professor, Horace Slughorn, to teach again.  However, it is not the dreaded Dark Arts post, but Potions(!), which means that a certain teacher finally gets that notorious post, much to Harry's dismay.  Yet Harry becomes a favourite of Slughorn when he exceeds expectations in coming out tops in Potions, much to Hermione's jealousy.  All this is due to Harry's used Potions textbook with some scribbled notations that produce quicker results than the usual instructions.  A note in the book reads, \\"This book is the property of the Half Blood Prince.\\"  Hence the title.<br /><br />Despite having fewer scenes in the fifth book, Dumbledore does play a key part here.  This time, he is Harry's instructor in private lessons, a seminar/independent study type class that meets irregularly.  As seen on the book cover, both master and student are examining the Pensieve, which made its debut in the fourth book.  Dumbledore is filling Harry in on Voldemort's background and early years, when he was Tom Riddle and later the notorious dark wizard, all in order to find some sort of weakness and pattern of the Dark Wizard.  One particularly hard task is to reveal a memory Slughorn had altered, at a time when Riddle was his student.<br /><br />Whereas Draco Malfoy, Harry's nemesis, was an overly nasty and annoying bully, here, he is somewhat subdued, although surly.  No confrontations per the fourth book, where he gave Hermione buckteeth.  He is up to something mysterious, so at Hogwarts, Harry spends a certain amount of time keeping tabs on Draco, who mysteriously doesn't show up on the Marauder's Map.<br /><br />On the lighter side, the pains and joys of having girlfriends are experienced by certain members of Gryffindor.  And Harry, as the Quidditch team captain, is given yet another leadership role for which he is respected, much like the Dark Arts club he founded in the last book.<br /><br />There is a stifled ambience in this book.  Precautions have been taken, and security is heavy.  I can't help feel that 11 September, with its oppressive aura contributed to that.  The Weasley's clocks, one for each family member, whose hands point to their destination, are all pointed to \\"mortal peril,\\" and not \\"work,\\" \\"sleeping,\\" or \\"in transit.\\"  And students going to Hogsmeade, the fun village, are triple checked with a Secrecy Sensor by Argus Filch, hence it takes longer to arrive there.  Hmm, sound familiar?  But that doesn't stop Fred and George Weasley from parodizing the Dark Lord at their joke shop-\\"Why are you worrying about You-Know-Who?  You should be worried about U-No-Poo, the constipation sensation that's gripping the nation!\\"<br /><br />The concept of Felix felicus, the Luck Potion Slughorn offers as a prize, is nothing new.  The Red Dwarf TV series episode \\"Quarantine\\" introduced Felix populi, which when injected into a person, gives that person unbelievably good luck.  However, more interesting is the Apparating course, where the instructor gives the students the \\"three D's,\\":  \\"Destination, Determination, Deliberation.\\"  This is something that applies in real life in getting from point A in one's life to point B, and if any one of the three are missing, we can't get to point B.<br /><br />This book is the darkest and grimmest of the lot.  As in the 5th book, there is a death of one of the main characters, and this deeply affects all the students and instructors at Hogwarts.  It is that devastating.  And more than one character has a suffering setback.  Given that, it wouldn't surprise me in the least if Rowling pulled a \\"The Final Problem\\"-like scenario a la Conan Doyle, only this time, we all know there won't be an equivalent of \\"The Empty House,\\" or worse yet, the denouement of the British sci-fi series Blake's Seven, where all the good guys get killed.<br /><br />Still, Rowling delivers an engaging story that brings things much closer to conclusion, and what will probably be the most action-packed, i.e. the book yet to come.only this time, we all know there won't be an equivalent of \\"The Empty House,\\" or worse yet, the denouement of the British sci-fi series Blake's Seven, where all the good guys get killed. <br /> <br />Still, Rowling delivers an engaging story that brings things much closer to conclusion, and what will probably be the most action-packed, i.e. the book yet to come.	2005-07-19

Recently orphaned, teenager Suguru Misato decides to hire a maid to clean up the spacious house he lives in.  On his way back, the bus he's riding on is hijacked by some thugs for some unspecified motive.  These nasties order the women to undress, including a cute girl in a maid's uniform, and the usually timid Suguru is angered at the way she is treated and mouths back to the hijackers.  The girl herself is shot at, only to deftly catch the bullets inbetween her fingers and thwarting the baddies.<br /><br />After the ordeal, Suguru returns home to find that same maid working in his flower bed.  Turns out that she is Mahoro, sent by Vesper Housecleaning Services to work for him, and that she is actually an android, albeit a former combat android who fought aliens attempting to take over Earth.  Upon being informed that her life expectancy would give her a lifespan of 37 days-presumably from a particularly nasty battle or years of wear and tear, she was given a choice of lighter duties that would extend that limited life to 398 days.<br /><br />Not only does she clean house excellently, she's also a great cook, and when Suguru brings her home-made lunches to school, he becomes the envy of his classmates, not only for the food.  When she arrives at school to deliver her master's dessert and tells his inquiring friends \\"I am committed to Suguru-san with every fiber of my being,\\" visions swim in their heads of Mahoro being his bedmate, and of Suguru whipping her.  Eager to clear up any misunderstandings his friends might have, Suguru invites them over, where they are won over by Mahoro's great cooking and friendliness.<br /><br />However, his homeroom teacher, 25-year old Saori Shikijou, who is incredibly stacked, is somewhat of a lech.  Ever heard of Van Halen's song \\"Hot For Teacher?\\"  In Saori's case, it's \\"Hot For Student,\\" and that student is Suguru.  Mahoro's presence inflames her, and she sees the android as a gold-digger.  Mahoro in turn is irked that Saori tries to interfere with her duties and becomes protective of her master.  She refers to Saori as that \\"ecchi sensei [teacher]\\" while Saori refers to Mahoro as \\"that sl-t wh-re maid.\\"<br /><br />Mahoro soft-spoken, kind, observant, and organized, and she does have a bit of an old-fashioned streak, as she tells her master that she doesn't approve of his collection of ecchi magazines (porn mags), but at least she doesn't throw them away.  Yet she's unaware of some of society's morals.  She unhesitatingly joins Suguru in his bath, to wash his back for him, seeing that as part of her duty as a maid.  And it goes without saying that she has made his lonely life brighter.  \\"She wakes me up every morning, makes me a delicious breakfast, takes baths with me, and the house has never been cleaner since she's taken over.\\"<br /><br />However, each chapter ends with the message \\"Mahoro's functions will cease in &lt;XXX> days,\\" reminding the reader that her time is limited.  And there is a connection between her and the death of Suguru's parents that he's unaware of.<br /><br />This manga yielded an anime that lasted two seasons, plus a summer special.  Think of Mahoro as an android version of Aoi Sakuraba of Ai Yori Aoshi, full of kindness and service, but without the shyness of Aoi-chan.heard of Van Halen's song \\"Hot For Teacher?\\"  In Saori's case, it's \\"Hot For Student,\\" and that student is Suguru.

I enjoyed all four volumes of Azuma Kiyohiko's manga comedy, Azumanga Daioh.  Her new series, Yotsubato or (Yotsuba &), is just as funny and crazy.  It focuses on Yotsuba, an elementary school age girl with four pigtails who seems to be in her own world.  But she's cute, as seen when she's waving at people through the door of the moving van, as she and her father, Koiwai, are on their way to their new home.<br /><br />On how she's drawn, she's almost like Chiyo-chan, the student prodigy from Azumanga Daioh who has two less pigtails than Yotsuba.  However, I doubt that Chiyo would climb up a telephone pole and make funny \\"zree zree\\" sounds.  When Fuka Ayase, her next door, freaks out and asks what she is doing, Yotsuba says, \\"I'm a cicada.\\"  Fuka kind of resembles Azumanga's Kagura, minus the competitiveness and the tomboy qualities.<br /><br />She is clueless about air conditioners, and when she hears about the connection between them and global warming, gets the conclusion that her father's a bad guy because he's destroying the world.  And the doorbell to her is that thing that makes people come out.<br /><br />The funniest segment involves her and Ena, Fuka's younger sister, going cicada catching with Jumbo, the very tall guy who helped Yotsuba and her father move, and when Yotsuba lets the cicadas loose in Fuka's house, clueless to the catastrophe, she merely goes \\"WOW\\" with her smile, then points to one and says, \\"There he is.  I caught that one.\\"<br /><br />There is a gag about Jumbo's height.  Ena, Fuka, their eldest sibling, the blonde Asagi, and their mother, all react to him, saying, \\"You're huge!\\"  His best comeback is when he says, \\"my ancestors were giraffes.\\"  But of the three siblings, Fuka, the high schooler, seems to have her stuff together, even coming to Yotsuba's father to have him sign neighborhood association (chonaikai) bulletins<br /><br />Another involves Yotsuba's antics at a \\"compartment store,\\" I mean department store, where she gets into all sorts of mischief, such as leaning over the escalator even though the sign beside her says not to do that sort of thing, riding tricycles in the store, jumping inside filing cabinets, and finally sleeping in a bed.<br /><br />We also learn that Yotsuba was an orphan that her \\"father\\" initially looked after but eventually adopted.  But her father tells Fuka, \\"She can find happiness in anything.  Nothing in the world can get her down.\\"  This is told when it's raining buckets during a thunderstorm and Yotsuba is out there splashing to her heart's content.  When it stops, she happily says, \\"It's sunny.\\"  Having a kid like Yotsuba may be all sorts of trouble, but in the end, it would be a lot of fun and happiness.<br /><br />In Japanese, yotsuba means \\"four leaf\\", as in clover.  Yotsuba herself has four pigtails, plus her hair is green per the manga cover, so that fits.  And I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out.  If this ever gets animated, I will definitely spring for it.  And hopefully, Kaneda Tomoko, who did Chiyo-chan's voice in Azumanga Daioh, will play Yotsuba.gets into all sorts of mischief, such as leaning over the escalator even though the sign beside her says not to do that sort of thing, riding tricycles in the store, jumping inside filing cabinets, and finally sleeping in a bed. <br /> <br />We also learn that Yotsuba was an orphan that her \\"father\\" initially looked after but eventually adopted.

Each manga is divided into ten or so chapters of roughly twenty pages each.  It has also spawned 25 half hour anime episodes and a second season of 12, the Enishi series.  AYA is a romantic drama/comedy based on the reunion of Aoi Sakuraba and Kaoru Hanabishi, who were betrothed to each other eighteen years ago, when they were both little tykes.  They played with each other and Kaoru was very kind to Aoi.<br /><br />However, Aoi, now in her twenties, goes out in search of Kaoru when she discovers their engagement is off, and to find out why.  Aoi, dressed in a traditional kimono amid the Western-clothed populace, She is quite bewildered at the Tokyo train station system, as it is her first time out alone and the lack of kindness in the busy metropolis.  A young man helps her find the right direction train platform and even mends her hanao, the strap on her sandal.  Guess who it happens to be?<br /><br />To Aoi, Kaoru is the best thing that has happened to her.  \\"When I think of him, I am truly grateful that I was born in this world,\\" she tells him before she realizes who he is.  But with her reappearance, Aoi is the best thing that has happened to Kaoru, as she cooks the best meal he's had in ages, and her habit of clutching things when she sleeps includes Kaoru, who gets flustered.  She is also overly polite, cute, kind, and later, as it turns out, overly trusting, but quite a worrier.  In fact she initially thought Kaoru left the Hanabishis because he hated her.<br /><br />As for Kaoru, a college student, he had a rough time with the Hanabishis, his adopted family, who owns one of Japan's keiretsus (conglomerates) and after suffering years of abuse from the patriarch of the Hanabishi, severed ties with them to live alone.  He even initially distrusts Aoi, thinking the Hanabishi sent her over as a lure to bring him back,<br /><br />A brief separation occurs when Miyabi Kagurazaki, the tall stern businesswoman in charge of Aoi's education, comes to take her back, but in the end, Aoi and Kaoru are left to start their new life together, but under Miyabi's care.  The series will introduce Kaoru's fellow student, the American Tina Foster, Taeko Minazuki, another student who becomes housekeeper to them, the spoiled rich kid Mayu, whom Kaoru befriended a few years back and who now has an insufferable crush on him, and the adorable Chika, Taeko's spunky and energetic cousin.  All of them become like a great family together.<br /><br />There are a few racy shots of Aoi, while she's showering or in the bath, part of the fan service, to be sure, but overall, she is one ideal woman.  The literal translation for the title, Ai Yori Aoshi, means \\"bluer than indigo,\\" but with \\"ai\\" also meaning \\"love\\" in Japanese, the title can also mean \\"true blue love.\\"<br /><br />At the end, Aoi says to Kaoru, \\"I am an inexperienced person, but please regard me kindly.\\"  As a reader who considers Ai Yori Aoshi my favourite manga AND anime series, I all but regard this series kindly, especially its sweet and lovable heroine.f separation occurs when Miyabi Kagurazaki, the tall stern businesswoman in charge of Aoi's education, comes to take her back, but in the end, Aoi and Kaoru are left to start their new life together, but under Miyabi's care.

OK, if Azumanga Daioh was about the hilarious adventures of a group of girl high schoolers, Cromartie High School is about a group of male students who are juvenile delinquents.  Cromartie has a reputation for tough guys, as proven immediately when Takashi Kamiyama, the most normal-looking student, drops a pencil.  One of Cromartie's thugs picks it up, then eats the pencil!  Kamiyama tests the lug by dropping a whole bunch of pencils, which the guy then gathers up and munches down on!<br /><br />Other funny things include the revolutionary way of fitting in with a bunch of delinquents, a handbook read by Kamiyama so he doesn't stick out.  However, things work out, because as Shinjirou Hayashida says, \\"say there was a rabbit, and it was living with a bunch of lions, and getting along just fine.  That'd have to be one bad*ss rabbit.\\"  To which another student says, \\"I get it!  Da*n, that rabbit rocks!\\"  And even if you get into and win a lot of fights, it doesn't count unless you have a nickname, like \\"The Fireball of 2nd [class]\\" or \\"The Hospitalizer of 3rd [class].\\"  Maeda is a good fighter, but as he didn't have a nickname, he's looked down on by his peers.  However, he does have a mean-looking mom that scares his classmates.<br /><br />Cromartie's surreal and bizarre appeal is based on three other characters introduced in the first volume.  The first is a tall bemuscled guy with a thick bushy mustache, slicked back dark hair, who suspiciously looks like the guy who sings \\"We Will Rock You.\\"  He never speaks and nobody knows his name, so Kamiyama names him Freddie.  I wonder why-ha ha.  Then there's a gorilla, an actual gorilla, who proves to be more intelligent than many of the actual students, and who is seen wearing a wristwatch and making a call on a cellphone!<br /><br />Finally, there is Mechazawa, a robot, basically a drum can with two headlight eyes dressed in school uniform, who's the brains of his homeroom class, constantly lifts the top panel of his head and oils himself with an oilcan, a satire of the 50's with the greasers.  Kamiyama and his crony,  Hayashida, who sports a Mohawk, aren't sure he's a robot and there's a running gag wondering if some of the other students will come out and say he's a robot.  Or are their eyes playing tricks on them, is Mechazawa actually a normal high school student?<br /><br />Other weirdness involves Takeshi Hokuto, the son of a rich financier who wants to control Cromartie High School, but is freaked out at seeing Freddie and the gorilla.  As he mistakenly enrolls in Cromartie, which is a municipal as opposed to an elite school, he quickly makes up lies to get him out of this mess, such as that he's fighting his own father, the shadow prime minister and evil archfiend.  The delinquents at Cromartie, however, have the intelligence of a pretzel and believe him, which deepens Hokuto's dilemma!<br /><br />And Yutaka Takenouchi, the tough, bald, burly kingpin of Class 1, loves field trips and going to historic temples and such, but he gets motion sickness from vehicles and is prone to puking or fainting.  So when Kamiyama accidentally sits down on him during the field trip, Takenouchi dares not lay a hand on him lest he barfs and lets everyone in the bus knows he's not infallible.  He also mistakenly thinks Kamiyama is out to get him, as being boss of Class 1 has gained him a lot of enemies.<br /><br />Note, there are two references to this manga in the anime series, based on how Kamiyama ended up in Cromartie, plus his one act of delinquency.  So getting this and the first DVD is essential, and you don't need to have a tough nickname, have a lazy swagger, and menacing glare to enjoy this manga.s head and oils himself with an oilcan, a satire of the 50's with the greasers.

US	50237277	R2IL50PSUVF48K	0823074994	928876682	The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits (Billboard Book of Top Forty Hits) 8th Edition	Books	5	32	33	N	N	Mandatory reference book for the pop music historian	It was during my pop music Renaissance in high school that I encountered the concept of how all those singles that I had been awakened to were on Billboard's Hot 100 charts, and those that entered the Top 40.  It was my buddy Keith Webster who turned me onto that concept and how Casey Kasem's American Top 40 was aired every Sunday on our local radio station.  Then of course, the highlight was finding out who the Top Ten were, and finally, at the end of the show, who was the new No. 1 or still at No. 1.  There was this horserace dynamic going on.  Yes, having any Billboard book may make one a music nerd, but I consider that epithet a compliment.<br /><br />Of the two Billboard tomes I consider essential to any pop music buff, not having Joel Whitburn's Billboard Book of Top 40 hits, revised every now and then, is tantamount to having green tea leaves and no hot water and cup.  I cannot stress how vital this tome is.  Whitburn's book consists of all singles that hit the Top 40 from Bill Haley's \\"Rock Around The Clock,\\" up through 2003, when Outkast's \\"Hey Ya\\" was at the top of the charts.  The book is lexically indexed by artist or group, with a brief blurb of the group, including members, instruments they played, DOB, and info on if any of them died, or if any entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<br /><br />From there, the columns under each artist/group consists of when the song debuted on the Top 40, its peak position, its duration in the Top 40, the title of the song, and the song's record label and number.  If a single hit the Top Ten, it is highlighted in bold so one can count how many Top Ten hits a particular artist had.  A round bullet to the left of the song title means the song went gold (sold a million copies), whereas a triangular bullet indicates platinum status (sold two million copies or above).  To use the masterpiece of my favourite group the Beatles, \\"Hey Jude,\\" it debuted on the charts on 14 September 1968, nearly three months after my birth, it was a #1 single for 9 weeks (yay!), spent 19 weeks on the Top 40, it went 4 times platinum, and the single was Apple 2276, the first Top 40 single from Apple Records, by the way.<br /><br />I must've spent years peering through but not buying this book due to the price, and it's only after twenty odd years that it's in my collection of vital reference books.  In closing,  I offer this tidbit for those who might feel miffed that a song they particularly liked either didn't make the Top 40, didn't stay at #1 longer than it should have, or reached #2 when it should've reached #1, or songs they didn't think deserve to reach #1, and believe you me, there are quite a few of those on my list.  The phrase \\"It ain't No. 1 till it's No. 1 on Billboard\\" is touted by Billboard.  The Hot 100 and Top 40 are well, just a way of measuring a song's sales and airplay, and those in turn play a part in how high a song reaches the charts.  But in the final run, it all comes down to how much you like a song.  After all, what's in a number?after my birth, it was a #1 single for 9 weeks (yay!), spent 19 weeks on the Top 40, it went 4 times platinum, and the single was Apple 2276, the first Top 40 single from Apple Records, by the way. <br /> <br />I must've spent years peering through but not buying this book due to the price, and it's only after twenty odd years that it's in my collection of vital reference books.

Again, owning this pricey book indicates one is a pop culture buff.  So why have this book in addition to the Top 40 book?  Well, ever think about any single that didn't make the Top 40?  Or what were the Top Ten singles for each year?  This is where Joel Whitburn's Pop Annual comes in.  Where the Top 40 book was indexed by artist/group, the Pop Annual is indexed by year, then listing all the singles by position, the #1's, the #2's, #3's, all the way to the songs that sadly peaked at No. 100 on Billboard's Hot 100 charts.  Within the songs that reached the same position, what determines its ranking is how long it stayed at #1, weeks in the Top Ten, weeks in the Top 40, and finally weeks in the entire Hot 100.  Hence, Bad English's \\"When I See You Smile\\" may have spent more weeks in the Hot 100 and Top 40 than Phil Collins' \\"Two Hearts,\\" despite both spending two weeks at #1, but \\"Two Hearts\\" spent a week longer in the Top Ten, so it is ranked above \\"When I See You Smile.\\"<br /><br />Each year begins with a time capsule of the top international and national headlines, fads and fashions, sports, and the top movies and TV programs that year.  There then follows a list of the Top 20 artists, their score determined by a point system, a 100 points for each week spent at #1, 10 points for each additional week, 90 points plus 5 additional for each #2 single, 80 points plus 3 points for each #3 single, 70 points for each #4-#5 single, 60 points for each #6-#10 single, and on down to 10 points for each #91-100 single.  There's more involving airplay, but I'll not dwell on that.<br /><br />Then there are top songwriters and artist debuts for the year.  For the year I graduated high school, the Top debut artist was the Bangles (yay!) the top songwriters were ex-Time members Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis of Janet Jackson fame, and surprisingly it wasn't Madonna or the Bangles who was the top artist that year based on points but Billy Ocean!<br /><br />Now, for the Top Five singles, there is included its chart positions history, from debut to its last week in the Hot 100.  Looking at the #1 list enables on to see who and how many #1 hits they had or indeed how many songs made it to the top spot.  For my favourite group, 1964 was a banner year, as they were the #1 artist, #1 artist debut, top songwriters, and had six #1 hits.  It wouldn't take a PhD to figure out who I am referring to.<br /><br />Of additional notes, there is a debut column, a 1 indicating an artist/group's debut on the Hot 100, or a diamond, indicating an artist/group's only Hot 100 charting entry, which may consist of one time duets between lead singers of varied groups, e.g. Ann Wilson and Mike Reno in \\"Almost Paradise,\\" one-time gatherings like USA For Africa, or novelty acts like Rick Dees or Buckner and Garcia.<br /><br />Finally, like its companion book, the Top 40, there is an index in the back alphabetized by song, which contains the artist name, its peak position, and year.  Some, including me, may think why not have a separate artist index, which would help, but that would probably double the price of this already expensive tome.<br /><br />Having this book takes me back to Memory Lane, i.e. my musical heyday, the 80's, but also a curious look at the 50's through 70's.  Me, I rarely look at anything beyond 1994 due to the type of music that began dominating the charts and still does today-some may call it music.  This tome goes from 1955 to 1999, and perfectly encapsulates the Billboard charts for the 20th century.Janet Jackson fame, and surprisingly it wasn't Madonna or the Bangles who was the top artist that year based on points but Billy Ocean! <br /> <br />Now, for the Top Five singles, there is included its chart positions history, from debut to its last week in the Hot 100.

It wouldn't take a PhD to figure out who I am referring to. <br /> <br />Of additional notes, there is a debut column, a 1 indicating an artist/group's debut on the Hot 100, or a diamond, indicating an artist/group's only Hot 100 charting entry, which may consist of one time duets between lead singers of varied groups, e.g. Ann Wilson and Mike Reno in \\"Almost Paradise,\\" one-time gatherings like USA For Africa, or novelty acts like Rick Dees or Buckner and Garcia. <br /> <br />Finally, like its companion book, the Top 40, there is an index in the back alphabetized by song, which contains the artist name, its peak position, and year.  Some, including me, may think why not have a separate artist index, which would help, but that would probably double the price of this already expensive tome. <br /> <br />Having this book takes me back to Memory Lane, i.e. my musical heyday, the 80's, but also a curious look at the 50's through 70's.  Me, I rarely look at anything beyond 1994 due to the type of music that began dominating the charts and still does today-some may call it music.  This tome goes from 1955 to 1999, and perfectly encapsulates the Billboard charts for the 20th century. <br />	2005-05-09

High school girl Outsaka Kanade can see a person's future by touching that person.  She's an altruist by nature, trying to head off danger at the pass and avert a person's fate.  For example, when she learns that Eri's boyfriend Ezawa, is going to dump Eri for a girl with dark long hair, she tries to set things up so that Eri won't get hurt or dumped.<br /><br />In contrast, there's her opposite, Naitou Arou.  He can tell a person's past but also at will.  When he learns of Kanade's attempt to change Eri's future, he uses the example of trying to warn someone who's about to step into a manhole.  Fair enough, you might save the guy, but they wouldn't understand it and probably curse you out.  His advice, \\"leave other people alone, otherwise the only person who'll be hurt is you.\\"  Also, what if the black-haired girl is a better match for Ezawa than Eri?  Wouldn't interfering prevent either from reaching happiness?<br /><br />Then there's the flipside.  What if you were a past-oriented person and learned of a tragedy after the fact?  In the same way, Arou is unable to go back to the past and prevent the accident.  The best he can do is call the police and give them the license number of a hit-and-run vehicle.  However, what if someone past-oriented totally enjoyed a hands-off policy and was smug about it?  Namiki Masahiro is that person and it's Arou's more compassionate nature that separates him from Namiki.<br /><br />All the same, Kanade finds solace in Arou, who despite his hands-off policy, is nice to her.  Arou sums things up the best when he says that even if one can see into the past or future, one can't see what will make a person happy.  And also, no one can see into another's heart with those powers.  But no matter what, it also doesn't pay to be afraid to touch someone, metaphorically speaking.  per temperament theory, idealists are more romantic and future oriented, guardians more cautious and past-oriented, which fit Kanade and Arou to a tee.<br /><br />Also included are two stories.  After The Festival involves a guy, Takahashi, and a girl, Katsura, who are on the same team during a relay.  Takahashi is tired from working on the preparations for the sports festival, he, along with Katsura, miss their intended train stop and end up spending more time together.  In The Mistaken Man, Fujisaki Nobuhiro mistakenly arrives early at school, only to find out he's entered the wrong classroom.  He meets a cute girl named Mishina Yuki before going back to the right room.  He tells his best friend Takeshi, who's puzzled because there's nobody by that name at school.  Sure enough, he meets her, but she calls him Takahashi.  A slip of the tongue, or something else?  The moral here seems to be that if one makes a mistake, turn it into a happy one.<br /><br />An interesting concept that succeeds with a pair of likeable protagonists.  Here's hoping the second installment comes soon.ake a person happy.  And also, no one can see into another's heart with those powers.

This was a serial killer, who in the case of couples, killed the man first, and if the woman was lucky, her too, as many left alive suffered even more.  What initially puzzled the LA police was that the victims cut across race lines.  Even though the first victims were Oriental or East Asian, the addition of dead Anglos put paid that theory.  But what set the killings apart from the usual convenience store shootings was their sheer savagery, as one of the victims had her eyes plucked out.  Another victim bravely spoke to him after her ordeal so she could remember his face should he be caught.<br /><br />Clifford Linedecker's account of Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker, is a well-detailed account that takes the reader from the first victim, to his being sentenced to death by a California jury, and even a to-date postscript, showing that he is still on death row.<br /><br />The book delves into more than just the killings themselves.  Linedecker explains the race and population demographics in LA as a background.  LA is such a racially diverse place, that various race groups formed their own enclave in the metropolis, such as the Japanese and Chinese in Cerritos, the Thais and Salvadorans in Hollywood Hills, and Mexicans in east.  It's also such an economic powerhouse that it could be an independent country if it chose.<br /><br />Night Stalker also details the working of the press and how things haven't changed since the days of Al Capone and Bonnie and Clyde, that of making killers into heroes.  In this case, it was the Los Angeles Herald Examiner that gave Ramirez his well-known monicker, The Night Stalker.  And the methodology used by detectives in tracking down serial killers-Wayne Williams and the Atlanta Child Murders is used as the example-is included.<br /><br />If anything, Ramirez turned LA residential areas into fortresses.  Demand for guns, security systems, fences, and guard dogs skyrocketed, Neighbourhood Watches sprouted like duckweed, and any unfamiliar person in the neighbourhood were reported.  In fact, one husband gave his wife a cyanide pill should the Night Stalker break in, figuring that death was better than what he would do to her.  But what also amazed me was the relative laxness in home security.  Ramirez entered via unlocked doors.  Why not just put a sign on the door saying \\"Hey, Night Stalker, kill and torture me\\"?<br /><br />Another chapter delves into the clues and how they weave into past history and the prevalent pop culture.  Ramirez's AC-DC cap fuelled the fire of heavy metal being the devil's music, and all amid the teen suicides that took place because parents blamed albums by Ozzy Osbourne and Judas Priest.  In fact, \\"Night Prowler\\" from AC-DC's Highway To Hell album was made the Night Stalker's anthem.  Another is the pentagram drawn on one of the victims.  There follows a brief discussion on the devil-worshipping and the Knights Templar.  At least Linedecker gets accurate Anton LaVey's sect that they don't sacrifice animals or people.<br /><br />The final section deals with the trial, which took three and a half years of legal juggling on the side of the defense.  Ramirez wasn't the most genteel of defendants, his outrageous behaviour resulting in his removal from the courtroom.<br /><br />A well-documented account of one of the U.S.'s most notorious serial killers.ld Examiner that gave Ramirez his well-known monicker, The Night Stalker.

The 1980's are my pop culture reference point, and what better way to go back and reflect time and again with Matthew Rettenmund's reference book, Totally Awesome 80's?  Because they were awesome.  He covers pop music, movies, TV shows, and trends in my decade.<br /><br />Yes, the 80's were the Reagan years, the year AIDS entered our vocabulary, MTV, back when it was good, VCRs and thus the video rental boom, the War on Drugs, Yuppies, and given her longevity and legendary status, Madonna.  Love or hate her, you gotta admit she was the biggest star of the 80's-sorry Michael Jackson and Prince.  But we lost a lot of people who made it big back then.  John Lennon, Orson Welles, Mae West, and Alfred Hitchcock, to name a few.  And games and pastimes such as Trivial Pursuit, Rubik's Cube, classic arcade hits like Pacman, Frogger, and Q*bert.<br /><br />The list of 80speak, inspired by valley girl talk, stuff from TV shows, \\"&lt;add your term>-o-rama,\\" \\"have a cow,\\" \\"space cadet,\\" or \\"rad,\\" takes me back as well.<br /><br />In the music section, included are special text sections on Michael Jackson, Duran Duran, Culture Club, Wham!, Madonna, Prince, and others who were essentially 80's figures.  The Billboard chart figures for them are also included.  However, the section on We Are The World, which lists the reasons for why the artists sang, is a bit jokey, making me wonder if the event's impact isn't as big as it is now.<br /><br />The list of the top music videos, hit songs, and movies of the decade.<br /><br />I'll list the Top Five of each:<br /><br />Music videos:<br /><br />1.  Eurythmics: \\"Sweet Dreams\\"<br /><br />2.  Buggles, \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\"<br /><br />3.  `til tuesday \\"Voices Carry\\"<br /><br />4.  Duran Duran, \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\"<br /><br />5.  Madonna, \\"Material Girl.\\"<br /><br />Quintessentially 80s songs:<br /><br />1.  Prince and the Revolution: \\"Let's Go Crazy\\"<br /><br />2.  Kajagoogoo: \\"Too Shy\\"<br /><br />3.  Animotion: \\"Obsession\\"<br /><br />4.  Asia:  \\"Heat of the Moment\\"<br /><br />5.  Simple Minds: \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\"<br /><br />Quintessentially 80s movies<br /><br />Ultimate: The Breakfast Club<br /><br />1.  Risky Business<br /><br />2.  Airplane!<br /><br />3.  Raiders of the Lost Ark<br /><br />4.  Flashdance<br /><br />5.  Purple Rain<br /><br />I'm not sure about the top two entries, but of the ones I really liked, Dirty Dancing came in at #10, Fast Times at Ridgemont High at #19, Ghostbusters right behind it, Back to the Future at #38, insultingly way behind at #62 instead of being in the Top Five, both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi-like, I'm so sure-and Gremlins at #70.  There are sublists of funny movies, hottest movies, horror, action, camp, overrated and underrated movies.  And things aren't complete without a small section on the Brat Pack, i.e. the stars of the Breakfast Club.  But yes, the 80's were also a decade where the teen market was exploited in a major way, via comedies and horror flicks.  The same market is being mined right now, but the output today makes the 80's oeuvre like Oscar winners.  And movies that were PG got an extra edge with that PG-13 rating, where there was more violence and other stuff in non-R movies.<br /><br />Of the TV shows I watched regularly, The A-Team came in at #11, Diff'rent Strokes at #34, my brother watched Knight Rider religiously (#54).  And come to think of it, I don't think I ever watched any of the so-called \\"Disease of the Week TV movies.\\"<br /><br />The appendix in the back lists the top Academy Award, Golden Globe, Grammy, and MTV winners, as well as a list of who sang in Live Aid, in order.<br /><br />I find myself in somewhat of a midlife crisis, as much of the music I'm trying to get is stuff from that era that I'm still missing.  Hey, I had to undergo the transition from cassettes to CDs unlike many Gen Y whippersnappers out there!<br /><br />Overall rating:  Even though I wasn't cool with the movie stuff, I found it like, totally tubular, in a major way.  Done with this review, now it's off to play Pacman, or maybe listen to some Cyndi Lauper or watch some Gremlins or Ghostbusters.ith this review, now it's off to play Pacman, or maybe listen to some Cyndi Lauper or watch some Gremlins or Ghostbusters. <br />	2005-01-03

Artist Misao Inagaki and scripter Hiroshi Takahashi made it into a manga in 1999, and only in 2003 did an English language version reach American shores.<br /><br />The story is so well-told from the American movie version to the Japanese and Korean movie versions, but I'll repeat it anyway.  An urban legend tells of a videotape that will kill anyone who watches it within a week.  Was this behind the death of Tomoko, the niece of reporter and single mother Reiko Asakawa?<br /><br />Reiko learns a couple of things, that it wasn't just Reiko who died, but three of her friends who also watched the cursed video and died at the exact same time.  Things take a turn when she visits the South Hakone Pacific Land resort where Tomoko and her friends spent vacation and watches a very strange video.  Sure enough, a message at the end tells her she'll die within a week.<br /><br />She enlists the aid of her ex-husband, Ryuji Takamura, a university professor who's having an affair with his student helper, Mai Takano.  Confident of his intellect and cool-headedness, she believes he can help her.  Sure enough, he sees it as a challenging game, and after analyzing the video bit by bit, discovers clues, such as an obscure dialect, a volcano, and the character Sada reflected in a human eye.  \\"Whoever made this isn't normal.  Without a tremendous amount of evil energy, this kind of complex prank can't be done.\\"  Note: unlike the movie, Ryuji seems a dashing sort of guy, younger than the actor who portrayed Ryuji in Ringu.<br /><br />Their investigations lead them to Izu Oshima and to Sadako Yamamura.  The rest is history.  In the manga, like the films, the main character is a female and not male per the novel.  Also, the more unsavory aspects of Ryuji's character has been eliminated, and the reason why Sadako was killed has been altered in the various versions.  Here, it's mostly correct except for one aspect.  Also, the concept with the blurred photos, never a part of the novel, is made here, as with the film versions.<br /><br />The art here is definitely not the glittery wide-eyed shoujo style, although Mai, who is drawn kind of cute, is closest to it, but a more serious sort.  Some of it is pretty macabre, such as Reiko waking up to the sight of a bloodied Tomoko, which leads to her discovering that her son Yoichi has just watched the video.  However, the drawing of Sadako, dressed in a white robe, long black hair flowing down her face, obscuring it, will have entered the annals of horror film legend due to its replication in the three Ring films and variations of it in The Hypnotist and Ju-On.  And her emerging from the TV makes for good graphic novel horror.<br /><br />Followed by Ring 2, Spiral, the proper novel sequel to Ring, and the prequel Birthday, Ring Vol. 1 stands out as a great manga version of Suzuki's novel.e various versions.

US	50237277	R3M6LPOO6KXJ8K	1413900003	339518280	Azumanga Daioh Volume 1 (Azumanga Daioh (ADV Manga))	Books	5	2	4	N	N	A series of funny four-panellers	The first thing one might notice in the first manga of Kiyohiko Azuma's 4-volume series, Azumanga Daioh, is that it consists of a series of four panel cartoons, something like one would see in the comics section of a daily paper.  Each set of four panels is thematically titled.  There are ten chapters here, beginning with the new semester in April through December.  Each chapter consists of 14 to 15 four-panels.  The first character to be introduced is Yukari Tanizaki, the homeroom high school teacher for Class 3.  Her specialty is English.  However, she is immature, selfish, gossiping with the other students, and once, when her bike chain falls off and a male student offers to help her with her bike, takes his bike so she won't be late!<br /><br />Two transfer students, teeny-tiny Chiyo Mihama, a ten-year old so gifted, she skipped ahead five years to being a sophomore, and Ayumu Kasuga, an Osakan who's actually quiet and not rowdy as thought, bring fresh life to Class 3.  However, Tomo, the energetic wildcat girl who's cheerfully loud, but at times a troublemaker, dubs Ayumu Osaka, because she's from there.  Chiyo stuns everyone with her intelligence, and although she's not good in PE, she manages to beat Osaka in running.<br /><br />Other standout scenes include the competitive sports festival, culture festival where the class put on a stuffed animal exhibit, a suggestion made anonymously by the introverted closet romantic and 170 cm tall Sakaki, the scene where a cockroach causes havoc in the classroom, the summer spent at Chiyo's beachside summer home, and Yukari getting sick of English and having a soccer and dodgeball tournament outside.<br /><br />Some scenes that didn't make it into the anime include how Chiyo was chosen as class representative.  It turns out Tomo nominated herself, Yukari nominated Chiyo, and the class overwhelming voted for Chiyo, who nervously accepts.  Another is how both Osaka and Chiyo get summer jobs at Magnetron Burger, whose M logo looks suspiciously like McDonald's.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the American translation.  Osaka's words, such as \\"teacha,\\" \\"pleased ta meecha,\\" all to distinguish her Osakan accent from standard Japanese, have a black or Italian leaning.<br /><br />The titles on the four-panellers, they are thematic, but some are funny.  \\"One...one...one\\" tells how Chiyo and Osaka fall at the starting line of the three-legged race.  Chiyo says they'll get up on three.  However, at one, they fall splat back on the ground.<br /><br />Some of the characters seem to be drawn somewhat rougher compared to later volumes.  These include Chiyo and Osaka.  Also, whenever Sakaki is bitten by the kamineko (biting cat), the cat's head doesn't expand with pointing teeth as in the anime.  However, the scenes are funny, especially when she rushes to stop two cats from fighting.  Both end up biting her.  As in the anime, eyes closed in a painful expression are denoted with a lengthwise boldface X from ear to ear.<br /><br />However, the stand-alone bobblehead drawings of the girls, located inbetween chapters and at the end, are cute, especially Osaka.  Chiyo's bobblehead character has her holding a paper with a 100 on the left-hand corner.  On the facing page, her word bubble says \\"Thank you teacher.\\"<br /><br />If the anime were done strictly in order of the manga, it probably wouldn't have worked.  As it is, some scenes here didn't end up in the anime until the third or even fourth disc.  Examples include the weird drawings of pandas Chiyo and Osaka make, and when the gang celebrate the end of the semester with a karaoke night.  Osaka's theories concerning Chiyo's pigtails are scattered throughout the book and only in the anime were brought together.  The presence of so many funny scenes frontload the first Azumanga manga, making it the best in the series, and it demonstrates how four-panellers can contain enough info and words to make it funny.e M logo looks suspiciously like McDonald's. <br /> <br />I have mixed feelings about the American translation.

The running theme (pardon the pun) is water.  Some are indeed dark, while others are mysterious.<br /><br />The first story, \\"Floating Water,\\" is already a movie in Japan and soon to be an Americanized film starring Jennifer Connelly, is about a single mother, Yoshimi Matsubara and her daughter Ikuko who move into an apartment, whose complex was abandoned when the bubble economy burst.  However, it turns out that there was an incident on the second floor that occurred years ago.  Tied in with this is a red bag with a kitty motif (Hello Kitty, I wonder?) that Ikuko is attracted to.  Despite it being disposed of, it keeps reappearing.  Yoshimi's daughter also finds an imaginary friend whose name begins with \\"Mi...\\"<br /><br />\\"Solitary Isle\\" doesn't fit into horror/mystery genre.  It deals with a burned out teacher, Kensuke Suehiro, who receives a surprising call from his mentor on whether he is up for an expedition to a ghost island, where there is an ecological site dubbed Battery No. 6.  That leads to reminiscing over Toshihiro Aso and a strange girl he mistreats, Yukari Nakazawa, who vanished due to the machinations of Aso.<br /><br />\\"Dream Cruise\\" takes Masahiro Enoyoshi, who's on the yacht of the successful aggressive sales-oriented Ushijima, a high school classmate of his who is trying to recruit him.  Finding a kid's shoe Kazuhiro on the heel seems unimportant, but then, Ushijima's boat, named Minako after his wife, catches on something...<br /><br />\\"The Hold\\" is a somewhat more unpleasant story, dealing with an abusive fisherman with a violent streak within him.  \\"Surge of irritation,\\" \\"eruption of anger,\\" is used to describe Hiroyuki Inagaki's moods.  One day, his wife Nanako goes missing, and it's when he goes fishing that he finds out why.  And why does he have a throbbing headache?<br /><br />In \\"Adrift,\\" Kazuo Shiraishi, an engineer on the fishing boat Wakashio VII, is about to finish his third year-long tour fishing, and maybe settle down.  However, before the W7 reaches Torishima, they discover an abandoned yacht whose circumstances resemble that of the famed ghost ship, Marie Celeste.  Kazuo volunteers to stay on board as the yacht is being towed by the W7, but when he wakes up...<br /><br />I wasn't too impressed with the other two, \\"Watercolors\\" about a theatrical troupe about to hold production in an abandoned discotheque, and \\"Forest Under The Sea\\" about two spelunkers who get more than they bargained for when they go into an unexplored cave.<br /><br />Note:  for geographic orientation.  In the story \\"Adrift,\\" the Ogasawara Islands are way south of Japan, 28 N by 142 E roughly.  Torishima is around 30.5 N, with Hachijo-jima higher up at 33 N.  And the Miu Peninsula, or Miu Hanto mentioned in the prologue, is the peninsula in Kanagawa Prefecture a few miles from Tokyo which forms the enclosed waters that is the Tokyo-wan (Tokyo Bay).<br /><br />Water tells stories, reveals secrets, takes men's lives, and holds answers to unfinished stories.  Short stories really aren't my thing, as I prefer novels.  Still, not a bad collection of stories from the Ringmaster.r /> <br />In \\"Adrift,\\" Kazuo Shiraishi, an engineer on the fishing boat Wakashio VII, is about to finish his third year-long tour fishing, and maybe settle down.

Kazuo volunteers to stay on board as the yacht is being towed by the W7, but when he wakes up... <br /> <br />I wasn't too impressed with the other two, \\"Watercolors\\" about a theatrical troupe about to hold production in an abandoned discotheque, and \\"Forest Under The Sea\\" about two spelunkers who get more than they bargained for when they go into an unexplored cave. <br /> <br />Note:  for geographic orientation.  In the story \\"Adrift,\\" the Ogasawara Islands are way south of Japan, 28 N by 142 E roughly.  Torishima is around 30.5 N, with Hachijo-jima higher up at 33 N.  And the Miu Peninsula, or Miu Hanto mentioned in the prologue, is the peninsula in Kanagawa Prefecture a few miles from Tokyo which forms the enclosed waters that is the Tokyo-wan (Tokyo Bay). <br /> <br />Water tells stories, reveals secrets, takes men's lives, and holds answers to unfinished stories.  Short stories really aren't my thing, as I prefer novels.  Still, not a bad collection of stories from the Ringmaster.	2005-01-01

She kisses him and before running off, tells him that they need to go to Tokyo U.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, Keitaro is struggling at a prep school, being a ronin-someone who didn't pass his college entrance exam-for two years.  He decides to look up his grandmother, who owned a hotel, to see if he could stay there.  However, due to accidental circumstances that are both unintentional and due to his clumsiness, he nearly gets lynched by a group of girls, one of whom he sees naked in a hot spring.  Fortunately, his aunt, Haruka, comes to his rescue.  It seems that his grandmother has gone off on holiday and turned it into Hinata House, a dorm room for high school girls.  A small lie on his part, that he's trying to get into Tokyo U. turns into the misconception that he's already at Tokyo U's law program, which gains him the respect of the girls.<br /><br />He is found out and is forced to leave, only to find out his grandmother has legally entrusted him with Hinata House, making him landlord!  This is a dream come true for Kei, surrounded by five pretty girls.  However, they plan to get rid of him by overworking him.  Plus his clumsiness leads to circumstances that really gets his foot deep in.  For example, despite being warned against anything perverted, such as peeping on them (which he wasn't in the first place), the railing he's leaning against breaks.  His fall is broken by a branch, but that breaks and he falls splash into the hot springs, where all the girls happen to be bathing.  And it's just one disaster after another with him, which doesn't help his standing any.<br /><br />Poor Kei tries to get his act together, studying at his prep school so he can get into Tokyo U.  So far, the guy's got nothing going for him.  He's not smart, handsome, or athletic.  And his tenants are determined to give him the hardest of times.  Foremost of his detractors is the long-haired, pretty but studious Naru Narusegawa.  She can't stand him, but she does reluctantly help him study, as he discovers she's attending the same prep school as he is.  The tallest and the most vicious is the black-haired Aoyama, an expert at kendo (Japanese stick fighting).  Kaolla Su is a darker-complexioned foreign student of undetermined origin.  And the short-haired Mitsune Konno, nicknamed Kitsune (fox in Japanese) is also dead set on getting rid of Kei.  The 12-year old Shinobu, however, initially looks up to him, that is until she discovers the truth, and being at the age where she takes lies very personally, ends up hating him.  Kei's attempts to help her end up in more disasters.  Remembering her birthday seems to help, until...<br /><br />The question thus remains, can Keitaro remain landlord of Hinata House without Naru or Aoyama killing him?  And will he ever find that first love of his after all these years?  As I just got started on this series, I don't know on the first.  As for the second, I sure hope he does.letic.

Nanako is pretty but rude, ill-tempered, and egocentric.  Uehara describes her in this lovely way:  \\"When she sits, she's like a delicate peony.  When she stands, she's a tulip.\\"  That is, until she opens her mouth.  A scientific experiment by Nanako's grandfather, an inventor, swaps their bodies.  That means they have to swap families as well, which causes some interesting situations.  However, the rough Nanako warns Akira not to look at her body or else \\"you're [meaning his boy's body] showing up to school naked except for a pair of socks.\\"<br /><br />Much of the changes are noticed by their respective peers and families.  For Nanako, now in a boy's body, she's able to be more macho and aggressive.  Indeed, Akira's little sister Miu used to walk all over him, but now, with Nanako in Akira's body.  He (or should that be she?) becomes more popular with the guys because he has been more on the ball, acting like a typical guy, but also the girls, particularly a cute blonde named Shiina.  And the parents, especially the father, is relieved that their son is finally turning out to be a man.<br /><br />Akira, now in Nanako's body, surprises everyone with her (or should that be his) diffidence.  Nanako's grandfather is actually happy to have a granddaughter more girlish and not the macho churl.  However, things really get whacked out when his best friend Senbongi, notices Nanako's girlishness and becomes attracted to her.  I mean, imagine being held by or seduced by one's own best friend, especially when one is a guy, albeit a dainty wimp, in a girl's body.  However, the more sensitive Akira begins to miss his family.<br /><br />Being familiar with the aforementioned body-swap comedies, Your And My Secret takes this further in its wackiness but also with the gender differences and perceptions.  Even though rated 13+, there are some situations and references to body parts that might take it to a 16+ rating.  This was released in June 2004.  Come on, when's the next one in the series coming?rl's body.

A floppy disc is discovered by the corpse, and the police decide to hand the case over to brooding and calm but taciturn Inspector Kozaburo Himuro, head of the Unsolved Crimes Division, Unit A.  He is stationed in \\"the Crypt,\\" his personal house far away from the Criminal Investigation Division's headquarters.<br /><br />Joining him as his put-upon and sometimes reluctant partner is Kurumi Ayaki, a stunning 23 year old in the traffic division who was planning to retire so she could get married to her wimpy car salesman fianc&eacute;, Shingo.  Unfortunately, the recession puts paid Shingo's expected promotion, where his salary might get halved.  Kurumi, who has already handed in her resignation, is forced to retract it, and hence assigned to Himuro.  As he is unable to leave due to an accident the previous year, Kurumi is forced to become his eyes and ears, with a cellphone with which the two can communicate. Despite his apparent coldness and the way he pushes Kurumi, I tend to like him better for his use of logic and intelligence.  Kurumi is thus on 24 hour call.  As Himuro tells her at one point, \\"you belong to a unit now.  The only time you're off duty is when you're dead.  If you can't deal with that, then maybe I should find someone who can.\\"<br /><br />However, while discussing matters at the Central Towers Hotel, Kurumi unexpected sees a man dressed in a clown suit singing a nursery rhyme, and moments later, takes charge in the lobby where a man is found dead with a floppy disc in his pocket.  Her ability for recall gives Himuro more to go on with, which makes him believe that maybe she is of good use after all.<br /><br />The clown has been leaving messages that serves as a password with which to open the floppy disc's files.  The clue in the first murder is the message \\"SEND MORE MONEY.\\"  While Kurumi sees it as it is, Himuro recognizes it as a mathematical equation, SEND+MORE=MONEY, with each letter being a number.  The files then reveal the location of each planned murder.<br /><br />The best scene involves Himuro sending Kurumi to a dark abandoned warehouse at night, where he expects her to find \\"one psychotic bozo.\\"  In other words, a clown, and Kurumi is forced to defend herself.  However, two more killings occur, at which point it becomes clear that there have been different killers.<br /><br />Kurumi isn't exactly that well gifted in the brain department, and is a bit of a ditz, making up for it in her figure.  However, she is a complement to the more logical and intelligent Himuro.  At one point, while running to prevent another murder, she stops to help an injured boy, which enrages Himuro because she will be too late.  And she is liked  by two of Himuro's assistants, the hulking behemoth Bob Kato, nicknamed the Bobhemoth, and whose lunch consists of a tray full of hamburgers, and the older woman Hanae, who thinks Kurumi will be the person to bring Himuro out of his shell.  Apparently, the accident he was involved in left him with the inability to feel anything emotionally.<br /><br />As for Tetsuya Koshiba, the artist, his hands do justice to the main characters.  Kurumi is drawn as a typical manga/anime bimbo, wide eyes, great figure, nice legs, and some shots of her can be gratuitous, such as the scene where she has fallen on the floor, and her undies can be seen beneath her mini.  Kurumi's close and faraway nude scenes in one section does justify the OT (16+) rating.  Even though she complains and is a bit irritating at times, at least she's nice to look at.<br /><br />The ending does not end the case, which is continued in Episode 2.

They are either in colour or B&amp;W, and she sizzles in costume or relaxing in ordinary clothes.  One set of photos that were cute was her and Ip, the tame fawn that became a temporary pet during her work on Green Mansions, and with she is photo'd taking a nap with, her terrier Famous also resting at the further end of the sofa.  The beginning of each chapter is prefaced by two quotes, one from Audrey, the other from a third party, be it Billy Wilder, Henry Mancini, or Alfred Lunt on what characteristics the star had, and a pretty clear picture is formed from them.<br />A need for stability and comfort as opposed to luxury is also shown the way up to fifty-five pieces of luggage accompanied her wherever she was making movies.  The result was that she dispensed the hotel's finery and replaced them with her own, thus making the illusion of a home away from home.<br />Like Harris's book, Karne lists two big names who actually hated her.  One was Humphrey Bogart, who was purposefully excluded because he was not fun to be with, due to racist things he said about Jewish Billy Wilder, and how he saw Audrey as &quot;an inexperienced upstart.&quot;  The other was Alfred Hitchcock, who never spoke to her after she refused a role that exceeded her line of taste.  The movie he intended was never made.<br />She was a great actress, that much can be established without debate, but one thing made clear is that she mostly wanted to settle down and cook and spend quality time with her family and enjoy nature's tranquil scenes.  Who knows what would have happened had she been a cinematic one-hit wonder, but the hits kept coming with Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Charade, and My Fair Lady, to name some.  But it is clear that despite her career, she tried hard to maintain her first marriage by giving it her full attention, but in vain.  Like her character Sabrina, Audrey was clearly an idealist.<br />The one thing I observed in this bio as opposed to the other one I have was how Audrey's legendary charm and status even moved Sidney Sheldon to rewrite ten pages of his novel Bloodline so that the main character was 35 and not younger, for Ms. Hepburn.<br />Karne is supportive and positive on the star, not emphasizing anything bad about her.  Come to think of it, there didn't seem to be.<br />The photos are wonderful and succeed in illuminating Hepburn's best traits:  &quot;Grace, dignity, charm, and compassion&quot;.  Of the reviews included in the biography, they all single out Audrey as the dazzling star of the show, or the only good thing about the movie (e.g. The Children's Hour, Paris When It Sizzles, They All Laughed).  Nothing wrong with Karne's praiseworthy bias of Audreyd she been a cinematic one-hit wonder, but the hits kept coming with Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Charade, and My Fair Lady, to name some.

Together, they bring about an exhaustively covered retrospective composite of that decade.<br />Self-expression and the alarming gung-hoism of the US is recounted by Chrissie Hynde, who was a freshman at Kent State on that fateful day in 1970.  To her, it was &quot;inexperienced people put in chrage of events they didn't know how to handle,&quot; but she lists Sinead O'Connor being booed by Dylan fans for her political slap at the pope on TV, realizing how self-expression has become suppressed in the name of patriotism.<br />The redemption of the South is told in essays about the resurgence of Southern rock, e.g. the Allman Brothers, and Jimmy Carter's winning the Oval Office.  His advisor Hamilton Jordan defends Carter by his tackling tough issues Nixon or Ford refused to touch, such as the Panama Canal treaty, SALT, and the Middle East peace process, but was sunk by bad luck (the price of oil, the shah's ouster).<br />Nothing new is revealed in Dan Rather's essay on Watergate.  Yes, that scandal fostered a deep cynicism and skepticism in journalism and among the people in politics.  It was the American people who decided Nixon's fate, but the legacy of that is what do people do when confronted with similar guilt from a politician or celebrity?  Do they want objective truth, or do they want something splashed out sensationalistically, with a &quot;gate&quot; suffix attached?<br />The music acts/artists covered here are David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Eagles, and Fleetwood Mac.  The portion covering the Eagles is an interview with Don Henley and Glenn Frey, and something Henley said struck me as embodying what the 70's was.  Henley lists the 70's as an attitude of disillusionment that the love-one-another ideal of the 60's didn't pan out and how a self-centered, self-concerned, materialistic mindset arose from the late 70's.  Still, Glenn Frey does argue that the 70's gave some great names in music.<br />Fleetwood Mac carved their name into rock legend status with Rumours, and the essay on them is written by Mick Fleetwood's ex-wife Jenny Boyd, who writes about the breakups and affairs that were going on during the making of the album and how they affected her personally.<br />The essay that really drew me was Mikal Gilmore on his reaction to his brother Gary Gilmore, who became the first men executed after the Supreme Court made capital punishment constitutional after years of review, and the ethics of life and death in the Karen Ann Quinlan case.  And disabled veteran Ron Kovic's quote on Vietnam rings true today:  &quot;a war ain't over until you don't have to live with it anymore.&quot;<br />Film critic Peter Travers says he hates what Star Wars led to:  the spate of sequelitis, cross-merchandise marketing, and soulless sci-fi movies like Starship Troopers.  SW also rode the crest during a brief time (1976-1978) when it looked like things would be better, as Don Henley also thought.  But it was also an escapist thriller, something needed after Vietnam and Watergate, something simpler, exciting, and yet innovative.<br />There's also a chronological timeline by day listed in the margins, listing events as groundbreaking as Nixon's resignation to what song and album were at the top of the Billboard charts and what were the year's biggest movies, albums, and books.  Mostly a pop culture stance on the Me Decade, but with asides to issues still relevant today.ow a self-centered, self-concerned, materialistic mindset arose from the late 70's.

Harris's biography on Audrey Hepburn is an unbiased, straight-ahead account that details her ups and downs, from her childhood in the war-torn Netherlands, her first starts at stardom in England, her breakthrough in Roman Holiday, marriages to Mel Ferrer and Andrea Dotti, to her declining movie career from the late 1970's onward, and to her work as UNICEF spokesperson.<br />The initial quotes from Billy Wilder, Cecil Beaton, Hubert Givenchy, and Stanley Donen give what made Hepburn a star.  Wilder says that God kissed her with that gift of stardom.  True enough:  that 5'7&quot; height, slender birdlike figure, prominent eyebrows, squared off chin, princess-like elegance and beauty that continued in her fifties, a wistful fragility, and soft voice that spoke perfect English and ended a sentence in a girlish query.  And that European sophistication she exuded no doubt came from a multinational heritage that included British, Dutch, Austrian, Hungarian, French, Scotch, and Irish.  And she is very distantly related to Katherine Hepburn, as both traced their lineage to James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, the third husband of Mary Queen of Scots.<br />And she was a professional actress, someone striving for perfection and a trooper when it came to her work.  She took time studying her background material, whether it be reading Tolstoy's War And Peace, where she played Natasha Rostova, Kathryn Hulme's biography on her experiences as a nun, and even going to see Hulme, resulting in The Nun's Story, and her going to a college for the blind for her part as Susy Hendrix in Wait Until Dark.  That's not to say Audrey was perfect.  Her one vice, smoking, came from the cigarettes she saw American soldiers smoking when her homeland was liberated.  She became addicted to life on them.<br />Hepburn's wartime hardships in occupied Netherlands is given quite some coverage because the experiences affected her later in life.  One was the closeness to her mother and brothers, one of whom, Alexander, became a &quot;diver,&quot; people who avoided conscription by the Axis army by hiding.  Second, being malnourished in the final years of war led to a metabolism that prevented her from significantly gaining weight.  And finally, the suffering she went through made her empathize with the starving children in Africa when she joined up as a UNICEF spokesperson during the last years of her life.  Her generosity extended to Givenchy, whom she fought to get him credit for his designs, and to William Wyler, to whom she felt indebted for Roman Holiday and thus agreed to star in The Children's Hour, which wasn't among her best movies.<br />All of Hepburn's movies, from her bits parts beginning with 1948's Dutch In 7 Easy Lessons through her final performance in Always, depending on how significant the movie, is given 5 to 7 pages coverage, from a brief synopsis, recollections by Hepburn herself, the directors, and co-stars.  So far, the only person who hated Hepburn was her Sabrina co-star Humphrey Bogart, who thought Audrey, Billy Wilder, and others were conspiring against him.  Others, such as her Roman Holiday co-star Gregory Peck, were gentlemanly.<br />Harris hits early on that actor Mel Ferrer, husband #1, was constantly being overshadowed by his wife, as he never got into the star tier and that led to a simmering resentment that finally ended their marriage.<br />Harris's coverage on her career is unbiased.  He gives what the critics thought of her performances and movies, even bad ones like Paris When It Sizzles and Always, where she was clearly the best thing in the film.  But through it all, he makes it clear why many, myself included, grew accustomed to her face.f whom, Alexander, became a &quot;diver,&quot; people who avoided conscription by the Axis army by hiding.

However, this is a very significant story in the Doctor Who canon, as this sees the very end of the Daleks.  At least that's what it was meant, as Dalek creator Terry Nation was looking to market his creations in America, hence this story.  Like the Power novel, is written so that it gives depth into the characters.  This book is more effective, as there aren't many supporting characters that there were in Power.<br />Following their adventures at Gatwick Airport, the Doctor and his companion Jamie are shocked to see someone steal the TARDIS.  The Doctor is suspicious.  Who would want to steal a time machine that has the outward appearance of an outdated British telephone box?  &quot;...whoever took it must have known exactly what they were stealing.  Which means they must know who I am.&quot; he says.<br />His suspicions prove right, as he and Jamie are whisked off to Victorian England, 2 July 1866.  They meet Edward Waterfield, a professor, who with his financial backer and benefactor, the leonine bearded Theodore Maxtible, are under the thrall of the Daleks, who have kidnapped Waterfield's daughter Victoria.<br />&quot;The conquest of humanity has eluded us.  The Daleks must know why.&quot;  The Doctor's task is to discover the human factor.  To that end, he works at a series of instruments recording Jamie's thoughts on a capsule, as he sets out to rescue Victoria.  &quot;It is for you... to select the major emotions and thought processes to make up the human factor,&quot; he is told.  Once finished, the factor will be transferred to the Daleks so they will become unbeatable, something the Doctor would rather die than do, but the Daleks have his time machine, plus he doesn't want to endanger Victoria's life, despite not having met her.  The Doctor seems to sum up the kind of enlightened person he is when he tells the fiance of Maxtible's daughter, &quot;I am not a student of human nature.  I am a professor of a much wider academy, of which the human being is merely a part.&quot;  His cleverness comes in at times when it looks like he's at a disadvantage, which makes the Second Doctor, with his dark Beatles mop-top, and impish smile, come alive.<br />Jamie's nobility and bravery is one of the highlights Examples of the human factor are given by Jamie's rescue of Kemel, the muscular 6 and a half foot mute Turkish strongman initially told that Jamie is a murderer and to stop him.  Kemel realizes his being deceived and aids Jamie in his quest.<br />The reason I wish this story were available in TV form is that Daleks are seen acting human, calling the Doctor &quot;friend&quot; and playing trains with him.  Another is the image of seeing the Daleks respond not with &quot;I obey&quot; but &quot;Why?&quot;  That is what differentiates Daleks from humans, blind obedience versus questioning authority.<br />Two things are in variance.  The other is the timing of this story to other Dalek stories.

The difference between this and the slim by the numbers novelizations of other stories is that this is a full twenty-six chapters, putting more depth into the characters of the Doctor, Ben, and Polly.  As Power Of The Daleks is one of the Who stories no longer extant in the BBC archives, a novelization is actually invaluable.<br />The story begins with a reprise of the last moments of The Tenth Planet, where the First Doctor defeated the Cybermen in Antarctica.  He collapses in his time machine, the TARDIS, and once there, regenerates, physically changing himself into a short man with twinkling eyes and a shock of black hair who later gets into the habit of tootling on a recorder.<br />Of his two travelling companions, Ben, the Cockney seaman, is skeptical he is the Doctor, but blonde Polly is convinced.  Ben's suspicions continue when they land on the planet Vulcan (no relation to Spock's planet) with its bubbling mercury pools.  The Doctor witnesses the murder of an Earth investigator and poses as that person, though he never sees the assassin, who knocks him out but leaves behind a clue.  His arrival causes tension.  The governor, Hensell, assumes the Doctor's there to report on his lack of progress against rebellious workers.  The scientist Lesterson, believes the Doctor is there because of a capsule that landed 200 years before.  Lesterson has been working on trying to get it open.  The Doctor succeeds and finds to his horror, two dormant Daleks, the xenophobic, salt-shaker shaped aliens he's fought many times before.<br />The Doctor tries to convince Lesterson and Hensell to have the Daleks destroyed, but is unable to prevent the Daleks from being reawakened, where they instantly offer themselves as servants of the Earth colonists.  Lesterson believes he can control them by shutting off their power, and more, by disengaging the arm that fires their laser weapons.  Plus, the Daleks win the governor over by offering to help build an anti-meteorite shield for colony.  But as the Doctor says, &quot;it will end the colony's problems because it will end the colony!&quot;  After all, &quot;one Dalek poses more threat... than a string of armed atomic missiles.&quot;<br />His only ally seems to be Quinn, the deputy-governor whom Polly takes a shine to, much to Ben's jealousy, but he seems anxious to speak to the Doctor.  Of the other people he meets, there's Janley, a pretty but hard-working no-nonsense woman who's Lesterson's assistant and who uses her wiles to persuade people.  Bragen, the Head of Security, seems to be sticking to his duties, but there are internal politics brewing between him, Hensell, and Quinn.<br />The novel places the Cybermen defeat as the 1990's, yet it is already firmly established in the TV series that it took place in 1986, so a strange continuity error there.  Another thing that's been added in the novel is that the colony's one sponsored by International Mining Corporation, the exploitative company first faced by the Third Doctor in Colony In Space.  And unless the video version of this story is found, the novel's all we got to go on, which in itself is a good thing.  John Peel has written other Who novelizations involving the Daleks (The Chase, Mission To The unknown, The Dalek Master Plan) so he was well-placed to write this novelization and the other missing Dalek novelization Evil Of The Daleks.by shutting off their power, and more, by disengaging the arm that fires their laser weapons.

One is Will Freeman, a thirty-six year old confirmed bachelor, an island to himself, who lives off royalties from a song his father made long ago, a novelty Christmas song called \\"Santa's Super Sleigh.\\"  He's hip,  and he has his day organized into either shopping trips, hanging out with his few friends, watching TV, and trying to score with women but not to commit on a long-term basis.  He finds a goldmine of opportunity in dating Angie, a single mother who resembles Julie Christie, and when she breaks it off, he decides there must be more attractive women of that sort.  To that end, he joins SPAT (Single Parents-Alone Together), an encounter group of moral support, and even invents a 2-year old son Ned, and ex-wife Paula.<br />Then there's Marcus, a 12-year old boy who doesn't have it so good.  He's in London, where students are more trendier.  His mother's a vegetarian/health food, hippy-type into Joni Mitchell, and who is totally against mindless conformity.  The result is that he's picked on in school, especially as he has the tendency to sing out loud from out of the blue when nervous.  He doesn't have any real friends to speak of.  His father's in Cambridge with a girlfriend.  But worse still, he notices his mother suffering from depression.<br />Will and Marcus meet when Suzie, a SPAT member whom Will has taken a shine to, takes Marcus on an outing in the park.  That day becomes a day forever etched in Marcus's mind, as his accidental killing of a duck with a French loaf is overshadowed by his coming home and seeing his mother overdosed on pills.  The two bond slowly, and Marcus learns how to become invisible, outwardly wearing trendy clothes, listening to hip music and all, but to be himself inside, i.e. to be in disguise.<br />The nature programme and Groundhog Day video Fiona and Marcus watch, on the fish that doesn't come out of its cave, and how Bill Murray lives the same day over and over, are clever and subtle parallels to Will's life.<br />The book here has Kurt Cobain and Nirvana as the thing that unites Marcus and Ellie, the rebellious and brooding 15-year old who slowly warms up to him, and the book takes place from 1993 to 1994, so one can figure out what bearing an event that took place nearly ten years ago tomorrow (5 April) will have.<br />But the one thing that stood out was a conversation involving the difficult search to find a life partner so \\"less different\\" from one.  Ellie's mother replies, \\"Why do you think we're all single?\\"  The conclusion seems to be, as Marcus later decides, that it's safer if everyone were simply just friends, pairing off being a bit of an emotional hazard.<br />With writing that's pointed and witty, Higham makes convincing characters of Will and Marcus, but he does so with Fiona, Marcus's mother, and Ellie, described as Siouxsie Sioux with a Roadrunner hairdo;  he also weaves threads of single parents, the difficulty of fitting in at school, and why the concept of marriage and or sig. others may be declining in the late 20th century onwards, and for Will, being able to care about someone and still maintain his own island.on pills.

He loves jazz music, is integrationist, and against class.  He lives in a slum named Napoli because he enjoys the low rent and how he is accepted, no matter what he does, and no one questions his background, educated or class.  He wouldn't be treated that way in Belgravia, the fashionable, upscale district of London.<br />He has a bunch of interesting friends, such as the very friendly  Fabulous Hoplife, who swings the other way, and the Wiz, a huckster who wants to make it into the bigtime, realizing there's a goldmine with the economic prosperity and renewed London.  He wants to get there via illegal means, much to the narrator's chagrin.  There's Big Jill, a big and friendly les to whom the narrator confides to about Suze; she's kind of like an older sister to him.<br />But he's really after his dreamgirl Crepe Suzette, or Suze, a pretty girl who's getting her kicks by sleeping around with every black she fancies.  He's very upset when she tells him she's getting married to Henley, a fashion designer in his forties for whom she's a secretary.  &quot;I'm marrying for distinction, and that's a thing that you could never give me,&quot; she tells him.  Despite her importance, she's not one of the most interesting characters here.<br />But when the narrator learns of the racial tensions going on and reads an anti-immigrant tirade in a news article condemning the Commonwealth Act, which allowed emigration from the former colonies to the UK, he sadly says &quot;I don't understand my country anymore. ...the English race has spread itself all over the world...No one invites us, and we didn't ask anyone's permission... Yet when a few hundred thousand come and settle among our fifty millions, we just can't take it.&quot;<br />The generation gap between three groups are interesting.  There are people like the narrator, growing up when the war was already over, and thus progressive, anti-Empire, and accepting blacks and Indians.  People like his oafish stepbrother Verne and Ed the Ted, in their mid-twenties, lived through the war, were more patriotic, pro-Empire, and are spiteful of teenagers.  And people like the narrator's father like the 1950's because they lived through the hell of the 1930's, unable to find good work, starving, and seeing the war as a godsend for the employment opportunities.<br />MacInnes's historical novel is a look at a post-war Britain, defanged of its empire, and having experienced a political faux-pas in the Suez Crisis.  It also examines race relations in Britain ten years after the Commonwealth Act, and how British commercialism got roaring with the newfound prosperity.  The tensions between whites and coloureds came to a head in the Notting Hill race riot, which takes place in this book.  The movie that was adapted from this cut out most of the thoughtful parts of the book, but it's one of my favourite movies, and I see this book in a new light.resting characters here.<br />But when the narrator learns of the racial tensions going on and reads an anti-immigrant tirade in a news article condemning the Commonwealth Act, which allowed emigration from the former colonies to the UK, he sadly says &quot;I don't understand my country anymore. ...the English race has spread itself all over the world...No one invites us, and we didn't ask anyone's permission...

Due to a totally original idea, well, kind of, as he got the idea lying on the grass thinking that there should be something like The Hitchhiker's Guide To Galaxy, HGTTG and its sequels became another dollop of Britannia that was rabidly slurped up by USA-ers that they did the Beatles and Monty Python.  But it also explains the success of HH, as it came out in the wake of Star Wars and Close Encounters making sci-fi acceptable entertainment for mass consumption.<br />It reveals that Adams was quite a talent at an early age, from his short story submission for The Eagle at age 12, to a hilarious very Pythonseque Kamikaze Briefing sketch included here that I really enjoyed that he did pre-HH.  His secret?  &quot;Writing comes easy.  All you have to do is stare at a blank piece of paper until your forehead bleeds.&quot;  Thank goodness I had those paper towels to clean up my computer screen.<br />Part of this is a biography of Adams, from his days at Cambridge, to his wilderness years doing odd jobs, including being a bodyguard for some Arabs, and doing collaborations with other writers, many of which fell through.  Despite initially being mistaken for being the sixth Python member, he did work with Graham Chapman, but that didn't work out, as Chapman was struggling with alcoholism at the time.  His time as Doctor Who's script editor from 1978-1979, and the three stories he personally wrote for the series, is explained, and the reason why he hated being script editor.  But there is also a synopsis of the stillborn Dr. Who and the Krikkitmen at the back of the book, parts of which later became Life, The Universe, And Everything, the knotty but still well-written third book.<br />Adams reveals to have some sensitive yet artistic side of him.  He doesn't seem to like remembering about writing his books because of some bad memories and hardships he had to go through.  And time-oriented is NOT the word to describe him.  For writing my and his personal favourite in the series, The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe, he had to be locked up in an apartment in an ascetic-like existence for four weeks, with Paul Simon's One Trick Pony as his only companion.<br />Neither is deadline a word found in Adams' dictionary.  Apart from only doing three essays during his time at Cambridge, there was even a time during the second series of the radio programme that &quot;they were recording the show in one part of the studio, while I was in another part of the studio actually writing the next scene.&quot;(!!!)<br />Mixed inbetween are script excerpts from dialogue never used in the radio series.  There's also a list of the most asked questions to Adams, of which most of them are either brief and to the point or totally deranged, but he did answer one I wondered, which was the Dire Straits song he referred to in So Long..., which was &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; from Making Movies.<br />This goes up to the first Dirk Gently novel, done in 1987, and it's a good read for those into HH or wanting to learn about the story and history about HH after reading the series.  Whoops, time for another Pangalactic Gargleblaster and a slice of Arcturan Megadonkey..<br />Adams reveals to have some sensitive yet artistic side of him.

Vile Bodies, his second novel, depicts a month in a half in the lives of the swinging, partying, jaded, young upper class, aka The Bright Young People.  Young, yes, bright, well, that's questionable, and people...  But it also a snapshot of an empire in decline, of the spoiled younger generation who take for granted what their elders fought for.  A sentence more or less summarizes how they are:  &quot;like so many people their age, Adam and Nina were suffering from being sophisticated...before they were at all widely experienced.&quot;<br />This also features drunk on wine, silly conversations, and silly names, such as a stern evangelist named Mrs. Ape, an ex-PM named Outrage, peers named Lady Circumference, and a group of girls dressed as angels who perform for Ms. Ape's Christian charity.  Their names represent certain virtues:  Fortitude, Chastity, Faith, Humility, Prudence, Creative Endeavour, and the like, i.e. Victorian values.  Yet their names do not mirror their personalities, as many of them bicker among themselves, which symbolizes the coming apart of Victorian values.<br />The story focuses on Adam Fenwick-Symes, a struggling and penniless writer whose success is like a series of W's:  down, up, down, up... and so on.  Having his novel, an autobiography, burned at customs for being possibly subversive, is just one of the misfortunes he runs into.  He's engaged to Nina Blount, an engagement that hinges a lot on his being solvent.  The most repeated lines by him:  &quot;I say Nina, we shan't be able to get married after all.&quot; or other variants.<br />Among his misadventures includes trying to track down a drunken major to whom he entrusted a thousand pounds on a longshot at the track, the numerous wild parties he goes to at the most happening places to be, &quot;masked parties, savage parties, Victorian parties,...parties at Oxford where one drank brown sherry and smoked Turkish cigarettes,...all that succession and repetition of massed humanity...all those vile bodies,&quot; and trying to get Colonel Blount his blessing to be married to Nina, is itself a challenge, as the irascible colonel's memory is such that he's got quite a loose propeller.<br />But Adam's brief tenure as the gossip columnist detailing parties, of who was there wearing what, is itself a portrait of how the upward mobile, socially conscious trendies are addicted in trying to be where it's cool, even when Adam invents people and visiting a lunatic asylum, gives them noble names and describes their ailments!<br />Of the decadent Young Things, Angela Runcible has the most exciting moments, as she wakes up after a rowdy party dressed in a revealing Hawaiian outfit, embarrasses the family she stayed over at during breakfast, and goes outside the door to the delight of reporters.  The address?  Oh, somewhere in Downing Street.<br />There's a conversation on the younger generation between Father Rothschild and the ex-PM, where Rothschild remarks on the generation gap.  From the Victorian value of &quot;if a thing's worth doing at all, it's worth doing well,&quot; to the Bright Young People's &quot;If a thing's not worth doing well, it's not worth doing at all.&quot;  Rothschild mentions it also relates at a need for permanance, such as marriage, given the word &quot;bogus&quot; that the BYP use, years before Bill and Ted, and the number of growing divorces.  And that's something Adam says, that a marriage should go on.<br />Vile Bodies is one of those great birds, a historical snapshot set among the jaded and decadent pre-war Young Things during the decline of the British Empire, all because Modernism is showing the upper hand over Victorian values.  This decadence and pluck of youth would be reduplicated in the late 1950's, when the teenagers took power, but that's another era of Britain altogether.wn sherry and smoked Turkish cigarettes,...all that succession and repetition of massed humanity...all those vile bodies,&quot; and trying to get Colonel Blount his blessing to be married to Nina, is itself a challenge, as the irascible colonel's memory is such that he's got quite a loose propeller.<br />But Adam's brief tenure as the gossip columnist detailing parties, of who was there wearing what, is itself a portrait of how the upward mobile, socially conscious trendies are addicted in trying to be where it's cool, even when Adam invents people and visiting a lunatic asylum, gives them noble names and describes their ailments!<br />Of the decadent Young Things, Angela Runcible has the most exciting moments, as she wakes up after a rowdy party dressed in a revealing Hawaiian outfit, embarrasses the family she stayed over at during breakfast, and goes outside the door to the delight of reporters.

First, she runs into a tall, angry Norwegian-looking person whom she helps out at the check-in counter at Heathrow Airport.  Second, said check-in counter explodes, sending her to the hospital.  The papers label the incident an act of God, resulting in several injuries and the disappearance of the apathetic check-in counter clerk who angered the Nord.  She recovers, but something leads her to Woodhouse, a hospital for very unusual patients, including a one-eyed old man whose name is Mr. Odwin, has a tiny demonic-looking assistant named Toe Rag, and a certain temperamental son with a hammer named Mjolnir.<br />So where does Dirk Gently come in this?  In his usual &quot;fundamental interconnectedness in all things&quot; way, of course.  He wakes up hours after he was supposed to meet his client, who's terrified of a green-eyed giant with a scythe.  He arrives at the client's house, only to find the police there, his client's head rotating in the middle of a 33 and 1/3 single &quot;Hot Potato&quot; record that keeps skipping.  He goes through a series of misfortunes and incidents, including breaking his nose and being attacked by an eagle.<br />The premise, and it may require a few re-readings to fully get what's going on, is interesting enough, but not as the ones he explored in his Hitchhiker novels and the previous Dirk Gently novel.  They seem to be a series of disconnected ideas that don't click together.  Dirk Gently's quirky, eccentric character works as long there's a more straight-laced foil to respond to his ramblings.  Here, there is no Richard MacDuff to help out.<br />Consider those who respond to him.  Sally Mills, the nurse whose coffee he steals, isn't too put out by his personality.  Kate Schechter, on the other hand, gives him a flea in his ear after he tail-ends her car, but she's more independent-minded than MacDuff, and there's only one segment in the book where she interracts with him.<br />Some ideas that could be funny or further elaborated include an I Ching calculator, which can add up to 4, but any answer above it equals &quot;a suffusion of yellow.&quot;  One that works is his theory of finding his way after being lost in traffic, and that's to follow a car that seems to know where it's going, the premise being that somehow, he'll end up where he needs to be.<br />As for his writing, Adams' description of Gently's fridge, which hasn't been opened for three months, is something: &quot;the fridge no longer merely stood there in the corner of the kitchen, it actually lurked.&quot;  And the fridge war between he and his housekeeper is a beaut in writing.  There are actually some good writing moments, but other than that...<br />People interested in Adams should, as the chorus to &quot;Hot Potato&quot; goes, &quot;don't pick it up, pick it up, pick it up&quot; and maybe only after they've read Dirk Gently.  Getting into it does require a high degree of patience, so only for the most diehard fans.  Overall a bit disappointing, like his other work Mostly Harmless.ichard MacDuff to help out.<br />Consider those who respond to him.

His method does not involve using fingerprint powder, but rather seeing the fundamental interconnectedness of things.  As he elaborates to a client, &quot;I see the solution to each problem as being detectable in the pattern and web of the whole.  The connections between causes and effects are often much more subtle and complex than we with our rough and ready understanding of the physical world might naturally suppose.&quot;  Missing cats is a specialty, using Schrodinger's quantum mechanics equation.  It also serves to exploit old woman seeking their missing cats of their money, that is if he ever gets paid.<br />Gently cross paths with his old classmate from St. Cedd's College, Cambridge, Richard MacDuff, who is having a trying and interesting time.  MacDuff, a computer programmer working for Way Forward Technologies, becomes involved with his old college tutor, Professor Urban Chronotis, the aged Regius Professor of Chronology, and hence bearing the nickname &quot;Reg&quot; whose vice is conjuring tricks, and in the middle of a dinner honouring Samuel Taylor Coleridge, performs a totally inexplicable one involving a salt shaker and a Grecian pot that perplexes MacDuff.  Equally perplexing is how a horse entered the bathroom of his professor.<br />MacDuff has many other things to worry about.  He's overdue on a software programme for his boss Gordon Way, he isn't spending enough time with his girlfriend Susan, who's his boss's sister, and he's got a sofa lodged halfway up the stairs to his flat.  To make matters worse, he then sees the ghost of his boss, who was mysteriously killed at the same time he was at the Coleridge dinner, and is wanted by the police for questioning.<br />Adams' usual humorous observations on human foibles are at play here.  He describes Reg's memory as being comparable to a Queen Alexandra Birdwing Butterfly, &quot;in that it was colorful, flitted prettily hither and thither, and was now, alas, almost completely extinct.&quot;  Reg and the eccentric Dirk, who seems able to explain things MacDuff can't, are the best characters here.<br />As for MacDuff, there is some of Adams in this character.  Like MacDuff, Adams attended Cambridge and went for an English Literature degree, only it was at St. John's College and not St. Cedd's per the novel.  Adams also managed to turn in only three essays (!!), which was three more than MacDuff completed.<br />Some may know that Adams was the script-editor for Dr. Who from 1978-1979.  Elements from two stories he personally wrote, City Of Death and Shada pop up here.  In the latter story, there is a character called Professor Chronotis as there is here.<br />The humour is more tempered than in Hitchhiker, and relies more on wit and funny situations rather than the laugh-out-loud comedy of the HH series.  And this is more a sci-fi/mystery rather than a meta-scifi comedy in space.  Adams never loses his imaginative streak, in terms of story and writing style.  I read this immediately after the last HH book and found it an amusing and entertaining read.on human foibles are at play here.

The four members of the Red Dwarf crew, Dave Lister, the hologram Arnold Rimmer, the Cat, and the service mechanoid Kryten, are trapped in the ultimate game, where the player creates one's own paradise out of one's greatest dreams, or, as things turn out later for Rimmer, one's worst nightmares, and is addicted to the point that they eventually die because their real selves die.  Would I go for a game like that?  Heck yeah!<br />In the meantime, Holly, the ship's computer, and Lister's insufferably talkative and chirpy Talky Toaster (patent applied for), get involved in trying to get Holly's IQ back into the quadruple digits like it was before, a process that invariably causes the computer's remaining time to exponentially decrease.  Result, Holly shuts himself down to preserve what little remains of his life.  Further result:  the ship's powerless as a result.  Further further result:  a runaway planet is on a collision course with them.<br />However, one sobering aspect of the future that Grant and Naylor work into this novel is a garbage planet.  One of the planets in the Solar System is chosen to house all the other planets' waste, and guest which planet that is?  North America gets the bottles, Europe the sewage, Australia domestic waste, and Japan the graveyard of motorcars, etc.<br />Lister finds himself on this kind of planet, and attacked by lethal pollution storms by the planet itself.  &quot;Then he knew.  He'd done everything to Earth.  He'd crucified it.  He was a member of the human race, part of the species that had spread like bacteria over the planet...finally rendering it fit only for use as a dumping ground for all humanity's garbage.&quot;  Panic-stricken, he pleads for mercy, promising to make it right again.&quot;  The concept of the Earth as a giant organism, with us unaware that it's organic is taken here.  To that end, he forms an alliance with a creature most of us would immediately say hello to with the sole of our tennis shoes.  This reminder of how we're polluting our planet is the best segment of the book, interesting for book derived from a comedy series.<br />A brief history of Earth's genetic mutations for new and weird sports, such as twenty-feet tall basketball players and soccer playres with five legs and no mouths, to sentient vacuum cleaners, wars against these creatures, later called GELFs (Genetically Engineered Life Forms) is given as an intro to a creature that appears in the TV story Polymorph.  And GELFs are encountered in the 6th and 7th seasons.<br />Another insight into humans:  &quot;The thing about human beings was this:  human beings couldn't agree.  They couldn't agree about anything. ... And the reason was this:  basically, all human beings believed all other human beings were insane, in varying degrees.&quot;  That leads to wars, but by the 20th century, human beings &quot;got so good at war, it couldn't have one anymore.&quot;  Some of this Douglas Adams style humour is wry, and also appears in a section when Rimmer royally messes up by accidentally destroying a whole bunch of scutters (Red Dwarf's tiny arm-shaped service robots) in testing the engine's pistons.<br />Here are the stories worked into this novel:<br />Better Than Life, Season 2, Episode 2<br />White Hole, Season 4, Episode 4<br />Marooned, Season 3, Episode 2<br />Polymorph, Season 3, Episode 3<br />XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, Season 3, Episode X<br />Once again, revealing what that last story is would spoil the fun, but the sequel would actually take place in the fourth and not the third book.<br />Like its predecessor, it's more than just a TV tie-in, but an actual book that delves more into the personality of the characters, especially Lister.would immediately say hello to with the sole of our tennis shoes.

US	50237277	R2DNX4XI35EPE8	031216985X	707311195	The Rise and Fall of the British Empire	Books	5	49	55	N	N	Lengthy but effective, unbiased work on the empire	Lawrence James takes a straight factual narrative of the empire, neither going the neo-imperialist apologist route nor the leftist postmodernist road, equally emphasizing its achievements and darker moments.  He does have an interesting style in introducing some of the chapters, and that is by describing the paintings that symbolized Britain at a certain point.  He also uses poems, popular songs, and novels of the time to describe the sentiments at the time.  At 629 pages, covering from 1600 up to 1993, it's quite a hefty read and may require a few sittings, but for a one volume work of the largest empire to last for a long time, it's effective.<br />James's focus is primarily economic and political, with the sociological aspects on the British left and anti-colonialists given quite coverage beginning in the 19th century.  But the story's the same.  England's empire was created for her need of goods from the New World, but really took off during its series of global wars against France and its allies beginning with the Nine Years War (1689-97) up to the American War For Independence (1775-1783).  The reason was twofold, to prevent France from gaining a foothold in the New World and to outcompete France and Spain in its maritime trade network.  And England won because of its banking system, which allowed for deficit spending, and its constitutional monarchy with Parliament having the powers of the purse, established with the Glorious Revolution that unseated James II.<br />The competition/antagonism with France over trade in Africa and India was refired in the 19th century, with Britain using its superior navy to establish its commercial hegemony.  Yet there was another mission, and that was to civilize, to eliminate heathen practices (such as sati (widows immolating themselves on their late husband's pyre) in India, and introduce education and other British institutions in those faraway places.  But that couldn't have been done with British work ethic, integrity, and a \\"dedication to the general welfare of mankind.\\"  Britain came out on top because of \\"native inventiveness and application of its people\\", \\"Britain's manufacturing industry\\", and \\"naval supremacy.\\"  Imperialism in itself is bad regardless of the country, as it leads to racism compared to the Germans and French, but the British were better than those countries given that they had a government that was the envy of all nations, although they retaliated in force only when attacked, e.g. Gordon, the Sepoy Uprising.<br />The rise of the leftist intellectuals who became more egalitarian and anti-imperialist couldn't have happened without the 1832 Parliamentary Reform Act, which gave the vote to the middle class, leading to a more democratic Britain.  Many were Liberals or Radicals, and they contributed to the eventual fall of the Empire.  Counter to that were the more conservative Tories, imperialists to the core, and who espoused jingoism, \\"a clamorous, pugnacious and intestinally inspired patriotism,\\" something briefly resurrected during the Falklands War.<br />It was only when the empire was declining after the heavy loss of life in WW1, that the empire began to tighten its fist in a desperate attempt to cling onto its holdings.  The massacre at Amristar (1919), the callous way it treated Middle Easterners, was the empire's dark side.  This desperation can be seen with the establishment of Empire Day and the indoctrination of schoolchildren to look up to the empire, aided by pulp hero adventures by imperialist ex-war correspondent G.A. Henty, who cranked out imperialist propaganda to brainwash the youth.  But being bankrupt by WW2, rising nationalist movements led by Gandhi, Nasser, and Nkrumah, and being dependent on US-influenced anti-colonialist foreign policy and aid, led to the empire's collapse into the Commonwealth, \\"a surrogate empire.\\"<br />Each section is titled with start and end dates.  However, in some sections, there are topics that cover the same timeperiod, so although it looks like one is going into a time loop, keep in mind that many things were going on.  For example, James covers the Irish situation from 1919-1939, and then in the next chapter, covers Egypt from 1919-1942, the Middle East during that same time period, and then India.  Then he covers British social and economic dynamics in separate chapters.<br />Conclusion:  \\"Few empires have equipped their subjects with the intellectial wherewithal to overthrow their rulers.  None has been survived by so much affection and moral respect.\\"period, so although it looks like one is going into a time loop, keep in mind that many things were going on.

The tie-in doesn't qualify as quality fiction in any sense.<br />Not so with Red Dwarf.  For the first novel, Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers, RD creators Rob Grant and Doug Naylor took certain ideas from the series are either expanded (the best things in this novel), altered (also great), or dropped altogether from stories of the first two seasons and strung them together in a continuous story.  In places, dialogue is replicated, but in other places, it's done in the narration of the text.<br />Naturally, the first episode worked in is the debut The End, but before that, we learn how Dave Lister signed on aboard the Jupiter Mining Corporation vessel Red Dwarf, how and where he first met Arnold Rimmer, the man synonymous with the name Smeghead, and the events that led to Lister being the surviving human being.  Some aspects of the story are changed, such as the captain of RD being a woman, but the most interesting thing that's given more of a background story is how and why George McIntyre, seen as a hologram in the TV series, died, and there's a dark aspect in that.  Another shows why Rimmer flunks his astronavigation exams, and that's his spending more time making making revision timetables instead of actually studying.  The Cat, a humanoid evolved from the ordinary housecat, and Kryten the mechanoid also feature in the story.<br />Holly's computer senility is detailed after spending 3 million years alone.  For example, he knows that Isaac Newton's a famous physicist, but he can't remember why.  But the more human parts of the characters are covered, such as Dave initial coping with his sole existence aboard, or George Saunders's agonized coping with the fact that he's a hologram in the first chapter.<br />Speaking of holograms, there's an interesting discussion between a hologram and a psychologist.  On Red Dwarf, the most recently deceased crewmember is kept on as a hologram, consisting of a light bee transmitting 3D projection of the crewmember, duplicating that person's personality.  The hologram is a simulation of a possible or probable person who died, and adding Descartes' cogito ergo sum to the equation, only that principle is altered because &quot;it's the computer making you think you're thinking, therefore, you possible are.&quot; I think I'm thinking, therefore, I possibly am... Hmmm...<br />The description of Dave's girlfriend for five weeks, Kristine Kochanski, and the ideal love of his life, is as follows:  &quot;It wasn't a beautiful face.  But it was a nice face.  It wasn't a face that could launch a thousand ships.  Maybe two ships and a small yacht.  That was, until she smiled.  When she smiled, her eyes lit up like a pinball machine when you win a bonus game.  And she smiled a lot.&quot;  I could go for a girl like that.<br />One part of Chapter 6 is a great written montage, intercut between Holly the computer's activities following the radiation leak, and the gradual evolution of the Cat Race, something not given too much detail to in the TV series.<br />Five of twelve stories from the first two seasons were worked into this novel:<br />The End, Season 1, Episode 1<br />Future Echoes, Season 1, Episode 2<br />Me Squared, Season 1, Episode 6<br />Kryten, Season 2, Episode 1<br />XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, Season X, Episode X<br />The reason for the X's is that aspects of this episode make room for a sequel novel, which there is, and I don't want to give things away.  Besides, this is my favourite part of the book, as it's something I'd definitely want to do.

He tries to in this book.  Film is shaped by politics, philosophy, economics and the technology of a society, with that last being more a key factor with the digital revolution.  How To Read A Film-Movies, Media, Multimedia is more than just a book on film technique, history, and theory.  It's that last word in the title that is given emphasis on in the last section, including the emphasis that the book is also about How To USE a Film.<br />Techniques are covered include lighting, aspect ratio, tracks, film grade, and codes.  And yes, there is the requisite film history, which is heavily condensed and goes through individual directors, countries, and certain genres in film.  As only one chapter's devoted to it, but it's a quick cram-course in who's who, who-directed-what?, who-starred-in-what?, and what was going on in such-and-such a country.<br />Another interesting concept is the terms film, cinema, and movies.  The terms are defined in the way we look at the medium.  Film is what it's called in relationship to the world, i.e. politics.  Cinema refers to a more aesthetic and intellectual stance.  And movie is a named when defined as a consumer-oriented, economic commodity.  The terminology is interesting when one defines a performance as the sum of the actor's persona in conflict with the role he plays.<br />Monaco then spends some time discussing the two schools, expressionism/formalism versus neorealism/functionalism.  Expressionism, derived in Germany from such masters as Fritz Lang and F.W. Murnau, focuses on the inner aspect of humanity, using symbols, stereotypes, stylization, which eventually influenced directors such as Hitchcock and Welles.  Formalism, more from the Soviet masters like Sergei Eisenstein, is more analytic and scientific, concerned with technique.  There are discussions of montage (series of shots that advance the action) vs. mis-en-scene (deep focus photography that allows more audience participation in the film experience) and the schools of thought that argued in favour of one over the other.  There's an interesting observation by Andre Bazin, who saw film as the asymptote to reality, the imaginary line that nears but never touches reality, which if put into conjunction into the earlier definition of film being something that can't be explained.<br /> All this leds to multimedia and virtual reality.  Most of the latter deals with the information age, detailing the history of computers and Internet, which led to the control and access to information.  This ties in with the ethics regarding copyright in the merging of texts, images and sound, and downloading MP3's in this postmodernist, recontextualization of art, where film sits squarely.  Doesn't this surely affect burning DVD's from the Net, which serves to accelerate already shrinking box office takings?  Monaco quotes Lenin on how ethics is the esthetics of the future, sums this dilemma up pretty well.<br />Monaco uses the example of David Bowman, the astronaut in 2001, and the virtual cage he's in at the end of the movie, to describe how our closed personalized environments, created to block out the noisy outside world, may give us security, i.e. Discmans, cellphones, VCR viewings as opposed to theatrical outings, but at the cost of losing touch visually and morally from our surroundings.

That's what Boris Adrian, a.k.a. King B or simply B, a well-respected star director who's won Oscars with his revolutionary and visionary styles who has entered a creative drought for the past two years, wonders aloud to Sidney Krassman, his gross, hefty, and profane producer after an evening spent watching stag films at the home of eccentric, vivacious, multi-handicapped Teeny Marie.<br />Sid gets three million dollars for production costs.  Yes, Boris's movie will be made, but the proviso that it will be filmed and exclusively exhibited in Liechtenstein, that postage stamp sized principality sandwiched between Switzerland and Austria, with the government providing the funding.  That would be a boon to a country with the lowest per capita income in Western Europe.<br />The movie, titled The Faces Of Love, is to be an anthology of erotic love, of twenty-five minute segment stories.  Getting the budget money, and production crew is no problem.  What about the performers?  To that end, Boris procures Angela Sterling, an actress clearly based on Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield, and America's top draw, someone who wants to be seen as more than just a T&A actress, the French lesbian actress Arabella, and prim but pretty British actress Pamela Dickensen.  The only big trouble may come from Angela Sterling, who is also the mistress of Les Harrison, vice president of Metropolitan studios, and whose presence on Boris's movie was the result of a breach of contract from a movie funded by Metropolitan.  The movie would take advantage of some recently lifted restrictions and challenge some movie taboos, with each story representing a theme such as miscegenation/multiple partners, the first experience, which is a lesbian one, a priest and a hooker, and brother with sister.<br />As this was written in 1970, four years after the demise of the notorious and increasingly irrelevant Hays Code and two years after the imposition of the MPAA ratings, Blue Movie is well-placed, coming out at the dawn of a brief newfound cinematic freedom.<br />Sprinkled with lots of four-letter words, mostly by Sid, with plenty of explicit passages and even a few chapters, funny characters such as Feral, a Senegalese extra whose equipment gets many reactions, Tony Sanders, the writer who's a veritable goofy but creative genius, and of course Sid, who's crass, vulgar, but funny.  He tells a topless and quite chesty waitress, \\"Do you have a cold?\\"  When she asks him what makes him think that, he says, \\"Oh I don't know why.  Your chest looks all swollen.\\"  Boris's laid back, thoughtful personality makes him a pretty appealing character.  The bash at big studios is apparent.  Some chapters depict the actual shooting and discussion of scenes in the film, special apparati used in adult scenes, which film buffs may appreciate.<br />The book ripples with the usual irreverence Southern gives, outdoing The Magic Christian and Candy, two novels that were done as movies.<br />Which brings me to this:  if Blue Movie had been made into a film back in 1970, I'd put Peter Fonda as King B, Vic Tayback (Mel from the Alice series) as Sid, Mamie Van Doren as Alice, Jeanne Moreau as Arabella, and Robert Wagner as Les Harrison.  And as Pamela was described as someone resembling Susannah York, why not?  And of course change the bummer ending.

Furthermore, the state of cinema reflects the society producing the movies.  A movie reveals all that society's taboos, inhibitions, degree of censorship, and sexuality.  But apart from being a mirror on society, it can also serve to influence a society's conscience.  For example, when a \\"perversion\\" is tolerated, that causes a shift in society's definition of normality.  Lenne's book thus takes a look at cinema from the erotic angle to examine contemporary mentality.<br />The question of why sex and nudity have been taboo in Western cinema is answered by equating nudity with nature, innocence, and health.  Nature, normality, and health is good, whereas anti-nature, abnormality, and unhealthiness is bad.  However, the onset of Judeo-Christianity, the ideological foundation and moral backbone of Western Civilization, condemned pleasure and condoned chastity, equating the suppression of pleasure with a virtue.  On one side, there was the Immaculation Conception, the miraculous virginity, which meant sexual pleasure became equated with Satan and evil.  Further, the consequences of repression leads to frustration and thence to madness, and that has been translated into film.  Looks at frigidity, nymphomania, and fetishism, among others are examined, with many films used as examples.<br />Lenne does get into a brief history of Hollywood, the star system, and the Hays Code that was imposed in the wake of scandals such as Fatty Arbuckle/Virginia Rappe and the Desmond Taylor murder.  The result was that vamps like Jean Harlow and particularly Mae West were defanged, something that killed Mae's career and would've for Jean had she lived beyond 1937.  It was from the late 1950's that the Code began to crack, with explicit dialogue relating to an assault in Anatomy Of A Murder (1959), the onset of the nudie film genre with Russ Meyer's The Immoral Mr. Teas, and Thelma Oliver baring her breasts in The Pawnbroker (1965) and the allowing of miscegenation that led to the Code's disintegration in 1966, replaced by a system of auto-regulation.  Things began from softcore in the 60's, with Russ Meyers' Faster Pussycat and Vixen heralding a transition to hardcore in the 1970's.  Films like Deep Throat, The Devil and Miss Jones, and Behind The Green Door exemplified the newfound liberation in films until October 1975, when regulation reared its head by giving an X to any film with \\"pornographic content.\\"  This also meant the envelope being pulled away, a retreat back to softcore.<br />The 1970's was when the cinema became more daring in France, enhanced by the various youth, gay, and feminist movements in Europe.  In fact, much of the photos, most of them, full-frontal, are of Italian and French films.  France is a centerpiece in this book, given Lenne's examination of the French New Wave, Vadim's And God Created Woman and Louis Malle's The Lovers, up to the 1970's with erotic films like Emmanuelle and The Story of O.  The 70's also saw the challenge against conventional marriage, with threesomes, cohabitation, and other unconventional couplings.<br />So then what is the purpose of censorship?  Lenne's contention is that it's to maintain order, and that the villain was again, pleasure, seen as a contagion, dangerous concept.  Thus, it was Hedy Lamarr's expression of pleasure rather than her nude scene in Ecstasy that was condemned.<br />The differentiation between eroticism and pornography is defined, where the former is more mental, more fantasy, whereas the latter is more physical, demonstrative.  The former has more positive connotations.  In the end, cinema will have succeeded when the film shown has made a true communion with its viewers, who will all begin to live their fantasies.

OK, so Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets came out in 2002, the calendar came out in 2003, so a 2004 calendar would logically have material from the first two movies, right?  Right, which this calendar does.  However, the months are clearly skewed towards the second movie, with only three months are dedicated to the Sorcerer's Stone.  Why not an even six/six, that's what I'd like to know?<br />The picture selections are well chosen, though not as good as last year's calendar.  The one's that raises bemused eyebrows is the large picture of the mountain troll with Harry's wand stuck up its right nostril.  Nice to see that for 31 days, that.  It's the quotes from the movies written on parchment-coloured rectangles that sink it.  They work if the dialogue's toe-tinglingly triumphant or something apt that fits the scene.  The potion book's explaining the Polyjuice Potion, shown aside Hermione's preparation of it, great.  Oliver Wood's simple \\"Watch it Harry\\" in the picture where Harry's chased by the Rogue Bludger, okay.  But Harry accusing Lucius Malfoy of precipitating the events of the story over a picture of Dobby being freed doesn't work.  A simple \\"Dobby is free!\\" would've been better.  Another observation:  none of the instructors show up-it's mostly Harry, Ron, and Hermione.<br />And no, there isn't a special page with stickers like there were on the 2003 wall calendar.  That'll probably come with the 2005 calendar for The Prisoner of Azkaban.  Reviewus terminatus.	2004-03-16
US	50237277	R14I7RF9JYOW0G	0942637909	556174675	Comrade Chikatilo: The Psychopathology of Russia's Notorious Serial Killer	Books	4	30	34	N	N	Portrait of Russia's notorious serial killer	In November 1990, Russian police finally arrested the man they believed to have been behind the brutal killings and mutilations of several children and young men and women ranging from age 9 to early twenties.  The man was Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo, a Ukraine-born supply clerk in his mid-fifties, who lured his victims with promises of a nice meal at his dacha in the woods, assaulted, stabbed his victims with knives multiple times, poked their eyes out, and calmly disposed of the body.  Under questioning, he admitted to 53 murders, which could've been up to 70.  This book traces Chikatilo's life, his reign of terror (1978-1990), and why he evaded captured for twelve years.<br />Having been born during the man-created famine of the Stalinist USSR, and having witnessed the kidnapping of his older brother Stepan, who was eaten by starving peasants, and thus made to stay inside the house for fear of suffering the same fate, it's no wonder that Chikatilo grew up with a damaged psyche.  His impotence and premature ejaculation no doubt led to further humility, humility that wouldn't have boiled into a rage of unfulfillment and thence to horrific murder, had medically curing impotency been legal in the Soviet Union.  Indeed it was lucky enough that he and his wife bore two children, and that his wife was a modest, patient, and understanding woman.  Alas, that wasn't enough, it seems.<br />The book also examines the flaws inherent in the Soviet police system.  People suspected of a crime on circumstantial evidence, yet having an airtight alibi can be made to confess.  This happened to Aleksandr Kravchenko, an ex-con who committed rape and murder but was under 18 so served his time, had seen the error of his ways and was now a good citizen.  Unfortunately, he lived on the same street as Chikatilo, his house was also near the river where Chikatilo's first victim was, and his wife, brought in on trumped-up charges of stealing, was forced to change her testimony regarding her husband's whereabouts.  Further, Kravchenko was beaten up in prison and threatened with rape by a decoy used to elicit confessions, and confessed to a crime he never committed, for which he was executed.<br />Another example is the immunity given to Party members from crimes.  Party membership was quite a mark of status in the Soviet Union.  And the emphasis of scientific evidence, then dated, worked for Chikatilo.  The police was looking for someone of blood type AB, and due to a medical anomaly, Chikatilo's blood was A, with the B antigen more prominent in his hair and saliva--hence the evidence was enough to drop any murder charges against him.  One police captain might have been credited with his capture, but he acted more on intuition and common sense (his seeing Chikatilo's behaviour at the train station and panic when asked to produce his documents), and that unfortunately isn't scientific.<br />Comparisons/contrasts between him and John Wayne Gacy are interesting, as it highlights the difference between American and Soviet sociology.  After Gacy was caught for his first offense back in the 60's, he served his time and was released, presumably cured (alas it was not to be).  Chikatilo was known for fondling the girls at the school he taught and once was caught assaulting a 14-year old in a lake, grabbing at her, yet nothing was done about his behaviour--it was just seen as one of his odd quirks(!)<br />The conclusion was that Chikatilo was three personalities in one.  One was the ordinary family man, the other was the rapist/murderer, and the third was the one who acted insane when put on trial for his heinous crimes.  The authors do a good job in maintaining the chronology and gathering of information, painting an effective portrait of Chikatilo, and using narrative reconstructions of two killings in gruesome detail, yet the lack of bibliography and sources makes the book somewhat questionable.usband's whereabouts.

US	50237277	R3JSDRPD13MJ2J	0312238630	621625468	Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Brilliant book for those uninitiated into anime	I'll admit that among the first anime I focused on watching were the LA Blue Girl, Angel of Darkness, and Twin Doll series because of the graphic violence and violations committed against women.  However, after reading Susan Napier's study on Anime, I was noticeably enlightened and focused on getting certain quality titles.  Napier, who teaches Japanese literature and culture at UTex, Austin, argues that anime has historical roots, from woodcarvings by Hiroshige Ando in the 19th century, the Edo Period of the Tokugawa period, such as the erotic kibyoshi books, to Zen cartoons in the medieval era, and even the Kabuki traditions.<br />As to why has anime become so popular with the release of Akira in 1988, the answer lies in the genres diversity in themes, the fact that it's not as predictable or sanitized as the child-geared Disney cartoons, and of course there's that unique visual style of those big-eyed, small waists, long-legged miniskirted women.  But the characters are more human and thus realistic, not straight black-and-white, but cases where heroes have some negative qualities and villains some positive ones.  And depending on the genre, anime reaches out to all age groups.  It's also an art form, and dramatic and intellectual in the same way independent films should be.<br />Females are more assertive and stand out as role models for young girls, whether it be San from Mononokehime, the klutzy but powerful Usagi of Sailor Moon, or Miko and Miyu, the demon fighting sisters in the graphically adult LA Blue Girl.  Compare that to wimpy heroines in Disney movies, where ironically, the more assertive females are the villains (Medusa in the Rescuers, Ursula in Little Mermaid, and the Evil Queen in Snow White).  But they are also seen as nurturing and supportive (q.v. Belldandy in Oh My Goddess).<br />However, anime also stands as a resistance against American-style globalization in pop culture.  Apart from the reasons listed, I sometimes think Americans who like anime do so for the same reason, to find other outlets, for the same reason certain people want foreign films to get away from the usual Hollywood grind.<br />Napier examines certain sub-genres in anime:  post-nuclear, elegy, the carnival, the graphic adult anime, and mecha, underlying that the first three are the most significant.<br />Akira is viewed as a study of the post-apocalyptic society as well as teenage alienation;  the former is a reminder that Japan was the only nation to have an atomic bomb dropped on it.<br />The fantasy element is examined in the &quot;magical girlfriend&quot; subgenre in Oh My Goddess! and Video Girl Ai, which goes beyond the movie star onscreen stepping into real life in The Purple Rose of Cairo.<br />Neon Evangelion is examined by Napier in the examination of the mecha genre.  There's clearly a technophobic dynamic explored in live-action movies like Terminator and Robocop, of the dangers of technology gone amuck.  And video games like Robotron 2087, I'd like to add.<br />The elegiac mode harkens back to a nostalgic yearning for something long gone, which in Japan's case involves the traditional countryside life that has been abandoned due to post-war industrialization, such as Only Yesterday, discussed in length.  However, it can also indicate loss or a search for something, exemplified by the cyborg agent Kusanagi's search for her human soul in Ghost In The Shell.<br />And yes, there is a section on Miyazaki Hayao, whose then-latest film, Mononokehime, broke Japanese box office records and won Best Picture at the Japanese film awards for 1997.  The still must-be-reissued Nausicaa and the Valley Of The Winds, a post-nuclear tale that was a favourite of Aum Shinri Kyo leader Asahara Shoko, the cute Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbour Totoro), examining the assertiveness of the sisters Satsuki and Mei, and Mononokehime, studying the man versus nature (the wild gods), but also technology (iron) versus nature, and some more assertive females, the title character San, Moro, the she-wolf who raised her, and Lady Eboshi, leader of the iron-forging village who wants to clear the forests.<br />A good start in learning the what and whys of anime, with with college-level discourses by Ms. Napier., the title character San, Moro, the she-wolf who raised her, and Lady Eboshi, leader of the iron-forging village who wants to clear the forests.<br />A good start in learning the what and whys of anime, with with college-level discourses by Ms. Napier.	2004-03-09

Naturally, a lot of this book is based on the TV series, but some are based on comic books and other tie-ins only diehard collectors have read.<br />Know Your Enemy-first off, there's a cut-away section of the Dalek, listing the 26 parts of the Dalek with separate listings for each component.  Think of it identical to a guide to the buttons on your remote.  For example, that screen-like mesh around the Dalek's head is an atmospheric absorption system for nutrients.  Some of the entries are humorous, in case of the lights on top of the head: &quot;while some documentary evidence suggests that the lights flash when the Dalek is not speaking, the most plausible theory to date is that the lights simply serve to indicate to other life-forms which Dalek is speaking.&quot;<br />After that, there is a series of Dalek pictures organized by rank, from Emperor Daleks, Daleks in their natural habitat, Invasion force Daleks, and standard Daleks, Imperial Daleks, Dalek Supremes, and of course, those powerhouse Special Weapons Daleks.  Each Dalek type is identified by overall colour, colour of sense globes, the type of slats and colour, types of appendages (e.g. eye stalk, gun, iris-type, etc.).<br />The section on How To Survive Captivity With A Dalek contains some funny cartoons.  In one, a Dalek tells a human, &quot;I have seen no other humans in the vicinity,&quot; while there are some skeletons lying on the ground nearby.  The caption reads, &quot;Conclusion:  The Dalek's immediate environs here suggest a lie.&quot;<br />Supplemental Data-this contains the various Dalek histories, including Terry Nation's original draft of the Daleks, and also a brief outline of Genesis Of The Daleks, the story explaining how the Daleks were created.  They also detail the technology, such as Transolar Discs.  However, the funniest section involves a sociological/psychological essay asking, &quot;Are the Daleks all bad?&quot;  Examples:  &quot;When the Daleks exterminate hundreds of people, we should not simply condemn.  We must ask ourselves, 'Where is the Art in this?  What does it tell us about this race?'... Remember, the Dalek's perspective is just as valid as your own.  All right, so you may not actually want to be exterminated, but try to appreciate--for once--the Dalek's point of view.&quot;  Yeah, right!<br />The FAQ section answers questions like &quot;Where Do The Daleks live?&quot; or &quot;Can Daleks swim?&quot;<br />So if the Daleks do invade and you survive, chances are you are a Who fan, and have read this book and not just laughed at the humorous cartoons and witty entries.line of Genesis Of The Daleks, the story explaining how the Daleks were created.

However, she gives different names of the types, different from Riso, although the focus of attention each types corresponds to Riso's analysis. I've listed Palmer's designation, followed by Riso's, and on the whole, I like Palmer's designations better, with the capital vice and antidote to each type.<br />1 Perfectionist, Reformer, anger, meekness<br />2 Giver, Helper, pride, humility<br />3 Performer, Motivator, [deceit], [truthfulness]<br />4 Romantic, Individualist, envy, charity<br />5 Observer, Investigator, avarice, poverty<br />6 Trooper, Loyalist, [fear], [courage]<br />7 Epicure, Enthusiast, gluttony, abstinence<br />8 Boss, Leader, lust, chastity<br />9 Mediator, Peacemaker, sloth, zeal<br />Like Riso, she covers George Gurdjieff, who pioneered the Enneagram in the West, but here's a fresh spin.  She takes Dante's areas of Purgatory and Geoffrey Chaucer's virtue listed in The Parson's Tale.  Each type is characterized by a certain passion, or a capital vice, and Chaucer's virtue is an antidote to that.  The brackets above indicate that they are designations from Oscar Ichazo, who further developed the virtues.  Palmer then uses Gurdjieff's centers of intelligence (mental, emotional, and body-based) to identify the focus of attention on each group.  For a four, it's melancholy on the mental, envy on the emotional, and competition, shame, and recklessness on the body-based.<br />Palmer then covers each type in terms of worldview, spiritual path, concerns, personality bias, subtype focus, focal issues, security and risk, intimacy, positive and negative signals, leadership style, conflicts, conflict resolution, employee participation, and team building.  In particular, I like the brief sentences used to describe the worldview.  In my case, a Type 4, it is &quot;Something is missing.  Others have it.  I have been abandoned.&quot;  The sense of shame on feeling unworthy proceeds from that feeling that something is missing.<br />She does use Riso's dynamics for change in each group using the 142857 cycle.  For example, a secure Type 4 shifts to a Type 1 on a positive, but an insecure Type 4 slides down to a Type 2.<br />Finally, Palmer creates a directory of relationships, love and workplace, playing each type against each other, e.g. 1's with 5's, 4's with 8's, etc.  However, she steps away from Keirsey's notion that one type is optimal with another type, i.e. Rationals with Idealists, stating, &quot;It would be a mistake, therefore, to categorize types according to compatibility or incompatibility.  Your best match in intimacy and team building is actually any psychologically mature person.&quot;<br />As director of the Center for Enneagram Studies, and having written The Enneagram and The Pocket Enneagram, Helen Palmer is ideally placed to write this book., it is &quot;Something is missing.

US	50237277	R4YCKC8EXL0UV	043932162X	69383288	Harry Potter Schoolbooks: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them / Quidditch Through the Ages	Books	5	41	42	N	N	Supplementary Harry Potter knowledge for a good cause	In order to benefit starving children around the world, J.K. Rowling put out this two book set in a nice purple cardboard slipcase based on Hogwarts textbooks, twenty percent of the retail sales minus taxes going to that charity.  They are meant to be as supplementary back stories to the Harry Potter mythos, and as it is sponsored by Comic Relief, there is some funny material in both books.  Both books have material that correspond to the first four books.<br />The first is Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them by Newt Scamander, which is one of the books all first year students needed.  It's basically a small encyclopedia on those beasts, with M.O.M. (Ministry of Magic) classifications going from X (boring) to XXXXX (known wizard killer/impossible to train or domesticate), or, as a scribble next to it reads, \\"or anything Hagrid likes.\\"  And what is a beast defined as?  The scribble in there reads \\"big hairy thing with too many legs.\\"<br />The scribbles in the book are what also enhance this book.  The book has a label \\"property of Harry Potter\\" on it, but we discover that Ron Weasley has been borrowing his book because he's spending his money on dung bombs instead of a new book.  For example, on the entry on Acromantula, giant eight-eyed spiders, there is a XXXXX rating, but several more X's have been scribbled, presumably by Mr. Weasley (q.v. Chamber of Secrets).  There's a funny comment under Pixies (q.v. Chamber of Secrets).<br />The entry in the Chimaera mentions a wizard who fell off his winged horse and died after slaying one.  This is clearly a reference to Greek mythology's Bellorophon, who fell off Pegasus after being stung by a wasp.<br />The second is Quidditch Through The Ages by Kennilworthy Whisp, with a seal reading \\"Property of Hogwarts Library\\" which reads like a history book and goes first from the development of the broomstick as a form of transport to its use in sports.  This takes the reader to brief descriptions of early broomstick games, and then to a certain game played at Queerditch Marsh in the 11th century.  The evolution of the game is detailed, but the most fascinating part is the origins of the Golden Snitch, which itself has a sad but ultimately humane ending.  However, I consider it a good move to have the blooders made of stone to Bludgers made out of iron.  Both would still be very painful if one was smacked in the gourd by one.<br />Other bits include major Quidditch teams, slang terms, broomstick models, and Quidditch moves (such as the Wronski feint, which Harry does in the first movie in order to reach the Snitch).<br />However, the book has duplicated wear and tear, plus a list of pupils who've checked this book out, include Oliver Wood, Angelina Johnson, Millicent Bulstrode, and the last two names, who are more than well known--a certain Hermione Granger and Harry Potter.  Those who are into HP will recognize the names I've listed.<br />While made for the main target market for Harry Potter, adults who read the book will get a laugh out of the scribbles in the red Beasts book and an insight into the creative historical-minded side of J.K.

This volume serves as an extension of Cannadine's earlier book Class In Britain.  In Ornamentalism, Cannadine takes a different approach in looking at the driving force of the British Empire.  It was driven not by race, but class, a traditional-hierarchical one, with the Empire being \\"the vehicle for the extension of British social structures, and the setting for the projection of British social perceptions, to the ends of the world and back again.\\"  This in turn means that \\"it was about antiquity and anachronism, tradition and honour, order and subordination, about glory and chivalry,... processions and ceremony, plumed hats and ermine robes... about thrones and crowns... dominion and hierarchy, ostentation and ornamentalism.\\" It was thus also concerned in the constructions of affinities rather than otherness, as one of the ways to civilize the places they had taken over.<br />Indeed, social ranking was the result of the Enlightenment's way of looking at people, races, and colour, a concept that transcended the three dynamics.  And the British were far more welcoming than the racist Germans.  An example was the invitation to England of King Kalakaua of Hawaii, who took precedence before the crown prince of Germany, the future Kaiser Wilhelm II, who took offence at his being ranked lower.<br />A lot of focus is given to the nobles of other countries, as the image formed by these well-dressed personages created a dignified image of order and authority.  These sultans, pashas, shahs, etc. were the apex to their own people, but formed a lateral relationship to the British dukes, princes, and marquesses.  They were also important in keeping order after uprisings such as the Sepoy mutiny of 1857.  India with its castes was the perfect example.  Rudyard Kipling himself observed the fixed order of obedience, pack animals obeying their drivers, drivers their sergeants, sergeants to their lieutenants, lieutenants to their captains, all the way up to generals obeying their viceroy.<br />The monarch itself symbolized the semi-divine aspect of the empire/territory/kingdom.  For Queen Victoria, the number of places named after her, the buildings, statues, stamps, honours, correspondence envelopes, were all manifestations of the omnipresence of empire and thus of class.  This is where Edward Elgar's \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" marches came in, in honour of the queen's Diamond Jubilee (sixtieth anniversary celebration) in 1897.  Critics saw them as \\"glittering gaudy toys.\\"<br />Also, the creation of honours to promote the imperial hierarchical vision is discussed, such as the Order of the Garter, Order of St. Michael, all these medals, which became a status symbol, leading to officials proudly displaying their array of orders like a peacock, \\"the accoutrements of hierarchical display and imperial ostentation.\\"<br />And thus did imperialism and classism, seen as one interconnected world, lead to ornamentalism, defined as \\"hierarchy made visible, immanent, and actual.  Small wonder that was the way the ordinary British citizen related to the world.  Abroad, \\"they saw what they were conditioned, what they wanted, and what they expected to see.\\"<br />In the end, it was nationalism, attacks from the urban, intellectual, and middle classes, technology, and the perception that hierarchy was unchanging that brought down the empire.<br />Cannadine doesn't take the neo-conservative, imperial apologist position, nor does he take the post-colonial and post-modern perspective in writing this book.  Rather, he neither defends nor criticizes it, but tells the facts plain and simple, using the \\"entire interactive system\\" approach and giving a wider perspective of what the Empire looked like.  He succeeds in breaking new ground, away from the ancient master narratives, by addressing the issue of class and hierarchy.ceroy.<br />The monarch itself symbolized the semi-divine aspect of the empire/territory/kingdom.

US	50237277	RHTCH53SXSHNT	0395798671	352408002	Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery	Books	5	20	22	N	N	Self-discovery as the key to facing a lonely world	As someone constantly obsessed in self-analysis and discovery, I was attracted to Riso's enneagram book, which I saw as an alternative or a step up from Keirsey's temperament sorter.  Whereas Keirsey has sixteen different types, four variants of four personalities, the Enneagram has nine different personality types, grouped into three Triads, the Feeling Triad (2,3,4), the Thinking Triad (5,6,7), and the Instinctive Triad (8,9,1).  And within each triad, each group either overexpresses, underexpresses, or is most out of touch with that dynamic.  For example, as a 4, my ability to feel is underexpressed.<br />The symbol for the enneagram is a circle with nine equidistant points drawn around the circumference, with 9 at the top, an equilaterial triangle drawn by connecting points 3,6,9, and another line by following this sequence, 1,4,2,8,5,7,1, which ironically is the sequence of numbers correlating to one-seventh, which is .1428571 repeated.<br />The concept of wings come in, which expands the nine types into eighteen different types, because one may be a mixture of two adjacent types, which is called a wing.  For example, I am a 4W5, termed a Bohemian, meaning that traits that straddle both a Type 4 and 5 are in my makeup.<br />However, the most important thing Riso does is explaining the healthy traits in each type, and what happens when the unhealthy traits become emphasized.  He lists nine levels, with levels 1-3 being healthy and psychologically balanced, 4-6 being average, where the ego starts to inflate and overcompensation begins, and 7-9 being unhealthy, dysfunctional to downright self-destructive and pathological.  Someone at the latter 3 levels slides down to the personality next in the 1428571 sequence.  For example, in my darkest hours, as a 4, I'll take on the characteristics of a 2.  However, a healthy person will integrate to the number before.  In my case, I'll integrate to a 1, meaning I'll be more opened up to people, and will either stay introspective or become outrospective.<br />In Chapter 14, he uses other psychologists works to further define the personalities.  For example, he uses Karen Horney's \\"general neurotic solutions\\" (compliant, aggressive, withdrawn) and Freud's anal/oral/phallic, retentive/expulsive/receptive designations.<br />One thing he explains is translating Jung's intelligence and functional types into his typology.  I'm duplicating this here, but this time using Keirsey's system, Horney's solutions, and Freud's designations.<br />2, Helper, ESFJ, ENFJ, compliant, a-exp<br />3, Motivator, no equivalent, aggressive, p-rec<br />4, Individualist, INFJ or INTJ, withdrawn, o-ret<br />5, Investigator, ISTP or INTP, withdrawn, o-exp<br />6, Loyalist, ISFP or INFP, compliant, a-rec<br />7, Enthusiast, ESTP or ESFP, aggressive, p-ret<br />8, Leader, ENTP or ENFP, aggressive, p-exp<br />9, Peacemaker, ISFJ or ISTJ, withdrawn, o-exp<br />1, Reformer, ESTJ or ENTJ, compliant, a-ret<br />Although he lists no equivalent for 3's, in looking at the examples of Type 3's, I noticed they were all celebrities, those in the Artisan type to use Keirsey's terminology, so SPs who may not be in Types 5, 6, or 7.<br />The appendix includes a diagram for each type, listing parental orientation, behaviours, attitudes, basic desires, and basic and secondary fears at the healthy, average, and unhealthy levels,<br />Riso also includes examples of famous people or characters from novels in each type.  People like me include Edgar Allan Poe,  Virginia Woolf, Bob Dylan, Johnny Depp, Joni Mitchell, D.H. Lawrence, and Yukio Mishima, so am I in good company or what?<br />Riso claims that not everyone's personality is totally set within one type, plus that's it's not THE panacea to becoming a whole individual.  Rather, the Enneagram is a tool which helps people understand themselves as they are at their best and worst in the middle of a lonely, terrifying, and impersonal world.ective or become outrospective.<br />In Chapter 14, he uses other psychologists works to further define the personalities.

The closest shelf of the calendar kiosk where I work has the girlie calendars, the ones that I keep an eye on for fear of theft.  Of those, there's Carmen Electra, Anna Kournikova, the Maxim girls, and then this well-tanned cute brunette, Brooke Burke.  Well, day after day of working there, something in those brown twinkling eyes and smile kept saying &quot;buy me, take me home.&quot;  I finally succumbed to that smile this past Sunday.<br />Despite the cover, no, there is no nude shots of her, although she does have a topless shot on the opening Sept-December 2003, which is poster-sized, with strategically-placed gold flakes.  (That'll do wonders for the price of gold, yeah?)  With the beach behind her, if that isn't a 21st century rendition of Botticelli's Venus having risen from the sea, or Ursula Andress' Honeychile Rider stepping on shore in Dr. No, I don't know what is.<br />Most of the photos are 8X10s that can be seen at her website, such as the white flowered swimsuit (August), but she is at her element on the cracked earth.  The photo for September, which is taken from the same session as the pose she strikes on the cover, is the one that appears in the intro of her site, except she's staring intently at the camera.<br />Brooke Burke is so much woman she makes Kournikova look like the Wicked Witch of the West.  If 2004 is a year that seems to drag on by, at least I'll have some sweet company to make the passing of that time worth it.  But when it's over...alas!	2003-12-18
US	50237277	R6UPPXUSNH47K	1932234004	75828016	Ring	Books	5	6	8	N	N	The book that started it all-well-written suspense thriller	When it comes to Ringu the movie, The Ring the Hollywood remake, The Ring the manga, and the original source for this series of runaway hits, Koji Suzuki's novel Ring, straight off I'd classify it more as an investigative suspense thriller rather than horror.<br />The whole story takes place between 5 September and 21 October 1990, with quite a bit of action taking place during a particular week.  Journalist Kazuyuki Asakawa is drawn into the deaths of two teenagers, one of them being his niece Tomoko, the other a boy who suddenly keeled over on his motorcycle and died.  The coroner's verdict for both: sudden heart failure.  Not only are the causes of death similar but so are the times of death, around 11:00 PM, and the fact that it was as if they were trying to pull their hair out.  Soon, he learns of a young teen couple who died the same way in a car, and that all four were friends.<br />A couple of clues leads him to the Villa Log Cabin resort where he watches a bizarre video full of abstract and real images, which gives him the following message at the end:  &quot;Those who have viewed these images are fated to die at this exact hour one week from now.  If you do not wish to die, you must follows these instructions exactly...&quot;<br />The problem is, the rest of the tape has been erased so there is no way to prevent death.  And as Asakawa has established that the four teenagers spent the night at the cabin a week before their deaths, he is in panic mode, as he has a wife and child.<br />He turns to his classmate and Ryuji Takayama for help.  Ryuji, now a cynical philosophy professor, may be a bit on the twisted side, as he boasted once that he assaulted young women in high school, and he has a bit of a libertine attitude, but he's intelligent, methodical, and quick to suss out clues from the video.  He is quick to take charge, being the more assertive of the two, and there are some actual intelligent conversations about science between them.  The situation becomes more urgent for Asakawa when... guess who else accidentally ends up watching the video?<br />Asakawa seems to have more of a conscience, whereas Ryuji is more jaded.  As he tells Asakawa after being asked if he felt guilty about the crime he committed against one of his victims, &quot;Try slamming your fist into a brick wall every day.  Eventually, you won't even feel the pain anymore.&quot;  With the countdown to Asakawa's life ticking away, the reporter's sense of urgency is felt in the book, while Ryuji seems to be taking it all in casual, confident of a resolution.<br />Having read the original source, I see how so many liberties were taken in even the 1998 Japanese theatrical version--there was even a TV movie version before the 1998 version--notice that it's a woman whose life is at stake in both movie versions.  However, Suzuki's writing is accessible, or should I say the people who translated his book, with a contemporary touch.<br />This is the first in a trilogy, the story being continued in Spiral and Loop, which will doubtless reach the US sometime in the future.  As for the title, it has nothing to do with &quot;before you die you see the ring&quot; re the Hollywood remake--it's more conceptual rather than concrete.  I read this all in one sitting, a few hours, minus time for lunch, so go figure.omes more urgent for Asakawa when... guess who else accidentally ends up watching the video?<br />Asakawa seems to have more of a conscience, whereas Ryuji is more jaded.

And in reading the Harry Potter books and watching the movies, one can't help but wonder, how does that work in the world of Hogwarts?  The bottom line is that the world of Hogwarts has got a technology that far surpasses 21st century technology, so to us, it does appear like magic.  Think of what the Aztecs thought when Cortes and his men fired their guns. Surely they thought the guns were magic, as that was alien to their civilization.<br />The Science Of Harry Potter is the name of this book.  What science, you might ask?  Well, how about alchemy, astronomy, biology, genetics, physiology, quantum physics, time travel, And there's some more, like history and mythology, on where creatures like Fluffy the three-headed dog guarding the Sorcerer's Stone and games like Quidditch were based on.  He also incorporates work from Einstein, Rutherford, Hawking, B.F. Skinner, John Nash (A Beautiful Mind) and Kip Thorne from the Muggle side.<br />The Sorting Hat, which sent the first-year Hogwarts students into their respective houses, might have had some interface that interpreted brain waves from the students, but there's also the concept of recognizing personalities a la Jung or Keirsey, so I wonder if the Hat's technology can correlate the brain's wiring with that of a Guardian, Rational, Idealist, or Artisan, to use Keirsey's classifications, and then say \\"Gryffindor\\" or \\"Slytherin.\\"<br />The theory of time travel in the Muggle world is that one can't go back in time before the machine was built, and also to prevent a mistaken killing of one's ancestors, because then one would be erased from existence. Hogwarts technicians must've overcome that glitch.  Hey, if it's possible in Dr. Who, why not in Harry Potter?<br />However, the fact that Nicolas Flamel is based on a real life 14th century alchemist and that Queen Elizabeth I's conjurer John Dee was the inspiration for Albus Dumbledore will jerk some eyes open.<br />As for an example of a psychological aspect of Harry Potter, Highfield uses bereavement syndrome to explain the Mirror of Erised, with the mirror as an output device that's receptive to the brain's trauma-ridden visions.<br />Apart from using J.K. Rowling's first four books, Roger Highfield exhaustively used respected biology, psychology, physics, and medical journals, and history books as his sources.<br />If one is of a highly fantastical and romantic nature, not wanting to spoil the magic of Harry Potter by possible scientific explanations, go elsewhere.  Those who are able to accept Clarke's Law and assimilate these theories into the Harry Potter universe without it spoiling the magic, this book's for you.  Well, time to put on my silvery cross-connected fiber-optic cape that records images from the background over me.

US	50237277	R2VTBPMKX92HQ3	0451524357	907195620	Complete Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde	Books	5	84	87	N	N	Short stories of tolerance, humility, and natural love	Anyone who's seen the Oscar Wilde biopic starring Stephen Fry as the great wit will have noticed him narrating &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot; to his children.  At first, I thought he was telling a story someone else had written, but when I heard a brief narration of a story in the movie Tesis, and discovered that it was from an Oscar Wilde story, I wondered if the giant story had been written by him.  Discovery of this book confirmed that fact for me.<br />This collection comprises both the Happy Prince compilation and the House of Pomegranates compilation of Oscar Wilde's short stories.  The Happy Prince contains these stories:<br />The Happy Prince<br />The Nightingale and the Rose<br />The Selfish Giant<br />The Devoted Friend<br />The Remarkable Rocket<br />The House Of Pomegranates contains these stories:<br />The Young King<br />The Birthday of the Infanta<br />The Fisherman and His Soul<br />The Star-Child<br />These stories are suitable for adults as well as children.  Wilde's adherence to Fabian socialist philosophy is seen in many of the tales here.  Basically, equal distribution of wealth, accompanied by tolerance, humility, and natural love would lead  to true individualism.  Many figures will have to become Christ-like martyrs to achieve such a world, regardless of whether the receiver of the gift will appreciate their sacrifice, as is the heartbreaking story of &quot;The Nightingale And The Rose.&quot;<br />Examples of this include The Happy Prince, where the prince, a living statue, gives up the jewels of his sword, the jewels making up his eyes to those less fortunate and finds himself happier as a result.  The same motif can be found in &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot;, who builds a wall around his garden to keep the children from playing in it;  as a result, Spring never comes to the garden and it's perpetual Winter.  The giant realizes his selfishness and tears down the wall.  And like the giant, the title character in &quot;The Star-Child&quot; goes from being proud of his good looks and standing, adopting a philosophy like the Remarkable Rocket (see below), then undergoes humility and suffering when those are taken from him, and becomes selfless and repentant as a result of his suffering.<br />Other main characters never see beyond their selfish egotism.  The Infanta in &quot;The Birthday of the Infanta&quot; is amused by a dancing dwarf, who is hunchbacked and ugly to behold.  She and her companions are doubled with laughter at his entertainment.  The poor dwarf, whom the Infanta has given a rose, thinks the Infanta loves him, and also, raised in the forest, is blissfully unaware of his countenance.  It is only when he looks in the mirror that he dies of a broken heart.  The Infanta then declares that no one should have a heart.<br />A denunciation to the upper class of the British Empire, who have an aura of self-importance around them, is given in &quot;The Remarkable Rocket&quot;  The Rocket's philosophy, &quot;the only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everyone else&quot; is telling of the misguided romantic mentality of this upper class.<br />But only in the psyches of certain individuals does true social consciousness arrive, such as &quot;The Young King&quot; whose dreams of the horrible cost of ordinary people who have suffered so that the upper class may prosper, deeply distresses him to the point that he refuses wear the luxurious signs of power symbolizing the raiment of the king.  &quot;...on the loom of sorrow, and by the hands of Pain, has this robe been woven.  There is Blood in the heart of this Ruby, and Death in the heart of this pearl.&quot;  &quot;Shall a man not eat bread till he has seen the sower, nor drink wine till he has talked with the vinedresser&quot; adds the King, in a foretelling of the sweatshops and maquiladoras of today.<br />And BTW, for those who have seen Alejandro Amenebar's Tesis, &quot;The Birthday Of The Infanta&quot; is the story Chema tells Angela as they are walking down the hallway of the college's movie archives.<br />Reading these stories and realizing how the Fabian society's dreams of a compassionate world is far from been fulfilled should give one pause to think what kind of world we live in.ry Chema tells Angela as they are walking down the hallway of the college's movie archives.<br />Reading these stories and realizing how the Fabian society's dreams of a compassionate world is far from been fulfilled should give one pause to think what kind of world we live in.	2003-11-15

When we were covering Taoism in my World Religions class, I suddenly recalled the Tao of Pooh book my sister-in-law gave me the year I planned to end it all, back in 1995/96.  I read it once, was comforted by it, and forgot it all.  Years later, after reading Taoism, I instantly felt a light bulb flash in my head... &quot;Oh, so that's what it's all about!&quot;  This cute book combines the Taoist philosophy in conjunction with Pooh's interractions with his friends, with Christopher Robin being the kind but serious teacher who tries to teach Pooh about what he represents--Taoism.<br />In contrasting Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, Confucius is described as a sour-faced man, Buddha as one with a bitter expression, but Lao-Tse being the smiling one.  Basically, the laws that govern the heavens are the same one that govern earth and man, and that if we go with the flow, we'll be in harmony.<br />The concepts of wu-wei is also explained.  Wu-wei means &quot;not doing&quot; but of doing nothing against the natural flow.  Here, it's called the Pooh Way, because Pooh has a &quot;mind that merely sees what's in front of it, and follows the nature of things.&quot;  In other words, put the round peg in the round hole, the square peg in the square one.<br />The characters who make up Pooh's friends demonstrate the flaw of knowledge and cleverness, and I was fascinated and sobered by this because their personalities reflect me, and I realize the bad side in knowing too much.<br />Dig this:  Owl, the modern equivalent of a Confusionist, Dessicated Scholar, is described as someone who gains Knowledge for Knowledge's sake, or for the sake of appearing wise.  A bit harsh because that's me to some extent.  Rabbit is described as someone who gains Knowledge for the sake of appearing Clever, and I had to wince, because to my shame, I fully admit that's also me to some extent.  And Eeyore is someone who gains Knowledge for the sake of Complaining.  Given my political stance, yes, me too again.  And as Pooh says in response to Owl having a brain, &quot;I suppose that that's why he never understands anything.&quot;  Maybe that's my problem too.<br />But Pooh, the lucky bear, may not have much of a brain, but he embodies the Simplicity of the Uncarved Block, the Taoist equivalent of John Locke's tabula rasa (blank slate).  Basically, Pooh can't describe the Uncarved Block, he just IS it.  &quot;That's the nature of the Uncarved Block.&quot;<br />And he's got the right idea in not being a Bisy Backson, or (Busy Back Soon), you know, rush-rush-rush.  I wonder why we don't have an American equivalent of a French sidewalk cafe or Chinese teahouse.  Now that I'm getting on, maybe I value the message of &quot;You're important.  Relax and enjoy yourself.&quot;<br />A cute book on the explanations of Taoism, and how maybe simplicity, wisdom (as opposed to knowledge) and contentment is the best way to go.  But it makes me wish that I was a tabula rasa or an Uncarved Block once again.  Oh, just to be, not to know or be clever, but just to be., me too again.

Sir Paul McCartney as musician, songwriter, actor, producer, knight, yes.  How about poet as opposed to songwriter?  Most definitely, as his school teacher turned him on to Shakespeare and Chaucer.  And as &quot;Blackbird&quot; is one of my favourite Beatles songs, I thought it appropriate a title for this collection of poetry and even songs by the Beatles, Wings, and his solo material.  However, I also learned in the intro that he was inspired by a message he was giving to a black women during the civil rights movement.  The song was transformed from literal to symbol, so the words changed from &quot;Black women living in Little Rock&quot; to &quot;Blackbird singing in the dead of night.&quot;<br />The book is divided into nine thematic sections:<br />1.  Playing at Home<br />2.  Yesterday<br />3.  Friends And Enemies<br />4.  The Business<br />5.  The World Tonight<br />6.  All The Lonely People<br />7.  Standing Stone<br />8.  Home To Love<br />9.  Nova<br />Sections 3 and especially 6, taken from a lyric in &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; hit home to me.  Some of Nova has odes to Linda and shows how devoted a couple they were and the devastation he felt at her passing, such as &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;She Is...&quot;<br />However, some poems show McCartney as social critic on the issues of nuclear war, pollution, the legal system, and public safety.  In &quot;Jerk of All Jerks&quot;, written from the point of view of the title people, he writes &quot;I'm the man that disposes/of nuclear waste/There's no need to worry/it's perfectly safe.&quot;  And he imparts great wisdom in describing the follies of going for the top is written in the refrain of &quot;Chasing The Cherry&quot;:  &quot;And say, are you chasing the cherry?/The merry-go-round of the roses/If so, you must know/that the down side/is to sink like a ferry.&quot;  And reading &quot;Looking For Changes&quot;, on the horrors of animal experimentation really got my dander up because Sir Paul told it like it was.<br />And some of his poems are whimsical and amusing.  In &quot;Trouble Is&quot;, he writes &quot;Rabbit running in circles/chasing his tail/because it looks like candy floss/Trouble is--rabbits don't eat candy floss.&quot;  The punchline to this poem is funny.<br />Where the songs are placed in a poetry format, some of them reveal themselves when read rather than being listened to.  &quot;Yesterday&quot; for example, is one, as is &quot;Here Today&quot; from the Tug Of War album (1982), dedicated to John Lennon.  And &quot;The Song We Were Singing&quot; from Flaming Pie shows Sir Paul commenting on how we all fall back to our usual selves after undergoing something deep:  &quot;Take a sip, see the world through a glass/and speculate about the cosmic solution/to the sound, blue guitars/caught up in a philosophical discussion.&quot;  But alas, &quot;we always come back to the song we were singing.&quot;<br />Compilation of this book was done by 60's activist/anti-war/counter culture poet Adrian Mitchell under Linda McCartney's guidance.  There is also an index, and for the songs, there is a listing telling which album it's from.  Helpful, that.  And this book, not only reminds people that McCartney is a great songwriter but reveals his inner personality as well.e of his poems are whimsical and amusing.

While acknowledging that empires are far from perfect, Ferguson allows the reader to decide \\"whether there could have been a less bloody path to modernity.\\" In the brief conclusion, he identifies America being in the same role Britain was for four centuries and the lessons it can learn from its forebear.<br />In each of Empire's six chapters, Ferguson gives a distinct theme both in terms of globalization and the human dynamics, chronologically weaving the two together, e.g. commodity markets/pirates, labour markets/planters, culture/missionaires, government/mandarins, capital markets/bankers, and warfare/bankruptcies.<br />Ferguson points out that the British were imitating the Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese empires at the time, countering the myth that England was the first industrial nation.  China and India were homes to the imports the British craved, but there was nothing the British had that those two countries wanted, so the British had to make cash purchases with gold and silver bullion.  The significance of this trading arrangement led to globalization, \\"the integration of the world as a single market\\"<br />Ferguson does not omit the darker moments, such as the Myall Creek Massacre in Australia (1838) and the massacre of Amristar (1919).  Yet he places culpability on misguided groups and individuals who were aberrations in the role of British administrators, weighing in with the presence of a distant \\"restraining authority\\" in London to halt the excesses of their colonists, a dynamic not present during the American campaign against the Native Americans.  The good intentions the British had can be labelled as the three C's:  commerce, civilization, and Christianity.  Ferguson then lists a fourth \\"C\\" that unfortunately emerged in conjunction with the other three:  conquest.<br />The reasons for the Empire's fall, is World War I, post-war territorial overstretch from the Ottoman Empire and Germany, and a tenfold increase in the national debt.  Reduced defense spending thus allowed Hitler and Mussolini to run riot in the 1930's.  He also briefly goes into the Japanese atrocities at Nanking.  India could have used WWII to break free, \\"but ... had to look at the way the Japanese conducted themselves... to see how much worse the alternative before them was\\".<br />Then there were nationalist uprisings, such as the Easter Rising in Ireland (1916) and the one in Amritsar;  what they both revealed was the schizophrenic nature of the British response:  \\"harsh on the ground but then emollient at the top.\\"<br />Ferguson accounts for the darker moments and failures of the British Empire, but in a broad context, concludes as follows:  \\"In the end, the British sacrificed her Empire to stop the Germans, Japanese, and Italians from keeping theirs.  Did not that sacrifice along expunge all the Empire's other sins?\\"  He heavily tilts the emphasis on economic, with military and administrative dynamics coming in a close tied second.  The last part of the title, \\"the Lessons for Global Power,\\" tells Americans to take the initiative and realize that their country is traversing down the same road as Britain.<br />Ferguson uses a few techniques to make this book eye-grabbing.  One is the use of contemporary phrases on past events.  The laying out of telegraph wires on the ocean floor--an \\"imperial information superhighway.\\"  How the telegraph and steamship shrank the world is reminiscent of how the Internet has done so from the late 1990's.

However, I didn't know that Peg Enwistle was the one who started a trend by diving off the LAND of the HOLLYWOODLAND sign, which now reads HOLLYWOOD.<br />The key scandals of the 1920's through 1950's are played out.  The Fatty Arbuckle scandal of 1921, involving his alleged part in the death of starlet Virginia Rappe, was the O.J. Simpson of the 1920's is given a separate chapter.  It took three trials to acquit him, but his career was finished.  As Anger snidily writes, \\"The Prince of Whales had been harpooned.\\"  The others include Errol Flynn being accused of having sex with two underage girls, Mary Astor's diary, and the stabbing death of Lana Turner's lover John Stompanato by Cheryl Crane.  Frances Farmer's nervous breakdown and collapse has some of snidiness in there, although he makes it clear that he does sympathize with her plight years before Nirvana did a song on her on their In Utero album.<br />Two mysterious and to this day still unsolved are probed, that of Thelma Todd, the Ice Cream Blonde, who may have been murdered by the mob instead of committing suicide, and the murder of director William Desmond Taylor, and those aren't as treated sensationally as other material.<br />Suicides are written with some embellishment in this book, i.e. Paul Bern, Jean Harlow's second husband, Marie Prevost, whose starving dog ate parts of her body, Lupe Velez, a.k.a. the Mexican Spitfire, and Carole Landis.  Separate sections are written for Velez and Landis.<br />However, not all events and people get Angers' chops and slices.  The Red Scare that ruined the lives of actors such as Gale Sondergaard and John Garfield, and the Hollywood Ten is presented as the travesty it was:  \\"What it did do was ruin many lives and careers and tarnish the glamor of Tinsel Town.\\"  And the blackmailing practices of the snoopy, Confidential magazine, forcing performers to cough up to prevent them from revealing sordid things about performers.  Thankfully, this terror was stopped when the founder of the magazine committed suicide after being named as a communist by Joe McCarthy.  He's also contemptuous of the two gossip columnist Gorgons, Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons.<br />Towards the end, the decline of Hollywood in the 1960's is portrayed as one sordid death after another, ranging from La Monroe, Judy Garland, Ramon Novarro, and George Sanders.  Somehow, I did not need to know that Garland died sitting on the toilet in her London flat.<br />Not a scholarly history of Hollywood's seamy side by any means.  Rather, Kenneth Anger drags out Hollywood's dirty laundry and lays it out in a shamelessly sensationalistic and exploitational format, with catty sentences to boot, even including a few nude photos of starlets.  Find a film encyclopedia instead.

Most of Lovecraft's writing style is straightforward narrative, no characters speaking, and it may seem dry and drab.  Most of the time, the protagonist is in the first person and is told from the point of view of that person looking back on the story or reporting it from a journalistic point of view.  The stories are set in New England, mostly Arkham, Massachusetts which houses Miskatonic University.  Most of them fall under unknown horrors, strange beings from another universe (the Great Old Ones), and things that wouldn't be out of place in the Twilight Zone, Ray Bradbury Presents, or Tales From The Crypt.<br />One of these stories, The Dunwich Horror, about how a human mutates in the course of the story, was made into a movie in 1970, and that has some actual dialogue.<br />The Colour In Space is actually an interesting one, portraying the devastating effects a meteor has on a valley and the family living in it, could make a good made-for-TV drama.  So could The Shadow Of Innsmouth, about a strange-looking group of people and a weird race found in the Pacific.  The protagonist learns the bulk of the story from a Zadok Allen, a 96-year old man who has witnessed a lot in the town, and there is dialogue, mostly from Allen.<br />The weirdest story is The Shadow Out Of Time, which deals astral travels a man may or may not have experienced, and encountering a race that might have existed back in time.<br />What brought me to buy one of his collections of short stories was the interest in the Old Ones, powerful beings from another universe who exert their evil powers on Earth from afar.<br />After reading most of these stories, I'll say it'll take me a while to get into Lovecraft, although I find some of the stories imaginative.  As for bloodcurdling and macabre, well, maybe for its day, but not today.ns of short stories was the interest in the Old Ones, powerful beings from another universe who exert their evil powers on Earth from afar.<br />After reading most of these stories, I'll say it'll take me a while to get into Lovecraft, although I find some of the stories imaginative.

US	50237277	R1V4CZ7YBNU7RH	0880642181	100687738	Deborah Harry	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Complimentary portrait of Deborah Harry	Cathy Che's book traces Harry's life from her birth in New Jersey to her becoming drummer and vocalist in the psychedelic group Wind In The Willows, singing with the Stilettoes, to Blondie, and beyond.  However, she divides the book thematically, such as Harry as a movie actress, Harry's influence on music after Blondie's departure from the music scene, as an icon for gays, and on fashion.  All this leads up to the Blondie reunion, which yielded the No Exit album and the accompanying tour.<br />The coverage of the CBGB's scene and the onset of Blondiemania is done well, and certain movie roles, i.e. Videodrome, Heavy, and Hairspray, have added detail, as they were starring roles for her.<br />The key content of the book are the series of interviews with Deborah Harry and the one with Chris Stein.  Che does reveal at the outset that Harry despises idiotic questions like \\"how does it feel to be a sex symbol?\\"  And that good manners and intelligent questions are a prerequisite to have a successful and interesting interview with her.  Her answers are honest, open, with a twist of humour every now and then.  However, what struck me was her belief that her accomplishments wasn't worth a full book.  Even Chris Stein thinks Harry doesn't realize the influence she has had on pop culture, which is bringing the \\"movie starlet sensibility into rock.\\"<br />What's important to emphasize, as Che does is that Blondie is all five members of the group, i.e. Harry, Stein, Clem Burke, Jimmie Destri, Gary Valentine, and as may have been apparent, Blondie became solely equated with Deborah Harry, an inaccuracy on one hand, but that's something that Chris Leeds, Blondie's manager from 77-79, fervently argues, that the men were \\"backing up this particularly beautiful woman.\\"  Leeds is portrayed as a controlling force and someone who had what it took to push Blondie in the spotlight, and he isn't portrayed too flatteringly here, perhaps justifiably so, as a clause in the exit contract gave him 20% royalties.<br />Another way to put it was 'Blondie' as Harry's onstage persona, a 70's Jean Harlow or Marilyn Monroe.  As Harry said, \\"The initial idea was to be desirable, feminine, and vulnerable, but a resilient, tenacious wit at the same time.\\"  \\"For this reason, technically Deborah Harry both is and isn't Blondie.\\"  I can go for that.<br />The brief commentary by those influenced by her include Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo, Fred Schneider of the B-52's, whose new track \\"Debbie\\" on their Future Generation greatest hits is a nod to Ms. harry, Michael Stipe of REM, and Theo Kogan of the Lunachicks is quite rewarding to read.  And Che also mentions Madonna, whose fiery independent, self-assured image was surely taken from Deborah Harry.<br />There is a series of photographs, including Andy Warhol's wonderful silk-screen portrait, a very interesting surreal painting by Robert Williams, and the usual bunch of photos.<br />Warm, accessible, and generous is how Che portrays Harry in this book, but Evelyn McDonnell's final words in the foreword sums things up pretty well:  \\"When Blondie died Harry was able to go on living.\\"him 20% royalties.<br />Another way to put it was 'Blondie' as Harry's onstage persona, a 70's Jean Harlow or Marilyn Monroe.

Slang.  photographs featuring a view of an attractive woman's legs and body.<br />Cute title, which is a take on the phrase Marie Antoinette plagiarized from a Polish princess.  Hugh Hefner's description of artist Olivia de Berardinis as the Anais Nin of contemporary fantasy graphic art, or as being for the 1990's what Alberto Vargas was to the 1940's and 1960's is highly apropos.  After all, Nin championed for female rights to fantasy, and the drawings of Olivia have the same aim.<br />Her drawings, most of them tasteful but erotically-charged nudes, might as well be characters in fantasy novels, such as zebra-women, women with plumed wings, and mermaids.  Vanity, yes, the one famous for her liaison with Prince, is drawn with cat years and tail using gouache.  The zebra-lady, whose skin has stripes like a zebra and who sports a main running from her forehead all the way down, is also a highlight.  Her capture of Bella Schol's unique but subtle sneer in her gouache and pencil drawing \\"Whiplash\\" is another.<br />Olivia's uses oil prepared with gesso (gypsum prepared with glue) and gouache, the latter being opaque watercolours prepared with gum, as well as watercolours, acrylics, and pastels, often using more than one medium per drawing.  The way she paints bare skin, be it pale, light brown, with shading that makes it so real is what attracted me to her drawings, as is the glossy finish she uses on some of her acrylics, which in her words, make them come alive.<br />Included in the intro is a letter Alberto Vargas wrote to Olivia dated 14 June 1979.  The appendix is a plethora of useful background information, as it lists each painting, the title, year made, dimensions, and the medium used, the model where applicable, and sometimes, comments by Olivia or her husband Joel Beren.  In the case of the cover drawing, it's titled \\"Devil's Food\\", dimensions 40\\"x30\\", watercolor, gouache on board, with Rhonda Ridley-Scott being the model.  Olivia says she was inspired by Milton Greene's photos of Marilyn, \\"with a nod to the Cheshire cat.\\"<br />Among the models used are Vanity,  Marilyn Monroe-lookalike Rhonda Ridley Scott, Pamela Anderson, and Bella Schol.  She also does likenesses of Bettie Page and Josephine Baker, based on photographs.  But the real Page probably never had a full-bodied black panther chasing a mouse tattooed down her back (Cat And Mouse).<br />The commentary by Olivia in the back shows her to be a very creative and self-assured woman who uses her paintings to reflect the mood she's trying to elicit, be it something with a lighter touch or something aggressively splashed.  The main thing is that the women of her paintings are those \\"in control of their own sexuality, who choose their partners, and choose to be dominant or submissive, and not be admonished for their decisions.\\"  This goes back to the Anais Nin comparison.  I have my friend Erick Vaneckhoutte in Farmington to thank me for introducing me to Olivia.nspired by Milton Greene's photos of Marilyn, \\"with a nod to the Cheshire cat.\\"<br />Among the models used are Vanity,  Marilyn Monroe-lookalike Rhonda Ridley Scott, Pamela Anderson, and Bella Schol.

US	50237277	R1YPH9GI5C0AO0	0821217658	913838623	Marilyn Monroe and the Camera	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Good place to start for Marilyn photos.	One of the first Marilyn books I got was a compilation of photographs from well-known photographers.  It wasn't till later that I got the original primary sources, i.e. books by Eve Arnold, and collections by Bernard Bruno and Bert Stern.  So once one gets this collection, one can decide which photographer captured Marilyn's beauty the best, be it Milton Greene, Bernard Bruno, Richard Avedon, Ed Feingersh, or my personal favourite, Andre de Dienes.  The photos, both colour and B&W, accompanied by captions, take the reader on a chronological journey from 1945 to her death in 1962.<br />Well-known photographs include the Tom Kelley photo that led to the notorious nude calendar, her potato sack dress, the photo Andy Warhol used, her wearing the golden dress, and the Life magazine photo.  The final picture is not of her but her obituary flashing across Times Square.<br />Other material include a 1960 interview done with Georges Belmont for the French magazine Marie Claire.  She talks mostly about her early life as a child before going into her adult life.  Jane Russell, who was her costar in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, does a brief but generous foreword on her recollections.<br />Other photos include scenes from movies, press conferences,and other occasions.  There's an annotated biography and filmography in the rear of the book.  Each film entry has the distributing company, year, starring cast, and the name of Marilyn's character.  As for the bibliography, I was surprised to see I had nine of the books used.<br />This serves as a cross-section of photos taken by various photographers as well as a photographic history.  Good for beginning MM students, as it was for me back then.	2003-07-15

Jacques Tati's Mr. Hulot character, whose tics and twitches he memorized during his time at St. Bees.  The significance of this is that it helped him in his technique of using silent comedy, miming even, to get laughs.  Coupled with the faces he pulled in front of a mirror to gain a rubbery-faced elasticity that rivalled Jim Carrey, we can see the beginnings of Mr. Bean.  Naturally, Monty Python is an influence, as it aired when he was 15 years old.  John Cleese's nasty sarcasm was later felt in each of the Blackadders, as well as his portrayal of hideous comedy star Ron Anderson in his first starring movie, The Tall Guy, opposite Jeff Goldblum.<br />There are a lot of comparisons between him and Cleese, come to think of it.  Each of them had many years behind them, cutting their teeth on TV series, working with other performers, never being in something for too long, before making it big.<br />In terms of his TV series, there's quite a lot devoted to each of them:  Not The Nine O'Clock News, Blackadder, Mr. Bean, and the Thin Blue Line.  Brief plots are given of each episode, as well as major performers who appear as guest stars, such as Miranda Richardson, Rik Mayall (The Young Ones), and Robbie Coltrane (Harry Potter movies).  It is with the third series of Black Adder (my personal favourite) that he won BAFTAs (the British equivalent of the Emmys and Oscars).<br />Mr. Bean, despite being his breakthrough series, was not only his fulfillment to create a comedy that could be more universal instead of being directed strictly at British tastes, was in a way the culmination of sketches he did on stage in the late 1970's, so it was basically old material (e.g. face shaving routine) refined.  The movie was a success here, but because it was so Hollywoodized, was panned quite a bit in Britain.<br />Atkinson though comes through as a genius who despite striving to be a perfectionist, realizes that perfectionism unhealthily reduces someone to a bundle of ragged nerves.  More an introvert, he is two different people, a comic onstage, a very private person offstage.<br />At this point, the Bean movie seems to be the pinnacle of his American success, but has the backlash happened?  Sure, he came out the painfully jejune Rat Race, but Johnny English may be his saving grace, as Hollywood seems at a loss how to use him optimally.  Then again, he didn't quite break into movies, as the book points out.  Most of his movie roles have been minor (Never Say Never Again, Hot Shots Part Deux, Four Weddings And A Funeral).  Yet through this book and from the time I noticed him in Not The Nine O'Clock News, the thing I've learned is never to anticipate what Rowan Atkinson will do next.  Overall, a well-done book that casts Atkinson in a positive light and recommended for those who want to find out more on Britain's most talented comic since John Cleese.g. face shaving routine) refined.

Or put it this way, it can be used for both bad and good, but given human nature, more to the former.  Shoplifting, sneaking into movies for free, robbing a house, even murder or rape.  It's that element of surprise that gives invisibility its appeal, that sense of being powerful and thus invulnerable.  However, imagine someone looking around to make sure nobody's around, sees nobody, pulls out a gun and shoots at nothing, hitting an invisible person.  Moreover, what if one couldn't revert to visibility?  Both assets and disadvantages are experienced by the title character, who during the course of H.G. Wells's immortal 1897 novel, goes around the bend.<br />The Coach and Horses country inn in Iping gets a mysterious visitor on 29 February 1896-the year's not mentioned, but I say this because 1896 is the closest Leap Year-and this person isn't exactly hospitable.  He's brusque, reclusive, demanding, and temperamental, as he breaks things but is willing to have them put on his bill.<br />Iping being a small-town and all, it isn't long before people learn about the \\"damned rum customer\\" at the inn.  Rumours start flying.  One is that he's an escaped criminal in disguise.  The most amusing comes from Mr. Fearenside, whose dog bit the stranger's leg.  \\"He's a kind of halfbreed, and the colour's come off patchy instead of mixing.\\"  The only thing patchy here is Fearenside's theory, but let's not go there.  A burglary and an event the inn's proprietress Ms. Hall attributess to spirits occur, before the stranger's secret is unveiled, to reveal... nothing.  But that's only the beginning, as the stranger's hot temper eventually becomes his undoing.<br />Wells' writing in this novel is more journalistic.  He writes from the POV of someone having heard this account from other sources, like the characters in the story.  The account of a murder that takes place reads out partly like a police report, but also a detective yarn.  And he gets the dialect of the Iping folk down pat--imagine people talking like Hagrid (Harry Potter).<br />There are also interesting bits of writing, as when he describes Mr. Huxter yielding to unconsciousness:  \\"The world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light, and subsequent proceeded interested him no more.\\"<br />Like its predecessor The Island Of Dr. Moreau, Wells' novel is another portrayal of science gone wrong under misguided scientists.ort, but also a detective yarn.

That model was Madonna Louise Ciccone.  Some of those photos ended up in the September 85 Playboy, after Like A Virgin exploded over the face of pop.  Schreiber describes this book as \\"a celebration of the human form, a dedication to an innocent, determined young woman, and to all figure models.\\"  Given the photos that were shot, I'd concur.  $30 for three hours, as the consent form signed by her says.  Well, that three hour session yielded some really tasteful b&w photography, the highlights of which are blown up for this book.  The last pages show the safety film of the complete sessions.<br />This particular form, done in various lighting and shadows, is quite appealing and artful.  One full frontal shot of her, spanning 8 through 8A on the safety film, with the head cut off, would make an excellent Greek or Roman statue.<br />The frontal sphinx-like crouching shots of her are nice.  A striped cat is crouched inbetween her arms.  The next shot, the cat is gone, she is in the same position, and there's a view of her pubic hair in shadows.  The cat comes out in two other shots of her, including the book cover photo.  BTW, Madonna isn't smiling in these shots but maintains a dignified expression throughout.<br />Think about it though.  These were taken in 1979, years before Like A Virgin, MTV, Sean Penn, Blonde Ambition, Evita, and the bogus British accent she has now affected.  Often times, early activities by an actor or singer (think Sylvester Stallone) reveals some embarassing moments, but this isn't one of them, as the Certain Sacrifice movie was.  No, years from now, Madonna can look through these pictures and remember the simpler times.  P.S.  I wonder if the cat got an autographed copy of Like A Virgin from her.	2003-07-11
US	50237277	R1V7JL8TD0W698	0879517182	890978873	The Marilyn Encyclopedia	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Updated Marilyn reference work recommended for MM students	The basis I'm using as comparison is with an earlier book, The Unabridged Marilyn-Her Life From A to Z.  The Marilyn Encyclopedia's assets is that there is more information, there are splendid colour photographs not present in the earlier book. In fact, it boasts 170 full-clour photos and 205 b&amp;w ones.  Some of the colour ones take two pages.  As for the entries, they compare favourably with the other book.  And each letter, A,B,C,D... et cetera is heralded by a colour photo.<br />One key difference is that the entry for each movie lists the cast and credits, as well as any Academy Award nominations and wins.  She herself wasn't nominated for any.  It is also more up to date, 1999 compared to 1987.  Much has happened re people.  Inbetween those 12 years, Bette Davis, Dean Martin, Joe DiMaggio, and Frank Sinatra among others have died, and this book updates those facts.  Yes, the domestic postage stamp that was released in 1995 is included. However, I was surprised Marilyn Manson wasn't included, as his stage name is an amalgam of Marilyn [Monroe], [Charles] Manson.<br />Yet the one factor that differentiates the two books is this entry:  &quot;Internet.&quot;  As the first paragraph states, &quot;The world's most popular woman has spawned thousands of tribute sites on the World Wide Web.  Type in the world &quot;Marilyn Monroe&quot; on any of the major search engines and you get back a bewildering number of matches.&quot;  And I was also amazed to see how many actresses have portrayed Marilyn-based characters or how many fictional novels have been written on her, so &quot;most popular woman&quot; does have some merit to it.<br />The Marilyn Encyclopedia easily supplants its earlier predecessor.	2003-07-09

This malchick here's got a couple of bolshie slovos to shazat to you all.  One of the many books in my biblio is A Clockwork Orange written by that Anthony Burgess veck.  It's the story of Little Alex and his droogs who go about shopcrasting, tolchocking other gang members with britvas and nozhes, as well as going on the surprise visit and having a bit of the old in-out, in-out with some hapless devotchka or what not.  His tyrannical ways becomes his undoing and his droogs turn on him.  He is sent to the Staja (state jail) on a murder charge, but that sentenced is commuted in exchange for taking part in \\"this new treatment that gets you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure that you never get back in again.\\"  But is that better than the traditional eye for an eye, as the prison Governor says?<br />The debate between good and evil is the bolshy theme here as explained in this passage comparing goodness and badness as different shops:  \\"If lewdies are good that's because they like it, and I wouldn't interfere with their pleasures, and so on to the other shop.  And I was patronizing the other shop.  More, badness is of the self, the one, the you or me on our oddy knockies, and that other self is made by old Bog or God and is his great pride and radosty.  But the not-self cannot have the bad, meaning they of the government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self.  And is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines?\\"  The self against the machines.  Yes, we saw in the 1960's, my brothers.  But the quote also explains that we are all so full of what Christians call original sin, we want to go into that shop of badness, we enjoy seeing scenes of ultraviolence, people being tolchocked.  After all, it's easier to destroy rather than create, so it's no surprise despite having a decent pee and em raising him up, that our humble narrator dishes and gets dished the tortures of the damned.<br />Another bolshy theme pops up when the prison charles has a govoreet with Alex, who has just gotten the opportunity to undergo this Ludovico vesch that turns a malchick like himself good.  The charles says, \\"What does God want?  Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness?  Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" Or still, \\"in a sense, in choosing to be deprived of the ability to make an ethical choice, [is to have] in a sense really chosen the good?\\"<br />The number of chapters also plays a significant role, like it did in Dante's Divine Comedy.  This book is divided into three sections, each of 7 chapters each.  Seven times three is twenty-one, which is the age at which someone reaches adulthood, and that last chapter was originally taken out of the American release of this book.  That's how the film directed by that Stanley Kubrick chelloveck ended.<br />And that's where I too end, oh my brothers, for a bit of spatchka.  I finish with a tall glass of the old warm moloko, \\"before getting my passport stamped...at sleep's frontier.\\", to spat perchance to sneety, but that's another work altogetherdecent pee and em raising him up, that our humble narrator dishes and gets dished the tortures of the damned.<br />Another bolshy theme pops up when the prison charles has a govoreet with Alex, who has just gotten the opportunity to undergo this Ludovico vesch that turns a malchick like himself good.

Bunny's Honeys is a tasteful collection of many other models Miss Yeager photographed during her heyday.  Having started herself as a model for US Camera, it wasn't long before she decided to go on the other side of the lens.<br />The models are arranged in alphabetical order, with a brief blurb on each one.  Unless one were an avid student of 50's and 60's models, the names would be lost, but that's because Yeager preferred to photograph woman who hadn't been photographed before.  There are colour and B&W photos.  Not all of them are nudes, but being a woman herself, she did have a knack for tastefully bringing out their natural beauty in a way that men photographers wouldn't.  Also, the models felt more comfortable posing in front of her as opposed to a man, which stands to reason.  And the models have that 1950's look and the texture of the photographs bring out a nostalgic air.<br />Most of the models have two pages devoted to them.  Bettie Page has six.  Maria Stinger, a cross between Marilyn Monroe and Lana Turner, has only two pages devoted despite the fact that a 1954 magazine cover of her was the first photo Bunny sold.  Others like Lisa Winters get their due, as Winters became a Playmate of the Year.<br />Yeager clearly loved her work and some creativity shows, such as the orchid bikini she designed for Joan Rawlings.  She describes in the foreword how she always tried to find new posing ideas, hairstyles, etc.  However, she felt alienated at the more explicit photos coming to the forefront in the 1970's:  \\"Photos of women in men's magazines were no longer beautiful for me to look at.  I didn't want to do that kind of photography.  It was demeaning to women.  The loveliness of a woman's body was gone and in its place was a type of cold clinical photography that only concentrated on the female sex organs.\\"  Result, she gave up pin-up photography.<br />Eric Kroll's description of Yeager's work is accurate:  \\"Bunny Yeager's photographs were never obscene.  Erotic and glamorous yes.  Cheesecake, perhaps, but not pornographic. ... These are the 1950's after all.\\"  Kroll is known as the man who returned Bunny to the spotlight by making her work, especially Bettie Page photos, available to the public eye.  The essay on her gives him a chance to thank the woman whose photos he enjoyed in his youth.  And this book gives me a better appreciation of an independent woman ahead of her time.

On that particular St. Nicholas's Day, Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu were executed by members of the National Salvation Front.  Romania thus became the last of the Communist East bloc countries to fall, albeit violently.  That's how the book begins, before going back in time and detailing Ceausescu's rise and fall.<br />Ceausescu worked as a cobbler in his father-in-law's shop and was lousy.  When asked by his father-in-law what he would do for a living, Ceausescu prophetically replied, \\"I won't need a trade.

Also, readers will learn that Ceausescu was Romania's third Communist leader, the others being Petru Grosz (1946-1948) and Gheorge Gheorgiu-Dej (1948-1965)<br />There's also the usual historic background behind Romania from World War I, when it was ruled by the ineffectual but tyrannical King Carol.  The rise of the RCP under Gheorge Gheorgiu-Dej in the 1930's, and Romania under the Axis-allied Iron Guard is covered.  These are important, as Romania's rival communists began jockeying for power when the tide of the war began to turn.  But being a high-ranking lackey for Gheorgiu-Dej helped Ceausescu when the former became the second Communist leader of Romania.<br />There's also an unflattering look at Elena Ceausescu, nee Petrescu, who was a lousy student and whose doctorate in chemistry was gotten by bogus means--she didn't even know the formula for sulfuric acid.  And some portion of the book includes the early career of Ion Iliescu, the man who succeeded Ceausescu as leader of Romania.<br />One critical event that took place was the earthquake in 1977, which stimulated his desire for urban renewal and led him to destroy villages and churches--he was \\"perceived as an urban rapist, Dracula driving a bulldozer.\\"<br />I'll say here and now that at high school, I considered Ceausescu a hero, a maverick in the mold of Tito because he told the Soviet Union where to go, he and Tito condemned the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, and he defied the Soviet-sponsored East bloc boycott of the LA Games, sending some hot-looking gymnasts by the way.  He was seen as the \\"good communist\\" because of that, even when he was starving his own people by exporting food abroad, concentrating on enriching himself--in France, he and his people stole ashtrays, clocks, electric and phone wiring at the residence they had been staying at.  This book reveals him to be quite the tyrant.<br />Behr's book spawned a TV special aired on PBS, which I videotaped.  Oh, and as for the title, it's taken from an old Romanian proverb of Turkish origin.  Although Ceausescu and his wife are long gone, they left their mark on Romania the same way Stalin did his on the Soviet Union, and it's likely to continue for years to come.	2003-07-03

He was seen as the \\"good communist\\" because of that, even when he was starving his own people by exporting food abroad, concentrating on enriching himself--in France, he and his people stole ashtrays, clocks, electric and phone wiring at the residence they had been staying at.

Aside from the long wait, the phrase I'd use to explain why The Order of the Phoenix is hands-down the best so far in the planned Harry Potter septet, is \\"surprising changes\\" and right from the outset, J.K. Rowling's fifth book opens with the best Dursleys segment ever that yanks the readers eye and won't give it back.  Many changes take place in Hogwarts, disrupting the normal flow of things we expect, and one of them involves the usual Quidditch games.  It's also a traumatic time for fifth formers, as they have to take their OWLS, Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the wizard equivalent of the English O-levels, which filters students into specialized areas for careers.<br />As for the title, the Order, founded by Dumbledore, refers to the secret society who fought Voldemort the first time around.  They've reconvened following the events in Book Four.  Harry's halo has dipped a little, though not clear down to his neck, thankfully but who can blame him?  He's fifteen, and having reached that temperamental, sarcastic, cynical stage, he lashes out at Ron and Hermione after being marooned at Privet Drive for a month:  \\"Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him; his frustration at the lack of news, the hurt they had all been  without him, ... All the feelings he was half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries.\\"  Harry does have cause to erupt, as he is far from ordinary and the lion's share of bad stuff happens to him--I mean, this book isn't called Hermione Granger and The Order Of The Phoenix, right?  Neither she nor Ron had to face Voldemort or dementors.  Ron and Hermione stand by their beleaguered friend throughout the turmoil nevertheless. As for me, to borrow a phrase from President Clinton, I'd tell Harry, \\"I feel your pain.\\"<br />As for the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge, well, think of it this way.  Umbrage (close to Umbridge) means offense or resentment, so that should give you a rough idea.  Dumbledore plays a real major role here, if one has read excerpts of the book released before the street date.  However, politics in the magic world has taken a nasty turn, with Cornelius Fudge, under the thrall of people like Lucius Malfoy, refusing to recognize Voldemort's return and accusing Dumbledore of irresponsible rumor-mongering and trying to seize the Ministry of Magic for himself.<br />Two characters really come out into the forefront.  Mrs. Weasley becomes heavily involved in the Order but also comes to regard Harry as kind of family, as she scolds him as much as she does her own flesh-and-blood.  She locks horns with Sirius, Harry's godfather on this.  It's the kindly Remus Lupin who is the mediating voice of reason between the two.  The other is Neville Longbottom, who makes an effort not to be the unassertive clumsy klutz who suffered at the hands of a broom and Cornish pixies in the first two books.  No, he really shines through here.  And Ron Weasley undergoes some character development here.  And Hermione?  Still brilliant as ever, and a good choice to be a prefect.<br />The Order of the Phoenix is again an epic-sized book like its immediate predecessor, The Goblet Of Fire.  The parallels to the resurgence of German nationalism, the brewing stormclouds of war following the Nazis' going back to Czechoslovakia for seconds, and debates between the appeaser Chamberlain and Churchill, who recognized the threat Hitler actually posed, is seen here.  And more threads to the the Harry Potter tapestry are woven here by Rowling's magical hands.  One of 2003's best reasons to be alive!  Thanks very much, Ms. Rowling!

I let the really dark turn this book took towards the end make me rank it below The Prisoner of Azkaban, but a reread and the ensuing reflection found me ranking this above its predecessor.  With the fourth book, J.K. Rowling turns the Harry Potter series into epic-size proportions and given the recently-released fifth book, it's something that will continue with Books Six and Seven.  In fact the opening chapter of this book hints at what's in store.  The question is when and how?<br />There are two big extra-special events in this book.  The first one is the Quidditch World Cup, where thousands of wizards attend to see Ireland play Bulgaria.  Harry goes with the Weasleys and Hermione to this once-in-a-while gala sporting event, which takes place in the woods.<br />However, mayhem is later caused at the campsite when the Dark Mark, an emerald skull representing Voldemort's supporters, appears in the sky.<br />Meanwhile at Hogwarts, Dumbledore announces the Tri-Wizard competition, revived after its dangerous past, with 6th or 7th formers (16-17 year olds) allowed to compete.  Qualifying students are told to enter their names into the Goblet of Fire.  That eliminates Harry, who is only a fourth former and knowingly does not put his name into the Goblet.  You can imagine what happens, right?<br />Many new developments are taking place.  Fred and George Weasley would rather open up a joke shop, much to the chagrin of their mother, who think they should be putting more emphasis on higher education.  Dudley, Harry's nasty cousin, is their first victim a la the Ton Tongue Toffee, but then again, he deserves it.  Guess what it does?<br />The character of Rita Skeeter, a gossip columnist always looking for dirt on her subjects who would put Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons to shame, is introduced.  Woe be to anyone who crosses her, although one would think the article on Hermione being Harry's girlfriend, though untrue, would be a compliment to Harry and Hermione.  Along those lines, Harry and Ron are growing up.  They notice beautiful women in the form of veelas, sensuous-looking creatures from Bulgaria with a Siren-like effect.<br />There's another new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Mad Eye Moody, He's gruff, no-nonsense, blunt, --he even punishes Draco Malfoy in a very funny way-- but he really knows his stuff and the part where he discusses the Unforgivable curses really demonstrates what should really be learned.<br />In the third book, Rowling portrayed a conflict between Ron and Hermione due to Crookshanks, her cat.  This time, it's between Harry and Ron, and among his peers, Hermione is more than ever a beacon of support for Harry in his time of need, even though having her as a friend means spending more time in the library and less talk about Quidditch.  Hagrid is also a pillar of support, as he believes in Harry.<br />The book sets things for the next book, but is the story worth the 700+ pages?  Well, yes it is!  I recently read an article saying that the movie for this book might be split into two movies.  If that's the case, I wonder if they will film it all at once, then stagger the release dates (a la the recent Tolkien trilogy adaptations).  That would still keep interest stoked up in the series, and by then, the penultimate book will have hit the shelves and the third movie out on video.rmione.

No, this covers Bowie's RCA period, from Space Oddity up to Scary Monsters.  Each section is done per album, and before the song-by-song analysis and description, there is a detailed history of Bowie's life at that point.  Bowie's better-known collaborators are given decent print, especially Mick Jagger, Marc Bolan, John Lennon, and Tony Visconti, as are influences such as Kraftwerk for his three Berlin albums, Stanley Kubrick's 2001 for Space Oddity, and George Orwell's 1984 for the Diamond Dogs album.  Bowie's inter-album projects, such as his movies and plays are also included in the history.  And there's a good deal given about his early life before Space Oddity.<br />There are certain insights into Bowie concerning his art.  He even said, &quot;I don't like a lot of my albums... I like bits and pieces.  A bit of it works exceedingly well and a lot of it only works.&quot;  This mirrors somewhat my feeling on his lesser albums, such as Diamond Dogs and Young Americans, but not on his spectacular ones such as Hunky Dory, The Man Who Sold The World, or Low.<br />Many of the stories behind the song are revelatory for those not in the know.  I wasn't totally aware of the 1984-theme that pervaded Diamond Dogs apart from the &quot;1984&quot; song, but &quot;We Are The Dead&quot; (in 1984, Winston Smith's words to Julia before they are caught by the Thought Police) and &quot;Big Brother/Chant Of The Ever Circling Skeletal Family&quot; are two other songs that contribute to that.<br />To take an example from my favourite 1970's Bowie album, Hunky Dory, I learn that Bob Dylan wasn't exactly happy with the playful tribute &quot;Song For Bob Dylan&quot; because Bowie referred to him by his real name and described his voice akin to &quot;sand and glue.&quot;  Ouch!  However, as I learned, the song was actually calling for Dylan to go back &quot;to writing songs for the 'revolution' and to scour his scrapbook for inspiration if the muse is not upon him.&quot;<br />And it's peppered with colour and black-and-white photos.  At the end of the book, a chronology from 1947 to 1980, and a singles and album discography are included, with song listing and album issues and reissues included, as was done under Ryko for the albums being explored in this book.<br />In the end, Bowie is revealed as a great songwriter, wordsmith, and artist whose creativity knows no bounds, even if he did alienate many of his fans with his shifting musical directions.inspiration if the muse is not upon him.&quot;<br />And it's peppered with colour and black-and-white photos.

A break comes when her husband becomes involved in an antitrust suit against Megabyte, a software giant.  However, the time spent on the case creates a larger rift between them that eventually erupts into interpersonal conflict.<br />The underlying conflict within Amanda always comes back to balancing her loyalties to her husband and children as wife/mother while at the same time wondering whether she should go back to work.  There is the feeling of self-worth, self-affirmation, self-fulfillment of the feminist 70's, in conflict with the 1950's selflessness in being Donna Reed, child-rearer, cook, etc.  Which leads her to wonder constantly:  \\"why not go back to work?\\"<br />The title really gives me pause to think.  Amanda was bright in her working career, but @ home, looking after her children, getting the household chores done, and all to make things presentable to her husband by the time he comes home is quite a struggle with her, which goes back to the conflict within.  When the sound of vacuuming is perceived as beneficially drowning the children's screaming and howling, it's time for some heavy duty introspection.  She is the one who has to deal with some rather unfriendly school teachers and officials who are unsympathetic to her son Ben, whom they say is being \\"violent.\\"  Even around the gatherings with her fellow women, she feels alienated and insecure because of their higher status.<br />From the 1980's onwards, the career woman was on the rise, with or without Mr. Mom, to use a movie reference.  Anyone wanting to have a Donna Reed-like family structure would either have to have a CEO breadwinner (clearly I'm exaggerating) or be willing to live with enough to cover essentials but no extras that demonstrates one's social status.  It's sad how the measure of social standing, self-esteem, and happiness is measured by material things.  It's OK if one is single, but if one has a couple of offspring to mind, it's important to become friends with Mr. Dollar.<br />It also makes me think how much of a global, digital, efficient, and impersonal world we have entered with the New Economy.  The  title of the book, Amanda Bright@HOME, in an e-mail format smacking of the Internet Age, attests to this.<br />Crittenden injects some wit in her book from page one, about a minefield of toys, and a room that \\"looked as if it had been attacked by Suicide Bomber Ken.\\"  And despite the turmoil that takes place in the novel, there is a note of hope within this mechanized mindset of a world.  A house-husband, Alan, tells Amanda not to worry about Ben:  \\"The world is always trying to put your kid into some sort of box, and you may as well learn early on how to fight your way out of it.\\"  Too true, and it applies to us even as adults.  Perhaps that's why I still haven't found my destiny--this reluctance to be pigeonholed in a box.<br />Reviewer's note:  I had the honour to read a personally signed copy of this novel sent to me courtesy of David Frum, Ms. Crittenden's husband and talented author in his own right, and it was equally an honour to review it.ey say is being \\"violent.\\"  Even around the gatherings with her fellow women, she feels alienated and insecure because of their higher status.<br />From the 1980's onwards, the career woman was on the rise, with or without Mr. Mom, to use a movie reference.

Taking a Russian history class and learning in detail about Joseph Stalin's rule would help one understand Animal Farm much better, as well as the characters.  George Orwell's hatred of totalitarianism, especially that of the Stalinist USSR, formed the basis for this short satirical fiction.<br />A band of oppressed farm animals oust Jones, their cruel human owner and take over the farm.  Led by two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, the animals proceed to run the farm by themselves so they are no longer exploited.<br />Napoleon is clearly Stalin, while Snowball is based on Leon Trotsky, and the Old Major is Lenin.  Squealer may be Molotov or Kaganovich, but I'm not sure.  The first attack on the Farm by Jones and his men is based on the Russian Civil War (1918-1921), where disorganized factions of anti-communists attacked the Soviet Union from all sides, and lost.  However, things don't always go in parallel, as the Old Major dies before the Revolution.  Lenin of course precipitated the Revolution in 1917.  And note the date of the liberation of Manor Farm:  12 October.  That is close to 24 October, the date of the Bolshevik Revolution.<br />Other items:  Boxer the horse is the epitome of the hard worker whose two sayings are \\"Napoleon is always right\\" and \\"I will work harder.\\"  In fact he may be Stakhanov, the worker whose team so efficiently met their quota in one of Stalin's 5-Year Plans, that the word Stakhanovite became synonymous with an A-One Soviet worker.  And the inability of most animals to read only the first two letters of the alphabet hint at their being lowly, illiterate subjects blindly obedient to the State.<br />The Seven Commandments--ironic for a Biblical reference in an atheist system-- plays an important key to the book, as they keep changing during Napoleon's reign.  They are:  \\"Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy, 2)  Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend, 3)  No animal shall wear clothes, 4)  No animal shall sleep in a bed, 5)  No animal shall drink alcohol, 6)  No animal shall kill any other animal, and 7) All animals are equal.\\"  However, as Napoleon consolidates his rule, the Commandments become slightly altered.  For example, after the animal executions, analogous to Stalin's purges, the sixth Commandment has the words \\"without cause\\" appended.  And talk about irony in using the name of Napoleon for the Stalin character when in fact Napoleon invaded Russia, the result of which increased distrust of the West by Russians.<br />Orwell's portrait of the totalitarian state would be finalized in his masterpiece 1984.  Animal Farm was a preview for that grand work, but the final thing that comes through in this book is that the Stalinist regime was just as oppressive as the czarist regime, with the ordinary animals on the receiving end-i.e. \\"but some animals are more equal than others.\\"5)  No animal shall drink alcohol, 6)  No animal shall kill any other animal, and 7) All animals are equal.\\"  However, as Napoleon consolidates his rule, the Commandments become slightly altered.

Wells.  One is The Time Machine, which of course was the primary inspiration for my all-time favourite TV show, Doctor Who.  The other is The Island Of Dr. Moreau, which like the Time Machine, I saw as a pioneer literary work in science fiction.<br />After being picked up from the dinghy of the Lady Vain by a trader ship, Edward Prendick goes to a small unchartered island in the Pacific, where he finds some very strange looking natives, including a serving man with furred pointed ears.  The island is run by Dr. Moreau.  Could this be the same Dr. Moreau who had to leave England in a hurry because of a scandal involving experimentation on dogs?<br />The contrast between man and animal is one theme here, as seen in the natives' laws:  \\"Not to go on all Fours; that is the Law.  Are we not men?\\" or \\"Not to claw Bark of Trees; that is the Law.  Are we not men?\\"  No we are Devo.  Sorry, wrong reference.  Prendick is also called a \\"five man,\\" as in five fingers.  What makes men different from animals?  Reasoning, language, being bipedal, trimmed nails, and sophisticated in manner, although that last point is certainly debatable.<br />However, most people are so keen to see this as a pioneering sci-fi literary miss the intellectual background.  After Darwin's theory of evolution started to crack the foundations of Victorian and religious thinking.  It seemed that we were closer to apes than to God.  However, humanism also reared its head again, and Moreau becomes another Dr. Frankenstein in playing God.  Small wonder why Wells later called this a \\"an exercise in youthful blasphemy,\\" though it's interesting that he initially became a disciple of pro-evolution scientist Thomas Huxley--in the novel, Prendick himself claims to be a student of Huxley.<br />So far, this book has been remade into at least four movies, none of which have faithfully adapted it.  There was even a Dr. Who story, Timelash, which borrowed heavily from it, and the theme of man usurping God's place at his own peril comes through.<br />This book has some relevancy today, as stated in the afterword by Brian Aldiss:  The spirit of Dr. Moreau is alive and well and living in these United States.  These days, he would be state-funded.the theme of man usurping God's place at his own peril comes through.<br />This book has some relevancy today, as stated in the afterword by Brian Aldiss:  The spirit of Dr. Moreau is alive and well and living in these United States.

I originally bought this book when I was interested in finding any of Salman Rushdie's books.  I found it mildly interesting.  This past winter, I took an upper division History of Central America at Fort Lewis College and after learning more about the Somozas and the Nicaraguan Revolution, I dug up Rushdie's book and one, it made more sense, two, I was more intrigued than merely interested.<br />Rushdie introduces the background to the Nicaraguan revolution that forced Anastasio Somoza Debayle's resignation in 1979 and even goes into the background of Augusto Sandino, the nationalist rebel leader executed by Anastasio Somoza Garcia's Guardia Nacional, and the Somoza dynasty that lasted forty years.<br />Rushdie got to meet some of the big nine Sandinista leaders, including President Daniel Ortega, vice president Sergio Ramirez, and agriculture minister Jaime Wheelock.  However, they justify press censorship because they are at war with the Contras and America, and any press sympathetic to the US will undermine the regime.  Seems reasonable, as the U.S. funding of Contras and the mining of Managua's harbours were acts of war by the U.S.<br />Not only are the Contras portrayed as terrorists, but Reagan isn't seen in a favourable light, understandably.  Rushdie writes \\"Scarecrow Ronald Reagans hung--by the neck--from roadside trees.\\"  And in Ortega's speech to the people of Esteli, \\"Quien es culpabile?\\"  the people roar back:  \\"Reagan!\\"  Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto even recalls a conversation with a Reagan administration official who tells him \\"Just do as we (the U.S.) say,\\" serving as a reminder of U.S. hegemony in Central America and its refusal to abide by the Hague judgment, which ruled that the U.S. contra aid and force was a violation of international law.<br />Rushdie also visits Bluefields, where there are Miskito, Sumo, and Rama indigenes alienated by first the Somozas and the Sandinistas.  One tragedy is that there are only 23 Ramas left and any attempt to preserve their language is hampered by the fact that many of them have few teeth, putting the mockers on proper enunciation.  One of the people he meets is Mary Ellsberg, daughter of Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers, who is totally sympathetic to the plight of the indigenes there.<br /> Rushdie's interview with Violeta Chamorro, widow of La Prensa editor Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, and later to be elected president, reveals Ms. Chamorro as someone who tries to manipulate a few facts and is biased against Ortega--she claims that Ortega was not elected democratically and yet according to foreign observers and an 80% voter turnout, he was.

One of the people he meets is Mary Ellsberg, daughter of Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers, who is totally sympathetic to the plight of the indigenes there.<br /> Rushdie's interview with Violeta Chamorro, widow of La Prensa editor Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, and later to be elected president, reveals Ms. Chamorro as someone who tries to manipulate a few facts and is biased against Ortega--she claims that Ortega was not elected democratically and yet according to foreign observers and an 80% voter turnout, he was.

It is up to the Left to coalesce once again into a unifying force to continue the American story and achieve the country.<br />The loss of American pride is another key element.  Rorty derives this from two modern thinkers, Walt Whitman and John Dewey, whose beliefs sharply contrasted with that of the finite, absolute, divine-centered beliefs of the Victorian pre-modernists.  Whitman passionately exalted the more humanistic approach to truth and self-discovery caused by the floodgates opened by Darwin's theory of evolution.  As a result, the divine standard to which men held to was replaced by secular humanism and humanistic standards.<br />Both Dewey and Whitman saw \\"America\\" and \\"democracy\\" as synonymous with being \\"human.\\" Dewey too placed \\"America\\" and \\"democracy\\" on a visionary scale. But where Whitman described the American way as \\"the last and greatest vision of the American potential,\\" Dewey saw \\"democracy\\" and thus America's story as \\"a great word, whose history... remains unwritten, because that history has yet to be enacted\\".<br />As a result, Rorty asserts that Dewey and Whitman would advocate American pride despite blacker moments in America's history such as the Vietnam War.  This was why the Left lost its effectiveness in carrying out its intellectual role--its spectatorial preoccupation with sin.  According to Rorty, a Dewey-Whitman counter to this indulgence in self-disgust would be that \\"there are many things that should chasten and temper such pride, but that nothing a nation has done should make it impossible to regain self-respect.\\"<br />Another group of thinkers Rorty drew upon was the \\"reformist Left,\\" progressives who as champions of the downtrodden, strove to make political and social changes within a constitutional and democratic edifice.  This reformist Left consists of two groups: the powerful, financially secure leftist elite launching top-down initiatives, (Upton Sinclair, Ida Tarbell, the Wagner Act) and  the second group, consisting of the financially insecure and disempowered \\"little man\\" and grass roots organizations (Marcus Garvey, the Montgomery bus boycott, and the Stonewall riots.) Rorty contends that the reinforcement of the bottom by the top was the glue holding the two groups until 1964, when the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and the denial of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party at the Democratic Convention created a rift in the Left.<br />The solution, according to Rorty, is a unification of the Lefts, as the Cultural Left is \\"unable to engage in national politics... [or] deal with the consequences of globalization.\\" That is something the pre-Sixties left is able to do, i.e. \\"piecemeal reform within the framework of a market economy.\\" Rorty also wants to wean the Cultural Left from addictions such as theorizing, philosophizing, abstract systems, and self-disgust. In its place, he proposes activism, concrete solutions, a focus on people and pressing issues, and national pride, the latter two which the grass roots conservatives used to push the Right in power. The job of this Brand New Left, a union of the reformist Left, Cultural Left, and in support of the little man, is to create a new ideology and hence a new utopia that will engage and mobilize a hitherto disillusioned populace into political participation waiting for specific solutions. The Brand New Left will be an intelligentsia practicing pragmatism.<br />Proud as Dewey and Whitman are in their assertion of America, bowing to no other authority, not even God, I am disturbed by one application of their assertion. This statement corresponds with American unilateralism, the concept of the United States being above the auspices of the United Nations, whose vision is more inclusive and unbiased towards any one nation.<br />I also agree, that yes, it is beneficial to be aware of the darker moments of American history, and to learn not to make the same mistake and move forward to what one would hope to be a better tomorrow. But what is the line between proper awareness and a prosaic, token, and trendy \\"awareness month\\" or \\"awareness week\\"?itman are in their assertion of America, bowing to no other authority, not even God, I am disturbed by one application of their assertion.

I had my first glance at a Bathory without knowing it so I finally found the book after a long search.<br />The story, based on Leopold Sacher-Masoch's novel of the same name, but Pichard's version focuses more on her last few days of freedom in 1611--she died in captivity in 1614.  There is rampant female nudity in this book and the torture and bondage scenes are pretty explicit, but Pichard's artwork is alternately attractive and grotesque.  Erzebet herself is the best-drawn.<br />It also takes liberties on facts about the Countess's life.  For example, her obsession with blood began when a serving girl brushing her hair pulled too hard and the Countess struck her so hard, she drew blood.  The blood dripped on her skin, and when she saw its effect, became convinced that blood could keep her young.  There's a different version of that told in the Masoch-Pichard book.<br />Anyway, it involves Emmerich, a young prince and his sister Isabel who are paying a visit to Bathory and hear of her reputation along the way.  They see the ways she punishes lawbreakers and disobedient servants, which should have sent up red flags saying &quot;Run, Forrest, Run,&quot; but...<br />Very very adult and sadistic, and definitely not for the squeamish.  For those interested in Bathory, graphic novels, and maybe black metal fans into dark stuff, this is perfect.  And its meagre 44-pages are potent enough to make Pichard's artwork a veritable impression on one.	2003-05-16

Journalist David Remnick, who spent four years in Moscow, compiled a series of thematic events into Lenin's Tomb, and explained how glasnost, initiated in small doses by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, became GLASNOST that proved too potent for the dilapidated Soviet state, and in the end, the Marxist-Leninist foundation on which the State had been build.  An overdose of GLASNOST gave the Soviet Union a fatal political cardiac arrest.<br />However, in his indicting assessment, he notes how the Party and the Soviet Union, like Lenin's mummified husk, was politically, spiritually, and economically bankrupt. \\"The Soviet Union was an old tyrant slouched in the corner with cataracts and gallstones, his muscles gone slack.  He wore plastic shoes and a shiny suit that stank of sweat.  He hogged all the food and fouled his pants.  Mornings, his tongue was coated with the ash-taste of age. ... The state was senile but still dangerous enough.\\"  Nice analogy, huh?<br />Remnick further identifies the cause of that decay with the Party and its failure to keep the promises of socialism to the ordinary Soviets:  \\"The men of the Communist Party, the leaders of the KGB and the military and the millions of provincial functionaries who had grown up on a falsified history, could not bear the truth.  Not because they didn't believe it.  They knew the facts of the past better than anyone else.  But the truth challenged their existence, their comfort and privileges.  Their right to a decent office, a cut of meat, the month of vacation in the Crimea--it all depended on a colossal social deception, on the forced ignorance of 280 million people. ... When history was no longer and instrument of the Party, the Party was doomed to failure.  For history proved precisely that:  that the Party was rotten to the core.\\"  And once ordinary Soviets realized they had been lied to, that the socialist utopia was a pipe dream, they wanted the riches and luxuries that only a capitalist system could provide.  In short, the Party was over.<br />Gorbachev was willing to give the Soviet people an inch, i.e. glasnost. As the caretaker of History, he was willing to demonize Stalin but not Lenin.  Denouncing Lenin would mean denouncing Marx and Communism, and flat out telling the Soviet people that they had lived a lie for seventy-four years.  Instead, the Soviet people took their miles, GLASNOST, and ran with it to many finish line;  for the Russians, it would be the demonstration in front of the parliament building on 20-21 August 1991.<br />Glasnost had thus led to GLASNOST. The influx of information and culture from the West, formerly forbidden books, had led to the ghosts of the past rising up again, be they formerly independent republics absorbed by Russia, or institutions that had been partially banned, such as the church.<br />Glasnost also revealed the failings of the system, and this was most painfully apparent with the Chernobyl tragedy 26 April 1986.  Chernobyl was the epitomy of many things.  One, it symbolized \\"every curse of the Soviet system, the decay and arrogance, the willful ignorance and self-deception.\\"  Two, \\"Chernobyl was not like the Communist system.  They were one in the same. ... The system ate into our bones the same way the radiation did, and the powers that be--or the powers that were--did everything they could to cover it all up, to wish it all away\\"<br />According to Remnick, Gorbachev introduced glasnost and perestroika as a bandage, albeit a piffling one, to the Soviet Union, and he should be credited for that courageous act in face of the opposition he faced.  However, he was outshadowed by Andrei Sakharov and Boris Yeltsin, who advocated what the people really wanted, GLASNOST and PERESTROIKA, i.e. open heart surgery.  They and the Soviet peoples took GLASNOST to its logical conclusion, chucking the Soviet Union's bones into the dustbins of History.<br />This is a well-detailed critical book that explores the whys and hows of the Soviet Union's collapse, and more interesting for those like me who witnessed the Gorbachev era.ucking the Soviet Union's bones into the dustbins of History.<br />This is a well-detailed critical book that explores the whys and hows of the Soviet Union's collapse, and more interesting for those like me who witnessed the Gorbachev era.	2003-05-16

Krutch defined the title concept to mean the angst-ridden state of mind exhibited by people in the 1910's and 1920's who wanted to return to the simpler ways of Victorian certainties and principles, such as the concept of man radicaly differentiated from animals, the existence of universal moral truths, and the certain existence of God.  Unfortunately for them, Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution hit the Victorian fan, thus beginning the gradual unravelling of God, absolutes, and other Victorian principles.  William James himself added fuel to the fire by espousing pragmatism as a method to actively find out a belief system that fits in with people's experiences.<br />The situation of people exhibiting that modern temper was akin to an adult nostalgically looking back to at his simple childhood,  a world of poetry, mythology, and religion that was upset by the world of science.  The ideal world was replaced by the world of Nature.  The anthropomorphic God and human needs and feelings were ousted by Nature.  Yet, there was a need to crawl back into the womb, as \\"the myth, having once been established, persists long after the assumptions upon which it was made have been destroyed, because, being born of desire, it is far more satisfactory than any fact\\".<br />The failure of the laboratory and hence of science underlined this dilemma.  The scientific method came to be applied in fields such as history, philosophy, and anthropology, so why not lay out the human soul on the dissection table and start hacking away?  However, science was used to seek out a light, such as ultraviolet or infrared, that man, limited in sight by the visible spectrum, was unable to see.  Mankind thus lost its faith in its findings to discover that sought-for moral world.<br />The implications for love were likewise devastating. Formerly the thing that brought man closest to the divine state or the highest level possible, depending on how man saw himself, the value of love became a hormonal thing.  Sex replaced love by demystifying and desanctifying it, increasing its accessibility.<br />The long-term implications of the modern temper and the yearning of returning to the pre-Darwinian womb hints at the collapse of the American Empire.  Krutch mentioned how philosophical debates sapped the vitality of Greece to the point that it was conquered by the Romans, who after building an empire yielding enormous riches and comforts, suffered the same fate under philosophically innocent barbarians.<br />Metaphysics, which operated outside the realm of observable and objective reality, established certitudes such as ethics, whose realization caused a blooming of the human spirit.  Yet science and applied Darwinism knocked down those certitudes like nine-pins, causing that human spirit to wilt as man realized the dissonance between the idealized world of his childhood and the harsh unrelenting world of Nature.  The solution was to create the beneficent \\"fiction,\\" transforming life to an art.  All one has to do is to assume the existence of some moral order \\"and ... construct in his imagination a world where they actually do.\\"  And if the foundations of that fiction can be destroyed by science or the physical world, so what?  One protects his world by erecting a Great Wall between it and the physical world.  The trouble is twofold.  One is the lack of ultimate conviction belied by any self-created world.  The other is the believer's self-deceptive slide away from reality.<br />The advent of postmodernists and their struggles against premodernists and modernists in America seems to be that same debate that will make us soft and while we are busy arguing, the underbelly of our empire will be slit open by another country in the vitality stage.  The question is who?  A very thought-provoking book on the conflict between modernism and absolutism.himself, the value of love became a hormonal thing.

The Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan in 1965, is the key to first studying in the C of S and lays out the philosophy underlying his movement and exposes many hypocritical aspects of mainstream religion.  The tenet that the world is a brutal cutthroat world reeking of Social Darwinism, and one must struggle to go above it, but there are other considerations.<br />Mainstream religion has communitarianism, belief in God, love one another, the Golden Rule, temperance, etc. while the Church of Satan emphasizes individualism, belief in one self, a revised Golden Rule I'll detail later, and indulgence.<br />The most important question though, is, &quot;Who is God?&quot;  Answer:  in my case, it's me.  This is an underlying current, especially in self-glorification.  For example, look at some of our holidays.  Some workplaces get Easter and Christmas off.  For a Satanist, the holiest day is one's own birthday, so one should be allowed to take that day off, or better yet, make it a paid holiday for oneself.  After that, Walpurgisnacht (30 April/1 May) which may also be Beltane, Halloween, and then the solstices and equinoxes, as the latter celebrate the first day of the seasons.  There are also Marxist undertones to this argument, as LaVey points out that man created God.<br />Yet here's another thing to make clear:  LaVey clearly points out that Satanists do NOT, I repeat, do NOT sacrifice living people or animals.<br />LaVey's book unveils the many hypocrisies underlying Christian society.  For example, in a chapter on hate, LaVey questions that necessity of degrading oneself and thinking something like, &quot;They'll be punished by God.&quot;  The truth is, not all people are loving, so why not hate them?  But by all means, give love to people who actually DESERVE it, not on ingrates.  Oh, and how's this for a revision of the Golden Rule:  &quot;Do unto others as others do unto you.&quot;  If someone is nice to you, sure, be nice to them.  If someone hits you, hit them back!  Pacifists may quake at this, but self-defense is justifiable.<br />And what is the difference of sin in Christianity and Satanism?  In the former, one asks for forgiveness at confession.  Confessing to another human being is degrading.  Why not go the route the latter recommends, basically to recognize one has made a mistake, to learn from it, and not do it again.  Seems more pragmatic to me.<br />Hope and prayer and not seen as productive.  Prayer means one will sit back and wait for a situation favourable to happen instead of taking direct action.  In other words, positive thinking + positive action = results.<br />Some parts of his creed turn Biblical phrases on their head.  His take on the Seven Deadly Sins is revealing.  Greed simply means wanting more than one has.  Envy means looking with favour on the possession of others and wanting to get the same things for oneself.  The two together combine to be a huge positive motivational factor.<br />The latter sixty percent of the book concentrates on the ritual aspects and the incantations which one might pass over or read if one has leisure.  It affirms man's need for the emotional and ritual as a balance with the logical and secular.<br />A revealing and thought-provoking look at this often misunderstood religion.

Apart from the art, there's a written text of her life that gives one insight into her life and what aspects the movie emphasized or omitted.  There are also black &amp; white and colour photographs of her as well.<br />She mostly did self-portraits, and looking through them, I see more and more that Hayek was the best choice to play Kahlo.  Many of the paintings realized and duplicated in the movie appear here.  The Two Fridas, one wearing the white dress, the other a blue dress, with a blood vessel connecting the two, are included, as is her stark representation of the miscarriage which in the movie, causes Diego to weep.<br />The title of each painted, the medium used, e.g. oil on canvas, the year painted, and the current whereabouts of the original are listed on each page.<br />Many of them are simple but brutal, others demonstrated the cathartic release of the pain she felt, whether it was the lifelong spinal injury gained from the train accident in 1925, to her divorce from husband and artist Diego Rivera.  The main reason for her painting was to compensate for the inadequacies she felt, i.e. her shorter right leg and her spinal condition.  The Broken Column, which is a cutaway picture of her with a fractured Greek column representing her spine and nails hammered into her body, sums up her pain very well.<br />As for painting other people, the portrait of her sister Cristina, her husband Diego, and Lupita and Mariana Morillo are simply stunning.<br />She's remembered as the best known female painter ever, whether it be for her surrealist pictures, the Mexican culture embodied in her paintings, and how she was able to project her feelings through her art, stark, brutal, and poignant.  After this volume, a next possible step are the books by Hayden Herrera that served as the basis for the film, which is the route I'm taking.	2003-04-05

Low's book On The Plaza-The Politics of Public Space and Culture discusses the interrelationship of public space and culture.  She primarily focuses on two plazas in San Jose, Costa Rica, the Parque Central and the Plaza de la Cultura, while also making references to other places such as Tenochtitlan in Mexico. Using ethnographic, ethnohistorical, microgeographical, and statistic sampling methods, Low argues that \\"these culturally and politically charged public spaces are essential to everyday civic life and the maintenance of a participatory democracy.\\"<br />Low describes the background of Costa Rica, going into its population, ethnic, religious, and urban proportion distribution.  She explains the rise and fall of consecutive monocultural economies, such as cacao, tobacco, bananas, and coffee, its tradition of democracy, and the economic nadir in the 1980's.  She then goes into the history of San Jose from colonial times to the present, including the devastating effects of the economic downtown and the trade vacuum created by NAFTA.<br />She then explores the history of the two plazas.  Parque Central dates back to 1761, and is the larger and more densely populated of the two.  It became a center for merchants, grocers, lottery ticket sellers, and sundry vendors, as well as shoppers and customers.  Also, the trend of regulars sitting in the same benches over time gives Parque Central an ambience of traditional social life and hence less contested space between various social groups.<br />The Plaza de la Cultura, constructed between 1976 and 1982, was built as a contrast to the closed nature of Parque Central, as a more open space for the middle and lower classes.  Central to the plaza was the National Theatre with a museum housing the country's Precolumbian gold.  Despite its cultural stance, the new plaza became a haven for underage prostitutes, gangs, and drug users.<br />Plazas also contain social and spatial boundaries as factors that symbolize differences such as nationalities, race, class, and gender between plaza populations within a capitalist system.  Low again contrasted the two plazas in San Jose in the framework of social boundaries:<br />Parque Central:  mostly older men, closed space, clique-oriented, has professional prostitutes, lottery ticket, newspaper, food vendors, less foreigners, older.<br />Plaza de la Cultura:  mostly women and children, open space, not clique-oriented, prostitutes who give services for clothes, nurturing relationships,  balloon, popcorn, tourist item vendors, more foreigners, younger.<br />Another more important function of the plaza is for public protest.  Low categorizes them in terms of the kinds of protest and their outcomes.  Manifest protests such as strikes and demonstrations usually result in the temporary closure of the public space, followed by a reopening where the space is policed to discourage undesirables.  An example of that involved the chasing out of shoeshine men from Parque Central.  Latent protests involve conflicts that become apparent in terms of design and surrounding buildings and can result in discussions in various media or a plebiscite.  Ritual protests, such as parades, normally involve the temporary takeover of space by a protesting group before it is relinquished to the forces nominally in charge of that space.<br />Taken in the context of protest, Low sees public space as symbolizing political objectives by those, particularly national leaders, who created them--e.g. the Plaza de la Democracia is a legacy to Oscar Arias Sanchez's Nobel Peace Prize-winning efforts for Central American peace.  Plazas that don't fulfill the objectives of their creators or are not deemed valuable are either redesigned or denied access to the public.<br />Constituting twenty-five years of research spanning from 1972 to 1997, Setha Low's exhaustively researched book depicts the essence of the function of the plaza.ize differences such as nationalities, race, class, and gender between plaza populations within a capitalist system.

What he learns is that despite his father's survival at the camps, the experience has seared him, leaving him spiritually and emotionally burnt whole.<br />The graphic novel format using animalization allows Spiegelman to delineate the ethnic differences perceived by the racialism in the Nazi world view.  The depiction of the Jews as mice can be taken in the context of many things.  One, cats chase and eat mice.  Two, Joseph Goebbels depicted the Jews as scuttling rats in one of his propaganda films.  Three, mice are on the lower end of the food web, beset by many predators.  Mice are mainly herbivorous, with no allies.  The Jews had no allies to stand up for them in the anti-Jewish measures that took place in the Third Reich.<br />Germans are portrayed as cats.  Apart from the generalization that cats eat mice, cats are also known for their cruelty, playing with whatever prey that have caught, before eating it, many times when that prey is half alive.  Pogroms and killing methods used by the Germans were nothing but cruel.  And Americans are dogs, who chase and kill cats, and Spiegelman's depicts them that way as they were on the Allied side.<br />The conflict between Artie and Vladek plays another vital role in Maus.  Artie, by being raised in New York, was imbued with the American virtues of individualism and seeking one's own destiny, a far cry from his parents' values of maintaining close ties to the family, such as following their expectations of him in vocation and marital life.  While he was aware of his parents' sordid experiences, he could not adequately relate to what they had gone through.  After what they have gone through, Anja and Vladek demand gratitude from Artie.<br />For Vladek, the key is struggling for life till the last moment, a survival strategy he adopts when they hear news of the death of Richieu.  Anja breaks down in the streets says she wants to die.  To which Vladek replies, \\"No, darling!  To die, it's easy.  But you have to struggle for life!  Until the last moment we must struggle together!\\"<br />\\"Never again\\" is the oft-heard phrase regarding the Holocaust.  Never again would the world allow such a systematic, inhumane wave of genocide.  Yet Vladek continued to live as if the Holocaust could happen again.  He continued his survival habits to the exasperation of his wife Mala.  Artie remarks how his father collects junk, like a pack rat--pun sort of intended.  Mala angrily points out, \\"he's more attached to things than to people!\\"  He finds attachment to things rather than people, as those things helped him survive the camps.  But the greater picture reveals how Vladek has lost his faith in humanity.  After all, how could the world silently watch six million people \\"burnt whole?\\"<br />Vladek may not be a likable character, but the point is he survived, at the point of having a bunker mentality.  Mala angrily says of him that \\"it causes him physical pain to part with even a nickel,\\" which causes a conflict within Artie, who does not want to paint his father as \\"racist cariacature the miserly old Jew\\" but wants to portray his father accurately.\\"<br />Which Art Spiegelman does, using the unique dynamics of a graphic novel and animalization to create an honest and heart-wrenching story.parents' sordid experiences, he could not adequately relate to what they had gone through.

His father Vladek and mother Anja are captured and sent to Auschwitz.  However, things aren't well at home.  Mala, Vladek's second wife, exasparated at Vladek's tight-fisted controlling ways, leaves him.  Artie and his wife Francoise rush over to help him out and during this time, Artie continues the interviews with his father and thence into Maus II.<br />The path of Artie understanding his father is smoother but at a cost.  Following the success of Maus I, Spiegelman depicts a pile of dead Jewish bodies lying under the Artie's writing desk symbolizing how much the history his father has bled from that first volume has seeped into him.  He is beginning to understand, but at the cost of emotionally and vicariously going through his father's experiences, for which he has sessions with Pavel, a Czech Jew psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor.<br />Artie gets more perspective during these sessions with Pavel.  He tells Pavel that as a child, he constantly argued with his father, who said that anything he did was nothing compared to surviving Auschwitz.  Pavel refers to the psychological concept of transference:  \\"Maybe your father needed to show that he was always right--that he could always SURVIVE-because he felt GUILTY about surviving. ... and he took his guilt on YOU, where it was safe... on the REAL survivor.\\"  The argument stands to reason.  Vladek survived the death of so much family and friends, as well as the millions he never knew.<br />We learn more of how Vladek survived Auschwitz.  He teaches English to the Polish kapo, who expecting the Germans to lose the war, wants to get in good graces with the Americans.  Vladek is thus given better food, a better fitting uniform, and the tip to stand at the far left of the line of prisoners during the labour call.  Improved health increased chances of survival and a better mental state.<br />Vladek has enough chutzpah in his tight-fisted but survivalist ways to exchange used groceries for new ones(!)  While in the car waiting for him, Artie and Francoise discuss Vladek.  Francoise says:  \\"I'd rather kill myself than live through  ... everything Vladek went through.  It's a miracle he survived.\\"  Artie responds with \\"In some ways he didn't survive,\\" which is key to the book's theme.  Yet drastic saving is one way Vladek survived the war and camps.  On the way back from the grocery store, we discover Vladek's racism towards blacks, an example of the victim becoming a victimizer.<br />Maus is a must-read for a personal instead of abstract, statistical look at the Holocaust.  It also brings up post-war genocide.  Pavel's contention that people haven't changed rings poignantly.  Despite the vow of \\"never again,\\" genocide has repeatedly happened \\"yet again\\":  e.g. the Cultural Revolution, the killing fields in Cambodia, the massacre in Rwanda, and the ethnic bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia.  Perhaps for racial harmony to become a human instinct, all people need to feel the same way, but the relativistic world of the twentieth and twenty-first century to makes that dream virtually impossible.  Pavel's statement that a newer and bigger Holocaust is needed to change people grimly prophesizes World War III, meaning that unless we change, we will all die.s tight-fisted but survivalist ways to exchange used groceries for new ones(!)

He further divides the Sixties into the low Sixties (1958-1963), where things began in a relatively non-violent fashion, the High Sixties (1964-1968/9), where things culminated to a crescendo of violence to 1968, and the final phase (1969-1974).  He looks at four countries where this cultural revolution took place:  Great Britain, France, Italy, and the United States.<br />The economic boom of the 1950's continued in the 1960's.  Most families had radios, televisions, automobiles, and refrigerators.  Teenagers became an economic class in themselves in that they became a target market.  Most of them began buying their own clothing, toiletries, and luxury items, or influenced their parents into buying said items.  Their tastes in music were a radical departure from their parents--e.g. Fats Domino, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley.  Britain too experienced the \\"teenage  ball\\" as coined in Colin MacInnes Absolute Beginners.<br />It was from this generation that the Students for a Democratic Society emerged, led by Al Haber and Tom Hayden, the latter who composed the Port Huron Statement which was the rehearsal of the major concerns to be taken up by the New Left and the Movement in the High Sixties.<br />I was particularly struck by the issue that only marginally succeeded in the United States (The Great Society) but was a progressive enlightened vision in Britain, \\"the civilized society,\\" as coined by Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, and the welfare state.  The central concern was national insurance, where every person made a flat-rate contribution and could get that same rate when they became unemployed, later amended to where higher-salaried employees would contribute an added rate in exchange for an added rate in their pensions.<br />The five bases for the civilized society were the abolition of capital punishment (1969), the Abortion Reform Law (1967), the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act (1967) allowing local authorities to freely dispense contraceptive devices and advice, the Sexual Offenses Act (1967), which decriminalised homosexual acts between consenting adults, and the Divorce Reform Act (1969).<br />The 1960's was a time of permissiveness in books and the arts.  Consider the seizure of the unexpurgated version of Lady Chatterley's Lover by the post-master general.  A district court judge ruled that the book could be sent through the mail because interpretations of censorship must change according to the attitudes of the day.  The same argument was used in film censorship and in 1968, during the High Sixties, Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture Association of America instituted the four-tier code that replaced the outdated Hays Code, the same way Jack Trevelyan adjusted the film code in Britain.<br />Marwick gives credit to my favourite group, the Beatles.  After all, they became icons of youth culture, although they didn't fare well in conservative France and Italy.  They were the synthesis of the skiffle craze and Mersey Beat sound that began in the Low Sixties, heroes of working class backgrounds.<br />Marwick identifies 1968 in America and 1969 in France as marking the end of the High Sixties.  In France, it was the end of Charles de Gaulle's regime.  In America, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, and the SDS-led student siege of Columbia University were flashpoints.  In France, there were anti-U.S. student demonstrations in the Sorbonne in the wake of the Tet Offensive, leading to full-blown riots that took place for weeks in May 1968.<br />Marwick points to the end of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and the resignation of Richard Nixon on 9 August 1974 as a victory finally achieved by the anti-war protesters.  However, the economic prosperity of the 1960's collapsed in 1974 with the effects of the Arab oil embargo.<br />A somewhat lengthy book that focuses more on cultural and socioecnomics rather than political, but an eye-opening read nevertheless.60's collapsed in 1974 with the effects of the Arab oil embargo.<br />A somewhat lengthy book that focuses more on cultural and socioecnomics rather than political, but an eye-opening read nevertheless.	2003-03-16

While awaiting his sentence, he is forced to reexamine his past.  The conflict within Rubashov can be construed as a struggle between several sets of dualities:  Communism versus Christianity, \\"we\\" versus \\"I,\\" the Party versus the individual, emotionless logic versus emotional conscience, a.k.a. \\"the grammatical fiction\\", lies versus the truth, old Bolsheviks versus new Bolsheviks, and regarding History, the Party, and Stalin, the most important duality of all:  right versus wrong.  Whatever the outcome, as Rubashov says throughout the book, \\"I shall pay.\\"<br />Rubashov is expected to do the right thing, to logically arrive at the conclusion that he was wrong and that Stalin and the Party were right, but while in his cell, contemplates his past in daydreams, silent soliloquys, monologues, in the process analyzing monologues as \\"dialogues of a special kind;  dialogues in which one partner remains silent while the other, against all grammatical rules, addresses him as 'I' instead of 'you.'  He revisits his past and remembers the people he betrayed, such a Richard, the German communist, Little Loewy, the Belgian communist who takes issue with Stalin supporting Hitler with mineral shipments prior to the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, and Arlova, the librarian and Rubashov's former secretary whom he denounces just to save his own skin.<br />Also, consider this:  \\"History has taught us that often lies serve her better than the truth;  for man is sluggish and has to be led through the desert for forty years before each step in his development.\\"  Key to the argument of truth and lies is Stalin's absolute control of Party policy.  As Rubashov wonders during one of his bouts of doubt:  \\"And what if, after all, No. 1 were in the right?  If here, in dirt and blood and lies, after all and in spite of everything, the grandiose foundation of the future were being laid?  Had not history always been an ..., unscrupulous builder, mixing its mortar of lies, blood and mud?\\" Truth is a commodity held ... by Stalin, i.e. what mattered was what Stalin believed was the truth and woe be to he who challenges him.<br />This is akin to Orwell's 1984, where Winston Smith is forced to repeat the Party slogan:  \\"Whoever controls the past controls the future.  Whoever controls the present controls the past\\" O'Brien replies that \\"whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.\\"  And the Party has power with control of the truth.  Power is thus an end, not a mean.<br />Koestler displays religious overtones in connection with Rubashov's attack with conscience, ironic considering Marx's view on religion as the opiate of the masses.  Rubashov compares the Russian people under Lenin with the Israelites under Moses, who \\"for forty years... had been driven through the desert, with threats and promises, with imaginary terrors and imaginary rewards.  But where was the Promised Land?\\"<br />A painstaking introspective look at a man struggling with conscience, but also looks at the dark aspects of the Stalin purges and the ruthless machinery of the Party.ies, after all and in spite of everything, the grandiose foundation of the future were being laid?

The photos are from key points in the movie, such as the Gryffindor vs. Slytherin Quidditch match, with Harry and Draco facing each other like a Rocky poster.  With the exception of June, Harry is in each month.  June is Fawkes's honorary month.  Key text is included, describing the photo or theme.<br />There is an object in the foreground, off to the side of each month in keeping with the theme of the picture, be it Hedwig, the Polyjuice Potion, the Sorting Hat, or Ron's cellotaped wand.<br />By the way, as a bonus treat, inbetween the picture of Fawkes and the June months, there is a special page with eighteen stickers.  What stickers?  Well, framed portraits of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, the Hogwarts badge, Fawkes's head, Hedwig, the Golden Snitch, three coins (a Galleon, Knut, and Sickle), the respective symbols of each house (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff, along with their respective animals), the brown case containing the quaffle and bludgers, a glass of polyjuice potion, something that looks like a starfish inside a jar, presumably Ron and Harry's luggage, sundry chemicals, and the logo for the movie.<br />For what this year is turning out to be, Harry and company is one surefire antidote for not evoking a much-needed do-over clause for bad years.	2003-03-14

His struggle was a reflection of the Second Reich's attempt at world domination through nationalism and Social Darwinism.<br />His use of patriotism to the emperor was used when he manipulates someone into stating that the Hohenzollerns were Jews, accusing him of lese-majeste.  At that man's trial, Diedrich is accurately portrayed as &quot;an average man, with a commonplace mind,... without courage so long as things are going badly for him and tremendously self-important as soon as they had turned in his favour&quot;<br />Diedrich doesn't hesitate to make alliances when expedient and to boost his star higher, such as his association with his nemesis, Napoleon Fischer, a Social Democrat machinist at his factory.  On one occasion, to cover up his own mistake in miscalculating the dimensions of the New Patent Cylinder Machine, he bribed Fischer to sabotage the machine so that he had a case to return it.  Later, the two agreed to help each other in their political ambitions.<br />Thus Diedrich used his patriotism and anti-Social Democratic stance as ways to boost himself onward and upward, yet willing to make alliances with his alleged enemies, similar to the way Bismarck used nationalism as a tool to rally the Liberals against his wars against Austria and the south German states against France, all for his own personal power.<br />The importance of Wilhelm II's attempted surpassing of Bismarck must be reiterated.  Diedrich's colleague warns people of the danger of any man emulating Bismarck:  &quot;Weak and pacifistic by nature, he becomes noisy and dangerous.  Without a doubt the victories of his vanity will serve commercial ends.  First his travesty of opinion brings a man to prison for lese-majeste.  Afterwards he reaps his profit&quot;  So by virtue of the chain rule, Diedrich was in fact emulating Bismarck, making him not only a mini-Kaiser, but also a mini-Iron Chancellor.  And this illustrates Mann's criticism of Bismarck's self-motivating political profit, perpetuated in the person of Diedrich.<br />Mann's novel is a portrait of pre-war Wilhelmine Germany (1888-1914).  He thus saw as reasons for Germany's defeat in World War I the blind nationalism of the people and their obedience to the autocratic rule of the Kaiser.  It's a warning to be heeded by any nation making rumblings toward war.e victories of his vanity will serve commercial ends.  First his travesty of opinion brings a man to prison for lese-majeste.

There are even some old heraldry flags from medieval times included.<br />Some countries have flags of their states included, such as Australia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Russia's autonomous republics (Dagestan, Chechnya), and oh yes, the U.S.  From looking at our states, it's disheartening to see how many states still have the Confederate flag or red saltire on them  (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi).<br />The best thing about this book is how the colours and symbol of each country/province/state/canton's flag is explained.  For example, Ireland has a tricolore of green, white, and orange vertical stripes.  The green represents the Catholics, the orange the Protestants (as in William of Orange), and the white is for peace between both groups.  Let's look at another tricolore, Guinea's red-yellow-green.  The red is the blood/sacrifice of the people, the yellow is the gold of Guinea and the sun, and the green represents vegetation and agriculture.  Isn't this useful?<br />And most flag proportions are 2:3, but others are 1:2 (Latvia, Libya, Nigeria).  And some are irregular.  Belgium's flag is 13:15, Switzerland and its cantons are 1:1, Mexico is 4:7, and our own, 10:19.<br />What about flag families?  Then there are colours associated with certain movements.  For example, green, yellow, and red are the Pan-African colours.  Black, green, red, and white are the Pan-Arab colours.  They represent the colour of the dynasties of the Islamic Empire (black for Abbasids, green for Fatimids, white for Umayyads, and red for Hashemites).  Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Syria have flags with those colours.  And with the breakup of Yugoslavia, all but Bosnia and Macedonia have the blue, white, and red Pan-Slav colours.<br />The French tricolore has influenced many other countries' flags with its three vertical stripes.  Romania, Italy, Belgium, Guinea, and Cote D'Ivoire.  And it's no coincidence that all the Scandinavian countries have identical flags--they're based on the Scandinavian cross.<br />Symbols are also explained.  The Muslim crescent and star, a main symbol of Islam and mentioned in the 53rd surah of the Quran, is adopted by Turkey, Algeria, and Pakistan, for example.  And writing.  The writing on the Iraqi flag reads \\"God Is Great,\\" which ironically is what is written 22 times in Sufic script along the Iranian flag.  ...<br />Parts of flags:  this is an interesting one.  Much of this is technical terms.  The hoist is the first (left) vertical half, the fly is the right vertical half.  Then there are charges (figures) For example, that upper rectangle of our flag is a canton.  A saltire, i.e. the cross part in the British flag, is what is used to divide the flag into four parts.  And the trapezium, a sideways trapezoid on the left part of a flag, is what Kuwait has.<br />There are also flags of international organizations, such as the UN, Red Cross, or League of Arab States.  Regional flags, flags of revoltution (Sandinistas, Viet Cong, FRELIMO) flags of ethnic people without nation-states (Kurds, Shans, Sorbs), and political flags are also included.  Example:  white is a monarchist flag, black is for anarchists, red is for socialists.  And the Nazi flag spawned so many imitations, such as the Arrow Cross, Afrikaner Resistant Movement, and Fronte della Gioventu--all are red with a white circle and black symbol.<br />This was updated in 2002, before East Timor gained independence, so much of this is up-to-date.

However, his work touches on themes (fantasy, mechanization, vampires) that remind one of Sorayama and Giger as well as de Berardinis.  The first few pages dwell on the mecha theme (Geiger and Sorayama), though the mecha stuff isn't as glossy as that of Sorayama.  That's because Cleavenger's preferred medium is acrylic paint.<br />Models include Alley bagget, Melissa Wolfe, Glorianne Gilbert, Kate Moss (yes, that Kate Moss) and one of Olivia's favourites, Julie Strain, who is the winged cover girl astride a giant robot in a piece titled \\"The Bonecrusher.\\"<br />Some of the artwork might be of appeal to black metal fans, especially fans of groups with dark artwork like Cradle Of Filth and Dimmu Borgir.

Snyder's Encyclopedia of the Third Reich.  Major entries are very detailed.  Most of them are two to three pages, such as Goebbels, Goering, Hess and the Hess flight together, the July Plot, and the Katyn Massacre.  Hitler himself takes up ten full pages, if that's any indication of the detail of the entries.  Considering how the book is 388 pages minus bibliography and the number of entries, that isn't too bad.<br />Apart from Hitler and friends, there are also events and people of the Weimar Republic, such as Paul von Hindenburg, who named Hitler chancellor, as well as Hitler's predecessors, such as Heinrich Bruning, Franz von Papen, and Kurt von Schleicher.  After all, Weimar's downfall caused Hitler's rise.<br />There are also organizational charts throughout, such as the Hierarchy of the NSDAP and the ranks in the Third Reich.  This latter entry lists the army ranks of the German Army, and the equivalent ranking in the SS, NSDAP, German Police, and United States Army.  For example, a general in the German Army has a rank equal to an SS-Obergruppenfuehrer, a NSDAP Gauleiter, the General der Polizei in the German Police, and a General in the US Army.  Tables are also included, such as the list of Gaus (districts) under the third reich and the Gauleiter in charge.<br />Key conferences and attendees include the Rastenburg Conference, where Hitler and his military advisors were on 20 July 1944, which is the day of the bomb plot, and the Wannsee Conference, where Reinhard Heydrich chaired a meeting detailing the Endlosung or Final Solution.<br />Many entries are concepts in the original German.  So for the entry Night and Fog Decree, it will say See Nacht- Und Nebel Erlass, where the data will be.<br />Acronyms usual have See the full name.  E.g. NSAG.  See Nationalsozialistische Arbeitgemeinschaft.  Looking up that entry, one will find it's English for National Socialist Working Association.  Damn, those Nazis really liked long words, didn't they?<br />Trial results include that of the Frankfurt Trial, for the chief SS officers at Auschwitz, the Doctor's Trial, for those doctors who experimented on prisoners of war, and of course, the Nuremberg Trials.  Each has the defendant, DOB or age, position, verdict and punishment.<br />As for actual documents, there are Hitler's Last Will and Political Testament.  There are also general essays on art, architecture, film and theatre (especially Triumph Of The Will, which has an entry all its own), music, and education.  Other things of interest:  the lyrics and translation of the Horst Wessel anthem and \\"Lili Marlene.\\"<br />At the beginning, there is a chronology of key dates in history, with the exact day.

Some creature is petrifying certain Hogwarts students as well as a certain unpopular animal.  People who've seen the movie probably already know.  Underlying that is a threat that the heir of Slytherin will strike at all the Muggle-borns, or to use the derogatory term Draco calls Hermione, a mudblood.  In two of the attacks, Harry walks in on the scene and is suspected.  Fortunately, the Weasleys and Hermione back him up, as do Hagrid, McGonagall, and Dumbledore.  Could this be the danger that Dobby the house-elf warned him about early in the book?<br />Author J. K. Rowling ratchets up certain conflicts.  The Dursleys cruelty goes up when they bar Harry up in his room.  Draco Malfoy, the rich kid bully, is more verbally vicious to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  The Quidditch match and the duelling scene underscore Harry vs. Draco.  The same goes for Professor Snape, who becomes more hateful of Harry than in the first book.  But nicer characters continue to be a relief, such as Dumbledore and Hagrid.  As this is a more serious crisis, their roles as kindly guardians become more pronounced than ever, especially for Harry.  And the Weasley twins, Fred and George, are more mischievous than ever.  Whoever invites them to a party had better have a good sense of humour.  And Hermione is still the know-it-all and her expertise comes in handy for her two friends, but she's still a girl, as evidenced by her crush on the handsome Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher.<br />Another key to a successful book series is expanding on concepts or people from a previous story.  For example, in Book One, Hagrid tells Harry that he got into trouble at Hogwarts and got expelled.  Here, we found out why he got expelled.  The three-cornered friendship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione is also cemented here, as is Harry's affinity to the Weasley brothers.  Face it, the Weasley family might as well be Harry's true adopted family compared to the Dursleys.<br />Of the new characters, Lucius Malfoy stands out as a menacing character to be reckoned with, and we see where Draco got his nastiness from.  Gilderoy Lockhart is a narcissistic, self-promoting, shallow, incompetent charmer.  In fact the required texts for his class are all based on his exploits.<br />The concept of pure-bloods and Mudbloods (wizards with Muggle parents) has definite overtones of the Nazis determination of race and their effort to keep the Germanic race pure.  But, as Hagrid points out, \\"...they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can' do.\\"<br />Oh, Mary GrandPre$B!G(Bs chapter heading illustrations are still vivid.

Eric and D'Eva Redding's Great Big Beautiful Doll exposes the dark side of the playmate, from her humble beginnings as Vickie Lynn Hogan of Mexia, Texas to Vickie Lynn Smith, to Anna Nicole Smith, the latter name she got from Guess? Jeans president Paul Marciano.  From there, Redding details someone who vulgarly flaunted sex, who was under a cloud of booze and drugs, and who wasn't above having sex with other women in front of the authors and even her own son.<br />Yet there is an incident in which both sides of the story are told.  It involves Maria Ceratto, a former Honduran housekeeper who claims Anna Nicole forced her to have sex with her and basically held her captive by changing the phone number and not telling her.  Anna Nicole on the other hand claims it was Maria who was doing the harassing.<br />There's even an entire chapter dedicated to Jay Leno's punches on her in his monologue, mainly concerning her marriage to Marshall.  Two of the funniest:  \\"I don't want to say he's old, but yesterday she told him to act his age--and he died.\\"  \\"She said they're two peas in a pod. ... It's more like two cantaloupes and a prune.\\"  Ouch and double ouch!<br />There are photos in the book, pictures as a child, nude ones, and a not-so-flattering police mug shot for a DWI.<br />So is this book credible?  Well, let's see, Redding took the Polaroids that led to Anna Nicole's jump to fame.  Both he and his wife were around her during that time, plus Anna-Nicole hasn't sued the Reddings.  And Reddings portray themselves as being simultaneously disillusioned and feeling sorry at what she's become.  To quote from the intro:  \\"It would be easy to make fun of Anna, but we can't.  Maybe it's a case of 'we knew her when,' but we did--and we liked her then.\\"  Yet at the same time, the bio comes off as being sensationalistic and somewhat exploitative.<br />For Anna-Nicole Smith sycophants, this book truly trashes their idol, so don't bother.  If you totally loathe Anna Nicole, this book is ammunition for you.  If you're ambivalent about her, well, maybe it's worth a read.is book is ammunition for you.

With the first movie having been through my player at least every other month since I bought it, I wondered how the book was, and it was an engaging read. It is an enchanting part-fantasy, part-mystery, part-adventure, with lots of light relief. The ideas J.K. Rowling came up with blew me away--Platform 9 3/4, staircases that move, Bertie Bott's Many-Flavoured Beans, where did she come up with this?  There's nothing wrong with Rowling's writing at all. In fact, she's quite a magician herself in order to create the Hogwarts world. Which House does she belong to, I wonder?<br />The story of Voldemort and wizards going to the dark side is reminiscent of the Dark Jedi in Star Wars. Unicorns and Fluffy, a variation on Cerberus, and the invisible cape are taken from fairytales and mythology. And many of the spells are Latin-derived. Rowling's use of comparatives and colours is also ingenious. Here's how Uncle Vernon reacts when he sees the first letter Harry gets from Hogwarts: \\"His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.\\"<br />There are some aspects of the real world in Hogwarts as well, such as nasty teachers and nasty students. However, things have a way of working out. For example, yes, Harry, Hermione, and Neville get detention for going on the grounds in the evening, but they get to help Hagrid for detention so that's not too bad.<br />What also makes Harry appealing is that he's thin, bespectacled, but intelligent and gifted. Not only that but after eleven years of living miserably under his uncle's roof, he is amazed to find that everybody in the wizard world knows who he is because he is \\"the boy who lived\\" through Voldemort's reign of terror. This gives hope to many downtrodden youngsters who read the book, because Harry can be someone to relate to. If Harry were a muscular blonde-haired jock who got the pretty girls and drove the fast brooms, he wouldn't be appealing at all. Somehow I don't think the average kid could relate to someone like that.<br />Hermione's character gives a shot in the arm to the virtues of dedicated reading and studying, something impossible in this world with all these video game systems. True, she does sit on the side of the caution and finds security in obeying the laws but when the chips are down, she's ready to stick by Harry no matter what.<br />Draco Malfoy, who becomes Harry's main antagonist, proves that yes, there are jerks in any setting--it's how to handle them that counts. If best, don't get into fights, but sometimes, it's necessary to fight them.<br />The kindly and reliable headmaster Dumbledore and the whale-sized gameskeeper Hagrid are two other favourable characters who look out after Harry and friends and check to see if they're doing all right. And despite being a stern disciplinarian, Professor MacGonagall is fair and can be generous.<br />Mary Grandpre's illustrations above each chapter heading add extra spice. Check out the ones for Fluffy and Norbert. She does the cover illustration too, BTW.<br />There's one additional comment here. This book is rightly categorized as fantasy. There's something in here besides wizards, witches, spells, magic, Quidditch, and pictures that move that make this book a fantasy. That something is people who are generous, stick with you in times of trouble, and take a stand on the side of right, sometimes when unconventionality is called for.

Sophie is well-placed to tell her experiences in Doctor Who, as she was the series' last companion.  She came in the wake of a tough transition in Doctor Who's history--following the dismissal of Colin Baker and the installing of Sylvester McCoy, Sophie was chosen to succeed Bonnie Langford as the new companion.<br />Mike Tucker, her collaborator of this work, was the visual effects designer during Doctor Who's dying days.  He too provides his point of view and remembrances with equal aplomb.<br />In each of her nine stories (Dragonfire, Remembrance Of The Daleks, The Happiness Patrol, Silver Nemesis, The Greatest Show In The Galaxy, Battlefield, Ghost Light, The Curse Of Fenric, and Survival) she provides vivid commentary and detail from her diary of her experiences.  There's lots of behind the scenes photographs in B&W and colour, early design sketches, listings of the cast and production team, director, story number, number of episodes and date broadcast--it's pretty comprehensive.<br />And yes, the famous incident of her while shooting Battlefield is included.  Basically, she was in a water-filled tank and was to be pulled up.  Sylvester McCoy noticed the glass bulging and then... CRACK!  Sylvester shouted for the crew to lift her out, which they did, before anything happened to her.  She also tells about this in the More Than 30 Years In The TARDIS video.<br />Considering how she was one of the few ex-alumni of Who to come out in the More Than... video, it shows how much she loved the show.  She was very heartbroken when Sylvester McCoy told her that there wasn't going to be a 27th season, and that too is included in the book.<br />At the end of the book are photos and text of some of her post-Who efforts, including More Than A Messiah, an episode of the Stranger, the short-lived Colin Baker series, and Shakedown, a Who-spin off that not only featured the return of the troll-like Sontarans but paired her with Carole Ann Ford, Dr. Who's first ever companion.  Then there's an interview where she tells what her favourite story was, plus her favourite Doctor.  I have to commend her on her answer--she has good taste.<br />This is a splendid companion-piece after watching any of the 7th-Doctor/Ace stories.  If you can find this book--get it.

Ingrained in that was the mission to defeat that enemy.  The trouble was, the enemy was human, be they the Native Americans the colonists and later the American government displaced.  We also had this mindset that we were always on the right and they were always wrong, therefore, they had to be defeated.<br />One element was to exaggerate the atrocities committed, meaning that yeah, some of it happened, but not in the large scale depicted by the white leaders to drive home the point that we had to kill these unholy, ungodly, &lt;insert enemy race here>.  Colonist Mary Rowlandson's accounts on her captivity and the massacre she survived was the archetypal demonizing of the \\"enemy.\\"<br />Victory culture nestled itself cozily in new visual media--the movies and television.  Basically, the enemy performed some horrible atrocity on innocent whites, and it was up to the heroes to punish the enemy.  The enemy would be defeated, more often than not killed, and everybody would live happily ever after.  Straight and simple.  It was in straight black-and-white (the issues as well as the early programs before colour TV and film came into being).<br />Engelhardt argues that between 1945 and 1975, the ends of WW2 and Vietnam respectively, that victory culture ended<br />Pearl Harbor gave plenty of opportunity to dehumanize the Japanese as an enemy, along with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.<br />The Cold War was where it all went into overdrive.  The Communists were now the enemy, and that paranoid ideological struggle into the unknown carried through not only into Korea and Vietnam, but into movies, TV shows (Twilight Zone), comic books (Tales From The Crypt, MAD), and even toys (GI Joe).<br />A new dynamic also came, of the enemy hiding behind some citadel or bunker, such as the Forbidden City or Kremlin, with only large posters of the leader representing the human face of the enemy.  Thus the enemy couldn't be destroyed.<br />Vietnam demonstrated once and for all that we were fallible, and for a while, we were in a funk.  And with My Lai, WE became the massacring enemy, the Vietnamese the colonists.  The concept of victory culture was turned on its head with that event.  And think about it:  we lost Vietnam for the same reasons the British lost the American War for Independence.  History has come full circle to America.<br />This book came out in 1995, and early on in the book, Engelhardt makes a well-worn but important point:  \\"with the end of the Cold War and the loss of the enemy, American culture has entered a period of crisis that raises profound questions about national purpose and identity.\\"  Ponder that passage, and what's going on today in the world.<br />The main thing to ask today is, do we really need to have an enemy and a war to unite the people together?  Peace and harmony can do the same thing.  We do not need victory-for-one-side culture anymore.  What we need is victory-for-all culture.nly large posters of the leader representing the human face of the enemy.

True, she didn't make any A-movies, but like Marilyn, embodied that woman who drew a fine line between good girl/bad girl and crossed the lines as easily as one drank Coca-Cola.  Unlike Marilyn, Bettie survived, but like Marilyn, her legend lives on for one simple reason:  she dropped out of sight in 1957 following the fall of Irvin and Paula Klaw by the Kefauver Committee on indecency and pornography and refused to have herself be photographed as she is now.  Thus, she is remembered as she was back then.  And as her life has become simpler, she values her privacy.  She says so as much in the hand-written foreword, at the same time surprised and honoured that so many people are interested in her.Karen Essex and James L. Swanson book is a great place to start for those curious about Bettie Page.  Basically, it's a biography accompanied by lots and lots of colour and b&w photos, many of them topless.  There are two of them which has her completely nude.  She also posed for countless magazine covers and photographers.  Art Amsie's photos are the best of the lot here.  Bunny Yeager is touched on briefly, but that woman has a book on herself so...  Looking at the early Bettie, before she became a pin-up from 1947, is also quite a revelation.  She is still beautiful, but in an ordinary way, like a typical girl growing up in 1940's America.There is clearly a dualism going on here.  There's the pretty wholesome girl in the bathing suit or maybe not, and then there's the darker leatherbound fetish girl, be she receiver or giver.  That latter half led to her downfall.  The point also was that she enjoyed her work, mainly the lighter beach stuff.  You can see it in those twinkling eyes and smile of hers.The last section of the book features models who have been influenced by her, be they in clothes or just looking like her.  Of the lookalikes, Eva Herzigova, Debi Mazar, and Janice Dickinson have got it down to the bangs, (it's the bangs that did it for Bettie, after all), long black hair, and prominent eyebrows.Apart from being one of fantasy artist Olivia's favourite subjects, Bettie's images appear on album covers by My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult and the David Lee Roth Band.  Her three videos, Teaserama, where she acts opposite stripper legend Tempest Storm, Varietease, and Strip-O-Rama have come out.  She'll live on, no doubt about it.Anyone interested in Bettie Page-start with this book.

Well, how about born in a bad year?  That's the circumstances underlying your humble reviewer, but it didn't take Jules Witcover's 1968-The Year The Dream Died, to make me figure that my year was a rotten vintage.<br />Witcover points to the Kennedy assassination in 1963 as the point where things began to sour.  As Daniel Patrick Moynihan, future Senator of New York, then assistant secretary of Labour said in the wake of JFK's death, \\"We'll laugh again.  It's just that we'll never be young again.\\"<br />That whole disaster of a year that was the third straight year of U.S. involvement in Vietnam was also a presidential election year, during which Democratic disunity and third party candidate George Wallace gave Richard Nixon a new address--1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  It also didn't help matters for Hubert Humphrey that his hands were tied in his election bid.  He couldn't actively criticize LBJ, who was concentrating on conducting the war.<br />But the two events that spelled the death of optimism were the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.  The latter's death is covered in a chapter aptly titled \\"Murder of Hope.\\"  It figured.  The nation still hadn't completely healed after the JFK assassination and the murder of these two figures served to scar the nation even more.<br />Nixon, Agnew, Johnson, Sirhan Sirhan, and Lt. William Calley were some of the dark forces at work that year, but the most ridiculous by far was General Curtis LeMay, that lunatic who seriously thought of using nukes in Vietnam and embarassed George Wallace, who tapped him to be his running mate without foresight.<br />My Lai demonstrated how brutally insane the situation in Vietnam had become.  How could American soldiers actually contemplate massacring 567 unarmed civilians, when in World War II, they were considered heroes?<br />Other events covered:  the riots in Chicago, the Pueblo incident in North Korea, the Prague Spring, the presidential campaign, and the student protests that inflamed universities.<br />Each chapter represents a month of that dreadful year, and at the beginning of each chapter is a brief timeline of what else occurred, be they deaths of famous people, e.g. Helen Keller, or opening days of key films e.g. Yellow Submarine.<br />However, at the end, Witcover argues alternative scenarios.  Had RFK lived, he would have taken the Democratic nomination AND the White House, ended Vietnam, and worked with MLK to heal the racial divide in the country.  Or if Eugene McCarthy had decided to endorse Hubert Humphrey earlier in the race, Humphrey would have defeated Nixon.  All of this and more is soberingly reviewed in a thorough coverage of that fateful year.a, the Prague Spring, the presidential campaign, and the student protests that inflamed universities.<br />Each chapter represents a month of that dreadful year, and at the beginning of each chapter is a brief timeline of what else occurred, be they deaths of famous people, e.g. Helen Keller, or opening days of key films e.g. Yellow Submarine.<br />However, at the end, Witcover argues alternative scenarios.

One example is the Lockerbie bombing of 1988, which was in retaliation for Reagan's bombing of Libya in 1986.  (Note:  this book was published in 2000, so his passage that \\"the innocent of the twenty-first century are going to harvest unexpected blowback disasters from the imperialist escapades of recent decades\\" is tragically ironic and foreshadowing.  But blowback has been experienced by other empires, so America's not the only one.  Look at the Soviet Union, Britain, and Rome.<br />Johnson explains America's imperialist influence in Japan, in particular, the notorious rape case in Okinawa in 1995.  That was the most publicized case.  In fact assault and harassment of Okinawans is commonplace.  There's a clause in the U.S. forces occupation treaty that gives the U.S. military accused of crimes the right not to hand over guilty soldiers to the local authorities.  It's kind of like the diplomatic immunity ambassadors in foreign countries get.  (Remember Lethal Weapon 2?)<br />Individual countries are covered in detail:  Japan, both Koreas, and China, in particular.  The words \\"American Empire\\" in the title are no mistake.  True, it's not outright political annexation as was done in the Roman, Spanish, or British Empires, but an economic hegemony.  Where the Soviet created an Eastern bloc with countries such as East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, so did the U.S.  No, not in Western Europe, but in East Asia, comprising of Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan, and before their fall to Communist regimes, the former French Indochina countries.  In fact, what's the first thing a newly-elected Japanese prime minister does?  He flies straight to Washington D.C. to report in to his new masters.<br />Another factor of American foreign policy is its support, defense and economic, of repressive anti-Communist regimes, such as South Korea and Indonesia.  America hardly batted an eye when in 1980, a student demonstration protesting martial law was violently put down in what became known as the Kwangju uprising.  The same is true for the Kopassus commando squads in Indonesia, who violently put down Suharto's opponents.<br />Then there's Indonesia, where Suharto, who had been put in power by the CIA in 1965, was ousted with the help of the DIA because the IMF was unable to help Indonesia's financial problems.  Conclusion:  Suharto was no longer useful so he was dumped.  The collapse of the Asian rim economies is also touched on.<br />Another similar pattern is how former dictators are given immunity for their crimes.  Ferdinand Marcos died in exile in the U.S., General Chun Doo Hwan was pardoned by South Korean President Kim Young Sam, and Suharto was deemed too ill to stand trial.<br />The ultimate message in this book is indeed, that a country reaps what it sows.  Solution:  less imperialism, less interference, more peace, in other words, an end to the hegemony.  There's so much peaceful potential that the U.S. has--why not use that?report in to his new masters.<br />Another factor of American foreign policy is its support, defense and economic, of repressive anti-Communist regimes, such as South Korea and Indonesia.

Richard West writes a favourable, even-handed, and comprehensible account of Tito, who ruled Yugoslavia from 1945 to 1980.  He even provides a background to the South Slavs before talking about Tito, because it is important to understand the dynamics going on under the Ottoman Empire and later the Balkan absorption by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1878.<br />Tito, a Croat, was indeed born during an interesting period, when tensions were growing in Europe between the two alliance blocs, the Entente and Central Powers.  He had his brush with Pan-Slavism, as he went to help the Czechs and Slovaks during his military service.<br />West also takes time to talk about the Independent State of Croatia, the fascist puppet state under Ante Pavelic, the mastermind of Yugoslavian King Alexander's assassination in 1934.  That regime was brutal, as Serbs were butchered, bombed while in worship, and hurled off cliffs.  Even the Franciscan priests participated in the killing.<br />Tito's wartime exploits make interesting reading, as he was besieged from all sides, by Germans, Italians, the Ustasha (Croatian fascists), and monarchist Serbs under Draza Mihailovic.  It didn't help matters that the Allies saw Mihailovic as the more viable threat against the Germans.  Only when Churchill got information from the code-breaking Ultra did he realize that Tito was the greater danger against the Nazis and hence recognized that they had better give Tito higher priority.<br />His own brand of Communism, Titoism, was freer than Soviet Russia, Maoist China, or Hoxha's Albania, but also tried to make the various nationalities live together in collective brotherhood.  That hope would turn out to be unrealistic, but he did try to clamp down on nationalism.  True, he did jail some opponents and nationalists, such as future Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, but he didn't carry out large scale massacres like Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot.  He was one of two \\"good Communists\\" in the eyes of the West, the other one being Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania.<br />His role as one of the leaders of the non-aligned third bloc, along with India's Jawaharlal Nehru and Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser holds relevance today.  11 Sept has made non-alignment a non-option.  Unfortunately I haven't seen any countries who have made a firm stance of neutrality.<br />This book was written before the outbreak of the war in Bosnia despite its publication in 1994.  In light of what happened in Bosnia and Kosovo, critics might tear into Tito for keeping the genie of nationalism firmly stoppered.  It was a little after a decade when Yugoslavia disintegrated.  Like leaders such as Charlemagne and Louis XIV, his death left a leadership vacuum that led to political fragmentation.large scale massacres like Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot.

Kent's book Bismarck And His Times details the path taken by Prussia that gradually led that nation to unification with other German states under Prime Minister and later Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.  That path, however, did not lead the unified Germany towards political maturity, and led to its defeat in two world wars, notoriety for perpetuating the most shocking atrocities publicized in the world, and its division into two countries until eventual reunification in 1990.  As a result, Bismarck's achievements were reanalyzed, with post-World War II assessments revealing considerable rust on the \\"Iron Chancellor\\"'s facade.  Kent is one of those historians, arguing that Bismarck and his foreign and domestic policies were to blame for this tragedy, and the German nation, as well as the North German Confederation that preceded it, \\"was conceived too narrowly and maintained too rigidly for too long\\".<br />Consider the constitution of the North German Confederation created by Bismarck in 1866, a lopsided hybrid of an absolute monarchy and a constitutional state, with the executive and upper house holding most of the power.  There was the Prussian king--later the Kaiser of Germany--and the members of the Upper House composed of representatives from the North German states.  On the other side was the Reichstag, whose members were elected by male property owners, whose powers were limited to pass or defeat bills introduced by the king or Bismarck;  the Reichstag could not introduce bills.  In addition, the chancellor could not be brought down by a vote of no-confidence from the lower house, resulting in the dissolution of the government.  Bismarck created this constitution mainly to benefit himself and to ensure the power of the king and God.<br />His defensive foreign policy, such as the three wars with Denmark (1864), Austria (1866), and France (1870), consolidated his power and that of Prussia at the expense of antagonizing and alienating certain countries.  His alliance with countries was tied less to the Second Reich's interests than to his political survival.  Bismarck's intrigues with Austria-Hungary and Russia led a train of in what was described as \\"the finest example of diplomatic deception\\".<br />Bismarck may have been a master tactician and strategist in his foreign agenda before 1871, but the opposite holds true in his domestic policies.  He \\"was unable to tolerate opposing points of view, however sincere, and always considered opposition to his policies as personal attacks, motivated by selfish or group interests\\".  To him, the word \\"loyal opposition\\" was a contradiction in terms.<br /> Therein lies the problem.  Bismarck was energized by having foes to fight and vanquish, as he did with the Danes, Austrians, and French.  In his struggles against the Catholics and the Social Democratic Party, he appeared not to shift gears--he just kept on fighting when he should have switched gears into peace mode, or better still, rest on his laurels and retire.<br />What brought his downfall was his lust for power that went to such an extreme, that in the face of being dismissed by Kaiser Wilhelm II, he was prepared to set events that would bring victory to the SDP, Catholic Center, and hardline Conservatives, whose policies were counter to the Kaiser's, in the 1890 elections.  He would then convince the princes of the Reich's constituent states that the empire had undergone political paralysis.  A military coup, on the pretext of a Social Democrat uprising, would follow.  SDP leaders would be arrested, martial law would be declared, and the Reichstag dissolved.  Germany would then become a military dictatorship.<br />Kent's book has successfully depicted the flaws of Bismarck's mindset, in which he placed his personal political survival before the interests of the political entities he governed, and that is the rust that tarnished the image of the \\"Iron Chancellor.\\"is alliance with countries was tied less to the Second Reich's interests than to his political survival.

Fine make clear a couple of points on the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and to do that, they dig the history of Bosnia from an independent Catholic kingdom to Ottoman overlordship, Austro-Hungarian overlordship, Serbian-dominated royal Yugoslavia, the fascist Independent State of Croatia under Ante Pavelic, Socialist Yugoslavia under Marshal Tito, to the independent Bosnia that was torn apart by ethnic strife.<br />Those of you who saw American Marines on TV saying, \\"Oh, these people have been fighting each other for thousands of years,\\" should clearly realize their ignorance of Balkan history.  Clearly, ancient history is not a prerequisite for grunts.<br />Another interest point is how the Ottomans classified their Slavic subjects.  They did so under religion, i.e. Orthodox, Catholic, Muslim, or Jew.  They were more favourable to the Orthodox Slavs, as the Orthodox patriarch in Constantinople was under their thrall, so in civil complaints, guess which Christian the judge favoured more?<br />The other dimension to categorizing by religion was how the people identified themselves.  Most nationalities think, \\"I'm German,\\" or \\"I'm British.\\"  In this case, the logic goes something like this:  \\"I'm Orthodox, therefore I'm Serb\\" or \\"I'm Catholic, therefore I'm Croat\\" or \\"I'm Muslim [in religion], therefore I'm Muslim [nationality]\\".  Interesting indeed.<br />But let's not forget the main point:  it wasn't until the Austo-Hungarian Empire took over the Balkans that the religious animosities flared up.  Before, people of all three religions got along just fine.  Oh, and guess what?  The Serbs and Croats got their names from Iranian tribes who migrated to the region.  These tribes became Slavicised and that was that.<br />This book goes up to 1994, just missing the massacres of Srebrenica and Zepa, as well as the shopping square massacre in Sarajevo that got the Western powers to finally say, \\"That's it!  We gotta do something!\\"<br />The handful of maps of the region helpfully compliment the sections of the book, and early on, the legitimacy of Bosnia as a distinct polity is successfully argued.  Its division into states along the river-boundaries (Banovinas) of royal Yugoslavia is also of particular interest.<br />What happened in Bosnia was very horrific, there's no denying that.  This book will explain the facts, debunk myths, and give the reader a quick primer in Bosnian history.ful of maps of the region helpfully compliment the sections of the book, and early on, the legitimacy of Bosnia as a distinct polity is successfully argued.

Like the Shulman book, Frum points to Vietnam, in particular My Lai, as a milestone, when we discovered we weren't infallible, morally and otherwise.  Was it any wonder that a high rate of AWOLers, deserters, and dishonourable discharges ran rampant during the 1970's?  And like Shulman's book, Frum argues that it was the 1970's that made the America of today, not the 1960's.<br />The sobering disillusionment of the law is covered in \\"The Law Is Crazy\\" section.  The crime rate skyrocketed with the influx of poor blacks from the South to the urban North.  Crime was named as the biggest fear Americans faced in the 1970's.  The thing was, people who became victims didn't bother reporting it because they figured the law wouldn't do anything about it.  Frum lists pride, guilt, and laxity in policing as the diseases that bred disrespect for law in that decade.  The Dirty Harry and Death Wish movies were clearly responses to the crisis on hand, and it wasn't surprising, now that I come to think of it, of the many cop shows that aired, such as Columbo, the Rockford Files, Kojak, CHIPS, Hawaii Five-O, and The Streets Of San Francisco, during that decade.  It was a cry for law and order, to use Richard Nixon's slogan for 1968.<br />We got into a buying binge with the credit card from the 1970's, where despite being socked by the Great Depression, Americans figured as long as post-war prosperity continued, splurging was in.  People could gain more material possessions and boost their status, and with inflation eliminating a little percentage of one's debt, why not spend now?  \\"Self-denial was becoming downright irrational,\\" according to Frum.<br />The Energy Crisis: ah yes, in 1973 and later in 1978.  We became more aware of our dependence on foreign oil and the realization that we only had a finite amount of natural resources, and that we would have to cut back or find some efficient method of fuel.<br />It was also that time that the Arabs were seen as the new masters of the world, as they controlled the oil spigot.  The story of the detainment and release in France of one of the masterminds of the Munich Olympics massacre testifies to that.  And along with the Arabs, came hijacking incidents, especially Entebbe.<br />However, let's not forget liberation.  There was also a sense of easing authoritarian institutions.  In the case of law enforcement, it was bad, but in terms of religion, maybe that's what was needed to counterract the desertion of pews in both Catholic and Protestant churches.  And sex?  That was the most positive aspect of the 1970's right there.  The mouthful of words POSSLQ (person of opposite sex sharing living quarters) has fortunately been changed to \\"significant other\\" of today.  The taboo of living together out of wedlock was shattered.  \\"Nice girls do\\" and \\"The day may come when we regard chastity as no more a virtue than malnutrition\\" were two quotes typifying that era.

Yes, he was the very first Time Lord, but more than that, as readers will find out.<br />The book that Jessica Carney mentioned being in the process of writing in the More Than 30 Years In The TARDIS documentary was Who's There-The Life and Career of William Hartnell, who was both the first Doctor Who and one of Jessica's grandfathers.<br />However, after reading about his early life and career, his years in Doctor Who might as well be a postscript.  Carney painstakingly traces her grandfather's life from his hard childhood in Devon, trying to overcome the shame of his illegitimacy, going on a stage career, meeting his future wife Heather McIntyre, making the string of B-movies in the 1930's, (quota quickies they were called), moving up the ladder with films such as The Way Ahead, Brighton Rock, Carry On Sergeant, and This Sporting Life, doing The Army Game TV series, a crisis of sorts as parts dried up, and his glorious finish in Doctor Who.  It's indeed ironic that the movie that started the entire Carry On series is not on video.  I've seen Brighton Rock and he played the character of Dallow very well.  Another irony is that both of Jessica Carney's grandfathers appeared in Brighton Rock, the other being George Carney, although the latter died before the Hartnells and Carneys became united with the marriage of Anne Hartnell to Terry Carney.<br />William Hartnell emerges as someone who could be hot-tempered, but also good-humoured, kindly, and overgenerous.  One example was his rivalry between Bob Monkhouse when making Carry On Sergeant.  Hartnell only warmed up to him when Monkhouse was affected with the death of his father.  He also valued security, hating change, and was upset to see the various TARDIS crew and even producer Verity Lambert leave in his Doctor Who years.<br />His early journal details his various capers, such as \\"bunking\\", basically trying to get free admission without paying, be it the tube or a movie theatre.  He even got drunk on his uncle's cider and even snuck out at night from his grandparents.  That this document itself survived is a miracle, considering how much of a throw-away society we've become.<br />Carney presents Hartnell as a grandfather, her \\"barmy sampa\\" as she states quite early on in her book, but as a human being as well.  Like all humans, he did have his faults, i.e. gambling, womanizing, this which hurt his wife very much, and his going to the pub and getting very slashed.  Sometimes, the womanizing accompanied that.  However, he took his departure from Doctor Who hard, as his wife noticed how much he went pubbing.<br />His arteriosclerosis that hit him during his Doctor Who years and untimely, I might add, (I say untimely because he died aged 65, and given 1974, that's not even life expectancy) showed up in his dialogue troubles in the show which I've noticed upon seeing later stories.<br />This book is a treasure due to the available source material, be they personal diaries of William and Heather Hartnell, photo stills, and playbills from the plays they starred in during their early period.  The tail end of the book has a list, cast, and brief synopses of his films and plays.get free admission without paying, be it the tube or a movie theatre.

Well, guess what?  I did a little, but not enough of the 1970's culture was filtered into my household.  As a result, I felt alienated from America, and still haven't come to terms with it.  So when I discovered Bruce Shulman's book, The Seventies-The Great Shift In American Culture, Society, and Politics, I saw an analytical treasure trove.  Basically, the beginnings of contemporary America began not in the 60's, but the 70's, and Schulman effectively makes his case here.<br />With the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy in 1968, the optimism that had lighted the country burned out into the disillusionment of the 1970's.  The melting pot was transformed into a salad bowl in the 70's, as various ethnic groups went on the cultural nationalism bandwagon, be they African-Americans, Italian-Americans, Japanese-Americans, Chinese-Americans, whatever-Americans.  I remember those commercials on a certain group, with someone concluding, \\"I'm proud to be a Chinese/Italian/Japanese-American.\\"<br />The various fads and movements are also touched on here, such as Werner Erhard's EST, radical feminism, New Age, the New Right Christians, the environmentalist movement, Gray Panthers, to list a few.  Strangely enough, the SLA, People's Temple and the Moonies aren't mentioned.  But the people thought there must be another answer.  After losing Vietnam, we had entered, in the words of Jimmy Carter, \\"a crisis of confidence,\\" even before he came to office.<br />The feeling that authority figures were not trustworthy hit a high point with Watergate, and an early chapter focuses on Richard Nixon and his policies.  This theme carried on later in Jimmy Carter's \\"crisis of confidence\\" speech.<br />And while I'm at it--Jimmy Carter's given a sympathetic treatment by Schulman.  His humble facade, attempts to de-imperialize the presidency, and Congress's tearing apart his energy policy are covered.  Basically, he had good intentions, but came face-to-face with a Congress still steaming after Watergate.<br />And what book would not be complete without entertainment?  There was the narcissistic indulgence of glam artists KISS and David Bowie (both in my top artists lists, BTW), the continuing importance of Bob Dylan with Blood On The Tracks, and punk rock as typified by the Sex Pistols, Clash, and Ramones.  The Clash's anarchic message demonstrated the anger against the establishment, and even called for people to \\"Kick down the wall/cause governments to fall\\" in the song \\"Clampdown.\\"<br /> Even Saturday Night Fever, with its escapist theme living side by side with the economic souring of that time, is covered.  There's a certain flavour in 70's movies, be it the hairstyles, clothes, cars, the vermilion dye that substituted for blood, and film quality that reaches out to me.  The feeling of anger, disaffectedness, and distrust in authority from that bygone decade harkens to me.<br />The Hegelian synthesis of Alan Alda's sensitive male and John Wayne's red-blooded macho male was an interesting read.  This is discussed in the Battle of the Sexes, which includes Billie Jean King teaching Bobby Riggs a well-deserved lesson.<br />The book concludes with the beginning of the Reagan Years, of how conservatism took over, and how counter-culture icons like Jane Fonda and Jerry Rubin sold out to crass capitalist values of the \\"My Decade.\\"  An additional postscript was how Grenada, Libya, and later Panama gradually brought America out of the Vietnam Syndrome.

This book deals with reconciling Greek mythology with Von Daniken's research of extraterrestrials visiting our planet in ancient times and influencing man's development.  That was a recurring theme in Dr. Who, (q.v. The Daemons.)<br />The aliens who came down to Earth were worshipped as gods, as they flew in their craft.  These gods intermixed with the natives, who became demigods, but possessing the same technological knowhow.<br />Von Daniken's book opens with an account of the Argonautica, the voyage of Jason, and straight off, there are aspects that bely alien origins--a ship that talks, specialists hired for the voyage, Talos, who was probably a giant robot, and the Golden Fleece as some form of advanced technology that enabled one to fly.<br />What about giants?  Gilgamesh and Enkidu encountered the giant Humbaba, David and Goliath, and the offspring of Cain's daughters?  Isn't it possible that these giants were aliens or descended from them?  There is more, including the possibility that the head of the Medusa was some sort of superweapon.<br />There is a section where he explains the difficulties involving where Atlantis was.  It's tied to the fact that from Atlantis is derived the Atlantic Ocean, Mount Atlas, and even Aztlan, which in turns is the derivation of Aztec.  This discounts Troy, Malta, Santorini, and Crete, because they are in the Mediterranean.  And if Troy was Atlantis, surely there'd be some record of it?  No, Troy was called Tros and Ilion, but not Atlantis.  That in turn is also explored in the section on Heinrich Schliemann and the different Troys found.  There are also excerpts from Plato's Dialogues where Critias tells the story of Solon and how Solon learned of Atlantis.<br />Included in this text are colour photos of the places mentioned, such as the Acropolis, Delphi, and Troy.  Getting this book makes me want to check out his earliest book on the subject, Chariot Of The Gods, and this is certainly an interesting twist on Greek mythology.gy.	2002-10-22

Included in length are photos of the turmoil that took place inbetween the end of World War I and the founding of the Weimar Republic, the fighting by the Communists, and the Bavarian coups.  The war pictures are themselves revealing as well.<br />The text accompanying the photos is a well-detailed (for a book mainly of pictures) history.  However, the real treat in this book are the colour pictures, which include war photos, war insignia, and posters.  Page 78, for example, has a Volkswagen ad, and the family rallying for Nazism picture was used by Laibach for the cover of their album, Sympathy For The Devil.<br />The black and white photos also provide a time capsule into an age that's looked at in both horror and fascination, though it's more the latter for me.<br />Other documents included are a copy of the Instrument of Surrender signed by Montgomery and the Nuremberg Laws written by Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart.<br />The glossary at the end includes a list of German titles and terms, such as Einsatzkommando, Kries, and Abwehr, a list of second rank officials such as Reinhard Heydrich, Roland Freisler, and Julius Streicher, and what their positions were in the Reich.<br />Seeing as how Bradley borrowed from Shirer and Liddell-Hart, who are among the top in this field, this is a worthy book.	2002-10-22

An international cast of bad girl goddesses star in this irreverent treatment of mythology.  Isis from Egypt, Osmotar from Finland, Freya of the Norse Gods, Maeve of Ireland, Judith and Jezebel from the Middle East, Lilith from the Garden of Eden, and Kali from India are among the featured players in Trina Robbins' collection.<br />The overarching theme that Trina Robbins puts forth in her arch, humorous stories about these goddesses is assertive females.  Well, she's a feminist so that's no surprise, but they form a different perspective compared to the traditional way goddesses in mythology are portrayed.<br />Here's an example of her biting humor when she tells of Elisha telling Jehu he could be king.  \\"Guess what?  Jehovah just told me that you can be the next king of Israel.  All you have to do is slay that sl-- Jezebel and her grandson.  Jehu went, 'Cool,' and gathered an army to invade the palace.  Today we call this a military coup, but Jehu simply insisted that God was on his side.\\"<br />On extraordinary feats performed by Osmotar (how she created the various creatures) and Kannaki (how she destroyed the city), Robbins accurately writes:  \\"Warning:  do not try this at home.\\"<br />In most stories, there is a small postscript telling of similar situations or an expansion of the theme.  For example, after telling Lilith's story, Robbins explains that Lilith was left out of the Bible because, guess which sex wrote the Old Testament?  One guess, and it isn't women.  Also, guess what sanitized story evolved out of Freya and the dwarves who owned the diamond necklace she wanted so bad?  Hint:  can you sing, \\"Hi ho!\\"?<br />Oh, and for those of you wondering who Pele is as in Tori Amos's Boys For Pele album, you'll find that answer here.<br />Definitely not on the scholarly side, but maybe this book will get people without a previous inkling about these goddesses to find out more about them.  Those familiar with them will get a laugh.  Maybe.	2002-10-14

Songs that contained sexually explicit lyrics, violence, and references to drugs and the occult were targeted.  Remember the \\"Filthy FifteenE  Remember only three musicians brave enough to come to the PMRC hearings-John Denver, Dee Snider, and Frank Zappa?  I do.<br />And lawsuits against artists/groups such as Ozzy and Judas Priest only proved that it's the listener who's at fault, not the artist, for the listener's suicide.  2 Live Crew's hard-fought and ultimately victorious court battle in Broward County, FL is also covered in the book.<br />In the short run, the infamous warning label set an age limit, but it led to edited versions of albums, which in turn exacerbated the problem of their being returned on the sly for the complete version.  The message seems to be there's always a way around things.<br />But censorship and condemnation only boosts sales for that product, with consumers wanting to know what the big deal is, so paradoxically, the PMRC and other groups actually help the artists/group they are condemning.  Makes you think, hmm?<br />Radio stations in small-town areas have targeted inoffensive songs just because they contain a word that may be taken to have negative references, the most famous case being John Denver's \\"Rocky Mountain High.\\" (They thought high meant as in a drug-induced high)<br />Eric Nuzum's book covers a variety of subjects, such as censorship during the 1950's up to the PMRC's inception, banned album art, inconsistencies in censorship, and racism, particularly how black musicians who created a sound had their art stolen by white musicians who made it big, relegating the original artists to segregated underground clubs. The trend continued when R&B was ripped off into rock & roll. If anything, there is a tremendous debt owed to black musicians who created the music. To add insult to injury, R&B songs that might have been considered risque were redone in \\"nice\\" versions by white artists, substituting \\"offensive\\" lyrics. Fortunately, the original versions by the original artists are available, but think of the royalties the black artists were cheated out of. It's downright unjust. MTV and narrowcasting (catering to a single demographic) is touched on. I learned here how black artists broke through on MTV and its own form of censorship. MTV seems more about money than music, to paraphrase Neil Young.<br />Marilyn Manson is also touched on in this book, as is the Columbine massacre. Manson's assertion that times have not become more violent but more televised is right to the point.

Face it, censorship will rear its ugly head time and again, but times are getting more progressive. Yesterday's fingerpointing rolls today's eyes skywards.

The former point of view is grimmer, filled with the everyday terror of war.  And this war was unlike any other fought before, as there were no major advances or retreats, and the war was fought on a limited sector of ground, between two lines of trenches, one French and British, the other German, with both sides giving no quarter, throwing thousands of young lives at each other and away.  The new technology and weaponry didn't improve the situation.  In that context, there were two possible outcomes for the private:  death at the front, or the worse, psychological death.<br />What kind of war was it where the survivors were better off dead, killed instantly by being annihilated by a shell, asphyxiated by mustard and chlorine gas, or slower and more painful, by gangrene?  The \\"Great War\\" have transformed Paul and his company into semi-living blobs of fear on the front, and in the case of Paul, alienated him from civilian life, such as his books, family, and the older people who his father takes him to meet.  And the older generation, completely disconnected with what Paul has undergone at the front, shallowly tells him to \\"shove ahead a bit out there with your everlasting trench warfare--Smash through the johnnies and then there will be peace.\\"  One can imagine Paul wanting to grab the old fool by the collar and shaking him silly.<br />They also become wild beasts defending themselves against Death, as Paul mentions in Chapter Six.  When the French soldiers attack, the Germans do not think of them as men.  They have had it with being attacked by faceless artillery and gas and can take their revenge by flinging grenades at them.  Their fear, madness, and drive for life is multiplied in concert to the point that if their own father came in front of them, they wouldn't hesitate to lob a grenade at them.<br />To summarize the common denominator of the people the soldiers hate, it is people who are not in their world.  What do the recruits, non-commissioned and commissioned officers, the older generation at home, or the sisters know of their life, their world?<br />During war, things take on multiple meanings that alienate the soldiers from humanity.  Death is signified by an empty bed.  All that remains of the poor fellow who died for his country is his effects, be they boots, clothes, or photographs, the things that had significance because they were owned by a soldier.  These possessions, bereft of their owner, seem like another layer of skin that has been sloughed off following death.<br />In the end, World War I proved to be the worst area a soldier could ever have been stationed for the following reasons:  a lengthy stalemate on both sides, new technology, and the bitter animosity of the opposing sides that extended to the battlefield.at them.<br />To summarize the common denominator of the people the soldiers hate, it is people who are not in their world.

Chances are one'll find three of the four and much much more in The Unabridged Marilyn A-Z, which is an encyclopedia, a Marilyn matrix at one's fingertips.<br />The entry featuring lists are painstakingly detailed, thanks to the duo of Randall Riese and Neal Hitchens.  Firsts, for example, lists that her first LIFE cover was the April 1952 one, that her first date was Jim Dougherty, later to become her first husband, or that her first screen test was on 19 July 1946.<br />Other entries range from individual movies, people who played parts in her life, be they crucial, trivial, or peripheral, such as photographers, directors, and other performers.  For example, there's a short entry on Audrey Hepburn because the part of Breakfast At Tiffany's Holly Golightly was originally written by Truman Capote with MM in mind.  Selected movie reviews, the coroner's report, LAPD police report, list of quotes, comprise other entries.<br />Peppered throughout the books are Marilyn related trivia questions, such as what plant she knocked over in The Seven Year Itch.<br />However, this book came out in 1987, and since that time, countless other books have been written on Marilyn, plus certain people, such as Yves Montand, Joe DiMaggio, and Susan Strasberg, have passed away.  Earlier books have probably gone out-of-print as well.  And of course, she finally got her own postage stamp in the U.S.  A lot can indeed change in fifteen years.<br />Books like these serves as a focal point for devoted fans or mere students of the subject, but others may find something like this to be somewhat indulgent and exploitative.  Marilyn, Elvis, James Dean, and John Wayne are probably a few who have had these kind of reference books written about them.<br />If you want to write a fictional work on Marilyn, find out all sorts of trivia on her, or just plain want to know about her, AND, you don't care that this came out in the late 1980's, this is a good place to start.  Who knows, maybe you'll start feeling blonde all over.ust plain want to know about her, AND, you don't care that this came out in the late 1980's, this is a good place to start.

There have been a few original novels involving Sherlock Holmes and the Whitechapel killings, i.e. the Jack the Ripper murders.  However, none of them are as controversial as Michael Didbin's The Last Sherlock Holmes Story.<br />What differentiates this story is that this is a case in which some of Holmes' later classic cases take place inbetween murders, such as The Red-Headed League and Silver Blaze, and those are merely referred to as taking place.<br />There are references to previous cases, such as \\"The Cardboard Box\\" and \\"The Speckled Band.\\"  And there is a proposed theory that maybe another Andaman Islander (like The Sign Of Four's Tonga) is on the loose.  However, the chief suspect becomes Moriarty, usually the mastermind, but given the way Holmes has put a stop to many a criminal scheme, the actual killer.  One clue is to the location of the killings and what letter they make.<br />Lestrade is portrayed as a pompous idiot and someone who is more antagonistic of Holmes rather than deferential in the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories.<br />One interesting aspect is that ACD is a character hired to publish some of Holmes' cases, and is given A Study In Scarlet and The Sign Of Four--\\"Mr. Thaddeus and Brother Bartholomew.  Jonathan Small and Tonga!\\"  Holmes is contemptuous of Doyle's glamorizing and bits of artistic license, whereas Watson doesn't seem to mind so much.<br />The Holmes and Watson team dynamic is maintained here in exactly the way ACD portrayed it.  Holmes' methods of detection and his classic arrogance is done to a tee here.

Others, such as myself, will be interested at this interpretation of the Whitechapel murders.

Candy Christian, a beautiful girl who just happened to be born on Valentine's Day, writes a paper on Contemporary Human Love for her instructor, Professor Mephesto, saying that \\"to give of oneself--fully--is not merely a duty prescribed by an outmoded superstition, it is a beautiful and thrilling privilege.\\"<br />And things go really cockeyed from there.  A tryst with Manuel, the Mexican gardener, in full application of her paper, leads to the hospitalization of her father, and her voyage into the wide, weird, world.  It isn't that she's missing much.  Her father's a stodgy conservative businessman, her aunt Livia is a vulgar hussy who uses sexual innuendos as regularly as one blinks.  However, her adventures lead her into meeting people who want nothing more than to rip the wrapper off and have a bite of that... candy.  Oops!  Candy, I mean.  Others downright hate her.  The poor girl has the best of intentions and doesn't want to rock the boat for the sake of preserving her credo, and hence lets them take advantage of her without knowing that they are.<br />Written as it was in 1958, I can see how it shocked America and Europe.  Dr. Krankeit's assertion that self-gratification is actually healthy is a message to the repressed people of the world:  \\"This mechanism you've contrived to keep your sexual lust a secret from the world, and from you yourself, is causing you more trouble than you realize.\\"  It makes sense--keep something bottled or under pressure for too long and KA-BLAM!!  Of course, involving another party complicates things, because consent is becomes issue.  But is it healthy and okay to look at adult magazines, videos, or computer CD-ROMs?  Heck yeah!<br />Southern's writing is brash, profanely funny, and will cause cause conservatives hairs to stand on end even today, but his choice of words, be they adjectives, nouns, and slang, in describing sexual things is creative to say the least.  It's what keeps this book afloat.  What also helps Candy is the hapless but lovable title character-face it, there's only one decent character in this book other than her--and I can't help but roll my eyes at her gullibility.  But I also feel attached to my heroine too.rds, be they adjectives, nouns, and slang, in describing sexual things is creative to say the least.  It's what keeps this book afloat.

This might as well be Round About Everything You Wanted To Know About Are You Being Served?. Why write about a TV series? With the exception of soap operas, a TV series that goes on for the good part of a decade isn't something to brush aside lightly, especially in the UK, with its limited, government-subsidized budgets given to the BBC. Are You Being Served? began with a pilot episode in 1972, then as a series in itself, lasting from 1973 to 1985. 12 years and 10 seasons wasn't that bad for a British TV series--look at Doctor Who and 'Allo 'Allo.<br />The inspiration is the most important thing--without it, there wouldn't have been a show. Leave it to Jeremy Lloyd, one of the co-creators, to work two years at Simpson's department store and get canned for selling drinks on the floor on a hot day! Two years and he came up with this much output? I've been working four years in the same place; what can I come up with?<br />For each regular character, there is a description, followed by a short bio of the actor who played said character. Naturally, there is a lot more print on the two most popular characters--John Inman (Mr. Humphries) and Molly Sugden (Ms. Slocombe). The book says that Mr. Humphries was camp, not gay, but doesn't explain the difference. Camp basically means openly flamboyant and more relaxed in extroverted emotion without the sexual orientation issue. I liked all the characters, though Mr. Humphries and Mr. Lucas were on the top of my list.<br />Things I didn't know that raised my eyebrows was Mike Berry's past career as a singer, as a contemporary of the Beatles.<br />There is also a season by season guide, with a synopsis to the stories, guest cast, original date of transmission, and ratings from * to ****. Going through this part, I realized that with the exception of the first and fourth seasons (1973, 1976), no season was completely pristine--there were bound to be some substandard stories. I agree with most of the ratings, and yes, the overall ratings were a bit uneven during the last three, when each season was every other year instead of every year. The book also includes the episodes of Grace and Favour, titled Are You Being Served Again? for the US, as well as the Australian series never aired here, and the various spinoffs.<br />There's also glossary of British slang in the back of the book as well as in the margins, which is as nice as ninepence for the uninitiated.<br />At the end of the day, anyone trying to get behind the scenes of this hit series will get a rattling good time. So read on to the top of your bent.tings were a bit uneven during the last three, when each season was every other year instead of every year.

The book reveals how Milosevic gave himself a name in 1987, when his boss, Serbian Communist Party leader Ivan Stambolic, sent him to Kosovo to quell down Serbian riots.  When confronted by protesters who told them the Kosovo Albanians were beating them, he uttered the phrase, \\"No one will ever dare beat you again.\\"  He became a hero from that day on, a figure to whom the Serbs could rally around.<br />Milosevic knew that too and betrayed Stambolic, his political mentor, to become president of Serbia.  The important things here are the parallels and dissimilarities between Tito and Milosevic.  Tito, a communist, wanted a united Yugoslavia, a nation of Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Montenegrins, Macedonians, Muslims, and Kosovars.  Milosevic, a nationalist, wanted a united Serbia, but only for the Serbs.  And he wanted to be leader of all Serbs, meaning the Montenegrins, Serbs in Serbia, Bosnian Serbs, and the Krajina Serbs.  He even told Milan Panic, Yugoslavia's prime minister, that he was the \\"Ayatollah Khomeini of Serbia.  The Serbs will follow me no matter what.\\"<br />The trouble with that was, the Serbs in those other areas already had their own leaders, such as Radovan Karadzic, so he had to discredit them or put them down under his thumb, which ultimately didn't work.<br />Some things that have come to light is the back door deal between Milosevic and then-Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, on dividing Bosnia between them.  Milosevic didn't care if he lost the Serb-populated Krajina and Eastern Slavonia, both in Croatia, saying that he would repopulate Kosovo with the Serbs from those regions.<br />But when the chips fall down, Milosevic used nationalism to get power for himself.  The beginning of the end came in the middle of the war in Bosnia, when he was beset by UN sanctions and the Western economic blockade.  His own position eroding so he endorsed the Vance-Owen plan to divide Bosnia into ten cantons--3 Serb, 3 Muslim, 2 Croat, 1 (Muslim-Croat), with Sarajevo organized like Washington D.C.  Karadzic was vehemently against it and split with Milosevic.<br />Milosevic was the \\"man of the hour\\" at the Dayton talks, in which he agreed to give Sarajevo, the holy grail to Bosnian Serbs, to Muslims, as well as division of Republika Srpska by the Posovina corridor.  It was not his to give, but he did it to make himself the good Serb to the West and to cut the Bosnian Serbs down to size.  However, this move alienated him from true nationalists such as Karadzic and militia leader Vojislav Sesejl.<br />Milosevic seems no better than a schoolyard bully.  He torments the weak but upon facing someone stronger, backs down, as he did in Kosovo.  It took the non-violent student group OTPOR to oust him, but that's another book, which I hope is well-researched and documented like this book.e.

Some people get all the fun!  However, their purpose was to examine programs, stories, or movies that influenced certain stories, and more important to point out goofs and links, both within a story and the entire series, which is where the C-word comes in--continuity.  They also write down dialogue that have double meanings, makes one (well, them anyway) cringe, and those that are positively memorable.<br />Example of a Dialogue Triumph: \\"Listen to that!  It's the sound of the planet screaming its rage.\\"  That was from Inferno, where the Doctor is referring to the parallel Earth that will soon become engulfed in molten lava.  From Colony In Space, when Jo asks on any other living things on Uxarius, Mary Ashe answers: \\"There's no animal life, just a few birds and insects.\\"  Now that's a Dialogue Disaster!<br />And finally, to find out what they thought of it, there's The Bottom Line section.  While I see pointing out errors useful, there is a clear border between justifiable mistakes and petty nitpicking.  In the latter case, well, there could be an unstated explanation.  Why, does everything have to be explained for the benefit of the viewer?  When I was in the now-defunct Friends of Doctor Who fan club, one member disparagingly referred to it as the Disco Guide.<br />One justifiable \\"goof,\\" for example, is the in The Three Doctors, where UNIT, being a top secret establishment, has a sign advertising its headquarters, as well as Lethbridge-Stewart's name listing him as commanding officer.  That's understandable.  I mean, to use a similar example, would the powers that had Kennedy killed have a sign reading \\"Military Industry Complex-Assassinating JFK since 1963\\" on their headquarters?  Puh-leeze!<br />An easily explained \\"goof\\" is when Tegan speaks to Kukurtji, the ancient-era aborigine, in Four To Doomsday.  Cornell and company complained that Tegan responded in the correct language and era.  Well, pardon me, guys, but remember The Masque Of Mandragora, when the Doctor explained to Sarah that her ability to understand foreign languages was a Time Lord gift he shared with her?  Surely it applies there?  So there!<br />Which of my favorite stories do they give the highest honors to?  Spearhead From Space, Inferno, The Pirate Planet, Remembrance Of The Daleks, and The Curse Of Fenric, to name a few.  Lowest honors?  The Time Monster, Monster Of Peladon, Planet Of The Spiders, The Android Invasion, Time-Flight, and Time And The Rani.  Well, actually, there aren't any Who stories I totally loathe but I do admit there are some that are worth watching but aren't as good as others.<br />The troika also do not look favorably on Dalek and Cybermen stories and go out of their way to find flaws.  There must be a full page of flaws listed in Resurrection Of The Daleks!  The Invasion doesn't get shredded as much as Earthshock and Attack Of The Cybermen, or Silver Nemesis.  It's very generous in rating Timelash, surprising considering its reputation as the worst Who story ever.<br />There are elaborate histories on the Daleks and Cybermen in here.  They also point out that Loch Ness is referred to in two stories, Terror Of The Zygons and Timelash.  One can assume that the Zygons, with their obviously superior power, killed the Borad.  Well, maybe they did.<br />Still, I use this as a valuable reference guide, and a work comparing analyses of various Dalek, Cybermen, and Earth Empire histories with other Who works.

One of the first books I got that turned me on to Marilyn was Andre De Dienes' Marilyn Mon Amour, and as such, is the best book I've ever bought on her.<br />The photos are in black-and-white, which adds to the charm.  de Dienes' work proves that the world didn't need colour photos to show that warm, blossoming, peach-like skin to its full effect.  No, b-and-w was good enough to bring out that inner beauty.<br />This book more than any other convinced me that Norma Jeane was prettier than Marilyn.  Oh yes, I was enthralled by the golden goddess who took the world by storm beginning in 1953, but it's that pretty brunette who charms me more.  The shots at the beach, where she's wearing the sweater and playing with the volleyball, are my favorites.  The shots of her in the Death Valley also exemplify her prettier self.  And she does look sweet and girlish in pigtails, during her first photo shoot.<br />Of the blonde shots, it'd probably have to be the 1949 beach shots.  Her hair was long then, and she looks like she's really enjoying herself.  And of any later stuff, the shot of her eating breakfast.<br />The last few photos mirror the despair she felt towards the end of her life.  The frightened little girl, surrounded by darkness, is clearly seen.<br />I've heard the saying that the camera is a mirror to the soul.  In the case of this photo collection, I am in full concurrence.  However, the camera needs an operator, someone to focus that mirror, and Andre de Dienes was the right person for that focus.	2002-07-07

I'm in history now, but Keirsey opened up a door for me, the exploration of temperaments, why people are the way they are, how many ways they can be different, and what occupations they are suited for.  If only people could find out how fascinating this topic is, it would make them be more analytical.<br />The first two times I took the Keirsey Test, I was classified as an Inspector Guardian.  That cannot be, I thought.  I decided that I would garner more information from the book rather than the web site, so purchase the book I did.  I read the book, and have found myself as a Rational, an INTJ--that's Introverted, iNtuitive, Thinking, and Judgmental, or Mastermind Rational.  Now that fit me more to a tee.  I trusted logic, didn't care too much for rules, although I grudgingly followed them when I didn't have a choice, I am calm and detached, efficiency, autonomy, thinking in the long-term, skeptical, and like sci-fi books/movies a lot.  And people like me are in short supply, so that makes me a rara avis of sorts.  Cogito ergo sum--that's my motto.<br />Keirsey goes through each temperament in detail, citing examples from books, movies, and historical figures.  Within each temperament, he goes through the four types.  There is a further section of leadership and companionship.  I found out my opposite number is a Champion Idealist, or ENFP, Extraverted, iNtuitive, Feeling, and Probing.  I don't think I'll ever find that rarest of birds to fill that hole in my soul, but at least I know what I need to look for.<br />I learned more about my Rational cousins, such as Aristotle, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, and Thomas Jefferson, and the latter has become my favorite president as a result.  Most of my other heroes have been Idealists, such as Gandhi, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Martin Luther King Jr.  A pity we comprise 15-20% of the total population.  Hopefully that fraction will be a proportional 1:1:1:1.<br />That's not to say I pooh-pooh the 80-85% who are Guardians or Artisans.  Paul McCartney, Marilyn Monroe, Dario Argento, and Madonna are Artisans whose art I appreciate very much.  As for Guardians, I'd probably like the friendly Guardians the best, as my late grandmother was a Provider Guardian.<br />Keirsey also helped me explain why I was swept away by Bill Clinton, because he's a Performer Artisan.  That guy was the life and soul of the party, optimistic, a bit of a playboy, but at least I know why.  And although I disagreed with Reagan's policies, I have to admit, he was an amiable enough guy.  Yes, he's an Artisan as well.<br />The test itself and the scorer are in the book, as well as a mini-assessment in the back, which found me to be a Rational first and an Idealist second, which fits, since Rationals are closet romantics.<br /><br />Apart from finding myself, whenever I watch a movie or TV program, I have always gotten in the habit of typewatching characters by temperament, which adds to the dimension of cinematic analysis.  I've found myself liking Rational and Idealist characters such as Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind and Juliette Binoche in Chocolat.  Movies with these temperament types as stars would make watching movies more enjoyable, especially foreign films or little known productions from Miramax.<br />An invaluable book, which if more people read, might help ease tensions and make a better world.  So people, accept others for who they are and don't try to change them, because to quote that sailor-cum-philosopher, \\"I am what I am.\\"  And to the rest of you, as Polonius told Laertes, \\"to thine own self be true.\\"fully that fraction will be a proportional 1:1:1:1.<br />That's not to say I pooh-pooh the 80-85% who are Guardians or Artisans.

If I was to choose a coffee table book of cheesecake and magically, could live on an island surrounded by the models in that book, I'd have to pass up Sorayama, Olivia, and Vargas, and go for Gil Elvgren, the collection being this 200+ page work that covers Elvgren's work from the 1930's to the 1970's.<br />The girls in Elvgren's paintings not only come alive, but seem more warm and human, innocent with a twinge of spice.  So this is what they meant by \\"sugar, spice, and everything nice.\\"  Maybe because most of them are smiling, with those pearly whites showing.  I could spend hours looking through those pages, forming stories around the paintings.<br />Many look like celebrities.  In \\"Let's Go (1957),\\" the blonde getting out of a white car looks a lot like Marilyn Monroe.  The girl in \\"True To You (Sitting Pretty) (1950)\\" also resembles Marilyn but with brown hair.  And the honey in \\"Evening Out (1969)\\" reminds me of Geri Halliwell.<br />Okay, so many of the drawings can be construed as sexist.  The particular theme on that being girls who get their skirt lifted up by well handles, pipes, fence rails, ladders, and elevator doors, revealing two very shapely legs.<br />Equally interesting are paintings that were repaints of earlier work.  \\"In For A Tanning\\" featured a sitting nude girl holding her bikini with a black dog to her side.  \\"Dumb Pluck\\" featured the girl in the same pose, except she was wearing a candy-cane striped bathing suit and holding a shovel, the dog still on her left.<br />Some were risque even for their time and the more amusing ones are beach shots where the girls get into distress, such as having their beachware stolen by a dachsund (Taking Ways, 1950)  And his nudes were never full frontal, only seen from the rear or side, the sole exception being \\"Harem,\\" an undated painting of an innocent maiden captured by Arabs.<br />It's when looking at his work during the 1960's and 1970's, that yes, the models have changed with the times and despite having Elvgren's signature style, their hairstyle are with their times.<br />Other notes:  the paintings are clearly better than the real-live model replications hands and legs down.<br />So, my favorites?  That's a difficult one, as the models are oh so cute, but I'd have to settle for \\"Well Picked,\\" of a girl in yellow dress wading in a pool and picking up a lily flower, \\"Golden Beauty,\\" of a Diana Dors-lookalike, \\"Surprise Package,\\" where the girl wrapping the X-mas present is clearly the title object, and \\"Lazy Days,\\" of the girl lying leisurely on the summer grass.<br />Proof that too much of a good thing is better, and that too much cheesecake can be good for one and not be fattening.

Howe of the famous Howe-Stammers-Walker team painstakingly compiled this work to correspond to Doctor Who's 30th anniversary.<br />Basically, each section is divided by season and consists of a very brief summary of the stories within that season.  Also included in each section are newsclippings, photo stills from the Who stories, publicity or photo stills of actors, actors in costume, and full page illustrations for the Who novelizations.  Allstair Pearson has the lion's share of illustration, and that's because his gouache-style paintings rule.  The ones for Earthshock, Remembrance Of The Daleks, Silver Nemesis, and the two Troughton Dalek stories are my favorites.  Compare his drawings to those of Chris Achilleos.  Oh, and there are funny cartoons and promotional items such as the Sky-Ray popsicles seen in the More Than 30 Years documentary.<br />But remember, when journeying through the thirty years spanning the show's creation to the first few New Adventures, that we are actually travelling through history, time itself.  What is a chronology, if not a time machine in writing?  To illustrate, there's a Radio Times programme listing for An Unearthly Child, Who's first story, Jon Pertwee on the cover of the Radio Times, a 1978 news clipping introducing Mary Tamm as Romana, a 1980 press cutting of Tom Baker announcing his resignation as Dr. Who, the March 1987 obituary of Patrick Troughton, and a 6 October 1989 press cutting that hinted (accurately) at the show's departure.<br />Call this a book version of More Than 30 Years In The TARDIS, Timeframe is essential reading for Who fans.	2002-06-26

Although Mr. John Harrison has received stipends averaging 1,000 pounds throughout the rigorous course of inventing the said watches, I find it more fitting that the sum of 20,000 pounds be bestowed upon him by Board of Longitude.<br />I've had time to get the pertinent facts of the problem from Mr. Harrison, and the crux of the matter lies thence.  Lines of latitude run west/east, whereas longitude are the lines running north/south.  The difference are that lines of latitude are not consistent re their distance around the Earth, the longest of them being the Equator, designated as 0°.  Lines of longitude are equilinear in relation to one another.<br />There have been two studies of thought, that of the use of a maritime clock, and the lunar distance method, endorsed by astronomers such as Sir Edmund Halley and the current Astronomer Royal, the Reverend Nevil Maskelyne.  First, the method championed by Mr. Harrison.  There are two timepieces used by the captain--the ship's clock, set to home port time and the other a pocket watch which must &quot;not be allowed to run down during the voyage,&quot; and is set to local noon by observing the noonday sun.  Comparing the two times thus enables the captain to determine his geographic position at sea.<br />The lunar distance method, discovered by our John Hadley, involves calculating in distance between the moon and the stars in the evening sky.  The position of the moon within the stars is compared with a table, which contains the time such a position was observed at home port, and the time difference calculated.  The flaw with that approach is due to the effect overcast nights have on lunar and stellar observation.<br />My hat is off to Mr. Harrison himself, horologist extraordinaire, and the meticulous genius and the spirit of perfection that has gone into his quintet of timepieces.  Five years for H-1, four years for H-2, twenty for H-3, and a year or two apiece for H-4 and H-5:  if that does not embody scientific aptitude at its zenith, then may Sir Isaac roll in his grave for eternity!<br />His watches has no pendulums, nor the necessity of lubricating the parts with oil.  Pendulums functionally ideally in stationary environments, not aboard the constant pitching and moving of a ship at sea, where the clock's speed would slow, speed up, or stop altogether.  Harrison has used metals that are not only rust-proof, but by having metals that counterract any contraction or expansion, thereby maintaining a balance.<br />We have evidence that works in our favour, in particular, the performance of his fourth watch, H-4, as tested aboard the H.M.S. Deptford on November 1761.  After eighty-one days at sea, from London to Port Royal, Jamaica, results showed that the watch had lost only five seconds!  There was a violent storm on the return trip back to England, during which time the watch lost just under two minutes.<br />A recent test of his latest watch, named the H-5, was performed for the benefit of His Majesty, George the Third, who was suitably impressed with the results.  If His Majesty was impressed, so should the members of the Longitude Board.<br />In conclusion, John Harrison, with his efficient, durable, and portable timepiece, has given our kingdom mastery of the seas over other Europeans and the Barbary pirates.  We can now set an infinite variation of courses to avoid detection from our enemies.  Harrison is entitled to stand alongside the many who have made England great.<br />Yours etcetera<br />the Right Honorable D.J.H.ffect overcast nights have on lunar and stellar observation.<br />My hat is off to Mr. Harrison himself, horologist extraordinaire, and the meticulous genius and the spirit of perfection that has gone into his quintet of timepieces.

Huey and Riley's move to the white suburbia of Woodcrest may be hell on Earth to the two tykes, but it provides a lot of laughs for those of us reading the Boondocks.  Of course, without this crucial twist of fate, there wouldn't be a perfect set-up for Aaron McGruder to write such a funny and hip socio-political series.<br />Anyone who wants to deal with telemarketers, take Riley's cue!  I was laughing at how he tore into them.  And apparently they rate below the KKK.  And Star Wars-The Phantom Menace is rightfully skewered by Huey and the Psycho Star Wars guy.  As Huey said, it was racist, as it made unflattering cariacatures not only of African-Americans (Jar Jar) but also of Orientals (the Nimoydians) and Jews (Watto).<br />In term of which characters have the most laughs or are interesting, top honors go to Riley and Jazmine.  I cringe at the street names in Woodcrest and laud Riley for changing them to something more eyecatching, to say the least.  What's funnier is how his grandfather remembers all that when giving instructions to some lost white folks.  What's even funnier is who Riley gets in trouble with his street sign antics.  Now me, I'd probably change my street names so that anyone wanting to get to my house from Main (I mean Sir Paul McCartney Street) has to hook a left on David Bowie Avenue, another right on Kim Wilde Street, and left on Sarah Brightman Street, just before the post office.  I have to hook a right on Cradle Of Filth Drive to go to work, and then left on Sir Paul.<br />Riley also takes pride in rapper Nas Escobar to the point that he wants to be called Riley Escobar or Esco for short, and gives his teacher heck on that.  He also puts on the gangsta schtick in front of his class, clearly startling them.  What he and Huey have in common when they are forced to attend J. Edgar Hoover Elementary is that they're not thrilled to be there and won't take any nonsense.  However, he gets caught listening to Lauryn Hill, and that ruins his rep.  Well, somewhat.<br />Poor Jazmine is conflicted due to her interracial heritage and her hair, which despite all attempts becomes an Afro due to humidity.  Huey still has fun at her expense, calling her Mariah one time, as in Mariah Carey, and later sarcastically sympathisizing with her conflict by telling her, \\"I'm part black, part African, part Negro, and part colored.\\"  She's a sweet and tender person, however, and as her white mother says, it's up to her to find her own identity.  Huey, being black and proud,  clearly wants her to admit she's as black as Richard Roundtree.  Oh, FYI, Jazmine, RR was the original Shaft in three movies in the '70s.  Just thought you should know.<br />Other small character but amusing parts include the well-meaning but intimidated white teacher, Mr. Petto, and the old white lady whom Riley has a ball helping with her groceries.  And finally, I know what the Santa conspiracy is!  The anagram clue, sure, but the addition one, I would never have thought.  Good job, Huey!<br />I know, this first collection set the stage by introducing the main characters, but I later noticed how some of them played smaller roles with the coming of Michael Caesar, such as Jazmine and Cindy.  Pity, as Jaz and Cindy are needed for Huey to ridicule or be harassed by, respectively.<br />This is a funnier collection than Fresh For '01.  So don't anybody be talking smack about these homies or I be smacking you fools jus' for livin', knaaawmean?

This here review's fresh from the DJ Da Man, so don't you be dissin' this playa or the Boondocks, knaawmsayin?<br />Having read of Huey Freeman's antics on the FBI anti-terrorism hotline in The Nation magazine, I had to find out more, so I started out with Fresh For '01... You Suckas!  The fun and frolics in the day of removed Chicagoans Huey, Riley, their grandfather in the white suburb of Woodcrest, was a refreshing blast of new air for me.<br />In this collection, we are introduced to Michael Caesar, better known as Caesar, a Brooklynite in dreadlocks stranded in white suburbia.  In comparison to the perpetually angry and depressed revolutionary Huey and his younger brother Riley, who is \\"Mr. Thug Life,\\" Caesar seems to be the most normal, as he thinks Huey takes things too seriously at times, but is nevertheless drawn in to his friend's sense of purpose, which is to give more than just lip service to James Brown's \\"Say It Loud, I'm Black and Proud\\" anthem.  And he's the only one who can cut the obnoxious Riley down to size.<br />Seeing things from a black perspective is interesting and refreshing to say the least.  Huey rips on movies for not representing blacks properly.  I discern how he longs for more days when blacks were more militant, in the early 1970's.  He probably sees Shaft and Coffy as the epitomy of black pride.  For him, the revolution needs to start NOW!<br />The best antics involve Huey's grandfather getting a job as a census taker.  He delegates authority to Huey, but torn between his desire to stay true to his anti-establishment ways and helping his grandfather, delegates his assignment to Riley, who has a blast harassing whites.  Huey in turn ditches lawn cutting duty to go watch The Patriot with Caesar.<br />The mainstreaming of urban culture and language to make white people more hip is seen with Cindy, a cute white girl who sits behind Huey in school and is into Puff Daddy, Jay-Z, and ODB.  She means well, trying to connect with Huey in her interest in black pop culture while being clueless to his opposition to the mainstream.  She tries to impress him by humming theme songs to old school black shows and even does her spin on the \\"WHAZZUP?\\" commercial.  In the end, all she does is annoy Huey even more, but at least she's open to more black artists and pop culture, even if it is mainstream and corporately packaged.  Cindy's funnier than Eric Cartman doing Flavor-Flav in South Park.<br />This collection covers the early to late stages of the 2000 election.  I don't know the time period each collection spans, but I assume the next collection will deal with the 2000 election results and hopefully see Huey's calls to the FBI hotline, and brother, I can't wait for it to come out.  Keep'em coming, Mr. McGruder.  And to Huey, Caesar, Riley, and the rest of the gang, peace out, y'all.ans well, trying to connect with Huey in her interest in black pop culture while being clueless to his opposition to the mainstream.

Seeing what was one of 2001's refreshing alternatives to the cinema, i.e. Terry Zwigoff's adaptation of Daniel Clowes' Ghost World, was what prompted me to get the graphic novel that inspired the movie, and I was NOT disappointed, believe you me.<br />Most of the scenarios seen in the movie are in the book.  The garage sale, the lame comedian, the \\"Satanists,\\" the 50's diner with \\"Weird Al,\\" the prank call leading to the fake date, the note on Josh's door, etc.  Two of them involve different characters.  Enid's visit to the adult shop has Josh as her unwilling escort, while the recipient of the fake date was an unnamed character.  Seymour was the subsitute in the movie for both occasions.<br />The interactions between Enid and Rebecca are realistic and human, as the bored duo spend days looking for excitement.  Towards the end, their friendship gets frayed, as both have different visions of where they want to be, and the differences between them become pronounced and explored.  Rebecca wants to belong somewhere, but Enid isn't sure.<br />The humor here is more human and natural while being profane at times.  Certain characters add to the laughs, such as the obnoxious John Ellis, a right-leaning WASP who endorses controversial views and people, such as a ex-priest into child porn.  He might as well be a refined Eminem.  He constantly taunts Enid whenever they meet.  In one conversation, we learn poor Enid's last name--Coleslaw.  Enid:  \\"My Dad has his name changed legally!\\"  To which Ellis replies, \\"From what... three-bean salad?\\"  Now that's funny!  Another bit:  Enid:  \\"Look how hot we are... How come no boys ask us out on dates?\\"  In the next frame, she says \\"Maybe we should be lesbos!\\"  to which Rebecca says \\"Get away from me!\\"<br />Josh may be awkward and shy, but he is, as Enid tells him, \\"the last decent person on Earth.\\"  Both want to go out with him, but he is put off by Enid's sarcasm and he isn't sure about Rebecca.  When pressed on his political views, he says he endorses \\"policies opposed to stupidity and violence,... cruelty in any form, censorship...\\"  That makes two of us.<br />I've wondered this since I saw the movie, but does the bus stop where Norman finally gets his bus and where Enid goes, symbolizes hope?  There's no interaction with Norman in the book, but it's revealed that the bus line has been reopened, while there's no such information provided in the movie.  The novel doesn't change the symbolism of the bus stop.<br />Compare the book to the movie, which is different in some ways, but still explores the themes of alienation and growing up; see how perfect Thora Birch and Scarlet Johansson were in playing Enid and Rebecca.  Both are stunning.  Truly a rare gem of a comic.he says he endorses \\"policies opposed to stupidity and violence,... cruelty in any form, censorship...\\"  That makes two of us.<br />I've wondered this since I saw the movie, but does the bus stop where Norman finally gets his bus and where Enid goes, symbolizes hope?

The first attempt to chronologize the Doctor's adventures began in Jean-Marc Lofficier's Terrestrial Index.  It was a nice starting point, but with the coming of the New Adventures, i.e. the continuing adventures of the Seventh Doctor and Ace, and Missing Adventures, stories of the previous Doctors, well, fans learned a lot more of the Time Lord.  Lance Parkin, author of the NA Just War, and the MA Cold Fusion, has superceded Lofficier's chronology into a more expanded and enlightening work.<br />In addition to incorporating the NAs and MAs, he uses his own conjecture in various places, but those are few.  For example, in The Masque Of Mandragora, the Doctor says that it will return to Earth in five hundred years, 1992.  He assumes that if it did, it must have been defeated once more.  The text for the televised adventures is done in a normal font, the NA and MAs in bold, and his own conjecture in a slightly thicker bold-italic.  The footnotes after each event or story is explained in detail on the sides of each page.  It's easy for stories that explicitly state the date e.g. Silver Nemesis takes place on 23 November 1988, but what about stories like Delta And The Bannermen, which takes place in ?4287 AD?  Parkin gives arbitrary dates, but the interesting thing is, the last two digits are equal to the digits the show came out, 1987.  The Caves Of Androzani, which came out in 1984, is given a date of ?2884.<br />There are seven sections in the book:  Prehistory, Known History, Contemporary, the Near Future, which we're in right now, Colonisation, the Earth Empire, and the Far Future.  Although a history of the universe, there is clearly an Earth-bias especially in the Earth Empire section.  Yes, the Earth follows the model of the British Empire, from rise to collapse, as was mentioned in the TV story The Mutants.<br />There are explanations of the Great Old Ones, the powerful beings such as Fenric, the Animus, and the Great Intelligence, in the Prehistory section, as well as known astronomical theory such as the Big Bang and Galaxy formation hypothesis, and the variability of races that sprang up.<br />My favorite part is probably the period we're in right now in the book, with technological gluts, environmental disasters, shifts in the ozone layer, severe overpopulation, goth-apocalypse culture, and civil wars.  All this takes place 2001-2009, and I sometimes wonder that given the corporate mindset of industrial countries, if this science-fiction will become reality.<br />One peeve I have is the dating of the Patrick Troughton/Jon Pertwee era UNIT stories, a sore point between Who fans.  I belong to the faction that puts them the year or the year after the story came out on TV.  Others put them in the future.  Parkin merely dates those stories (1970's UNIT--&lt;story name&gt;).  I don't know about that.<br />This last New Adventure covered here is Happy Endings, where Bernice gets married to Jason, and the last Missing Adventure is Sands Of Time, the sequel to Pyramids Of Mars.  It's important to note that around the time this book came out, Virgin Publishing's rights were set to expire in May.  A handful more of New and Missing Adventures came out, too late to be incorporated into Parkin's book.  That also meant there could never be a second edition of the Universe book, also published by Virgin.<br />What I wonder is, now that BBC books has the rights to new Who stories, will they come out with their own Who universe guide, thereby invalidating Lance Parkin's painstakingly crafted work?  It would be a shame if it did.  Why not incorporate the New/Missing and the current new adventures in a future book?

(Well, that is present at the end of the book before they list the cast and crew credits for each story.)  But no, Adrian Rigelsford and artist Andrew Skilleter have created an exceptionally imaginative work.<br />The monsters explored here are the Zarbi and Menoptera, the Yeti, Ice Warriors, Autons, Sontarans, the Wirrn, Zygons, Sil, and a group of Earth Demons and supernatural monsters (e.g. The Fendhal, Malus, Fenric, etc.)<br />Those of us who have seen the extant stories of the Who canon know the plot, how the story ends, etc.  Rigelsford retells the story from different points of view, and in different formats.  For example, the Sontaran stories are retold from the point of view of Sontaran cadet Jago, who has accessed the military databank and reviews the stories of the commanders who encountered the Doctor.<br />Reading the Yeti stories found me wondering how the original stories went, since both no longer exist in the BBC archives.  The Abominable Snowman was a six-parter and with the point of view from Professor Travers' diary, it must have been an exceptional one.<br />The Earth Reptile and Auton stories are presented as classified UNIT files for eyes only, with paper clips drawn over photo stills from the two stories.  Well, \\"eyes only\\" includes us, but think about it from the point of view with the average John Bull.  How would he have heard of this from the local media?  The Loch Ness Monster in Terror Of The Zygons, for example, was explained as a hallucinogenic fungus being introduced into the water.<br />And who better than Olive Hawthorne, the white witch of Devil's End, to tell the stories of the Earth Demons in a book she wrote?  Rigelsford maintains Hawthorne's magic-leaning personality to a tee--remember how the Doctor and she sparred in the debate of science vs magic?<br />Andrew Skilleter's illustrations create various worlds and contribute to those alternate points of view.

David Banks, has furnished us Earthlings and those who feel they are actually aliens (such as myself), with a superior, highly detailed information on Cyber History and the BBC series that chronologically dramatized said history. Elaborate histories of programs, dealing with a certain aspect of it, can either border from the esoteric for adherents of the program or the way Banks does it, which is esoteric but fascinating.<br />The prelude to the chapter dealing with biomechanics, control-and-communication systems, artificial intelligence, and immunity from diseases are the roots of what inspired Gerry Davis and Kit Pedler to create the Cybermen and make interesting reading.<br />A prerequisite of the program is obviously needed, as in the case of the solar map, having Fendhal between Mars and Jupiter. The existence of Cassius, described in The Sunmakers, is not mentioned, unless it is the same as Penultima, the 13th planet. Beyond that is Planet 14, base of the Cybermen in The Invasion.<br />An added bonus is Gerry Davis' Cybermen origin story, Genesis Of The Cybermen. As it does not specify which Doctor, it could well be a future Doctor should the BBC come to their senses and do another series. The companion is named Felicity so either BBC will work around that or change the name, as long as it is a female companion.<br />The chronological order of stories matches that in The Terrestrial Index, although the variances between the proposed year stories without a definite date are minor. For example, this book proposes The Invasion took place in 1979, whereas TI puts it at 1970. In contrast, both the Discontinuity Guide and A History Of The Universe place Revenge Of The Cybermen as taking place after Attack Of The Cybermen. The Disco Guide places Tomb Of The Cybermen AFTER Attack, so go figure. Silver Nemesis was in production as this book was being written, but because it takes place in 1988, there's little debate the year of occurrence.<br />The various changes in Cybermen are also covered in technical detail, from the Mondasians to the streamlined \\"new-fashioned Cybermen\\" of Earthshock onward, what is called Cyberneomorphs. They are differentiated from their lookalike ancestors, the CyberFaction (The Invasion) and the Cybernomads (Revenge Of The Cybermen).<br />It was in this book that I first learned of the destruction of the majority of the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton stories of the 1970's. Because of this callous lack of program preservation, we will never see Episode 4 of The Tenth Planet, Episodes 1 and 3 of The Moonbase, Episodes 1,2,4, and 5 of The Wheel In Space, and Episodes 1 and 4 of The Invasion.<br />The cover art by David Banks, with superior artwork by Andrew Skilleter, has the Cyberleader holding his gun, standing in front of a metallic tunnel of varying colours. And there are lots of drawings and photographs, both black-and-white and colour, scattered throughout the book.<br />Conclusion: this book is EXCELLENT!The various changes in Cybermen are also covered in technical detail, from the Mondasians to the streamlined \\"new-fashioned Cybermen\\" of Earthshock onward, what is called Cyberneomorphs.

As someone who collected Dr. Who videos and novelizations, including the New Adventures, I'm familiar with Andrew Skilleter's work.  An entire book devoted to his Who stuff (well, most of it, anyway)?  Wow!<br />I never got any of the early calendars, of which material from the hit 1986 calendar is sampled.  No, my first step into Who came in 1988.  But the calendar art included is a treasure.  Sil, with his marsh minnows beside him is just adorable.  And check out the exploding Dalek from the 1986 calendar.  He is strong in rendering all Who-related subjects, nothing weak in ANY of them.  I must say that of the Doctors, he does Peter Davison and Sylvester McCoy the best.<br />Speaking of 1988, the shot of Tom Baker for the calendar that year includes a space-station shaped like a birthday cake for the 25th anniversary.  Well, that kind of fulfills Baker's suggestion of pulling out a cake for The Stones Of Blood, the 100th story in the series.<br />Of the Profile Print posters I bought, I hung the Cybermen and Sontaran ones in my dorm room at NMSU.<br />His portraits of each of the then-six Doctors in the Kevin Judd Collection are masterpieces.  Love that celery to the right of Peter Davison.  Gouache is his preferred medium and perhaps it's because it's the same medium used by Olivia de Berardinis that I took to the art on the videos and books.<br />Now here's the trick.  I'd bought the two books he'd done before I bought Blacklight, and that was The Cybermen with David Banks and The Monsters with Adrian Rigelsford.  That cover of the Cybermen book is simply awesome!  It didn't sink in until I bought Blacklight that that guy who drew the art in those books was Andrew Skilleter.  Sure, his name was written on the books' spines but I was too absorbed in the text to find out.  Now though, I have a special appreciation for the artwork.<br />In closing, I've no beef against the designs of the video releases since the E-Space Trilogy, but to me, part of owning a Doctor Who video collection is Andrew Skilleter's rich and imaginative cover art.  Check out Blacklight and see what you're missing.ho video collection is Andrew Skilleter's rich and imaginative cover art.  Check out Blacklight and see what you're missing.	2002-03-25

It's a must-have for any Who fan, I'll tell you.<br />Be it for muscle for the elderly Doctors or lovely babes for all of them, the companions played a huge part in the sci-fi series. Fans of the series could discuss who was their favourite companion in addition to favourite Doctor, season, story, etc.<br />Here's my take on some aspects of companions that readers of this review who already have this book may have formulated for themselves. The long-time companions are the ones who'll be remembered the most, and they are normally associated with a single Doctor. These are Ian and Barbara (1st Doctor), Jamie (2nd Doctor), The Brigadier and Jo Grant (3rd Doctor), Sarah Jane (4th Doctor), Tegan (5th Doctor), Peri (6th Doctor), and Ace (7th Doctor). The Brigadier is a remarkable exception in that he later became a recurring companion from Mawdryn Undead.<br />Some of them served as transition companions, spanning Doctors, or serving for a short time. As a result, their tenure was either short or insignificant in terms of the series. Dodo and Steven (1st Doctor), Harry (4th Doctor), Liz (3rd Doctor), and Mel (6th and 7th Doctors) were examples. Others had very short fates or in the case of the third one on this list, due to a quirk of fate:  Katarina and Sarah Kingdom (1st Doctor), and Kamelion (5th Doctor).<br />The other thing one learns about the book was how the BBC dispensed with companions. Jackie Lane (Dodo), Peter Purves (Steven), and Michael Craze (Ben), for example, were just told, \\"We don't need you anymore. This will be your last episode,\\" and they had no say in the matter. That's one of the things I hate about the BBC--they seem to treat their actors callously, like disposable razors. After a few shaves, toss them in a waste basket. It seems that the best way to leave is to plan to leave and tell the Beeb so it won't be such a big deal. William Russell (Ian), Jacqueline Hill (Barbara), Anneke Wills (Polly), and Katy Manning (Jo) did this.<br />Many suffered because their characters didn't develop overtime, which is too bad, because they were likable and could've been kept on. Nyssa is the prime example of this, but maybe it's because I'm biased in her favour. This may also be because three in the TARDIS may have resulted in one of them not getting a fair share of lines. One or two is an ideal number of companions per TARDIS.<br />The colour pictures of the ladies are quite a pleasure, especially Katy Manning (Jo) with the Dalek, Deborah Watling (Victoria) and Nicola Bryant (Peri) in their bikinis.<br />Another feature is the TARDIS log statistics for each companion, listing their origin, likes, dislikes, reasons for joining the Doctor, and for the women, scream factor. Victoria, Jo, and Sarah Jane scored high on that last.<br />So, who are my all-time favorite companions? Jo Grant, the Brigadier, Nyssa, Romana I, Sergeant Benton, Ian, Barbara, Liz, Melanie, and Ace, in that order. In presenting this compendium on the Doctor's companions, Howe and Stammers do a job that's bang-on.<br />P.S. I wonder if the clumsy schmerd who gave the Australian Tegan a last name that was a Yugoslavian first name is still doing his penance.ay to leave is to plan to leave and tell the Beeb so it won't be such a big deal.

Review of Candide published in the Dialogike Society Journal by Daniel De-L'amlow, philosophe extraordinaire, February 1760<br />Upon reading Monsieur Voltaire's short novel Candide, I thought, \\"My lack of God, has he shed his wings of logical investigation?\\"  He has strayed from the pleasures of that path, due to the fact that he has failed to take into account the unpredictability and fallibility of man in a not-yet fully rationalized world.  Emotion has surpassed logic as the driving force in his novel.<br />As for Candide, Aristotle would have placed him as one driven by moral virtue.  He is a blank slate upon which is later written the words of his professor, Pangloss.  He also shares the quality of Dante in the Divine Comedy in that he is afflicted with fainting whenever experiencing something that his fragile psyche cannot take.  In Chapter 4, he faints twice in a row, once when hearing of the death of the object of his affection, Cun&eacute;gonde, and of the barbarities committed on the civilian populations by both Bulgars and Abars.  There is no mistaking Candide for a book; books have spines.<br />My favorite character is the scholar Martin, who accompanies the hero from South America back to Europe.  Here, we can recognize Voltaire the realist, or, for those who feed deeply in the trough of idealists, a cynic.  He is the symbiotic link between two extremes, the idealistic Candide and the hyper-rational Pangloss.  We are further told that Martin is a Manichean, with a dualistic view implying a balance worked out by God and the Devil.  Like Pangloss, he is a rational, curious and calm, a realist.<br />In Chapter 21, there is a discussion between Candide and Martin on the innate predatory nature of man, akin to hawks whenever they see pigeons.  Candide tries to differentiate this by humans having free will, but frustratingly, Voltaire cuts off to \\"As they were theorizing, they arrived in Bordeaux.\\"  This quick cut annoyed me to no end, as I was anticipating an interesting discussion between the \\"young\\" and \\"old\\" Voltaire.<br />Martin has the best line after he and Candide visit Voltaire's dark side, Poconcurate, a bored nobleman who has accumulated knowledge for the sake of collecting and not learning.  The scholar denounces Poconcurate's choleric attitude by quoting Plato:  \\"the best stomachs are not those which refuse all food.\\"<br />The other character for whom I have a liking to is the Anabaptist Jacques, who appears only in Chapter 4 and is killed off in the subsequent chapter.  Where Pangloss says that the evils of the world in the end serve the common good, Jacques hinges his point on how God did not give them anything destructive, such as cannons or bayonets, yet man developed them to slaughter each other.  Indeed, man should concentrate on expanding one's intellectual horizons instead of butchering each other.<br />In his misadventures throughout the globe, Candide finds the utopian, primitive, non-European society of El Dorado.  Is Monsieur Voltaire trying to say that Europeans, at the height of sophistication and intelligence, are nothing compared to this underdeveloped society?  It would appear so, as the king of El Dorado expresses his puzzlement of the white man's addiction to \\"our yellow mud.\\"<br />To give credit to Candide, he strives for Pangloss' utilitarian viewpoint, but the turning point comes when he and Cacambo leave El Dorado and meets the maimed slave in Suriname.  So horrified is he with the Negro's plight that he renounces Pangloss' optimism, which he describes as \\"a mania for insisting that all is well when one is suffering.\\"<br />By tale's end, Candide has gone from being an idealist to an industrious and careful guardian.  He has given up theorizing in exchange for tending his garden, by doing the best one can.  I have no quarrel with this proposal if it were not for the religious implications, a clear reference to the fall of Adam and Eve from Eden.  Candide has stooped to religion, an opiate of comfort for those who desire security.  His master Pangloss provides his best words at the end, speaking of the chain of interconnected events that led from point A to B.  Candide's feeble answer?  \\"That is well said, but we must tend our garden.\\"  That is as deplorable as the easy road taken by Socrates, who, after discussing in length the root of virtue in the Euthyphro, declares that virtue must be God-given.<br />Do not mistake me, mes amis.  Voltaire's work does have a few sanguine points, but he seems to forget that the world, the universe, itself embodies mechanistic perfection.<br />Monsieur Voltaire may think he is being funny, but with a few exceptions, he has the wit of a dull nail.  I will credit him in describing the sex between Pangloss and Paquette as giving her \\"an experiment in physics\\" in the bushes, and the analogical reference Cacambo gives to Candide when he shoots the monkeys.  Cacambo tells him that these monkeys are a quarter human in the same way that he is a quarter Spanish.  I see this as a direct reference to the percentage of ignorant laypersons in our society in contrast to we fully human philosphes.<br />What is plainly clear is seeing the romantic-turned-philosophe-turned realist towards the end of his career.  In short, I do not totally dismiss it, but Monsieur Voltaire does not know which side his croissant is buttered on.  Candide can be summed up as Voltaire having a disillusioned existence and has decided to write a novel about it.<br />Fin.of comfort for those who desire security.

When I first flipped through this book at an Albuquerque bookstore in November 1996, I was shocked to learn that Jon Pertwee, my favorite Doctor Who, had died back in May, twelve days after he had finished his memoirs.<br />I finally got the book a year later and it was a treasure trove.  One learns a lot more about Jon Pertwee behind the role of the Time Lord.  He's a man overflowing with anecdotes and he has at least one for every Doctor Who story he made.  My favorite one is when director Lennie Mayne, a colourful Australian who constantly swore a blue streak, told him and the cast of The Curse Of Peladon to react with more feeling at a monster.  Instead of \\"oohing and ahhing like a bunch of fairies,\\" they were to say, \\"&lt;Expletive> me, will you &lt;expletive>ing well look at that?\\"  Well, they did just that at a rehearsal.  Unbeknownst to them, producer Barry Letts had invited a priest friend of his to watch, so needless to say...  Another is his remembrance of working with The Time Warrior's director, Alan Bromly, in a play back in the 1930's.<br />He sure knew a lot of people.  Most of them liked him, there were a few who didn't care for him or his acting technique (e.g. Nina Thomas, Anthony Ainley), but even so, he never hated them back.  He was fond of people.  Many that he knew died young, such as directors Douglas Camfield and Lennie Mayne, actors Neil McCarthy and Duncan Lamont, and his good friend Roger Delgado (the Master).<br />The rapport he had with Patrick Troughton was interesting, in particular the anecdote of how the two of them went places where they were given free gifts, much to Troughton's delight.  He himself was shy, but so was Troughton, and he helped his predecessor overcome his shyness and enjoy public appearances.  Given that Troughton died of a heart attack during a Who convention still in his Who costume, Pertwee's help was invaluable.<br />What really made the Pertwee years work was the team and the rapport they had.  There was Jon, of course, then the UNIT family of Nicholas Courtney, Katy Manning, Richard Franklin, and John Levene, and on and off, Roger Delgado.  Producer Barry Letts and Script Editor Terrance Dicks rounded things off.  The Daemons is a perfect example of that camaraderie.  The end came when first Roger Delgado died and Katy Manning left.  With the news that Letts and Dicks were moving on, it was a good time for Jon Pertwee to leave.  He played the Doctor for five seasons, second to Tom Baker's record seven, so that wasn't bad.<br /> Other things:  his hobby of nurgling, i.e. taking stuff from abandoned houses, which extended to props from Who, such as the polystyrene statue of Bok, made him quite a pack rat.  His practice of giving his fellow actors notes on anything they felt they could improve during rehearsals, etc. all for the sake of improvement, is actually a useful idea.  I thought that the melody of the lullaby he used in The Curse Of Peladon was familiar until I read that it was \\"God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen.\\"  Well, duh!  I should've known that!  He liked the action that arose from the earthbound UNIT stories.  Me too.<br />Jon Pertwee's final memoir reveals an actor who enjoyed what he did, whether it was the Navy Lark, Doctor Who, or Worzel Gummidge.  Heck, he enjoyed life itself.  Like Troughton, he died as Doctor Who, in spirit if not in costume.  The last sentence of his book is poignant:  \\"I don't want to rust away.  I want to fade away.  Like the TARDIS.  But not just yet.\\"  Below, he signs his name with \\"Who?\\"  Under that is printed 7 July 1919-20 May 1996.

It's okay if one is the audience witnessing those schemes, but quite another if one is on the receiving end, e.g. the Musk and Tallow scents.<br />The action jets back and forth to Guy and his two aunts the fuzzy-brained Esther and the pert and serious Agnes, and a history of his antics, which is of course the core of the story.<br />As for the interludes with the aunts and Ginger Horton, the rational Guy, who doesn't seem to miss much, tries to remain aloof, saying the right words in an off-handed way, and really speaking when the subject turns towards anything relating to business.<br />The dog show involving the panther, the theatre where Guy shows a cheap foreign film instead of a musical, then reshowing the cheap film upside down, violating copyright laws by making his own film inserts in Mrs. Miniver and The Best Years Of Our Lives, the pygmy who became CEO of an accounting firm, and of course, the chaos that takes place aboard the Magic Christian vessel.<br />The Do-It-Yourself books are something that might actually catch on, assuming there isn't already something like that out on the market.  Purists might cringe but that only proves the follies of being a hardcore devotee.  The conventionally wise response is, &quot;Hey, it's only a book,&quot; or &quot;it's only a movie...&quot; etc.<br />The healthy satire of the media that Guy promotes, where actors walk off the set after spouting off words saying &quot;I pity the moron whose life is so empty he would look at this&quot; could be used today.  I don't watch any contemporary American TV programs and when I see previews or commercial spots for them, that's what I feel, to use the line from All Our Yesterdays:  &quot;Anyone who would allow this slobbering pomp and drivel to his home has less sense and taste than the beasts of the field!&quot;<br />The humdrum of life should be interrupted by some of Grand's schemes.  Smashing crackers on the sidewalk with a sledge, now that's something anyone can do, with a borrowed helmet and overalls.
