I have absolutely no interest in Manhattan intellectual life in the 40s &50s, no interest in poetry, & no interest in T.S. Eliot whom I consider a pompous depressing wannabe-Englishman.  Yeah, OK, I have no appreciation for poetry.  I admit it.  But having said that, I really enjoyed this book.  The characters were interesting.  They were real people you could care about. The plot was clever & had an element of mystery that kept me turning the pages. A good read even if you're not a literary buff.	2005-09-15

The plot was good (I wasn't bothered by the coincidences, as some reviewers were)& some of the characterizations were good.  I liked Dosie; I loved Rex; I liked Harro; Josh, the hero, I'm still not sure about. But there were some weak features as well.  The islanders, with few exceptions, are just too quaint & too eccentric to be real. Everyone (again with few exceptions) seems to have a goofy nickname.  Some reviewers thought this was cute.  I thought it was annoying.  And the crew of the Maudie Jane??? Are these guys really in the US Coast Guard? Was there ever such a naive clueless crew?  They moan about extra drills, seemingly oblivious of the fact that the Japanese have just bombed Pearl Harbor.  They are portrayed as such dumb (but lovable, to be sure) hicks that they make Gomer Pyle look smart.  Overall assessment: just so-so.  I may try the the next volume.  Then again, I may not.	2005-08-07

His best books are those that take place during WW2; that's when he's at his best.  The others vary greatly.  I didn't care for \\"Man from St. Petersburg\\" -- good plot but awful characters -- but this one takes the cake.  I see that many reviewers liked it, but I found the plot boring and<BR>the pace slow -- I skipped over all the descriptions of life in Afghanistan, as well as all the scenes of Jane bonding with her baby.  The main problem for me, though, was the characters.  If I don't like the main characters I don't care what happens to them.  Jean Pierre was fine as an evil Commie villain, but I just couldn't warm up to Ellis & Jane as the hero & heroine.  Call me old-fashioned but I like my protagonists to be a little more on the straight & narrow than these two.  As for the much-vaunted sex scene -- I know some reviewers found it erotic, but I found it just plain vulgar, including the language used to describe it!  It's one thing to put dirty words in the mouth of a character, but for the omniscient narrator to use them as descriptons was too much.  If you're new to Follett, go to the WW2 novels instead.	2004-06-27

I hate to rain on the parade of all these glowing reviews, but this book is a product of shoddy, lazy, amateurish research.  A full 59% of the footnotes are based on secondary sources, & a full 25% of those are from one source alone which the author himself admits is unreliable.  The section on Aaron Burr's mother is based on a \\"source\\" well-known for decades to be [untrue].  The discussion of Burr as a \\"slave-owner\\" is totally misleading, based on assumptions for which there is no evidence, & completely overlooks Burr's well known anti-slavery record.  I could go on & on, but you get the picture.  The book is full of factual errors, misleading assumptions, & faulty logic.  Theodosia Burr Alston needs a good biography, but this isn't it.	2004-05-07

But I agree with a number of the criticisms voiced already.  I didn't like the main character Jeannie & I didn't like the gratuitous political moralizing where all the bad guys were conservatives.  If you want to make your bad guys evil for their attempts at genetic manipulation & white supremacist rantings, fine, but don't throw in that they're against gun control & against welfare!  And, Jeannie, I just couldn't warm up to.  I know Follett likes his heroines feisty, which is fine, but Jeannie was just too counter-cultural for me.  The swearing, the free & easy sex life, the \\"smoking a little weed,\\" and, ugh, the nose ring.  Is that really necessary?  I also agree that Follett's presentation of academic life is unrealistic.  (I am an academic.)  Follett's books with a World War II theme are much  better.	2004-02-15

I enjoyed this book more than I expected to.  It has an exciting, intriguing plot & interesting characters.  Yes, there are some boring spurts of techno-jargon (but not nearly as much as in some contemporary military thrillers) but I just skipped over those.  It's the characters & the plot that drive this book (which is as it should be).  I especially enjoyed North's rather daring move of making himself a character in his own novel.  Not many authors would have the moxie to do that -- but it worked.  I also liked the Christian sub-theme which I thought was very well done & seemed natural as part of the plot.  So many Christian novels are too didactic & preachy.  In this one, the characters' conversions seem like a natural development of their own personalities & the plot.  A Christian-military novel is a narrow niche, but this novel is far far superior to another example I just read -- or, rather, tried to read -- it was so awful I gave up quickly.  I refer to Mel Odom's \\"Apocalypse Dawn\\" -- a real turkey!  If this is Ollie's literary revenge on his adversaries, that makes it even more of a fun read.  I can't wait to read the sequel!	2004-01-17

This, along with Jackdaws, I think are my two favorites of Follett's.  I can't comment on either the realism of the earthquake scenario or the realism of the FBI office, but only experts will nitpick at that anyway.  This was an exciting page turner with interesting characters &amp; especially a villain you love to hate -- the evil psychopathic old hippie, Ricky aka Priest.  If you are a Follett fan, definitely give this one a chance.	2003-12-27

But Odom isn't up to either of those gentlemen's ability (not that I consider either of them great writers!).  The main problem with so-called Christian novels is that they are too preachy &amp; the characters &amp; plot development take 2d place to getting out the message.  This book illustrates those fault lines.  The characters are one-dimensional stereotypes.  Endless descriptions of military hardware &amp; use of military jargon are no substitute for a strong plot and interesting characters.  I gave up without finishing the book because the characters weren't interesting &amp; I didn't care what happened to them.  This book is a loser.  Affirmative!	2003-12-21

I liked it, too, but do not think it is Crombie's best.  The murder mystery angle was good &amp; I was kept guessing right up to the end.  But the supernatural elements just didn't work for me.  Too much suspension of disbelief is required from readers who expect to see the detectives do some hard-nosed detecting.  Also, too many characters are introduced right at the beginning.  This is a characteristic of her more recent books.  It's hard to keep them all straight until the plot actually begins to unfold.

This was a disappointment, though.  At first it seemed like nothing more than a historical novel bodice-buster, but then the plot did pick up.  The main problem, though, was the character of Feliks.  Follett wants to make him at least a little sympathetic, maybe a lot, but it didn't work for me.  Feliks is a big, smelly, dirty, cruel, ruthless, coldblooded Communist assassin.  The fact that he's good in the sack & glib with words does not compensate for his evil.  And can Charlotte really be that stupid?  Oh, well.  They can't all be winners.	2003-11-27

This book is in some respects interesting, but suffers from two major flaws, one methodological &amp; one theological.  Diana Eck is a professor of religion at Harvard.  Her thesis is that America not only is a highly pluralistic country in terms of religion, but that this is a good thing &amp; should be celebrated rather than deplored. The two flaws: the first is that the evidence, such as it is, for her thesis is purely anecdotal.  Eck has traveled all over the country, visited many shrines, temples, mosques, etc. &amp; attended numerous festivals &amp; religious conferences of every conceivable descriptiion.  She met hundreds of lovely people whom you would be happy to have for your neighbors.  But that's the problem -- everyone &amp; every religion is too lovely.  All are benign.  No one dislikes let alone hates America.  Not only are they lovely; they're all patriotic &amp; thrilled to be here.  She never acknowledges the existence of anti-Americanism, anti-westernism, anti-Christianity, or anti-Judaism, let alone analyses how to respond to these attitudes.  All immigrants &amp; all religions to her are, by definition, wonderful, &amp; should be unquestioingly welcomed to our shores.  Even her addendum to the paperback edition, written after 9/11, refuses to acknowledge any problems.  The second flaw in her argument is that from a theological viewpoint -- &amp; she does identify herself as a Christian, albeit a very liberal one to be sure -- she refuses to acknowledge, let alone grapple with, the concept that all these conflicting truth claims cannot possibly be true.  Eck never met a religion she didn't like or a practice she disapproves of.  There's no judgment here at all -- not even common sense.  While she (rightly) approves of freedom of religion in the civil sphere, she confuses this with assessment of truth claims in the theological sphere, &amp; seems to suggest that all religions are equally valid.  That view in itself is a particular theological stance, but she never identifies it as such but implies that it is an unquestioned given &amp; that, consequently, we should all not just accept, but celebrate, all religions whatsoever.  In short, an example of pluralism gone berserk.	2003-01-08

However, even though I enjoyed this novel I had some serious problems with the covenant theme &amp; Jerry's character.  I though it raised some very problematic questions about a Christian's duty.  Every review I read on this site was effusive with praise for this book.  Didn't any of you have a question about the way this covenant theme was played out?  Frankly, I cannot agree with Jerry's outlook even though I can sympathize with it.  The author tiptoes around the difficult questions she herself has brought up as part of the plot.  Despite some erratic behavior, Jerry is portrayed as basically a good guy, but where are the Christians who would bring up other considerations.  What loyalty does one owe to a maniac who is a danger to society &amp; to one's own family?  How can it be Christian to facilitate the escape of such a person out of a sincere but misguided notion of covenant-keeping?  What would ultimately be for Frank's own good?  To let him go on killing &amp; ultimately destroy himself &amp; innocent people?  Sorry, but I can't accept that.  There's some very faulty theology here.	2002-11-02

There is way too much description &amp; not enough conversation.  Contrary to what several reviewers said, I found the character development weak to nonexistent.  There were some interesting characters &amp; I would have liked to know more about them, but the characters took second place to endless descriptions of the weather &amp; damage reports.

This book has gotten good reviews in this forum, but I'd like to offer a dissenting viewpoint.  This book may have a &quot;lively&quot; style but it is poorly researched.  It appears as though the author did no research in archives.  The material has all appeared elsewhere.  The bulk of the book is based on secondary sources.  Fully 85% of the footnotes are from secondary sources.  Some quotations are rendered with no footnotes at all.  The footnotes aren't even consistent in their form.

There is a huge market for books like this, &amp; Morris is very popular, so maybe I'm in the minority, but I thought this book was dreadful.  The writing style is corny, the characters are cardboard stereotypes.  The  portrayal of the Hanoverian monarchs, George II &amp; George III, is wildly  inaccurate &amp; unfair.  They are portrayed as physically ugly &amp;  morally evil.  How ridiculous!  Morris has repeated every canard ever  mentioned about G.III without bothering to do any research to see if they  are accurate.  George III was a Christian monarch, a man with high moral  standards, who did the best he could for his nation, &amp; in any event had  no power to do anything to the American colonies.
