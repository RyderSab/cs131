She was abused in one of the most undiscussed ways a child can be violated. Julie was the victim of her mother's mental illness. Her mother suffered from Munchausen By Proxy Syndrome. Julie's mother, Sandy, would feed 3-year-old Julie books of matches and tell her they were lollipops. She would give Julie pills that caused blinding migraines, all the while, taking Julie from doctor to doctor insisting Julie was seriously ill. At the height of her illness, Sandy was trying to have open-heart surgery performed on 12-year-old Julie. And when Julie tried to tell a nurse and her school friends what was happening, no one believed her.<br /><br />Julie and her brother also endured physical abuse. They were beaten and Julie was constantly starved to make her appear ill. \\"Sickened\\" is Julie's heartbreaking, but uplifting story.<br /><br />I was appauled and horrified by the treatment that Julie suffered. I cannot imagine what it must have been like to live with the knowledge that there was nothing wrong with you, but you  were at the whim of a deranged mother. This book was an amazing tale of courage and spirit. If you are an abuse survivor, this book will be very hard to read, but it is definitely worth it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this work.	2005-10-01

The tales that Tan tells cover all of the subjects that make a novel juicy: love, death, illness, war, murder, rock bands, and a quirky family. Only these tales aren't fiction, they are parts of Tan's own life. Tan also shares some insight into the life of a writer and publishes several speeches she has given over the years.<br /><br />\\"The Opposite of Fate\\" is a wonderful collection of short recollections. If you are expecting a coherent story out of this book, then you will be disappointed. While the recollections are grouped together by Tan, it is not a continuous narrative. Do not let this point deter you from reading this book. It was truly excellent. Tan is funny and honest. She bares a portion of herself that her readers have seen peeking at them from her works for years.<br /><br />If you are in the mood for something a bit different, but completely wonderful, definitely pick up a copy of this book!	2005-10-01

The narrator, Humbert Humbert, is an unusual man, which Humbert freely admits. Humbert is attracted to young girls, but not all of them. He is only interested in the ones that he qualifies as \\"nymphs.\\" Nymphs are young girls, ages 9-14, that have a lusty quality about them in Humbert's estimation. Much to his satisfaction, the daughter of his landlady, a 12-year-old girl named Dolores Haze, is a nymph. After the death of her mother, Humbert takes young Dolores on a cross-country trip, which is the front for the affair they carry on. Eventually, Dolores runs away from Humbert and into the arms of another man, leaving Humbert alone.<br /><br />I think \\"Lolita\\" is an amazing and haunting work. Nabokov was extremely daring to produce such a work. I am not entirely sure this book would be as well regarded if it had just been published, as opposed to the original publication date in the 1950s. No matter how endeared a reader is with the charming narrator, the fact that Humbert Humbert is a pedophile cannot be denied. I have read many reviews of this novel where the reader attempts to excuse Humbert's behavior with Lolita's willingness to participate. I do not see the story unfolding in that manner at all, nor does it excuse an adult man having a sexual relationship with a child.<br /><br />However deplorable Humbert's actions, it is hard not to like him. Nabokov crafts his narrator to be charming, witty, and extremely punny. The reader would have to actively attempt to dislike Humbert in order to not fall under his spell. Nabokov should be especially praised for the puns and running themes, such as the continual references to Edgar Allen Poe's poem \\"Annabelle Lee.\\" The story is so intricate and layered that I was awed by Nabokov's talent.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel. If for no other reason, read it so you can say you have.	2005-10-01

She is quite unhappy with her life. Her husband, a nice guy but not very affectionate, is an actor. Louise wanted to be an actress herself; instead she is a ticket clerk at the local theater. Louise begins to throw herself into fashion to cope with her miserable life. She finds a musty book in a second hand store on how to dress with elegance. Louise takes the words to heart and soon has a new lease on life. Unfortunately, she lost her husband in the process. But with the help of her two new roommates, Louise sets out to find love in high style.<br /><br />The description of this novel was so charming, I had to read it. Louise is a transplanted American living in England who throws her life into upheaval on the advice of an ancient book. It was too splendid. Overall, the novel was quite good and I would recommend it to others. However, my disappointment lay in the latter half of the novel. The first half was incredibly strong and I thought that this book would not be another predictable installment in the Chick Lit genre. But sadly, the last half of the novel did just that. It was all too tidy and tied up in nice packages.<br /><br />If you are looking for a breath of fresh air in the stale climate of Chick Lit, this is not the book for you.	2005-09-18

Griet, the 16-year-old girl in the painting, is a maid in the Vermeer household. Her father was a dutch tile painter who was blinded when his kiln exploded in front of him. In order to feed her family, Griet becomes a maid in the Vermeer house. From the moment young Griet meets the mysterious painter, there is a connection between them; a connection of veiled sensuality and vague longing. A wealthy client of Vermeer's is equally taken with Griet and demands that Vermeer paint her. Resistant at first, Vermeer finally paints Griet in a fashion he had never done before. However, this simple role of model threatens to ruin Griet forever.<br /><br />Tracy Chevalier did a tremendous job with this novel. It was captivating and beautiful, intelligent and entertaining. It was not a terribly deep work, but that is just fine. The reader does feel a strong connection to the narrator, Griet, and her struggle with family, sexuality, and her place in the world of 1664.  Chevalier draws in the reader with her beautiful details and rich setting. This is an elegant and intriguing novel that I highly recommend.	2005-09-17

In \\"The Beach House\\" handsome 21-year-old Peter Mullen appears to be adored by all. But when his body washes up on the shore, it's obvious not everyone did adore Peter. His older brother Jack, a law student, is shocked when officials try to deem his brother's death a drowning, when the autopsy photos show that Peter sustained a brutal beating and his neck was broken. Jack thinks he might know who is responsible for Peter's death, the rich and powerful Barry Neubauer and his wife Campion. What Jack isn't sure about is motive. Why would anyone want Peter dead?<br /><br />This novel was downright painful to read. I am an avid reader of Patterson's and most of the time I thoroughly enjoy his work. However, this book just plain sucked. The plot was ridiculous and stupid. The main character Jack had absolutely no depth and I wasn't even sure I liked him. There was an overarching macho motif throughout the entire novel which was really offputting to me, as a woman. There was also little explanation as to why some of the events transpired.<br /><br />As much as I like James Patterson and his work, I would have to say stay far, far away from this horrible novel.	2005-09-06

Audrey Niffenegger's \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is the tale of Henry and Clare DeTamble. Henry is a librarian from Chicago and a Chronologically Displaced Person. What's that mean? Henry can time travel. He has no real control over it and cannot take anything through time with him, except knowledge. Clare is his beautiful and talented wife, who is an artist. Clare has known Henry since she was 6. Henry didn't meet Clare until he was 28. And that sort of paradox is the beauty that is \\"The Time Traveler's Wife.\\"<br /><br />This book had been on my shelf for months. I picked it up once before and then put it back down. It is a huge book and I felt a little apprehension about starting it. If I had known what a glorious tale was waiting for me between those covers, I would have begun reading the novel the second I purchased it. Niffenegger's crafting of Henry and Clare as characters is fantastic. They have depth and flaws and are larger than life but terrible average. Over the course of the novel, I completely fell in love with these characters and with Henry's often disjointed time travelling. I wept at the end of the book, not only for it's poignant ending, but because my interaction with the characters was over.<br /><br />This novel is a moving and touching tale of love that endures time, absence, and defies logic. I highly recommend it.	2005-09-05

Jordan is a famous photojournalist who is in Hong Kong working on a  photo book she is publishing. Trying to de-stress from the horrors she has viewed through the lens of her camera, Jordan decides to take advantage of Hong Kong's cultural side and pops in to the art museum while she is there. Jordan begins to notice that people are staring at her, not because they recognize her for who she is, but for some other reason she cannot put her finger on. As Jordan strolls through the museum, she comes upon a collection of paintings known as The Sleeping Woman. Jordan learns that The Sleeping Women are pictures of nude women who were thought to be sleeping, but actually appear to be dead. Jordan is further shocked when she stares into one of the canvases and sees her own face. Jordan's twin sister Jane has been missing for over a year and Jordan fears that she has stumbled upon her sister's fate in the museum. Now, Jordan must find out who is painting the infamous pictures and what exactly happened to her sister.<br /><br />This novel had tremendous potential and I can definitely say that I did enjoy it. However, the first half of the novel, which was very exciting and suspenseful, couldn't balance out the latter portion which was dry and predictable. I kept waiting for the \\"big twist\\" which never came through, which was really disappointing and made the ending anti-climactic. Plus, there was a tangent side-story running throughout about Vietnam that ended up being nothing more than a tangent. I think with a little more effort, this could have been an excellent thriller, instead of a mediocre one.	2005-09-05

I refused to read anymore of her work. But I was bored and this novel was on sale, so I picked it up figuring it would at least pass the time. I didn't expect too much, but I was pleasantly surprised. Harrison finally managed to put a story together that wasn't so far out there that I couldn't stay interested or so boring I couldn't stay in there. Harrison constructed a solid story that kept me engaged.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up the next installment in this series.	2005-08-19

I would have given it a higher rating if the ending had not been so predictable. There was great character definition, a solid plot, and a beautiful and mysterious landscape as the backdrop. The only problem with this novel was that I found it to be extremely obvious who the \\"bad guy\\" was, which made the ending disappointing and anti-climactic.<br /><br />I will definitely be checking out further works by this author.	2005-08-14

I adored the novel. However, I went into \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" with an open mind and hoped for the best. I didn't even read reviews about the books, so as to remain open-minded. I was so horribly disappointed with this novel. It wasn't interesting or compelling in the slightest. I couldn't relate to Jessie, no matter how I tried. And I found the ending of the novel, the big revelation about Jessie's father, to be so unbelievably contrived that I wished I had never read this book to begin with.<br /><br />I am certainly glad I did not purchase this novel.

Her mother died when she was 4 and she is being raised by her extremely emotionally distant father. Rosaleen, her African-American caretaker/nanny, is the closest thing Lily has to a caring parent.  When Rosaleen attempts to register to vote, local rednecks beat Rosaleen in front of Lily. The police send Lily back to her father and Rosaleen is taken to the hospital. Lily knows that much worse could happen to Rosaleen, so she packs a bag with the few mementos she has of her mother, and breaks Rosaleen out of the county hospital. The two women flee and head towards Tiburon, South Carolina, the cryptic message scrolled on the back of a card belong to Lily's mother.<br /><br />In Tiburon, Lily and Rosaleen are introduced to 3 sisters who are beekeepers. Lily learns about the craft of beekeeping and is introduced to the Black Madonna, a figure that calls to her and awakens in her a new spirtuality.<br /><br />I know some people are highly crtical of this novel, but I found it to be totally delightful. Sue Monk Kidd crafted a completely sympathetic character in Lily, the narrator. I will agree with the reviewers who said nothing really happens once Lily and Rosaleen get to Tiburon. This is true. At that point in the novel, it becomes entirely about Lily's spirituality and personal awakening. It is so touching though, I feel that most women who have longed for a motherly deity figure can relate.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel. It is a very quick read and I personally had trouble putting the novel down.	2005-08-06

Silver Ravenwolf is one of the best known authors on the topic of Wicca and witchcraft; she is quite possibly the most mocked and dismissed. Quite a large segment of the pagan community finds her to be a \\"sell-out\\" and not worth reading. I am going to disagree with those people. I've been studying and practicing paganism and wicca for over 6 years. \\"To Ride a Silver Broomstick\\" was one of the first books I purchased on the subject and it put me on the path. This book is not intended to be the end-all-be-all authority on wicca. Its intent is clearly as a beginner's guide. With that in mind, I can definitively say that it ties for 1st place in my recommendation of beginner's guides (the other being Cunningham's \\"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\\").<br /><br />Call her a sell-out or whatever else suits your fancy, but the facts are that this book is a fabulous jumping-off point for those new to the craft.	2005-07-27

Colin, thinking Mariah is somehow inflicting the stigmatic wounds upon Faith and that Faith is in danger, sues Mariah for custody of Faith.<br /><br />This novel was tremendously intriguing and I would have been more than happy to give it a 5 star rating, if it had not been for the ending. Usually, Picoult answers any questions and ties up all the loose ends by the time the reader reaches the last page. I don't felt she did that in this book. I still had many questions that were left unanswered at the end of the novel, making me feel disappointed by it.<br /><br />Overall, it was a great book and I would definitely recommend it.	2005-07-25

I was so completely enthralled by it. I was worried that we might become bogged down in Harry's emotions, as we did in book 5, but Rowling has put together another terrific work.<br /><br />I was a disappointed with the ending of the novel. I don't want to spoil it for anyone else, so I will just say this: I never expected it to happen like that and I found it to be anticlimactic. The ending had a surreal quality about it that led me to believe it might be a joke or a ruse, but apparently that is not the case.<br /><br />Overall, an totally fabulous novel.

Hamilton's \\"Seduced by Moonlight.\\" Merry and her gang of guards also prepare for and make a trip to the Unseelie court, where we are left at the end of the novel.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Hamilton's, but I must say that I am growing weary of novels that lack a plot. The only thing that happened in this novel was a trip back to St. Louis and a ton of sex. Now, I am all for gratuitous sex, but this is just over-kill. In addition, I have noticed that Hamilton has turned both of her main characters (Anita and Merry) into these larger than life, everything to everyone, kind of people and it is really annoying. Merry is fey, and a princess, and she has the hand of flesh, and the hand of blood, plus she is the earthly vessel of the goddess Danu...please. I know it is in the fantasy genre, that is why I read it, but let's exercise some constraint please.

The dialogue was painful at times because it was so incredibly poor. Gardner employed tired rhetoric that frankly, came off as terribly corny.<br /><br />And the plot was horrible! It was some contrived nonsense that sounded like it belonged on a soap opera. Plus, the characters were constantly re-hashing all of the events-to-date, like the reader needed a score card.

Her father details his quest for Dracula, after having received a curious book related to the fictional villain. As her fath, Paul, finds out, Dracula isn't so fictional after all.<br /><br />I enjoyed the back story and listening to Paul's story, but I kept wanting the narrator to have a piece of the action.

Lula tries to be a bounty hunter and Grandma Mazur gets into a fist fight with Morelli's Grandma Bella. And those are just two of the highlights from this novel.<br /><br />I know a few readers said they found this novel to be \\"over the top\\" and I say so what if it is? I didn't find it to be, but this is a fun series with a little over-the-top action now and again. It is terrific fun to read the books in this series and they read SO quickly. If you are looking for something totally engaging and very funny, check out the Stephanie Plum series.	2005-06-27

John Harwood's spectral tale \\"The Ghost Writer\\" involves family secrets and a mysterious penpal. Gerard Freemont crept into his mother's bedroom one afternoon when he was about 10-years-old. He finds a picture of a woman and a book of short stories. His mother is enraged when she catches Gerard. It is years later before he returns to the room to try to find the book and the picture again. He eventually finds the books and realizes that one of the short stories was written by his great-grandmother. A very curious thing to hide, Gerard remains puzzled for years.<br /><br />Later on, when he is about 13-years-old, Gerard gets a penpal. Her name is Alice Jessell and she is confined to a wheelchair. They become best friends, despite Gerard's mother's objections. Over the years, Gerard and Alice grow quite attached to each other, but Alice refuses to meet Gerard.<br /><br />Interject a few short stories written by Gerard's great-grandmother and a heap-load of family secrets and you have The Ghost Writer.<br /><br />This book is so hard to summarize. Its format is like none I have ever seen. Harwood's novel is narrated by the main character, Gerard, and interspersed throughout the novel are short stories, emails, and a diary. It is a fascinating read and Harwood is exceptional at what he does. I could not put this book down. It was completely mesmerizing. I highly recommend it if you love a good ghost story.	2005-06-21

Leo Tolstoy's classic work, \\"Anna Karenina,\\" tells the tale of the title character and her scandalous affair with Alexei Vronsky.<br /><br />I was absolutely blown away by this novel. It's something I have wanted to read for quite some time, but was intimidated a little bit by the size of the novel. It took me about 2 weeks to finish it, but \\"Anna Karenina\\" was well worth the time.<br /><br />In terms of the story, I must say that Kitty and Levin irritated me something fierce. They were both so gushy that it was a bit nauseating. I found Anna and Vronsky's relationship to be very odd. They were in love, I think, with the forbidden nature of their relationship. Once they are together, they seem to hate one another. I have absolutely no sympathy for Alexei Karenin (Anna's husband) and I was very disappointed that he took Vronsky's daughter from him.<br /><br />A mersmerizing novel; I highly recommend it!	2005-06-20

I think most American's are under the impression that are legal system is fair and just and actually works. If someone is accused, they must be guilty, right? I used to be of that opinion. I have been following the West Memphis Three case as well as The Innocence Project for several years and when this book came out, I knew I had to read it. Given the fact that I am pagan, this case and book struck a chord with me. Damien Echols was villified for his interest in the occult. This interest was the primary basis for the conviction of all three young men. I find that very disturbing. I also find it downright terrifying that there was a legitimate suspect to whom the police could have linked the killings, but they had invested so much time and effort into the \\"Satanic Cult\\" theory, that they refused to admit they had made a mistake. Now, Damien is on death row and Jason and Jessie will spend the rest of their lives in prison for crimes they did not commit. This book is a terrifying commentary on our legal system. It's a sad state of affairs \\"Satanic Panic\\" can put innocent people in jail and let killers walk free.	2005-06-20

It was the very first book that I read on the subject of Wicca and witchcraft, and I must say that though I have now read many books on the subject, his remains in a league of its own. Cunningham makes the material that he covers so very approachable. His instructions are very easy to follow and the author comes across as very knowledgable.<br /><br />For anyone who is interested in Wicca and looking for a very practical guide to what it is and what it is all about, I highly recommend this book.	2005-06-20

His writing is completely spellbinding and so easy to read! I read 3rd Degree in 4 hours. The Women's Murder Club Series is his absolute best work. I adore the Alex Cross novels, but the women's series is where Patterson shines. I couldn't put this novel down!

Tempe is a college professor in the US and a medical examiner in Montreal. When called to collect some bones recovered on a construction site, Tempe finds she has landed right in the path of a serial killer. The bones she was called to recover weren't merely bones at all, but the dismembered body of a young women, wrapped in garbage bags. Tempe quickly realizes that this is not the first kill for the madman who committed the atrocity, nor will it be his last. Tempe must race against time to save her best friend, daughter and herself.<br /><br />I stumbled across Kathy Reichs in one of my local used bookstores. The title was what caught my eye, mainly because I thought it sounded hokey. When I read the dust jacket, I was intrigued but skeptical. The dustjacket compared Reichs to Cornwell, whom I cannot stand. However, I decided to give it a try and I am glad that I did! \\"Deja Dead\\" was a fantastic read. Very quickly paced, likeable central character, the plot was enthralling and a tad bit scary. Deja Dead is the best murder mystery novel I have read in quite some time.	2005-06-20

Over the course of her young life, Anna has been used by her parents like a car that has been stripped for the parts. And now, Kate has gone into kidney failure and Anna's parents are forcing her to donate a kidney to her sister. Tired of never being asked about her participation in the medical procedures and generally feeling invisible, Anna sues her parents for medical emanicipation, a move that tears her family apart.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is an amazing writer. This was the first novel by her that I read and I was completely blown away by her writing style. Not many authors can make me cry, but cry I did as I reached the end of the novel. Picoult employed the use of multiple narrative voices in a way that I have never experienced before. Each character became real to me as I heard their individual voices. My Sister's Keeper is a beautiful and elegant novel.	2005-06-20

The story then shifted to the grail quests, the fall of the round table, and the scattering of the nights.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the first two installments in this series, however \\"Child of the Holy Grail\\" was definitely lacking. A huge portion of the novel dealt with Lancelot and Guenevere's love affair, which was rocky to say the least. It seemed like every 50 pages she was sending Lancelot away for something he had done and the Guenevere would call him back and then send him away again. On and on like this for about 500 pages, gets really old after a while. I was a tad bit disappointed in this novel, although I would definitely recommend the series.	2005-06-20

I had some struggles with the first novel in this series, \\"Minion,\\" but \\"The Awakening\\" blew me away. I would strongly recommend a familiarity with African American literature before you attempt to read L.A. Banks. Her use of dialect could be hindering for the reader who is not used to it. Other than that, the novel is dynamic. Excellent character development and delivery. The protagonist is very sympathetic, thus the reader can easily relate to her. I would highly recommend this novel and its precursor to anyone who enjoys fantasy and vampire fiction.	2005-06-20

She is raising 13-year-old Savannah Levine, the daughter of a black magic practitioner named Eve. After Eve's death, the Coven decided Paige should raise Savannah and teach her only to use white magic. All is well until Leah, a half demon and the killer of Paige and Savannah's mothers, turns up and demands custody of Savannah on behalf of Savannah's long lost father. To apply pressure to Paige, Leah exposes Paige's magic and sets her up to look like a satanist and a murderer. Paige will have to battle not only Leah to save Savannah, but the coven as well. The coven now believes Savannah is a threat and should be turned over to her father. Paige must make the coven see Savannah's great potential and save the day.<br /><br />I was disaapointed with Armstrong's first novel in the Women of the Otherworld series, \\"Bitten.\\" However, \\"Dime Store Magic\\" was excellent. I approached it with a bit of trepidation, but was happily surprised once I started reading it. I think the character of Paige is much more likeable than Elena, the main character of Bitten. Of course, I love just about any story that deals with magic, so perhaps I am biased.	2005-06-20

One set of remains was wrapped in a leather tarp while the others were not. Temperance Brennan is called in to excavate the bones and determine, if she can, how long the remains have been in the basement. Brennan has a nagging feeling that these bones are more or less recent and not part of an old cemetery, as her police counterparts do. Not willing to accept \\"drop it\\" for an answer, Temperance begins her own investigation and eventually stumbles upon a shady former tenant of the building that houses the pizza place. Fueled by a mysterious caller who claims to know something of the bones in the basement and pieces of the puzzle that just don't add up, Temperance walks right into the hands of a sadistic murderer.<br /><br />\\"Monday Mourning,\\" by Kathy Reichs, is an amazingly suspenseful novel. Quite possibly Reichs' best work to date. Reichs is the author of the Temperance Brennan mystery series. Brennan is a forensic anthopologist who works in Quebec and Charlotte, NC. Much like the Patricia Cornwell Scarpetta novels, Reichs works follow Dr. Brennan through the forensic analysis of crime and justice. Unlike Cornwell, I adore Reichs.<br /><br />I read this book in just under 24 hours. I simply could not put it down. If you love a good mystery, definitely check out \\"Monday Mourning\\" or any of the other Kathy Reichs novels.	2005-06-20

Not because the novel was bad in any way, I just felt like I was reading really slowly. I thoroughly enjoyed Incubus Dreams. I thought Hamilton spent a little too much time on Anita's \\"life\\" issues and not enough on the actual vampire hunting, but that did not diminish my enjoyment.

How can a girl refuse?<br /><br />I tried to read this novel once before and abandoned it. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's very much like the Anita Blake series only A LOT more sex. Merry really gets around. I could see this as a drawback to some readers. I enjoy the supernatural erotica that Hamilton throws into each novel and even I was like \\"Jeez, will you stop having sex and get back to the plot!\\" Otherwise, it was excellent!	2005-06-20

Her connections to the flashy art world add plenty of glitz and suspects for Alex, Mike Chapman, and Mercer Wallace to investigate before the killer strikes again.<br /><br />I used to read alot of Patricia Cornwell and I had to stop because I realized I was reading the same novel over and over again. Now, you can say that of pretty much any mystery author, I realize. Most of them do a really good job of masking it though. I am hoping that Fairstein is able to do the same. Cornwell's character Kay Scarpetta is not likeable and always is attacked by the vicious killer. Fairstein's Cooper is likeable, but the reader sorta has to work at it and she is always attacked by the vicious killer. Authors need to realize that readers catch on to these sort of canned plots. We're not stupid, dearest authors, really we're not.<br /><br />I did find the plot of \\"Cold Hit\\" to be a bit tedious. Fairstein can be overly wordy sometimes. 50 pages could easily be shaved off of each of her books and they wouldn't be any different.	2005-06-20

Starbird delves deep into the myth of the Holy Grail and presents evidence supporting her theory that the Holy Grail was Mary Magdalene and the royal bloodline she fostered through the children she produced through her marriage to Jesus Christ. Starbird's arguments are very compelling and she backs up her claims through some extremely intriguing ways (art, literature, watermarkings, localized custom, etc.).

Andrew Tripping, the suspect in the case, used his 10 year old son as leverage against his victim. At the same time, Mike Chapman is investigating a murder case that seems to be suspiciously linked to Alex's rape case. Alex, Mike, and Mercer Wallace must untangle the deadly web before the murderer strikes again.<br /><br />Fairstein is generally an entertaining read, however this novel seemed a bit formulaic. I understand that there is a fomula that lies beneath the surface of every mystery novel, but if I can grasp the formula and feel it working, then the author isn't doing their proper job. That is why I stopped reading Patricia Cornwell; the formula was in my face, and I am feeling the same thing with Fairstein. Overall, it was an OK novel. Nothing to write home about though.	2005-06-20

I enjoy the Vampire Huntress series imensely. When \\"The Hunted\\" was released, I simple could not wait to read it. With that being said, I did not enjoy this novel nearly as much as the first two. I had mentioned in previous reviews of L.A. Banks that readers not used to dialogue being written in slang or \\"street speak\\" might have difficulty with her works. This previously was not a problem for me, but in \\"The Hunted\\" the street speak was so over the top that I became very frustrated. It seemed at certain points in the novel that Banks was throwing every bit of slang and street speak she knew into small scenes. This was hard for me to digest because it came off so phony.<br /><br />Also, Banks needs to learn a little variety and not to use some forms to death. She LOVES to shorten names and then use them in every sentence in a particular scene. For example, the shortening of names. Marlene becomes \\"Mar\\", Shabazz becomes \\"Bazz\\", etc. Then, 12 sentences in a row contained one of the name contractions. It wore on my nerves terribly. I don't need you to say a name or a name contraction in EVERY sentence to know whom the character is talking to.<br /><br />In addition, Banks employed some very offensive stereotypical representations in the novel. Carlos, Shabazz, and Kamal all repeatedly refer to Marlene and Damali as \\"woman\\", which I find offensive. In the contexts of their respective relationships, Damali and Marlene became property. Carlos and Shabazz, in heated discussions and private thoughts, referred to the females as \\"their woman.\\" Again, I find this offensive. The female characters also seemed to let this blow over them without much fanfare. Also, Damali loses her virginity in the beginning of this novel. That entire sequence is not told through Damali's eyes, but rather the man she was with. I find that highly unusual and demeaning to the character. During the virginity exchange, Damali is just a moaning mass, without thoughts or emotions. Whereas an experience that should be wholly hers, becomes the narrative property of Carlos. Carlos goes into great detail about how he wants to \\"brand\\" her so that no other man can every make love to her; she would always \\"belong\\" to him. It was complete macho crap and turned my stomach.<br /><br />I am very disappointed with this novel and I am not sure if I will attempt to read anymore of this series.<br /><br />The plot and characters were wonderful, but some facets of her story-telling were just offensive. Hopefully, these elements will be diminished in her next novel.mass, without thoughts or emotions. Whereas an experience that should be wholly hers, becomes the narrative property of Carlos.

I adore her novels. They are so intriguing and read so quickly. Reichs knows how to grab the reader from page one and keep them on the edge of their proverbial seat until the very end. I find Reichs' writings to be far superior to the author she is most often compared to, Patricia Cornwell. However, if you like Cornwell (which I do not) you will love Kathy Reichs.	2005-06-20

They die and rot each night as they sleep. Clearly magic is being used against him and the Marquis soon learns that it comes from his former love, New Orleans Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau.<br /><br />Doesn't my synopsis sound terribly interesting? Too bad the novel wasn't! This novel was a catastrophe! I expected a wonderul fantasy novel because the scenario seemed so intriguing, but I was let down and disappointed. I wasn't aware when I purchased this novel that it was part of a series and that in order to have a clue as to what was going on, I need to have read all of that series. I was so lost. Also, there was almost no action in this novel. Everything was dreams and dialogue which can become cumbersome after 200 pages. The characters were also very surfacey. They had almost no depth. I will probably give Mitchell another try, but I will definitely keep my expectations low.	2005-06-20

Trying to conceal this part of her identity in the big city and from her boyfriend is no small challenge, but Elena is making it work. At least until she receives a call from the Alpha of her pack, asking her to return home because they are having a situation with renegade werewolves who are threatening to blow the pack's cover. What Elena soon learns is that the new, renegade werewolves are actually vicious killers and rapists in their human forms who have been turned to werewolves in the hopes of destroying Elena's pack.<br /><br />Sounds pretty good, huh? That's what I thought when I read the back cover. Turns out that it wasn't anywhere near as good as it could have been. For starters, the story moved soooooo very slow. I was ready to give up on this novel about 125 pages in because nothing was happening. I stuck with it though. It did pick up some, but the rest of the novel and the ending were lackluster. Being that I love the supernatual type fantasy novels, I was prepared to be blown away. Instead I was just disappointed because the plot had potential, but the author dropped the ball.<br /><br />I will say that I have read all of the other books in this series and they are fantastic. I am glad that I didn't give up on this series, but I did not enjoy this novel at all. I would recommend skipping it and going straight to \\"Stolen.\\"	2005-06-20

With that said, after I have read something heavy, something that requires A LOT of concentration and attention, I like to follow it up with something light that doesn't require my brain cells to overheat. Thus, I picked up Three to Get Deadly by Janet Evanovich.<br /><br />In Three to Get Deadly, Stephanie Plum is on the trail of a kindly neighborhood figure known as Uncle Mo. Uncle Mo runs a candy store in the 'Burg and everyone loves him. When he fails to appear in court for a carrying a concealed weapon charge, his bond is revoked and Stephanie kicks it into high gear looking for him. Little did she know that she would be villified for her participation in his attempted arrest by the rest of the 'Burg. With no one talking and no clues as to Mo's whereabouts, Stephanie's investigation stalls. One evening, Stephanie tools by Mo's candy store to check for activity. When she finds the back door open and decides to take a peek inside, she is knocked out cold from behind and wakes up next to a dead body! The dead bodies keep piling up around Stephanie, eventually leading her to the conspiracy that holds the key to Uncle Mo's arrest and disappearance.<br /><br />This novel was packed with action and hysterics! Stephanie Plum is probably the worst bounty hunter in the entire world, but she is resourceful, spunky, and a character that the readers fall in love with instantly. And don't forget about Grandma Mazur and the mysterious Ranger (or Joe Morelli for that matter!). Mix them all together and you get a terrific, quick-paced novel that is hard to put down!<br /><br />This series is perfect for beach and vacation reading!	2005-06-20

This is not the first time Jessie and Gerald have engaged in kinky sex, however Jessie gets a bit spooked and decides she doesn't want to go through with the handcuffs. Gerald, think Jessie is \\"playing along\\", continues with the charade. Jessie, trying to make Gerald see she is not playing along, kicks Gerald in the chest and groin. Gerald has a heart attack and dies. The remainder of the novel (this all happens within the first few pages) is Jessie's handcuffed to the bed ordeal and all of the tricks her mind plays on her.<br /><br />I have never read a Stephen King novel before, which is how I ended up with \\"Gerald's Game.\\" I told this to my stepmom and she recommend and then lent me Gerald's Game. This book creeped me out to no end. The tricks the mind plays is all too familiar to me, so I was especially creeped out by this novel. It was excellent though. I was very impressed and now I can say I have actually read Stephen King. I have tried other novels, but couldn't get into his writing style. \\"Gerald's Game\\" was very different and I recommend it to anyone who isn't as squeamish as I am.	2005-06-20

Miles paints a beautiful and enrapturing portrait of the love triangle between Guenevere, Lancelot and Arthur. By the beginning of this novel, Arthur has had his incestuous relationship with his sister, Morgan Le Fay, and produced their son, Mordred. Guenevere, heartbroken, turned to Lancelot for comfort. \\"The Knight of the Sacred Lake\\" covers Lancelot's return to Camelot, Merlin's obsessive quest to further the line of Pendragon rule by finding Mordred, and the Christian monks attempts to further erode the worship of the Mother and destroy Avalon.<br /><br />Miles' Guenevere Trilogy is quite an interesting take on the Arthurian legends. The story is told through many viewpoints, through primarily through Guenevere's. Miles does an excellent job of painting Guenevere as a strong woman and follower of the Goddess, as opposed to the more popular literary Guenevere of \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" by Marion Zimmer Bradley, who is weak-willed and simpering. The reader connects to Guenevere and her pain in a deep way. Miles has created a moving and deep portrait of the famous Queen and her consorts.	2005-06-20

Olivia is sent to Miami to cover a face cream premiere and becomes convinced that a movie producer she meets at the premiere, Pierre Feramo, is really Osama bin Laden. Mayhem ensues as Olivia tries to foil the suspected terrorist.<br /><br />I was very excited when I heard that Fielding had a new novel coming out. I read \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" before it became colossally trendy to do so and I simply adored it. Thus, I was excited at the prospect of more from Fielding. I have to say I was a bit disappointed with this novel. The whole \\"Oh my gosh! He's Osama bin Laden!\\" thing was cute and entertaining when it first occurred in the novel. However, when he actually turned out to be a terrorist and al-Qaeda conspirator, I wanted to throw the book across the room. Perhaps it's because I read the novel very near to the 3rd anniversary of 9/11, but I just thought that linking this fictional character with al-Qaeda was poor on the part of Fielding. Plus, Olivia really wasn't that likeable. I didn't go into this novel expecting a Bridget-eque tale, but I did expect something better than what I got.	2005-06-20

Lipp breaks down and explains every part of the magick circle from gathering the supplies to when to invoke deity. Lipp answers quite a few questions that other books covering magick circles seem to ignore. Lipp always applies the 4 elements to each part of the ritual. Her theory is that every single thing that transpires during the construction of the circle, the actual ritual, and the breakdown of the circle relates to one of the 4 elements.<br /><br />It took me forever to finish this book. I must have been reading it for several months. Lipp presents some very interesting ideas and methods to employ in ritual, however she is so very wordy. Lipp spends what feels like eons explaining and re-hashing material until the reader just wants to scream \\"I GET IT!!!!!!!!\\". That does not mean that I would not recommend this book. I do feel that Lipp covered some important ground and explained elements of ritual that are largely ignored in other texts. I think this is a valuable tool for the magickal practitioner.	2005-06-20

Morrison reveals the rise of Ruby through the eyes of the women who become its ethical sacrifice.<br /><br />I go back and forth on my views on Toni Morrison. I really enjoyed \\"The Bluest Eye,\\" I am not sure what I thought of \\"Beloved,\\" and I did and did not like \\"Paradise.\\" I thought Morrison took too long \\"getting there\\" in \\"Paradise.\\" I do enjoy her writing style as a whole. Morrison is a master wordsmith and her style is so free flowing that one must really struggle not to be caught up in it.<br /><br />Give it a whirl, but don't expect too much out of this book.	2005-06-20

The Second Time Around is another thriller by popular author Mary Higgins Clark in which Carley DeCarlo, a financial advisor newspaper journalist, becomes entangled in the mystery surrounding the plane crash of her extremely wealthy and successful stepbrother in law, Nicholas Spencer. Soon after the plane crash, it is discovered that Spencer's company Gen-stone, a pharmaceutical research company working on a cancer vaccine, has had it's reserves looted and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Spencer is immediately blame for the financial theft almost simultaneously, his company Gen-stone announces the cancer vaccine is a flop and all of the corporate investors have lost their money. Soon after, Spencer's widow's home is set on fire and the mystery engulfs Carley. She wonders if Nicholas Spencer is dead? Could he have faked his death? Why are so many people connected to the cancer vaccine missing or dead? Was Nicholas Spencer set up and possibly murdered? Would she be next?<br /><br />I adore Mary Higgins Clark. I have been a huge fan of hers since I was about 14 years old. Having said that, I was not blown away by \\"The Second Time Around.\\" The plot moved a bit slowly and I felt like some plot points were beaten to death. The reader got it the first time, Mary. Let's move on. Overall, the story was good and read pretty quickly. I will hold onto hope that the next one is better though.	2005-06-20

The novel is told through the viewpoint of Kassandra, daughter of the King of Troy and priestess of the Sun Lord Apollo. Having been cursed to never have her premonitions believed, Kassandra foretells the fall of Troy, but no one believes her until it is too late.<br /><br />I adore Marion Zimmer Bradley's work. \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is one of my all time favorite novels. When I discovered that Bradley had written a novel about the Trojan war, I was elated. The Trojan war is a story that has always fascinated me, as has the character Kassandra.

In James Patterson's latest Alex Cross novel \\"The Big Bad Wolf,\\" Alex has just begun working for the FBI. Hoping the FBI will offer a more flexable environment and give him more time with his family, Alex is optomistic. However, Alex is quickly involved in a kidnapping case which is part of a white sexual slavery ring. That ring is operated by a Russian mafia boss called The Wolf. Alex is in a race against time to save the kidnapped women and catch The Wolf, before its too late.<br /><br />I love James Patterson. Patterson's novels read so quickly and move with such a dynamic pace, that the reader is sucked in immediately. I found this book to be entirely enjoyable and totally worth the read. I am not sure why people have been so harsh in their reviews of it. I highly recommend it and cannot wait to read the sequal, \\"London Bridges.\\"	2005-06-20

When Brennan is called to help on a mysterious plane crash, other than the cause of the crash, things seem pretty mundane to Brennan. That is until Brennan recovers a body part that doesn't belong to anyone on the plane. Brennan's contacts go missing and Brennan is eventually dismissed from the crash investigation in an elaborate plot to distract from the extra body part. Brennan must clear her name and discover the identity of the extra body part before it's too late.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy Reichs writings. I was a little dismayed at the beginning of this novel though. When it started out being about a plane crash, I thought it was boring. But, I hung with it and was pleasantly surprised. The ending of the novel was totally shocking and I am glad that I stuck with it. I definitely would recommend it.	2005-06-20

Her mega rich boyfriend, Luke Brandon, informs Becky that he has a new business deal in the works that will require him to relocate to New York City. Luke asks Becky to join him and Becky is thrilled. There is just one hitch: Becky is severly in debt - again. At the end of \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic,\\" Becky had paid off all of her debts and life seemed as if it were on an upswing for her. Several months later however and Becky has reacquired all of her old debt and then some.<br /><br />When Becky gets to New York, her spending spirals out of control and threatens everything about her way of life.<br /><br />If you like chick lit, you will adore Kinsella's novels. Her best work is \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\" but the \\"Shopaholic\\" series is cute as can be. Becky Bloomwood is a totally sympathetic character that every woman can related to (or just about every woman). I know that I can totally relate to some of Becky's thought processes concerning spending and her general feelings of ineptness. \\"Shopaholic Takes Mahattan\\" is a wonderful second novel in the series. Often follow up novels can be disappointing, however that is not the case here.	2005-06-20

This time around, Stephanie is not on the trail of a bond jumper, but is doing a favor for her parent's neighbor Mabel. Mabel's granddaughter and great-granddaughter have gone missing and Mabel asks for Stephanie's help. Stephanie soon learns that the reason behind the disappearance is more complicated that it appears and Stephanie is dodging bullets, watching her car get fire bombed and finding dead men on her sofa. It's a race to a finish you will not believe!<br /><br />Hard Eight is not my favorite Stephanie Plum novel to date, but it was completely action packed and totally engrossing. And there was of course the added bonus of Stephanie and Ranger finally sleeping together. She has a lot more resistance than I would have! I just adore these novels and I recommend that anyone who likes a good mystery try on these for size.	2005-06-20

They function as a sort of State of the Union address and the novel is structured around these letters. Containing 7 letters in all, we watch a woman struggle to find love and survive her bickering parents for just one night a year.<br /><br />I loved this novel! I laughed aloud so many times as I was reading. It is a fairly short novel, just a little over 200 pages and it read very quickly. The narrator is instantly likeable and easy to relate to. Markoe has a knack for the Chick Lit genre and I will definitely be checking out some of her other work.	2005-06-20

Damali's parents, unbeknownst to her, had died at the hands of vampires and she was dropped into the children's services nightmare. She eventually met up with a woman named Marlene who guided her on her vampire slayer path.<br /><br />The vampire who killed her parents has waged a war against Damali and Carlos, Damali's former boyfriend, and their families. His ultimate goal is to capture Damali during this very particular planetary alignment and impregnant her. She would give birth to what the author calls a \\"Day Walker\\". A day walker is still a vampire but one who is impervious to sunlight and can reproduce sexually as well as with the blood turning.<br /><br />I have read all of the installments in this series and I have to say, unfortunately, that this novel was the best of them all. I have a real problem with Banks' writing style. It is cumbersome and doesn't lend itself to the quick-pace vampire fiction normally has. Also, her use of dialectic speech is very annoying. I am not entirely sure why she has her characters speak the way that they do, but it is very difficult to read.<br /><br />I think this could have been a very entertaining series, but it just falls flat.	2005-06-20

Stephanie is an out of work girl living in Trenton, NJ. Her cousin Vinnie is a bail bondsman and, rather resistantly, puts Stephanie to work as a bounty hunter. Her first assignment is to bring in Joe Morelli, her high school crush that besmirched her reputation on a bathroom wall.<br /><br />The hysterics ensue as a girl with no experience in bounty hunting tries to figure the job out on her own. The book is laugh-out-loud funny, with the right combination of mystery and girl power. I think the Stephanie Plum series is so endearing because we can all see a little Stephanie in ourselves. These books are wonderfully funny and very quick and easy to read. I highly recommend the entire series.	2005-06-20

Erica Orloff's novel Diary of a Blues Goddess is about Georgia Ray, a young woman who sings in a successful wedding band. She lives with her Great Aunt Irene, who is a former prostitute turned saint, in Irene's former brothel. The haunted brothel, that is. And it is from the heartbroken ghost that lingers in her Auntie's house that Georgia Ray takes her love advice. Apparently, if a relationship is doomed, the ghost will slam doors and such. But then just about every house in New Orleans has a resident ghost with advice to spare.<br /><br />I cannot put into words how much I hated this novel. Orloff needs to return to writing self-help books, because her fiction isn't helping anyone. I don't think I have ever come across such a horribly contrived novel as this one. The characters were lackluster, the plot was downright silly and the novel as a whole was one very long and very bad cliche. Orloff employed, in a rather cheesy manner, every possible New Orleans cliche and stereotype she possibly could think of. This novel was an absolute train wreck and I would recommend it to no one.	2005-06-20

The caller insists that Langdon must lend his expertise to a murder that has just occurred. Thinking the caller is insane, Langdon hangs up, only to receive a fax several minutes later from the caller. The fax is a picture of the murder victim that had the word \\"Illuminati\\" branded into his chest before he was killed.<br /><br />That photo puts Robert Langdon and the daughter of the deceased, Vittoria Vetra, on a collision course with an ancient, secret order called the Illuminati. The Illuminati has a major vendetta against Vatican City and the Catholic Church, leaving a trail or murder and mayhem that Langdon and Vetra must unravel before the Illuminati destroys Vatican City.<br /><br />I read The DaVinci Code first. I know Angels and Demons was reviewed with much higher regard that The DaVinci Code. Or I should say, when reviewing The DaVinci Code, critics said Angels and Demons was the better book, hands down. I strongly disagree. I thought The DaVinci Code was a much stronger novel.<br /><br />I definitely picked up on a formula in Brown's novels. I am not sure if all of his work reflects such a formulaic nature, but you can definitely tell he has a construct he works with, as both novels unfold in essentially the same manners. I probably will not read much, if any more, of Brown's works because I don't care for formula writers (e.g. Danielle Steele, Patricia Cornwell, etc.).	2005-06-20

Soon Brennan's own nephew is immersing himself in this seedy underworld and it is up to Brennan to save the day.<br /><br />I adore Reichs' novels! Once I begin reading one, I cannot put it down! Very fast paced thrillers that will keep you hanging on every word! I was genuine afraid to read Reichs at first because she is so often compared with Patricia Cornwell, who I detest.

When several prominent citizens of Boston turn up murdered according to the manner of torture depicted in Dante's work, The Dante Club knows that they alone hold the key to figuring out who is behind the brutal slayings.<br /><br />I had such hope for this novel. The idea is incredibly inticing, but the delivery is poor at best. I know that this novel received rave reviews, but I am not sure what they were based on. The novel started off so incredibly slowly that I nearly gave up 100 pages in. The notion of the murders being modeled after Dante's visions in Hell is extremely interesting and I think quite a bit could have been done with that aspect of the novel, but it came off very weak. The chacters were not particularly well developed or likeable, the plot moved too slowly, and the ending was a dud.	2005-06-20

The team also learns that Katrina had been raped just a few months prior to her death. Could her sexual assault be linked to her murder? Or had Katrina stumbled onto information at the museum that no one wanted her to know; information about the bone vault?<br /><br />I felt like I was reading this novel for 100 years! It had such potential to be an edge of your seat kind of thriller, but Fairstein squashed that potential with her cumbersome writing style. Fairstein needs to remember that she is writing fiction, mystery/thriller fiction, which is supposed to be suspenseful and exciting. Instead, I feel like I am a member of one of her juries she is making a very detailed and explicit presentation to. Liven things up, Linda, or this reader may abandon ship! On the up side, no one tried to murder Alex in this novel, which is definitely a plus.	2005-06-20

His writing is a bit cumbersome. When they turn the novels into movies, that element of feeling bogged down is gone for the most part. The plot was excellent, as was the character development, but the novel moved a little too slowly for my tastes. Very interesting plot though.

Inside the prison, Prior meets Selina Dawes, a spirit medium with the face of an angel. Prior and Dawes strike an unusual and sensual friendship which threatens to unroot Prior's whole world.<br /><br />\\"Affinity\\" was definitely not what I expected. That is not to say I did not thoroughly enjoy it. I am a huge fan of the Victorian novel, so I was very pleased with this fan, although I admit it took me quite some time to actually bring myself to read this novel. Affinity sat on my bookshelf for almost a year and I just could not pick it up and read it. The time obviously came though.<br /><br />The look at the Victorian Gaol system and the Spiritualist movement was quite interesting. Also of interest were the lesbian undertones in this novel. The novel is very female-centric with all of the emphasis on female relationships. Margaret is very obviously a lesbian. She was in love with her best friend, Helen, who was apparently in love with her at some point, but forsakes Margaret for Margaret's brother, Stephen. Margaret and Seline develop a lesbianic attachment to each other that goes beyond simple, female friendship. The way in which Waters conveys this relationship to the reader is rather ingenious. Waters is an author I will definitely be keeping my eye on.	2005-06-20

Dinah narrates the story for us and recounts not only her own story, but that of her mothers (Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah), her brothers, and her father.<br /><br />I cannot express what a wonderful novel this is. Diamant is an extremely talented author. She managed to take a few simple lines of text from the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible and spin those sparse lines into the most engaging and touching story of a young girl and her family. Diamant brings Dinah to life and makes the reader love Dinah. I cried at parts of this novel and I laughed in others. It's a genuine work of art and Diamant is to be applauded for her work. Simply beautiful and captivating.	2005-06-20

I have to say that I was becoming rather disillusioned with chick lit. Everything felt stagnant and I was considering chucking the whole genre from my reading repertoire. But then, I read this novel and thankfully, my faith in the genre was restored. This book was so cute and lively. Yes, parts of it were predictable, but I didn't feel put off by it.

She is a talented and welcome addition to the supernatural/fantasy genre. I actually read  the books out of order, but it didn't really matter. Armstrong crafts her stories so that just enough detail is given to the reader in the event that they didn't read the previous books, but not enough to ruin those previous books should you decide to go back and read them.

I have a passion for the Russian Revolution and the last royal family. The mystery that surrounds whether or not one or more of the children survived that fateful night in 1918 is terribly intriguing. However, Berry didn't quite pull off what I hoped he would. His plot was so convoluted that it was hard to keep reading in certain places. Also, it became more than obvious that Berry was trying to mimic the \\"formula\\" of Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code, and Berry failed miserably at it.<br /><br />I was a fairly quick read and I might recommend it as a summer beach read, as long as you don't expect too much.	2005-06-15

In my opinion, the work doesn't bear up under these accolades. The story is down right boring, which is disappointing considering how engaging Gilman's short stories and other works are. The plot is odd and the message that Gilman is trying to convey is lost. I saw another reviewer call this work a satire, but I would strongly disagree. Gilman did not intend \\"Herland\\" to be a satire. She was attempting to show that women were more adept at \\"social housekeeping\\" than men were.<br /><br />Unless you have to read it, there are many other and better Gilman pieces to absorb your attention with.	2005-06-15

Mary Boleyn is the narrator of Gregory's novel. The Boleyn family pits sister against sister to further their political aspirations. Mary, who has an affair with King Henry VIII and has two children with him, is eventually pushed aside by her sister Anne. Mary details how Anne overthrows Katherine of Aragon and wins the affections of King Henry.<br /><br />It has been a very long time since I read any historical fiction. I must say that I approached this novel with some trepidation. However, I was most pleasantly surprised. Gregory is an amazing author. She wove intricate detail into the story without bogging it down. It was quick-paced and I honestly had trouble putting the novel down. The characters are well-developed, the plot was intriguing, and Anne was the kind of character that you love to hate. It was wonderful!<br /><br />I will definitely be checking out Gregory's other novels.	2005-06-15

Her writing is mesmerizing, usually. I didn't find that to be the case in Salem Falls. I could not like nor related to Jack, the main character. He was too remote and distant from the reader. I felt like I was on the outside looking in at him. It was an unpleasant feeling.<br /><br />Also, I was more than a little unhappy with Picoult's depiction of witchcraft and paganism. I am a practicing pagan and I found that her explanations of how magick works and what paganism is very informed. However, her representations of pagans - 4 lying, scheming, teenage girls and 1 typical pagan/hippy hybrid - to be lacking and insulting. You can do much better than that, Ms. Picoult.	2005-06-15

Girl is a 20-something college grad working for a non-profit women's organization. Sounds pretty cool, except her boss, Doris, is condescending and evil. Doris has reduced Girl to nothing more than an administrative assistant. When Girl stands up for herself against Doris' poor treatment, Doris fires Girl. Girl is flummoxed by her dismissal and the state of the job market into which she has been thrust.<br /><br />Then Girl meets Guy at a networking event. Proclaiming to need someone with a feminist background for the rebranding of his company, Girl thinks Guy holds the keys to unlocking her dream job. Girl gets the job and couldn't be more thrilled, even though she's not entirely certain what her job entails. Just when things seem to be turning around for Girl, she discovers that Guy can be just like Doris, if not worse, and her dream job may forever remain just that: a dream.<br /><br />Review: I am actually surprised by the sheer volume of negative reviews this book received. I've found, unfortunately, when authors have a huge success with a novel, in this case The Nanny Diaries, that people continue to compare later works to that smash hit novel, expecting those later works to be literary clones of the smash hit. When, of course, that is not the case, then people bash perfectly good books just for not being that initial book they loved. I think that may be what happened with Citizen Girl.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel. I could definitely related to Girl and her situation. I have worked for both a Doris and a Guy and that really helped me connect to Girl's as a character. Girl reminded me of myself at her age. Looking backwards at that time, now 10 years older, Girl helped me gain insight and perspective on that era of my life. I also admired Girl's ethics, morals, and spunk. She wasn't willing to violate her definition of herself just to retain a job. I found that admirable. I enjoyed the secondary characters, as well, especially Girl's brother Jack.<br /><br />I found the book to be well written. I very much enjoy the authors' writing style. It was inviting and helped me dive directly into the novel. I liked the plot and thought it moved along with a good pace. There was tension in the plot, which propelled me, as the reader, forward.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book. I would definitely recommend it.he book to be well written.

Orchid narrates her own story of love, power, joy, and grief. Told in the same vein as Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha, Empress Orchid is a powerfully strong novel about the strength of one woman and how she changed a nation.<br /><br />Empress Orchid is a truly amazing novel! Min provides such rich detail and a powerful voice for Orchid, that the reader is immediately enchanted by the beauty of the story and character. Orchid's strength is moving and inspiring.

When a developer wants to build a strip mall on top of an Abenaki Indian burial ground, suspicious circumstances lead the town folks to believe the land is haunted by the spirit of the Abenaki. Ross Wakeman, a ghost hunter, comes to the small town to visit his sister and quickly becomes embroiled in the situation. He is hired by the developer to find out if the property is haunted or not. What he finds on the land will change the rest of his life.<br /><br />It is truly impossible to not be smitten with Jodi Picoult. I have the hardest time putting her novels down. Unlike most of her other novels, Second Glance does not involve a court battle, which was a nice change of pace. This novel is so complex that it is really hard to describe. All the many stories are interconnected. It's complicated, but thrilling. I highly recommend it.	2005-06-15

I would have enjoyed the story much more if it had just been from Madame Mao's point of view. The constant changing, every other paragraph, to a different voice was jarring and really made me dislike this work.

I was sorely disappointed. I found the endless details of the construction of the World's Fair to be so boring that it might actually be a new cure for insomnia. It was completely lackluster and dull. I was intrigued by the tale of H.H.

I think Larson tried to accomplish too large of a task with this novel. He should have written about either the fair or the serial killer, but not both. I think a little dose of fiction would have been OK too. Sometimes the reality of a tale doesn't make for very interesting reading.	2005-03-16

I read this novel not long after my own mother died and it struck a chord. The characters are so well developed and sympathetic. Quindlen's writing style is wonderfully inviting and easy to read. I highly recommend this novel!	2005-03-16

That was not the case with this novel. I had an awful time trying to read it. The plot was dull, I did not like the characters, and I was simply disappointed. This novel was also about 300 pages too long. I was beginning to think Lamb just wanted to write for writing's sake. I am aware that many people adored this novel, but I am not one of them.	2005-03-16

I had to read \\"Alice\\" in secret because of the deeply religious household I was raised in. I remember relating to \\"Alice\\", not because our behaviors were similiar, but because we were both just teenage girls, trying to find that thing we felt was missing.<br /><br />It is truly a shame that this novel is so often banned by schools. I feel that \\"Alice's\\" tale could impact many teenagers in a positive manner. I know it did for me.	2005-03-16

I wish that she produced more adult novels, but the ones that she does write are certainly worth the wait. \\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" is a touching and engrossing tale. It even made me weep at certain parts. Amy Tan is a master wordsmith and crafts the most amazing novels. I highly recommend all of her works.	2005-03-16

Her writing style is amazing, her characters are entirely loveable and detestable at the same time, her settings are rich with the New Orleans atmosphere, and the plots are always original. I am deeply sad that Ms. Rice has decided not to continue this series. Perhaps one day she will revive it. Until then, I will just keep reading The Vampire Chronicles over and over.	2005-03-16

I especially like the intersection of The Vampire Chronicles with the Mayfair Witches. There was a good chunk of story that could have been cut from this novel and the novel would have remained the same. Sometimes Ms. Rice can get carried away with herself and the flowery writing style she employs. Overall, it was an excellent novel.	2005-03-16

I read \\"The Virgin Suicides\\" long before it was made into a movie and I was blown away by his writing style. \\"Middlesex\\" was no different. The novel is so elegant and touching, but provocative and disturbing too. The characters were created in such a way that the reader could not help but fall under their spell. I eagerly await Eugenides next novel and I highly recommend both \\"The Virgin Suicides\\" and \\"Middlesex.\\"	2005-03-15

I wasn't blown away by the novel, but I decided that I would try one of the other books in the Marquis de Sade series. I wish I had not. Mitchell's work is an absolute train wreck. This novel was supposed to be about de Sade and a big battle with another vampire named Marie. Instead, 80% of the novel was about a family of vampires that Marie and de Sade pay a visit too. The characters were completely flat, there was basically no plot, the dialogue was atrocious, and it was once sad and tired cliche after another. I will not be reading anymore of Mitchell's work. I am a huge fan of vampire fiction, but I will not be reading this garbage just because it is part of that genre. I am really surprised that \\"Tainted Blood\\" received such a high rating. I am horribly disappointed and I would not recommend Mitchell's works to anyone.	2005-03-15

I am from Cincinnati and I was really looking forward to the familiar local of the novel's setting. However, that brief joy was ruined for my in \\"Dead Witch Walking\\" as well as in this novel. I think this series has such potential if Harrison would lay off the cliches and all of the Ivy-wants-Rachel-to-be-her-scion crap. Ivy freaking out and trying to murder Rachel every 10 pages gets really old, really fast. I adore Jenks and his kids, but I have difficulty relating to Rachel and the other characters. Harrison needs to make her non-human characters a bit more accessible to us human folk. I may give Harrison's work one more try, but if the next installment doesn't make some pretty big changes, I won't be reading anymore of them.	2005-03-15

I had no idea what an amazing story was waiting for me between those two covers. Astrid is such an amazing character. The movie really did not do this book justice. The complexity of the characters, the bigger commentary on motherhood and how it \\"poisons\\" and the heartbreak of a young girl were lost in the transition from text to film. Read this amazing novel and skip the movie.	2005-03-15

I simply fell in love with it. Karen Joy Fowler should be applauded for her tremendous work. The characters are so lovely and human. I was able to connect to each of them. There was not much of a plot, however the absence of a plot really worked in this novel and I cannot imagine it being any other way. Any more plot than what is in the book would completely overshadow the delicate and sensational characters that Fowler created. The characters, after all, are the focal point of this novel. I highly recommend this novel!	2005-03-15

When I learned that a new installment in the Avalon series was published, I was thrilled. \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is one of my favorite novels and I have read all of Bradley's other novels in the series. Diana L. Paxson who collaberated with Bradley on one of the Avalon books, decided to take on the prequal and link Bradley's Avalon series with Bradley's Atlantis novel. She should have left both alone.<br /><br />Paxson cannot write. I would go as far as to call her work drivvel. It was terrible. The chacters were unsympathetic and hollow. They contained no substance whatsoever and as a reader I could not connect with them. Their speech was all wrong as well. Paxson had the characters swearing and using modern day slang! The whole novel was contrived, poorly written and not at all inline with Bradley's previous writings.<br /><br />I cannot advise anyone to read this novel, it was so poor.	2004-08-21

Where do I even begin to rant about this novel??<br />Harris' characters are terribly one dimensional, the plot was vey weak, and the &quot;Southern Charm&quot; in this novel was thick enough to choke a horse.
