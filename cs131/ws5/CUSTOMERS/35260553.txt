This book, however, was definitely worth the time and effort to read.<br /><br />Even though most of the concepts are simple, basic physics, I still learned things.  Most wonderful of all were the many times a lightbulb clicked on in my mind when I saw how simply and cleverly Faraday constructed his experiments.  These guys really had it together.<br /><br />Though somewhat devoid of helpful diagrams, the text of this work is often enough to give the reader a good idea of how Faraday was conducting his experiments and presentation.  I think the biggest detractor is that you really have to slog through the work and use your imagination to figure out what he's describing.<br /><br />My only wish is that I could have been there to see these lectures myself.  Sounds like quite the demonstration.	2005-04-28

I just don't get you.<br /><br />Or at least I didn't until I read this prequel era novel.<br /><br />Set in the time period just before _The_Phantom_Menace_, this novel continues to help set the scene for the prequel trilogy.  It significantly differs, however, because most of the story is consumed by the long chase (mentioned in the above novel synopsis) instead of involving numerous storylines of various different characters.<br /><br />I really enjoy learning more about the background of many of the characters later featured in the films.  You'll definitely get that here.  What I didn't particularly enjoy was the constant chase; while it kept the novel moving, it almost seemed forced, and I was getting tired of reading of constant improbable escape situations.<br /><br />However, many others may enjoy the change of pace offered here.  There is much less important dialogue to pay attention to, unlike a novel such as _Cloak_of_Deception_, where you pretty much have to pay attention to what everyone's saying in order to get what's going on.  So that's something new and different.<br /><br />Worth a read.	2005-04-25

Uh, so how could you not want to grab this book the minute it came out to find out how the whole thing ends/begins?!  This story does serve as a good bridge between the \\"prequels\\" and the original Star Wars.  And it's not nearly as complicated as I thought it was going to be.<br /><br />Why the three stars?  Well, the actual writing of this book was only fair.  The author used some techniques to get the reader inside the characters' heads that I believe actually backfired.  However, Stover was able to keep the story moving, and while the language didn't conjure up images of the characters/scenery very well, you pretty much got what you wanted out of it.  This novel is not nearly as well written as Episode II was, but I still couldn't put it down.<br /><br />A decent novel in and of itself, but more than the others (Episode I and II), the reading of more peripheral novels (Labrynth of Evil, etc) really helps place the story line in better context.<br /><br />One thing I have to give the storytellers...the last few pages of this book actually broke my heart.  Weird, considering how we all know how it's going to turn out.  Oddly moving, I think.	2005-04-09

It does get a little slow and plodding at times, but the real reason to read this book is that it sets up Episode I brilliantly.<br /><br />I know many people besides myself who sat through Episode I wondering what the heck was going on with the whole political mumbo-jumbo.

For repair, I'd advise those who know what they're doing to grab themselves a Chilton manual specific to their car.<br /><br />However, I think this book should be read by anyone preparing to enter the world of driving.  I personally would have my child read this book before allowing them to own a car.<br /><br />This book pretty much covers how a car works and simple/routine maintenance.  Stuff most people who drive have no clue about.  Stuff that is important to know if you're planning on navigating 2 tons of steel in three dimensions at 60mph.<br /><br />This is a great present for your teen's 16th birthday (place it in the front seat of their new car!), or for anyone who has just gotten a new car (and you know they barely understand how to turn it on).	2005-03-15

Then the \\"prequels\\" emerged, and I happened to get my hands on this book a few weeks before the movie was released (just casually browsing through a bookstore).  I sat down in the bookstore and read the whole thing.<br /><br />Ok, besides blowing a morning doing this, reading Episode II and the supporting novels written \\"around the time period\\" have greatly increased my appreciation of the Star Wars universe.  The politics, motivations, relationships, and history go far beyond what can be depicted in a two hour movie.  Or even three two hour movies.<br /><br />This book is well-written, interesting, and I believe it will motivate many people to seek out more information before the third movie comes out.<br /><br />The book to Episode III will be out in April (the movie will be released in May).  I totally plan on reading it.  I hope it's as good (if not better) than Episode II.	2005-03-10

Books	3	4	4	N	N	Parts of this are worth reading	As the daughter of \\"Rich Dad,\\" I always wondered why some of the people I met in college subsequently found themselves in poor situations once they entered the job field.  Or why they made the financial choices they made (which to me seemed obviously unwise).<br /><br />The part of this book that is definitely worth reading are the sections treating the difference in financial advice and perspective that most financially responsible wealthy parents impart to their children.  (Not all rich people know how to handle money.)<br /><br />Now that I have this information, it becomes obvious why so many people I know have made poor financial choices.  They just weren't *taught* otherwise.  Amazing.<br /><br />As for the other parts of this book...well, while some of the philosophy is intriguing, real estate speculation/prospecting isn't for everyone.  The message that you will make as much as you set out to make is the real point here.  If you really want it, and you make the real effort in the right direction to make it, it will be yours.	2005-03-10

I totally agreed with the theory of \\"The Love Bank.\\"  I found the lists of priorities men and women attach to their marriage very interesting (and enlightening).<br /><br />But as the book went on, I couldn't help rolling my eyes in disgust at the chauvinist comments the author would make.  I mean, do you really have to be submissive and helpless to be a good Christian wife?<br /><br />Given how much I agreed with the importance of your partner being your companion during activities you enjoy, I was disappointed with how Harley approached the activities, the solutions, and the inevitable \\"boys will be boys\\" attitude he espoused.<br /><br />Most of this book is common sense.  Will it really affair-proof your marriage?  I doubt it.  It'll either happen or it won't.  If you act like a jerk, you may get cheated on.  If you marry a jerk, you may get cheated on.

Like many others who have reviewed it, I had a hard time putting it down.  I don't expect that anyone wouldn't find it interesting.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for evidence of anything, stop now.  The author took this experiment upon herself with little regard for true scientific and experimental protocol and procedures.  The fact that her experiment fails says nothing about what is really real.<br /><br />For example, the author states no one can afford to live on the wages she earned during the time she spent making minimum wage.  What she fails to realize is that the ability to afford something changes with the amount of income one makes.  There are middle income families who cannot afford to live on what they make.  This is proportional to what they SPEND.  There are many instances during which the author spends money somewhat frivilously given her circumstances.  This touches upon the true problem we have in America:  the unwillingness of the general population to live within their means.<br /><br />Had this author spent any real time in the homes of these \\"poor\\" folks, she may have had further insight into how they conduct their lives.  There are many who stretch every dollar to the last ha' penny.  I've seen it myself.<br /><br />Necessities are another issue.  Many poor families have television sets (and big ones, at that).  A tv (and cable), cell phone, make-up, perfume, cigarettes, and beer are considered necessities by many people--I think it would surprise the average person how true this is.<br /><br />I think this is a great beginning, but more (and better) research needs to be done.  Taking someone's word for what they can and can't afford doesn't cut it.  True inspection of the lifestyles and spending habits of the study population is warranted.	2004-12-20

And the writing and story line in _State_of_Fear_ are fairly good.  Better than that, however, is the idea about which this novel is centered.<br /><br />It's too bad that it takes a celebrity to discredit other celebrities (even in the face of overwhelming scientific data), but I was extremely amused to find the subject of environmentalism and global warming treated in this novel.<br /><br />More important than the actual subject chosen by Crichton is the idea expressed in this book that the explosion of ratings-driven media is responsible for increased awareness of global activity/crisis, and that there does not exist an actual increase in crimes, natural disasters, etc., themselves.<br /><br />Crichton's most brilliant move in this novel, however, is having the protagonist (Peter Evans) start from the position of the spoon-fed public.  Through the eyes of this character, the reader is made more aware of the controversy, the pseudoscience, and the possible (though improbable) conspiracies surrounding environmental issues.  Excellent.<br /><br />It's a quick read, it's enjoyable, and you'll get a kick out of it (unless you're a tree hugger).  *grin*	2004-12-19

This is not the case here.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by someone who is supposed to read a lot.  Now I question that, and I wonder what it is exactly that he has been reading.  Certainly not good science fiction.<br /><br />While this book had the potential to be very interesting, the author fails miserably both in terms of the science and the character development.  For a great part of the novel, the reader must feel that the characters are running about willy-nilly with no sense of purpose.  I think Bear could have also delved more deeply into the science, but probably didn't because the premise was so weak to begin with.<br /><br />I am neither a creationist nor an evolutionist (let's remember that they are both currently just theories), but my dislike of this book has nothing to do with that.

However, I believe they have much more merit, as they are founded on common sense and realistic strategies.<br /><br />People reading this book will understand how throwing money at problems is ineffective and wasteful.  You will also understand a very basic principle that I believe is greatly misunderstood:<br /><br />There is no such thing as effective rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation is a myth.<br /><br />That isn't to say that people in prison cannot benefit from time, patience, and education.  The simple truth is that there is no known effective method for changing people's behavior.

Having lived here for almost three years (*and* having worked as a physician in the hospital he mentions in his novel), I can promise you that the innocence, the bluster, and the graciousness of his side characters is almost completely fictional.<br /><br />  I don't think it would have detracted from the book to portray the city and the people more realistically.	2004-12-10

Though the writing is somewhat simple, anyone can enjoy the characters and the adventures of this brave pioneer family.  The amazing thing is how much you can learn from these books.  History truly comes alive.	2004-12-01

As a physician and a former athlete, I have been advocating much of what is presented in this book for a long time. Diet will get you nowhere. I don't have patients who seriously exercise (regardless of what they eat) with chronic health problems.<br /><br />This book is snappy, smart, and (most importantly) short. In a fairly successful manner, it not only describes the steps one must take, but it explains why.<br /><br />The only thing missing is the rationale for why 30 minutes is the magic number. I also believe the benefits of weight training are underrepresented here.<br /><br />I will be purchasing a copy of this book for many of my friends who constantly ask me about different diets/pills/miracle weight loss. It'll be a great xmas present.<br /><br />Now if I could actually get them to do it...	2004-12-01
US	35260553	R1VHF5EU7VZWAM	0743424425	966329377	The Shining	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Dang good	King's first novels were undoubtably his best.  Out of those, I must say that The Shining is truly a standout.  What makes it most chilling is that it's told mostly from the perspective of a child who knows too much.  In this book, King is able to give us a fast-paced story without excessive character development.  I would call this more suspense than horror.  Either way, it's a dang good read.	2004-12-01

The characters in this book could have been pulled from life.  It's amazing.  I can't say that the story was all that strong, but the family dynamics and great (though somewhat unrealistic) dialogue just made my day.  It'll take you a couple of hours to read, and it's well worth your time.  Pick this up!  Give it as a gift.	2004-12-01

The protagonist(s) really get to your heart, and the story is fast-paced and interesting.  I think this would make a good read for anyone who loved the Harry Potter series.  It will also make a great present for anyone who likes to read.  These books are appropriate for both older children and any adult.	2004-12-01

This review is more for the whole series than for the first book itself.<br /><br />If you're looking for something light, entertaining, and well-written, this is the series for you.  The books are short, and the stories and characters are easy to follow and remember.<br /><br />Flaws I find in the series include a tad too much melodrama and one-sided villians.<br /><br />Check these out from the library and read 'em all in one day.  You'll be sad to leave Africa.	2004-11-29
US	35260553	R1CK4EECZF7S6X	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	3	1	4	N	N	So much potential...	This is one of those books that had everyone talking for a couple of months.  After I read it, I saw it everywhere...xmas presents, birthday presents, book clubs.  I couldn't believe that people liked it that much.  They must not read very much.<br /><br />The sad truth is that \\"good books\\" will be labeled as such and gain substantial popularity because they have good press.<br /><br />I think that it is an interesting book.  It's different.  It does make you think.  But the end is somewhat confusing and rather pointless.  It's fairly disappointing given how much the reader must wade through to get to the finish.  But I think that most people will enjoy reading this novel.  Don't go into it with huge expectations, and you'll wind up fairly happy.	2004-11-29

And Here My Troubles Began	Books	5	5	7	N	Y	Fantastic	This is a great format for such a moving story.  The pictures allow the history to come alive.  First rate.  I'm not Jewish, and I think this would make a great present for anyone.	2004-11-18

I'm probably biased by the WWII setting, but the characters are knowable, and you can try to understand them.  The writing is very well done.  Unlike some of her other novels, this one doesn't bore you halfway through.  Most people may say that \\"Joy Luck Club\\" was Amy Tan's best work.  I think it was this book.	2004-11-07

I kept finding reasons to put it off.  What a mistake.  This is a fantastic novel.  The quality of the story and the writing is well above that of the average published author.  However, the characters seem...well, like characters.  Not quite so real.  Nonetheless, this is a very enjoyable read, and it is almost guaranteed to hook you into the series.	2004-11-07

I found the parts taking place in Africa the most interesting.  The writing is very well executed.  I think anyone who wants to be considered \\"well-read\\" should probably read this book.  The first half, at least, will hold your interest well.	2004-11-07
US	35260553	R3C6ITYQJOOGFI	0446365386	716836572	Gone with the Wind	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	the best book ever	I read over 150 books a year, and I always have read a lot.  I don't go for romance at all, but this book is so much more than that.  The writing is fantastic.  The vocabulary is diverse.  The imagery.  The characters.  The plots within plots.  You are there.  You know the characters intimately.  This is the most amazing work of fiction I have ever laid eyes on.<br /><br />I'm not big on re-reading things, but I've read this novel many, many times.  Buy it.  Read it.  Treasure it.<br /><br />If you're \\"offended by the racism,\\" please try to keep in mind that political correctness will destroy your education.  And whether or not this book is racist (can a _book_ be racist?) does nothing to diminsh from its genius.	2004-11-07

It's not badly written, and it will keep you fairly interested.  However, there is nothing new in this book.  It's just another one of those novels about how someone's life in another country is just horrible.  You know, one of those \\"pc\\" profound things we're supposed to read to keep us \\"culturally aware.\\"  Seems that all you have to do to get published these days is put one of these novels out.  I found myself rolling my eyes on many occasions.  If it takes you a long time to read a book, don't invest that time in this one.  If it takes you just a matter of 2-3 hours (and you have them to waste), by all means, dip into yet another of this stew of pretentious publishing malarky.	2004-11-06
