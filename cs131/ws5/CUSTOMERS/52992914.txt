I have a centrist weblog. I love reading books and doing reviews (but since I started the blog I am doing fewer reviews on Amazon in the past). I got this book many months ago, read it rather quickly...and kept putting off a review. In fact, I dreaded it and was going to skip it totally. Why?<br /><br />Just look at the reviews here. Some people are turned off immediately by the title, or they don't like some of Michelle Malkin's opinions on various issues, or they feel it's outrageous that anyone can write a book defending the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Others feel that BECAUSE it is a non-PC title and issue it is automatically valid. So you have a polarized readership and although I hate to generalize, it's probably accurate to say some people who read this book had their minds made up before they did and some who did reviews maybe didn't read it (but wrote reviews to bolster or criticize Malkin). And each side can cite logical reasons for feeling that way.<br /><br />So I procrastinated this review -- and found out that a well-known conservative blogger had the same reaction (he decided NOT to write a review since this is such a powder-keg issue).<br /><br />In my case, though, I always couldn't understand why Japense-Americans were put in these camps. Was it just because of the war and pure bigotry? Or could it have been bigotry spiced with misinformation and/or stereotypical perceptions? Or could it have been that there was some info out there that was perhaps not confirmed but helped spur on the imprisonments -- info the general public didn't have at the time? Again, that info could be totally bogus and unconfirmed -- but was it OUT there exerting some influence in parts of our government?<br /><br />Malkin's book answers my question. She presents a wealth of info about intelligence that was out there -- controversial reports that some say have been discredited and others defend -- that suggest SOME policymakers had some info they considered to be specific. What can never be resolved is whether that info made its way to the top levels of FDR's government and was actually responsible for the policy.  Or whether the info was solid, flawed or just plain wrong. But there WAS some info floating out there. Did this justify the imprisonments? Since you can't confirm that this specific info she cites is actually what led to specific decisions, not really. But her book documents a POLITICAL CONTEXT that existed at the time.<br /><br />Is this the perfect case for racial profiling? Not really. But she makes the case that some factors might be considered in policy making. Is this a flimsy book? No. About half of it is comprised of the raw documents and secret reports she uses in the book, and copious footnotes. Another plus is that Malkin is an excellent writer so it's not dull.<br /><br />Finally: Do I agree with her on other issues? Not always. I disagreed a lot with her on some things during the presidential campaign. But she answered the question I've had since I was a school kid. And her book is a useful addition to what was being alleged in some government circles at the time. For someone who isn't on either polarized side of this highly emotional, personal issue, this was a worthwhile and well-crafted read.ed and others defend -- that suggest SOME policymakers had some info they considered to be specific.

One of my favorite kinds of satire is the fake newspaper story -- one that uses the structure of REAL stories as a device to spark real roars of laughter due to the often brutal jokes that take on a special meaning in a once-serious context. I've actually dabbled in these myself, in my early years as a journalist, on my website's previous (now defunct) satire section and now on my existing wenblog.<br /><br />NO ONE does this form of satire better than Andy Borowitz. PERIOD. I never met him. I never exchanged an email with him. But I'm going to buy all of his books (used if I can, to save a bit of $). Before I had my blog I'd email his stuff with a link; now I occasionally link them.<br /><br />The Big Book of Shockers is Borowitz at his best (with perhaps one overdone device; see below). You wreck the book if you go into detail, but I can share you a few of my favorite pieces: Ann Coulter's spontaneous combustion; Bill Bennett losing his wife in a poker game...and so many more. Best headline (with a great accompanying satire): CHENEY'S BRIEF APPEARANCE, RETURN TO SECURE LOCATION MAY MEAN SIX MORE WEEKS OF WINTER and BUSH REBUFFED BY MODEL UN.<br /><br />This book is a GREAT Christmas gift. Why? Borowitz, like the super topical satire group The Capital Steps, isn't doing one-sided partisan satire. He lampoons EVERYONE. And his professional comedy writing experience shines through in each gem of a satire because he's the very best of his genre: each satire has a beginning, middle and an end, and there are no wasted words. Just laughs. You can gift this book to anyone who follows the news or politics -- it doesn't matter if its a Bush supporter or a Kerry supporter (or a Nader supporter).<br /><br />The only device that doesn't quite work is a running gag -- a perhaps due to the fact that I have a blog and read so many outrageous blogs that it didn't seem all that outrageous to me. You may react differently. This \\"blog\\" is also the only one that breaks the format of this book's pieces -- satires of news stories.<br /><br />Prediction: if you read this, you'll order more of his books. And that's no joke.ormat of this book's pieces -- satires of news stories. <br /> <br />Prediction: if you read this, you'll order more of his books. And that's no joke.	2004-12-02

I have successfully used Amazon.com to assemble a great collection of Mike Royko column books, which I read periodically. To backtrack, I used to work as a fulltime journalist and am now in entertainment...but am doing some writing for $$ these days as well as an increasingly popular weblog.<br /><br />I LOVE politics and I LOVE humor -- and Dowd's Bushworld is a MUST OWN for you if you look politics, analysist and humor. Why? Because she's the logical successor to Royko. True, Royko did a lot more columns about local events, quirky events, major political figures -- and Dowd focuses mostly on her old haunting ground, the political beat. But what she does -- mixing fact, often screechingly funny sarcasm and humor, with a clear political point -- she does much better than anyone on the scene.<br /><br />If you're a fan of columnists, you have to have this book. If you like politics but don't want to read a long treatise, you have to have this book (most entries are short). If you're a young person interested in satire or opinion writing that is less dependent on name calling than on wit and scathing sarcasim, you have this book. I'm all over the place politically, so I don't always agree with Dowd but I know that she is at the top of her game and getting better every day.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about Bushworld is that you can see her evolution here -- how she has gotten more confident and daring as time has gone on.<br /><br />I had to do searches and scramble to assemble my Royko collection. One day young journalists and writers will do the same for Dowd's work. No one comes close to what she does -- and you can admire her, even if you disagree with her.	2004-12-02
US	52992914	RPYUQCQ9KMF4M	1400061016	696961016	The Godfather Returns	Books	5	61	83	N	N	GREAT CONCEPT For And Execution (no pun) Of A Spinoff	Egads, I've jumped into a hornet's nest on this one, but I have to be frank: I LOVED THIS BOOK.<br /><br />I loved Puzo's original Godfather book. The first two Godfather films (I will politely skip over the third) are among my top favorite films. Plus, I'm a huge fan of The Sopranos, own (and reviewed) The Soporanos book of scripts, the Sopranos cookbook.<br /><br />Yes, I read the tepid reviews about this book, but I wanted to see for myself what the latest attempt to keep the saga alive entailed. And I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED -- in fact, I could not put this movie down -- given some (but not all) of the reviews in newspapers and here on Amazon. Here's why:<br /><br />1)Stylistically, it's a fun book to read. There are very few spots where it lags.<br /><br />2) The main concept seems to be to plug in all of the holes that exist in the first book plus the first two movies. So some things that simply happen are more completely -- and masterfully - filled in.<br /><br />3)Portray of Michael is right on target with the books and films.<br /><br />4) Sinatra fans (and I am one of them) may not be too pleased (I gave the author a pass on this one) because Johnny Fontaine is expanded upon as a character, with a story line directly adapted from the real story about allegations involving Sinatra's ties to the Mafia, the Kennedys, his career revival with the legendary Nelson Riddle, and his ultimate disappointment by being shunned by JFK, who he worked so hard to elect.<br /><br />5) A JFK surrogate character also runs throughout the book, with a story line tied to what happened in the JFK administration...even a quickie hint at why (in the context of the story) JFK would later be assasinated.<br /><br />6)Fredo: He's a major character in this book. A lot of gaps are filled in that help explain a lot about this character and, again, the author manages to have it all coincide with the original book and the two classic films.<br /><br />So I have to say: I didn't read this expecting the author to channel Puzo. I bought and read it because I love the Godfather and was prepared to read a chapter or two, then sell the book on Amazon marketplace. Instead, I read it and finished it while visiting relatives in Florida and am gifting it to my brother.<br /><br />I don't generally get through all nonfiction. This one was easy, enjoyable -- and a MUST for Godfather and Sopranos fans.didn't read this expecting the author to channel Puzo.

Daniel San Miguel, Jr.'s The Winter Of My Years is a pleasure from page to page. It's a modest sized book (28 pages) but do NOT let that fool you: each page is packed with poetry that makes you think, touches you and leaves you wanting to read it again and again.<br /><br />This is one of the books I travel with, and I may gift it to a relative. The San Antonio resident tackles such subjects as Remembering Baseball, his Purple Heart, Life As A River,  and the title of his book The Winter Of My Years.<br /><br />I don't want to give it away, but I'm sure you're going to want to read A Memorable Experience over and over again. It's more of a parable than a poem and it'll stay with you permanently.<br /><br />And then there is what I consider his greatest achievement: Memories In My Hands...as he looks at his hands, and ponders what they've been through all of his life. Again, GET the BOOK and read it for yourself. Not only will you want to read it, you'll want to gift it.<br /><br />His writing is simple, yet determined. He doesn't mince words. The Winter Of My Years is about experiencing, surviving, and savoring life in all of its stages. Some wonderful things can come in small packages.	2004-08-27

It doesn't matter what you do for a living -- you're going to read in this zippy book of interviews a bit about how people (mostly writers and entertainers) went from point A to point Z...and how they stuck to their guns in doing it no matter what.<br />Stylistically, there not a thing to dislike about this collection. The interviews are from The Onion A.V Club (entertainment section) and cross generational lines. Everyone from cultural (and it is weird) icons such as Bob Barker, Henry Rollins, Harlan Ellison (the guy's charisma comes across with every word he spits out), Mr. T., Roger Corman, David Lee Roth, Conan O'Brian and many others.<br />There isn't a single solitary misfire in this collection and the subjects are so diverse there is something for everyone and every age group.<br />Two profiles stayed with me for days. One was the  interview/profile of 1950s-1960s satirist Tom Lehrer, who dabbled in his art, wrote a limited number of classic pieces (available in a great Rhino collection here on Amazon), then walked away from his satire...and has absolutely no desire to perform ever again. And the other was The Unknown Comic, who performed with a bag over his head (something some known comics might consider doing, given their acts). His anecdote of an elderly and furious Frank Sinatra threatening him for poking fun at him -- then nearly having a stoke as he wouldn't believe it was THE REAL The Chairman of the Board -- is a show business classic. (It was only when he got a phone call out of the blue from Milton Berle that he knew it was for real; and he says he later learned that Sinatra was looking for someone to teach him a painful physical lesson).<br />It's like having these folks sit in your living room, shed their famous identities, share a bit about themselves, and give you some valuable lessons on the importance of sticking to your goals (long range or quickly improvised ones) -- and to your own PERSONAL ART, whatever it may be. If I could give it 10 stars, I would...Well, I'll stick to it: 10 STARS.T, whatever it may be. If I could give it 10 stars, I would...Well, I'll stick to it: 10 STARS.	2004-06-17

President Kennedy Has Been Shot combines the best of &quot;oral history&quot; (long-quotes from people who were there rather than a long newsmagazine-style narrative account) plus a pull-out-all-stops CD...that puts you BACK in 1963, even if you weren't born yet.<br />  Where was I? I had just finished a (terrible) speech to run (unsuccessfully) for jr high school vice president. I was self-absorbed after my first-ever serious public speech. Right after I spoke a teacher got up and said something, there was a gasp and people filed out to the buses (it was time to go). I asked a teacher what happened and he said the title of this book: &quot;President Kennedy has been shot...&quot;<br />  It doesn't matter if you lived through this time or not. The highly-detailed reminiscences plus excerpts from things said at time time -- coupled with the effective use in the book of text of key audio-news tracks on the incredible CD -- make this highly compelling. And you're shoved into 1963, whether you were alive then or not, when you hear the CD's radio and television news bulletins, the shooting of Oswald -- but especially the loud, shocked GASP from the crowd when the Boston Symphony's conductor tells the crowd that the President was assasinated. And then you hear the mournful gasp as he says he will play a funeral march...<br />  It's all there in the text and the CD. Including things you didn't know at the time: authentic audio of Lady Bird Johnson's dramatic diary dictations, tapes of private phone calls by Johnson to J Edgar Hoover, Rose Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr, and a slew of news correspondents trying to cover a story. In the text you see how they covered it; in the CD you hear how some of them emotionally lost it.<br />  This is THE amazingly-priced multimedia packet to get anyone who wants to learn more, recall, or learn for the first time about what happened on that awful Nov. 22, 1963 and on those wrenching days after it. The CD is worth the price of the book and CD; the book is worth the price of the book and CD.<br />  I was reluctant to buy this at first.

One of the biggest is that since it came out in 2002 (it is now in paperback too) it has proven more correct every single day. If you've heard some of this information before or read some of it before it's mainly because this is the book that clearly has been the authorative source for many of journalists (I was a journalist and know how that works!)who do not attribute their on-the-air brilliance to the fact that they read this book. It's all HERE. And more and more of this book is proving to be correct every single day.<br />  The latest sign of author Rohan Gunaratna's solid scholarship, analysis and nuts-and-bolts-inside-info in Inside Al Qaeda has been displayed on the front page of the Los Angeles Times which ran a story about how the terrorist organization is undergoing a &quot;major shift&quot; in strategy -- mutating into more of a decentralized network, relying on an array of regional and local allies to launch more frequent attacks on targets. If you read the book before,  you KNEW that this network was in place -- and that this development was coming.<br />  Guanaratna painstakingly lays out the huge worldwide network of terrorist groups that are directly or indirectly allied with Al Qaeda. He breaks it down into regions and countries. In fact, this book is a virtual directory: see an event in the newspapers, then look it up in this book and you have all the background to sound like an on the air expert (but  you won't get paid big bucks).<br />  No, it does not read like a novel. But this superb book is highly readable  -- reading like a straightfoward newsmagazine report. There is not a word of filler or ideological rhetoric in it -- the author only lays out....facts. When he states that there is no evidence of a solid connection between Iraq and 911 he has 100 percent credibility due to what has come before. He's NOT proclaming it due to any political agenda.<br />  The book details it all: the bloody and highly political rise of Osama Bin Laden, Bin Laden's motives and goals (basically achieve a political goal by garnering a high victim body count, and whether that includes civilians, women, children or Muslims is absolutely irrelevant); the skyrocketing rise of militant Islam; how slights from fellow Muslim national leaders created and radicalized the Al Qaeda into a terrorism Frankenstein; an account of 911 from an operational standpoint; predictions on what is likely to come; and the highly detailed profiles of various cells.<br />  To those who are not sympathetic to Bin Laden or Al Qaeda's political goals (in other words, those who do feel upset if they see innocents intentionally murdered to make a political statement)this book is depressing, as it documents Al Qaeda's highly fluid and adaptable &quot;multidimensional&quot; nature -- which you now see in newscycles each day. Nor will it vanish soon. Writes Gunaratna: &quot;Al Qaeda's leadership, membership and supporters firmly believe that everything happens according to God's will.&quot;tails it all: the bloody and highly political rise of Osama Bin Laden, Bin Laden's motives and goals (basically achieve a political goal by garnering a high victim body count, and whether that includes civilians, women, children or Muslims is absolutely irrelevant); the skyrocketing rise of militant Islam; how slights from fellow Muslim national leaders created and radicalized the Al Qaeda into a terrorism Frankenstein; an account of 911 from an operational standpoint; predictions on what is likely to come; and the highly detailed profiles of various cells.<br />   To those who are not sympathetic to Bin Laden or Al Qaeda's political goals (in other words, those who do feel upset if they see innocents intentionally murdered to make a political statement)this book is depressing, as it documents Al Qaeda's highly fluid and adaptable &quot;multidimensional&quot; nature -- which you now see in newscycles each day.

No, I didn't feel ripped off by this book at ALL... in fact I have read it four times already on trips and I love it.<br />The book culls key dialogue from four seasons of the Sopranos and puts them in chapters headed by a piece of  immortal wisdom of the Tao Te Ching, the ancient Chinese text underpinning Taoism. YES...there are larger issues in the show's various scenes. And if you're a fan then seeing these larger issues, plus recaping your favorite moments, makes you realize again how much good WRITING is required in television (and film) to bring off an enduring hit. You realize that it isn't actors schitck that sustains the Sopranos but gem-like scripts that have big themes in them.<br />The Taoism is merely a device that gets this point across. Plus, it also serves to wet readers' appetites to find out more about Toaism itself, which isn't a bad idea.<br />The only reason this book shouldn't get five stars is this: there is really no explanation in it about various characters quoted in the key scenes used to illustrate the short Tao material heading up each chapter. So Sopranos fans, or anyone who has an even modest knowledge fo the show, will understand who is saying what -- but a non-fan or non-viewer will have trouble figuring out who the character is who is in each scene. Bottom line: GREAT book for any Sopranos fan who wants to enjoy the show's best moments and consider larger issues than sex, betrayal and violence. A bit confusing for non-Sopranos fans.	2003-11-09

But some things can be honestly said:<br />1)It focuses on people who try to answer the question What Should I Do With My Life. A great &quot;high-concept&quot; title for a book.<br />2)It is no way, by no stretch of the imagination, a self-help book that's going to help you ponder this question, take a survey and reach a conclusion. It's highly stylized in its writing and organization.<br />3)The book is as much about the author -- injected in the book throughout, as a character -- writing the book and meeting the people he interviews as much as the subject and the people he interviews.<br />4)It's very much a first person narrative book. Some chapters leave you unsatisfied. Some leave you satisfied. Some chapters seem like expanded diary entries.<br />  Bottom line: Don't buy this expecting this is going to greatly help you arrive at the answer to this question, or read comprehensive pieces about people who struggled with this question and arrived at the answer (which would help you arrive at the answer).<br />  Buy it if you want to read about some people who have dealt with this issue and about an author who writes about his writing project writing about people who struggle with this answer.<br />  It has the title of a typical self-help book...but it isn't. Which will be welcome news to some readers and a big letdown to others. Dale Carnigie, it ain't...	2003-10-10

A major publisher's book would more likely be a \\"best smeller\\" than a \\"best seller,\\"  with little \\"cross-over\\" (non-ventriloquist) appeal --  a nostalgia piece with little relevance to modern day generations.<br />  They said it couldn't be done. And DreamWorks' animation maven Kelly Asbury,  author of Dummy Days, has proven them totally WRONG. Dummy Days matters-- and it works on every level.<br />  Dummy Days is a book with INCREDIBLY wide appeal. In wonderful, painstaking detail, Asbury takes you through the lives of the 20th century's greatest \\"belly talkers\\" Edgar Bergen, Paul Winchell, Jimmy Nelson, Senor Wences, and Shari Lewis. Lovingly crafted bios of these five performers (plus mini-bios on variety show host Ed Sullivan and legendary dummy builder Frank Marshall) make you feel you actually KNOW them personally, and you learn  surprising never-before-disclosed details about them and the evolution of their acts.<br />  But the underlying and skillfully developed subtext is the entertainment industry's brutal, take-no-prisoners evolution through the early to mid-late 20th century and how top \\"vents\\"  adapted to it, then largely vanished from mainstream entertainment media's radar screen once Sullivan's landmark CBS TV show (a vaudeville show) was canceled in 1971.<br /><br />  Dummy Days is a book about highly-adaptable performers' sometimes roller-coast-like lives -- but it's also a vital entertainment history book. This makes it of interest not only to<br />ventriloquists and aspiring ventriloquists, but to ANYONE seeking to understand modern  entertainment's  roots -- from vaudeville, to radio, to vaudeville-influenced early TV. Each<br />time a dominant new entertainment medium eclipsed the previously dominant one, tastes shifted and successful performers had to adjust (their attire, their act, their persona) to survive.<br /><br />  Asbury, a highly acclaimed children's author, focuses on the five most famous ventriloquists:<br />--EDGAR BERGEN: He details the father of 20th century ventriloquism's evolution, from his adaptations to survive, to his big breaks, to his poignant last show and death shortly<br />afterwards. \\"For the first time in the history of ventriloquism,' he writes, \\"the art took a non-visual form'' with Bergen's hit radio show featuring life-like, carefully-etched characters. Asbury answers the raging question about whether Bergen ever had good lip control and shows why Bergen was the Gold Standard for ventriloquists.<br />--SENOR WENCES: A loving look at what Asbury calls the \\"surrealist\\" Spanish ventriloquist. An Ed Sullivan darling (48 appearances), Wences was pitchforked into national cultural consciousness by his hand-as-puppet Johnny and his head-in-the-box Pedro. Asbury tells you  HOW and WHY these beloved 20th century characters came about . Superb account of Wences performing into his nineties (he died at 103).<br />--PAUL WINCHELL: The chapter is  bittersweet since so little remains of pioneer Winchell's wonderful  TV work. A great account of Winchell's rise from talent show contestant, to TV star, creator of innovative puppet/ventriloquism techniques, and interest in medicine, which led him to invent the first patented version of the artificial human heart. According to Asbury, Winchell, known as \\"The Television Ventriloquist,\\" shaped early TV and \\"practically invented the idea of children's programming.\\"  .<br />--JIMMY NELSON:  Called \\"Gentleman Jim\\" by peers, Nelson, who Asbury calls  the \\"consummate professional,\\" is most famous for his early TV work and legendary Nestles commercials with dummy Danny O'Day and dummy dog Farfel (N-E-S-T-L-E-S).<br />He recounts the accident that won Nelson the lucrative Nestles contract, propelling Nelson into ventriloquism (and advertising)  immortality. This most affectionate chapter traces<br />Nelson's big breaks, savvy adaptation to changing venues, and key role in helping keep ventriloquism alive by ceaselessly promoting it, the Vent Haven ventriloquists' convention and<br />encouraging every aspiring ventriloquist who approached him (he even encouraged some like ME to go into ventriloquism fulltime).<br />--SHARI LEWIS: The most poignant chapter, due to her untimely death. Asbury calls the former Phyllis Hurwitz \\"the First Lady of Puppeteering.\\" He offers NEW insights into why Lewis dumped using a dummy for sock-puppet Lamb Chop,  how she tirelessly worked other entertainment areas when her TV worked ended, her extending her art beyond ventriloquism, and her work to educate kids.  Superb account of a talent successfully re-inventing herself.<br />  With its rare photos, short  articles,  multi-colored pages -- even page-corner animated flip photos so ventriloquists and dummies move -- Dummy Days is a feast for the eyes. From Dummy Days' meticulous research, to its superb writing, and creative design, Asbury gets everything perfectly right.

If she lapsed into the same &quot;sin&quot; that she contended those on the left indulged in, there was still the main argument and she made her case relatively well.<br /> In Treason there is the Good News and the Bad News.<br /> The Good News is that once again she has written a highly lively book, and done lots of research.<br /> The Bad News is that this could be titled Slander since it is has lots of name calling, accusations, etc. aimed at the left -- and indulges in what Coulter seemingly decried in her LAST book (this time aimed at her political foes).<br />  To put it simply: if you're a conservative and believe your opponents have taken stances that hurt U.S. security, or are traitors and have been traitors, you'll absolutely love it. If you're a moderate or liberal and believe people may differ on policy without being traitors, you'll absolutely hate it. If you go into it with an open mind it won't convince you because of all the name calling and demonization, the same kind of thing she argued against in her last book.<br />  Treason will be great for those who agree with Ann Coulter, won't win over those who have open minds but aren't into name calling, and will be totally ignored by those who disagree with her. It IS a lively book, but you have to enjoy books written by authors who seem as if they're perpetually angry.	2003-07-04

One scholar likened  his style to \\"high journalism.\\"<br /><br />  His books are crammed with important, painstakingly footnoted and painstakingly accurate research (quite an oddity these days when some print and broadcast journalists seem more akin to editorial writers, creative writing students or highly imaginative novelists). And he wraps up all his research, statistics, and quotes with thought-provoking concepts. Basically, Franda's books combine serious journalism with solid academic research.<br />  In Internet Development and Politics in Five World Regions, he tackles one of the 21st century's biggest potential themes with his usual thoroughness and crystal-clarity. And, as usual, an incredible amount of vital information is packed into a relatively short space (some 243 pages).<br />  This book has too many fascinating conclusions to go into here. But Franda notes that \\"the twin inventions\\" of the Internet and World Wide Web more than anything else \\"seem destined to spread the information revolution throughout the world.\\" Yet, for \\"most people and countries of the world, becoming a significant player in the information technology revolution remains far in the future.\\" In fact, he writes,131 countries in 1999 had less than 0.1 percent Internet connections.<br />  The bulk of his book focuses on places where Internet related technology \\"has been less advanced\\" and has run into resistance from \\"cultures, nondemocratic governments and<br />poorer societies that do not view it in the same way Western nations do.\\" Meanwhile, he writes, the \\"better-off...worse-off\\" gap between nations has widened as new income, international diplomatic and political power sources are created.<br />  Chapters cover topics such as aspects of African cyberspace; Internet Cultures in Israel and the Arab World; the Middle East and the Global Internet Regime (including a section on Islamic and Arab Nationalist websites); Information Technology and Political Cultures in Eurasia; The Internet's political economy in Eastern Europe; Internet Politics in the former Soviet Union and other Central/Eastern European States; plus a fascinating chapter on China and India (Franda has been a longtime expert on India)  as potential Internet Superpowers. Then he ties it all together with The Internet in Comparative International Perspective.<br />  One final note: I was so impressed with this book that I'm gifting it to my nephew, who is in college majoring in computer/Internet studies. And I'll soon reading two other<br />books Dr.  Franda has written on related issues. This book is recommended to anyone who wants to understand the Internet's impact, potential impact, and to students, business leaders and governments who seek an overview of what Internet development has come to mean to five key world regions.

Wilde's book contains insightful interviews with late 20th century top comedians and Ajaye hoped his own Comic Insights would be along the same lines.<br />  In fact, Comic Insights, a book containing interviews with some of the early 21st century's comic geniuses, is as good as or even better than Wilde's wonderful and still  timely book.<br />  The reason: Comic Insights contains not only great interviews but also specific and concise advice on standup comedy performance technique -- complete with easy-to-review notes at the end of key chapters. It's one of the best books ever published on the subject.<br />  Comic Insights is required reading for ANYONE remotely or seriously interested in performing comedy, key comedy techniques, the comedian's mind-set, goal-setting,<br />perseverance, the need to be YOU onstage and -- a crucial subject incredibly ignored in most comedy books ...TIMING.  Hopefully it'll be reprinted periodically, like Wilde's<br />book. If it isn't and you don't have a copy then you'll be out of luck because you'll be missing a vital potential comedy tool.<br />  This book was so fascinating, easy to read, and had so much good information, facts, performing tips and inspiration  that I virtually defaced it with my colored-marker underlinings and little notes written in ink. Any second the Book Police will (rightfully) arrest me .....<br />  The first section is one of the most readable  explanations of key standup tricks of the trade ever written. If an aspiring comedian uses some of these principles it could save him years of bombing. Ajaye also includes helpful review notes at the end of each of these sections.<br />  There are far too many superb tips to list here, but  a few include studying WHY top comedians are funny; studying the use of timing, body language and visual effects. The importance of recording and analyzing your act. And, critically, the importance of being yourself in performance and act content: \\"The hacks can steal your joke but they can't steal the way you look at life,\\" he writes.<br />  Peppered throughout are the BEST written explanations (from him and other comedians) on timing EVER  published. He points to the famous (and sadly not re-run) eternal master of timing Jack Benny and notes that timing is a way to \\"light the fuse\\" on a<br />joke, by taking a pause to deliver a punchline. Don't  \\"be afraid of silent moments,\\"  he advises, and wait until a laugh naturally subsides before moving to another joke.<br /><br />  The second section includes a wide range of the 21st century's top laugh-makers (again too many to cite here). Some key highlights include:<br />---LOUIE ANDERSON, a master of setting up routines, using his eyes, space and silence, inspired by Jack Benny. Anderson says: \\"The secret behind timing is to hold whatever you're going to say until you absolutely have to say it.\\"<br />--ELAYNE BOOSLER on the importance of taping an act, listening to it, analyzing it and enhancing it..<br />--GEORGE CARLIN'S great explanation of how evolved from a jacket-and-tie comediandoing stock, standard jokes in front of people who he realized where his parents' friends into a comedy icon for his own and younger generations by changing his jokes, dress<br />(getting fired for it) his attitude -- and the way many comedians forever would do  comedy.<br />--ELLEN DEGENERES & PAUL  REISNER: The slowing down joke delivery.<br />--JAY LENO: The importance of learning jokes (he has no joke file) and goal setting (you should be able to make standup within 7 years work).<br />--CHRIS ROCK: On the importance of writing NEW jokes to take any comedy career to the next level.<br />--ROSEANNE  & JERRY SEINFELD: The importance being disciplined toconstantly write down ideas (on anything even napkins), jokes, concepts and then sit down and translate those ideas into actual performable material.<br />--GARY SHANDLING: Persistance. He bombed for 5 years but never gave up.<br />  The third section is especially useful since managers, club owners and agents tell what they seek in a comedian. Talent Agent Irv Arthur, among other things, notes the importance of total preparation to be ready for the big break when it comes.<br />  This superb book, especially if read together with Greg Dean's wonderful Step By Stepto Standup Comedy (also available on Amazon), could save aspiring comedians years of frustration and tears....and it tips off civilians to what's really lurking behind the curtain of that comedy wizard of the Oz called \\"the comedy club.\\"stantly write down ideas (on anything even napkins), jokes, concepts and then sit down and translate those ideas into actual performable material. <BR>--GARY SHANDLING: Persistance.

I was recently on a flight and sat next to a guy in his early 20s who sat there fascinated, reading it during the entire 3 hour flight.<br />  Gangs of New York is NOT  your typical book on which a movie is based. If it's bought by someone who loves the film somebody is going to be in for a monster surprise (or disappointment).  Don't expect a plot, don't expect compelling writing, don't expect a large section on which the book is based and to easily find those sections. But do expect to be fascinated.<br />  WHAT THIS IS: This is a book about: early brutal gang warfare, during a time in the 19th century where gangs literally swarmed all over New York City; blow-by-blow bloody battles and legendary gang fighters in a city virtually in the grip of gangs -- leading  to the creation of the NY City Police department; and the politically dominating Tammany Hall machine's birth and growth in the 19th and 20th centuries, set within the context of a politically corrupt, violence-prone city.<br />  Most interestingly, it's about a time in NYC's history that you seldom see portrayed in films or in books. I found the accounts of the 1863 Civil War draft riots absolutely gripping. But mostly it's about the gangs with names such as  Dead Rabbits, Plug Uglies etc (the film used these names too). Many illustrations are old-style drawings rather than photos.<br />  WHAT IT DOES: Gangs of New York gives you a good history seemingly based on interviews and mountains of old newspaper clippings, most of it in anecdotal versus dry statistical form.<br />  WHAT IT IS NOT: It is not a book written in a modern prose style, but it isn't boring. It doesn't have a \\"plot\\" with a beginning, middle and end. No, it doesn't have a hero, or anyone resembling Leonardo, a love subplot, etc.<br />  But if you're interested in the acclaimed movie's source material and learning about  a fascinating and often forgotten period in NY City's municipal history you'll love it. Even though it was out of print for many years The Gangs of New York has been a legend itself for many years -- and it easy to see why.IT IS NOT: It is not a book written in a modern prose style, but it isn't boring.

You can't really say READ since there is no text. This book lives up to its name: it's just, soley, only comprised of screechingly funny photos of people with reaaaaaaaally BAD HAIR.<br />Most of these unexplained pix clearly come from old hairdresser photos or product books put out by hair products. Most of the photo subjects are supremely self-absorbed -- thinking they look handsome, beautiful, cool but actually are, to use a modern word,  &quot;dorky.&quot;<br />The humor is not only in the truly rotten hairdos, or rather, the hair-don'ts. What's funny is how these folks think they look so good, proving that some peoples' taste lies exclusively in their mouths. You will be convinced that these model photos are really stills from Saturday Night Live or Mad Magazine -- but, no, these models enjoying Nirvana (how &quot;great&quot; they look) and the horrors on their scalps are for real.<br />SO THE QUESTION IS: What use is a book that has no text and that only shows vile and putrid hair? Well, it makes a good and unusual gift. It's hard to see anyone selling their copy since it is the perfect &quot;bathroom book&quot; (right next to the mirror). Some of these follical creations are unfortunately not out of style. Looking at it will boost anyone's self-esteem (unless they are in the book). And if you have enemies give them a copy, paperclip a page and say, &quot;Hey, I saw this and it reminds me of YOU!&quot;<br />So remember, this is a book you won't have to read -- just look at...and you'll laugh (unless you see an old photo of yourself or see a hairstyle that looks like what you have today).<br />Bad Hair is just that -- a book of photos showing bad hair, proof of the eternal triumph of bad taste and a convincing argument that, in some cases, Bald is indeed Beautiful...	2003-01-14

When you heard about the Sopranos Family Cookbook did you think it was just a gimmick -- that the recipes were either too difficult or not real recipes for real Italian cooking? FUHGEDDABOUDIT!<br />  Or did you think it would be merely a recipe book with little or nothing of interest to Sopranos fans, a boring book of recipes? GEDOUDDAHEAYH!!!<br />  The Sopranos Family Cookbook is a great concept -- such a masterful idea that you almost wonder why they didn't think of it before (actually they did, but only this year moved to \\"merchandising\\".). It's a WONDERFUL stand-alone cook-book, that includes some recipes that are simple enough for someone like me who feels like Wolfgang Puck after pouring reheated Ragu on pasta. There are BOTH simple and ornate authentic Italian recipes galore, carefully spelled out -- even instructions on the BEST way to cut garlic (it gives you the three ways, depending on the strength of the taste you want and tells you to  avoid garlic presses and garlic powder which is \\"mayonnaiser behavior.\\").Tony's chef friend, Artie Bucco, who supposedly compiled the book, also gives various tips on things such as choosing olive oil and wines.<br />  Photo-illustrated \\"interviews\\" with key cast characters deliciously season this book and they'll be a (non-homicidal) scream for Sopranos fans. In other words, you truly get TWO BOOKS in and one and can buy (or with great confidence GIFT) this book as a functional cookbook (for a beginner cook or an experienced cook) or as another one of the quickly emerging great books on what some call TV's greatest show (the other GREAT new book is David Chase's book of Sopranos scripts from the first three seasons, also available on Amazon.com).<br />  It's impossible to list all my favorite recipes here, but  JUST a few include: Marinara Sauce, Bistecca Piaaziola, Giambotta (vegetable stew),  Janice Soprano's Vegetarian Baked Ziti, Standing Rib Roast (the one I want to perfect), Baked Ziti with little meatballs,  Baked Chicken with Potatotes, Lemon and Oregano, Baked Chicken Cacciatore, home-de Ah Beetz (pizza), Ceasar Salad, my parent's favorite Spaghetti Puttanesca...and many more.<br />  Sopranos fans (and cooks who want to also enjoy READING a cook book) will love the interviews with Sopranos characters. My favorite is with Tony's imported-from-Italy henchman Furio Giunta who says  he doesn't like the food in America: \\"First, you use too much sauce on your spaghetti.  Very bad. Too soupy. Can't taste the pasta, the semolina...They you do something really stupid. You drink cappuccino after dinner!\\"<br />  And then there is Janice Soprano; \\"I grew up in a typical Italian-American family of that era and milieu...I was in charge of setting the table, given the artistic touch that I, alone among my siblings, possess...My mother Livia Pollio Soprano was a typical stay-at-home-mom...\\"<br />  Just remember: one day you may be in your kitchen, nearly whacked by culinary disaster, pondering a too-difficult or too-simplistic cookbook, echoing the same exact words as Tony  Soprano in the final scene of the episode Pine Barrens: \\"Why does everything have to be so hard? I'm not sayin' I'm perfect, but I do the right...thing for my family. Doesn't that count for anything?\\"<br />  If your family hates your meal it won't. The Sopranos Family Cookbook makes it easy, authentic...and FUN.

You drink cappuccino after dinner!\\"<br />    And then there is Janice Soprano; \\"I grew up in a typical Italian-American family of that era and milieu...I was in charge of setting the table, given the artistic touch that I, alone among my siblings, possess...My mother Livia Pollio Soprano was a typical stay-at-home-mom...\\"  <br />    Just remember: one day you may be in your kitchen, nearly whacked by culinary disaster, pondering a too-difficult or too-simplistic cookbook, echoing the same exact words as Tony  Soprano in the final scene of the episode Pine Barrens: \\"Why does everything have to be so hard? I'm not sayin' I'm perfect, but I do the right...thing for my family. Doesn't that count for anything?\\"<br />     If your family hates your meal it won't. The Sopranos Family Cookbook makes it easy, authentic...and FUN. Trust me...or else...	2002-10-08
US	52992914	R3VDS0WYOIQ4TI	0140544518	276032073	The True Story of the Three Little Pigs	Books	5	51	52	N	Y	GREAT book for not only kids but ADULTS..trust me!!	I'm STILL chuckling after buying this book and reading it before gifting it to my nephew Greg, 11, and Kayla, 7. And,. as with other books by Jon Scieszka, the huge problem is: I want this book for MYSELF.<br /><br />The bottom line is that in his version, wonderfully illstrated by Lane Smith, the Three Little Pigs is the ultimate story of SPIN CONTROL. This time, unlike in a zillion other versions, the wolf is telling HIS side of the story -- what REALLY happened. And to hear him tell his story (with all of the familiar elements and a delicious economy of words) it's all a terrible mistunderstanding about his allergy, his desire not to waste food, and distortions by the press.<br />None of this gives any of this away, since the genius of this is not only in the conception, but in the TELLING of the story. Don't consider this just a book for kids. You can EASILY gift it to friends, relatives, favorite (and unfavorite) politicians and members of the media. It's the perfect late 20th-early-21st century retelling of the story, with the wolf as the poor misunderstood victim (of the police, the media, and his health  etc). Just like the old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, this works on two levels so the adults will be as delighted as the kids by this story -- which could easily have run as one of Mad Magazine's better pieces.<br />Get it for the kids, read it for yourself...and get ready to realize what a great gift this would be for adults of any political persuasions. LOVED IT so much...I hate to give this to the kids! Kids of ALL ages will love this story, whether you read it to them or they read it themselves (so will the kids under 40 years old).	2002-09-29
US	52992914	R1R4118XLV9QP7	0446679828	220090698	The Sopranos (SM): Selected Scripts from Three Seasons	Books	5	17	18	N	Y	GREAT writing...GREAT READING...shows why this show is GREAT	A truly GREAT dramatic or comedy program requires great writing and great performing. If one ingredient is missing, it falls short. This has been evident when great performers leave superbly written dramas or comedies and get into a mere star vehicle...and fail. Just look at the hapless Seinfeld cast: highly talented  performers were cursed with poor or fair material. They simply could not \\"go home\\" again.<br />  David Chase's book of Sopranos scripts is an example of superlative writing -- writing so GREAT that these scripts read like a novel. Even if you've never watched the Sopranos, these scripts will make it hard for you to put this big-sized paperback book down (and not read it AGAIN). And, most interestingly, these scripts show you how multi-layered this program is -- and leave some tantalizing questions open for YOU to decide in a more informed and satisfying way than if you only quickly viewed the final filmed product.<br />  It's just as compelling reading these shows as watching them -- except that here you get the compete stage directions, directions to actors about their characters' motivations,<br />emotions and expressions. You catch every single hilarious zinger (many of which can't be posted here since it's a family site!) and every single foreshadow or callback symbol (the ducks, symbolic in the pilot, fly overhead in a V formation during the College episode) that you may have missed. This is a SUPERB book for Sopranos fans and non-Sopranos fans alike since it starts with the pilot episode, introducing the characters and the premise of a family man Mafia boss from a dysfunctional family who is in psychiatric analysis.<br />  This book also includes four other all-time most fascinating and gripping Sopranos episodes: College (Tony takes his daughter on a college interview, sees a mob informant and strangles him); The Happy Warrior (Tony tries to keep childhood pal David Scatino away from his gambling operations but his friend insists on sneaking  in, gets in debt, and his FIRST payment is his son's SUV, which Tony unsuccessfully gifts to his horrified daughter); The Knight In White  Satin Armor (Tony's mistress tries to do herself in while Tony's sister Janice shows a genetic lack of impulse control by murdering her abusive newlywed mob husband); and Pine Barrens (the famous tour de farce with Christopher and Paulie getting stranded out in a cold forest after a botched attempt to kill an agile Russian gangster).<br />  In his introduction, Chase notes how his ideal is that each episode stands alone as a separate film, a goal not always achieved but achieved in each of these selections, especially College. The writing's quality  shines through with each line, each description -- even built-in directions on dialogue's timing. Some other highlights:<br />--PACING: When sister Janet angrily shoots her new hubby the script aims for something fast and furious. It comes across much more jarring on film.<br />--THE SHOW'S CREATION: Chase explains how each episode has at least three separately written strands that are literally cut and scotch taped into the script so plotlines go back and forth. Noting that The Sopranos was rejected by all four networks, Chase calls its exile to HBO \\"the best thing that could have happened because there's no way that the show we now see could have wound up on the screen of network television.\\"<br />--NUANCES: Judge for yourself exactly how even at an early juncture Tony's not-so-Mom-of-the-year Livia wanted to see him bumped off. The scripts also bring out the lust and final-restraint in Tony's wife Carmela's wannabe affair with \\"schnorer\\" family priest Father Phil and Tony's suspicions. \\"What did the two of you do for 12 hours? Play name that Pope?\\" Tony asks her.<br />  Like a great symphony, the final page of this book's final script (Pine Barrens) has a theme bringing this book full circle when a frustrated Tony asks his psychiatrist: \\"Why does everything have to be so hard? I'm not sayin' I'm perfect but I do the right...thing for my family. Doesn't that count for anything?\\"<br />  Read the Sopranos book of scripts...then YOU decide...ot sayin' I'm perfect but I do the right...thing for my family.

US	52992914	R2X211KX0QC8FY	074322423X	268598033	Self Matters : Creating Your Life from the Inside Out	Books	5	105	108	N	Y	Right on target: Dr. Phil's system is easy and it WORKS	I'm one of the few who has not seen Dr. Phil on TV except for brief bits and I have not read his other books. I bought this book because of its title, good reviews, and because I was undergoing severe problems with relatives that forced me to do research. Buying Self Matters was the BEST DECISION on a self-help book that I  EVER made.<br />  Dr. Phil's main point is simple:  a person may be unhappy and tormented by internal pain but we create our lives \\"from the inside out.\\" We have one shot on this earth and face a simple choice: are we going to live our lives as we would truly like to live them or are we going spend our time here being defined, \\"typecast,\\" hammered down, discouraged, de-energized  -basically, CONTROLLED -- by outside forces(relatives, friends, expectations and past events)? Do you live according to what he calls the \\"authentic self\\" or do you live a life and identity others have given you, much like a casting director fills a part? And how to do you find out what you REALLY want and who you REALLY are (not how friends and relatives typecast you)?<br /><br />  Here are several big reasons why you MUST buy Self Matters:<br />1. DR. PHIL WALKS THE WALK:  He changed his life. Originally  he'd start each day unexcited, not proud of who he was since \\"everything I was doing was chosen to please other people by meeting their expectations while totally ignoring my own...I knew I wasn't living the life I was meant to live.\\" He realized he had \\"betrayed who I was and instead accepted a fictional substitute that was defined from the outside in. I betrayed myself, and mine was a life and an experience that was a fraud and a fiction.\\"<br />2.HE GIVES YOU SPECIFICS THAT IMMEDIATELY GET ANSWERS:  He writes<br />in \\"tough love\\" style, including exercises and tests that help you take stock of who you REALLY are. He helps you  painstakingly trace the key influences in your life, defining moments (good and bad), influential people, pivotal choices you made that led to who you are now -- and then shows you how to make NEW choices and create NEW behaviors to create new, more productive results...and live the life you were truly MEANT to live.<br />3. USE IT AS POTENT MENTAL SELF DEFENSE for when people try to force you into roles or define you as THEY wish to define you -- whether in the job they expect you to do, the personality traits and flaws they insist  you to have, the negative predictions they make about you or your success. \\"You can't be you if you don't know you,\\" he writes.<br />4. IT WILL CALM YOU: Living for your fictional self, he writes, \\"is a dangerous state of being that diverts, absorbs, and robs your life energy.\\" People  \\"sell out\\" and get used to \\"living an assigned role, rather than living \\" to who they really are.<br />5. IT HELPS YOU DISRUPT MENTAL TERRORISTS IN YOUR LIFE: He teaches you to be acutely aware of the negative mental \\"tapes(values, beliefs and experiences) constantly playing over and over in your head, limiting you. And, most IMPORTANTLY: how to detect \\"life scripts\\" that others may be forcing on you --a set of instructions telling you how to run your life, based on THEIR fixed beliefs...including how things will turn out for you (more often then not you are given the message that you will fail or risk or change is doomed and these will be stated to you as FACT and reality).<br />6. MY PERSONAL TESTIMONY ON HIS IDEAS: Twelve years before reading this book I quit nearly 20 years in journalism to become an entertainer (ventriloquist). I now realize in reading Self Matters that I  unknowingly had applied his techniques. They WORK. And I have no regrets. But the biggest problem I have since faced are \\"tapes\\" still playing in my head, put on \\"play\\" by others, who constantly also bombard me with the life's scripts drawn up many years ago, defining me THEIR way.<br /><br />  I bought Self Matters while being battered by relatives' life's scripts. These activated my internal mental \\"tapes,\\" bigtime. Reading this book  saved me from  immobilizing depression this summer. After reading Self Matters, to my genuine surprise, I could quickly pinpoint when the internal \\"tapes\\" played, and when I was being pressured to be the character cast in one of their \\"scripts\\" (typecast in countless ways). I realized it did not reflect reality. Today they still try to define me with life scripts drawn up decades ago. But it's harder for them to succeed : I know who I am INSIDE -- and it's not who they think I am. I think they'll just have to cast another actor....

US	52992914	R50DYL61AHYJ8	067003116X	215020323	Report from Ground Zero: The Story of the Rescue Efforts at the World Trade Center	Books	5	13	15	N	Y	Vivid, stunning & haunting...a CLASSIC	Can a book about a tragedy move you even more than highly-compelling television documentaries which allow you to relive the moment in images and interviews? The answer is YES. Report From Ground Zero by retired New York City firefighter Dennis Smith has haunted me for months. I found it absolutely riveting -- except I could not read this in long stretches it was so tragic, so horrifying...yet, in the end, so inspiring.<br /> The TRAGEDY: the book's first half contains mostly rescue worker first-person accounts of what went on during what author Smith calls \\"the saddest day of our history,\\" a day with \\"no center...no middle...no end\\" but \\"collapsed into that single instant at 8:48 a.m.\\" when the first tower was hit. You WILL cry when you read it. You're going to feel you now personally KNOW the anguished -- and outraged -- people telling you what happened and you will see, through their eyes, what took place, feel their losses, visualize the people they knew who gave their lives, and be absolutely determined that this can never happen again.<br /> The HORROR: film and tape can only show what is captured on film and what time (2 hours etc.) . But these extensive printed accounts bring it even closer to home -- and go on in detail, with no time constraints. There are so many accounts it's impossible to even condenses them here, but here are a few quick key highlights that show how incredibly compelling the written word can be:<br />--Bob Humphrey, Engine 4: \\"I watched about 20 people jump. I heard them land, but I couldn't see them. It was good I couldn't see them....\\" When the South Tower collapsed, he writes,  \\"it was completely black. I couldn't see. I had no mask and no light, and it was hard breathing...\\" When north tower collapsed \\"the force lifted the cars off the ground and set them at all angles. I jumped down to the street and covered my heard. It was too terrible. Too much.\\"<br />-- Firefighter Frank Vaskis, after the explosions:  \\"There are body parts all around....\\" -- and it describes them.<br />--A firefighter walks to where the fire command is supposed to be and  \\"as building 2 comes down this great wind comes, chops me to my stomach and basically pushes me all the way back through the same window I came through.\\"  It's pitch black for a<br />while....then gray, like a massive black and white photo...then cloudy.<br />--Nightmarish descriptions of the relentless PLOP! PLOP! PLOP! as the towers' floors systematically collapse, becoming huge concrete pancakes.<br />--People fruitlessly looking for  loved ones. A firefighter whose son is a firefighter asks: \\"Have you seen my son?\\"<br /> The INSPIRATION: No matter what, these firefighters and rescue workers plowed ahead, strictly focused on saving lives, not obsessing over the threats to their own lives. And how, in the last part of the book, even when the worst rescue work was over they worked at the building, removing debris, painstakingly sifting through all of it in the hopes that maybe someone might still be alive and that those not alive might be identified.<br /> There are tons of books now about Sept. 11. This is one that'll be required reading in history classes 100 years from now...and hopefully will be used as a motivational book in military classes for many years to come.ound....\\" -- and it describes them.<BR>--A firefighter walks to where the fire command is supposed to be and  \\"as building 2 comes down this great wind comes, chops me to my stomach and basically pushes me all the way back through the same window I came through.\\"  It's pitch black for a<BR>while....then gray, like a massive black and white photo...then cloudy.<BR>--Nightmarish descriptions of the relentless PLOP!

US	52992914	R3NG0UNZ9T6KPO	0060514558	921401083	Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism	Books	4	111	181	N	Y	Makes his case well -- with minimum slash-and-burn	America has come full circle. Before  radio, television, and the Internet, highly partisan political writings were the rage  -- and vital campaign tools. By the mid 20th century partisan political books were published, but had  limited commercial appeal. Now, in the early 21st century, politically skewered books are raking in millions as they are pitchforked to the top of best seller lists.<br /><br />  These books include Michael Moore's Stupid White Men (left), Bernard Goldberg's Bias (moderate-to-right), Ann Coulter's Slander (each day more and more clearly the work of someone on the far right), Bill O'Reilly's two books (moderate-to-right) and now Sean Hannity's Let Freedom Ring (classically conservative). These authors don't claim to be objective (although Coulter's book title and theme suggested she was trying but she has undermined her credibility due to her slashing style and joke about wishing Timothy McVeigh had blown up the New York Times).<br />  These black-and-white-no-gray-areas-allowed books (on the right AND left) are written for The Choir. Those who don't agree are painted as totally wrong,  dangerous, dumb or insidious. So: can Sean Hannity make a case to independent voters (like me) and convince Political Infidels that perhaps some of his arguments are correct? Actually, I think so. I LOVED most of this book.<br />  Hannity makes the conservative case well, with a minimum attacks on his foes character, sex-lives or motives. He only undermines his case when he reverts to<br />all-who-disagree-with-us-don't-care-about-security-education-or-values mode, but the bulk of the book is less about attack than making scoring points (although in a book the foes can't argue back).<br />  \\"Our (conservative) views are consistent because we believe in absolute truths and in the essential soundness, even righteousness of the founders vision of government,' he writes. \\"...The left may be sincere, but they're sincerely wrong. And they must be challenged and defeated if we are to win this war on terror and preserve our way of life for this and future generations.\\"<br />  He says Democratic/liberal polices are \\"not just wrongheaded; they're reckless\\" but stresses that \\"I'm not saying that liberals...and many of the elitists in academia and the media are evil. I'm saying they have a disturbing habit of winking at evil, or ignoring it, or turning a blind eye to it. And in doing so they put us all in jeopardy.\\"<br />  Especially interesting parts:<br />--His argument that the Clinton administration dropped the ball on a series of terrorism-related issues and a chance to get Osama bin Laden..<br />--His contention that from the 70s on there was a \\"vast left wing conspiracy\\" to defang the CIA, despite warnings that it would leave the US unprepared.<br />--His career story, how he was infuriated over Oliver North's treatment during Iran-Contra and therefore became a vocal and provocative talk-radio show caller, then decided it was his life's calling. His national radio show debuted Sept 10, 2001 -- and due to his style and 911's tragedy became a hit.<br />  Like all the other books on the right and left, his key flaw and a strength with those who already agree with him  is when he lumps all opponents together, discounting that they might wish to improve things, too. The Democrats, he says, \\"turn a blind eye to the country's need to boost the economy, create new jobs, find new sources of energy and become more self sufficient\\"  -- never suggesting that perhaps  they merely seek a different approach to making things better.<br />  To Hannity, all Republicans act due to their  firm values; all Democrats act on focus group results. He insists national security should \\"remain above politics\\" but steadfastly defends White House political director Karl Rove's urging Republicans to run as the best party to safely protect Americans in wartime.<br />  Even so, Let Freedom Ring IS a homerun since even for an independent (like me) Hannity presents most of his case  without slash-and-burn personal attacks or appealing to the worst in anyone.  It's impossible to imagine Sean Hannity jokingly wishing that his those who don't agree with him be blown to bloody bits by a terrorist (right or left).<br />  In his shows and in Let Freedom Ring Hannity seemingly ENJOYS debating ideas and the political game. In this, he resembles MSNBC Hardball host and author Chris Mathews<br />and  Fox News' and author Bill O'Riley (both excellent authors)  more than Coulter or even conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh.<br />  Let Freedom Ring lambastes liberals without having contempt for or detesting them. That's refreshing and why I look forward to Hannity's next book. Hannity's not mired in an angry slash-and-burn mode -- he wants to WIN the DEBATE on values...which you can't do if your debating opponents are blown up.me) Hannity presents most of his case  without slash-and-burn personal attacks or appealing to the worst in anyone.

US	52992914	R2TPW578N18SLP	0385318375	327016821	Niagara Falls All Over Again	Books	4	2	7	N	Y	Good -- but fatally flawed -- novel	An entertainer friend of mine had mentioned this book so I excitedly ordered it on Amazon (I order everything on Amazon these days). I'm an entertainer addicted to show biz books and show biz bios (I read and collect many of them). So I WANTED to love this book. I knew I SHOULD love it. And often when I write a review there aren't enough stars to express how much I like the book.<br />But I simply can't say that about Niagara Falls All Over Again. If anything, I read this book waiting for something magical to happen -- and it never did. Yes, it is a good story by a highly talented writer about a show business comedy team's bonding and unbonding, the lives of these often complex entertainers, and the how they advance through 20th century show business: from vaudeville, to B movies, to radio to t.v. The story of the fictional comedy team of Carter and Sharp, whose show biz roles are the opposite in real life, unfolds with often wonderful writing, crisp dialogue, lyrical phrases, characters who make you (almost) care and, superb research.<br />Indeed, at times this book seems like superb research grafted onto another novel.  To be sure, research is topflight. Much of the detail about thin straight man (in the act that is)Mose Sharp is based on real-life Bud Abbott. Much of the detail about  on-screen-funny-but-off-screen-not-so-nice comic fatman Rocky Carter is based on controversial characterizations about Lou Costello (his toughness offstage; arguments over dividing up monies). Some of the facts about the team (how they met) are based on the team's history, sometimes with Carter paralleling Abbott instead of Costello (straightman Abbott actually recruited Costello). Some research also seems based on Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis (how they were the same size so one of them slumped to look smaller). And the vaudeville/movie scenes reflects topnotch research too.<br />The problem: this book always feels like a novel, like you're reading a creation. At no time did I feel I was reading REAL characters in REAL settings. Perhaps it's because of this book's truly fatal flaw: we are TOLD that this team is hilarious but at no point do we ever SEE evidence of it. There isn't a truly funny scene giving us a glimpse of why they wowed audiences and vaudeville films. We are told about these folks with the layers of research but they never come alive as true comedians. In the end, when I closed this book, I felt I had read a decent novel with lots of research...but I hadn't met characters who truly seemed to be real. In short: an interesting book based on a great idea but a big disappointment.I was reading REAL characters in REAL settings.

What other word can possibly come to mind reading The Stinky Cheese Man? I originally bought this book for my niece and nephew, Kayla and Greg. But before I gave it to them I read it myself and I simply could not stop laughing.<br />The best way to describe this to parents and adults is: it's a combination of Rocky and Bullwinkle (working on two humor levels), Mad Magazine, Mother Goose, and absolute literary anarchy. If you're an adult and have any sense of humor whatsoever you're going to laugh out loud. The best way to describe this to parents is to quote Greg, 10,  who, upon being told he'd get this book said: \\"GREAT! It has those funny stories and those crazy drawings. I love it!!\\"<br />How did author Jon Scieszka and illustrator hit on a book that truly appeals to ALL ages? The book is a parody, moving visually and in its text as fast as a guided missle, but never for one millisecond underestimating the intelligence of its kid -- or adult -- readership. My Special 10 Year Anniversary Edition of this book contained a \\"Long Lost Stupid Fairy Tale\\" printed under the cover, the Boy Who Cried Cow Patty, a take off of the boy who cried \\"Wolf.\\" (There is a less kid friendly version of this great story circulating on the internet).<br />Once you open the book (and I will not give it all away) you are immediately comedically clobbered with the Little Red Hen, who can't wait until the title page is seen to start her story and is upset with the management. Fonts, page layout, are all satirized or exploited for maximum laughs. Any kid who has ever had a fairy tale read to him/her and looked at a typical fairy tale book will get the visual joke immediately. So this book is not only a book they can read but a book that will make them WANT to read MORE...and see that reading can truly be FUN.<br />But it's the screamingly funny text and outrageously zany illustrations that have made this book a (well-deserved) legend. Even though it contains the alleged Surgeon General's stamp-disclaimer  warning that it  \\"has been determined that these tales are fairly stupid and probably dangerous to your health\\" these nutty stories are anything but  dangerous. The bottom line is that they're comedy-parodies that make all ages think, but don't require a degree to get the joke. The book succeeds from its bonus tale printed under its book cover to its final silly page.<br />Tales include Chicken Licken with its great ending (comedy coach Greg Dean writes that comedy is a \\"shattered assumption\\" and that's what we get here and it's FUN); The Princess and the Bowling Ball (take off on the Princess and the Pea); The Really Ugly Duckling (probably a truer version of this tale than has ever appeared before); the Other Frog Prince (the frog wants a kiss...but what is he??); Little Red Running Shorts; Jack's Bean Problem, Cinderumpelstiltskin; the Tortoise and the Hair; and the absolute all time classic The Stinky Cheese Man, a superb satire of the Gingerbread man with a laugh-out-loud ending.<br />This book SHOULD be titled \\"The Stinkey Cheese Man and Other Absolutely Hilarious Witty Tales.\\" If you like satire/parody and want your kids (or you) to read an upscale Mad-type take off on fairy tales, this book is for YEW! Now my only problem is: where can I HIDE this book after the kids read it, so I can keep it for myself???l's stamp-disclaimer  warning that it  \\"has been determined that these tales are fairly stupid and probably dangerous to your health\\" these nutty stories are anything but  dangerous.

Are there REALLY people who consider human life as cheap as a crow's feather (or considerably cheaper)? The events of the past year aside, just Read My Forbidden Face. Your answer (y-e-s) is HERE.<br />  This book is written by Latifa (a pen name),  a 22-year-old woman who details how her life was \\"confiscated\\" from her by the Taliban in Kabul when she was 16. This compelling and super fast-read (and no, the fact it's a translation does not diminish its impact one iota) raises several issues: the way women were treated under Taliban rule, the low value placed on human life, how countries  become pawns of other  countries -- and how books are so much more effective than film. t.v. or cable in communicating a real life horror story through the eyes...and thoughts...of a young dismayed woman.<br />  Bit by bit she recounts how, as a teen indeed influenced by Western culture's music and cultural figures (she had a poster of Brook Shields on her wall.) her world was turned upside down when the Taliban, taking advantage of warring factions and supported by Pakistani intelligence and the United States, hijacked her country.<br />  Banks closed. Radios and t.v.s were literally shattered to smithereens by the new fundamentalist rulers. Tangles of once-innocent cassette tape became bittersweet symbols, she writes, \\"hanging in the trees, swaying in the autumn breeze like sinister wreaths.\\" Spies were everywhere. A Taliban-supporting mother  went crazy after her son was brutally was beaten to death by the new regime's thugs for his heinous crime -- playing a VCR. Teenage boys were forced to slap other teen boys as punishment or face their own, even more brutal punishment.<br />  Talifa recounts  this systematically and you get a sinking feeling as she goes on about women being beaten for wearing white. Women being executed in the soccer stadium for going out without a man or not dressing in  \\"chandra\\" (covering her arms and face) clothing, the wearing of which she likens  to a mobile \\"jail cell.\\" Official mutilations of the disobedient, for even tiny infractions, were routine.<br />  A highly poignant scene recounts  how she released her beloved canary, figuring it would be outlawed -- as it indeed was, along with tea kettles and any form of  whistling. Even kids playthings were taboo:\\"Poor little boys, and poor Afghanistan!\\" she writes. \\" Those kites once looks so lovely in our skies.''<br /><br />  A key triumph is how she describes her sense of loss and grief over the fact that under the Taliban the only future she faced was  being a virtual  house prisoner. As a girl, she<br />dreamed of being journalist, but the regime banned careers or education for women. A highly effective passage recounts precisely what it was like for a young woman to stay<br />home, supremely bored, looking at every nook and cranny, and having to \\"wander around my home like  a convict taking a tour of her cell...This time they're really killing us, killing<br />all girls and women. They're killing us stealthily, in silence..''<br />  In the end, the gang rapes of women, the executions, the daily horrors manifested by the draconian Taliban decrees did not terrorize her as much as spark courageous defiance, so she got involved in an underground school to give youngster a chance at a non-Taliban education.  When this book was published she was living in exile in France. More gripping than any cable or television special, more dramatic than any movie, this quick-but-vital read is a MUST. Read it, gift it, pass it along...and never forget it as more daily events unfold.it as more daily events unfold.	2002-08-23

When I first saw this book I hesitated figuring it'd be fluff or despite its hype just another celebrity book.<br /><br />  The  Right Words At the Right Time is neither. Its skilled editor Marlo Thomas has painstakingly assembled short essays about life changing words, and life changing moments, from 100 top cultural icons, thinkers, politicos, celebrities and achievers from various fields and has created a life changing book. This is one of the BEST inspiration/life's lessons books I have ever read (and I have read all too many). Do I really feel this way? YES. I will be gifting this over the next few months to four or five (mostly young) people.<br />  Most essays are finely-honed three-page or so jewels, about what made someone famous or prominent go from Point A (where they were) to Point B (where they are now). Sometimes a negative person or negative comment inspired them to persist. Sometimes a healing word or act, or a kind comment made while they were in crisis became a turning point. Only a few essays are wastes of time and most aren't pompous (I hate to say it as a former journalist, but the pomposity factor is highest on journalists' essays here).<br />  You can't summarize 100 essays in a short review, but here are my top three favorites (and this does NOT include their whole story) to give you an accurate flavor:<br />1. Boxer Muhammad Ali: He reveals where he got  the idea for his \\"I am the Greatest\\" schtick, and why he used it. And his essay is the GREATEST: it  recounts how a teacher once told him he would never amount to anything. So after he won the Gold Medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics he went to that teacher's class, held his medal high and told her, \\"Remember when you said I wouldn't never be nuthing? I am the greatest in the world!\\" and \\"walked out of the classroom for the last time.\\"<br />2. Today host Katie Couric: She was devastated by an elementary teacher who told her \\"Katie, you smile too much,\\" but her father told her to use those words \\"to your advantage.\\" She acknowledged her smiling in running for student council...and won. Later, while working for CNN, a CNN President saw her smiling on TV and said \\"I never want to see her on the air again.\\" But she persisted, scored big at NBC and today she tells young people \\"not to take critics and their negativity to heart\\" because naysayers have their own issues. She learned to believe in herself and notes: \\"And by the way. I'm still smiling.\\" WORTH THE PRICE OF THE BOOK!!<br />3. ABC's Barbara Walters: She's clearly still traumatized by her move from NBC to ABC, where she was teamed up for the nightly newscast with a highly hostile and unreceptive Harry Reasoner on the news. When the two split, she later asked him in an interview about it and he said she was simply the wrong face in the wrong place at the wrong time. Her turning point came via a telegram from tough-guy movie star John Wayne who wired her \\"Don't let the (deleted) get you down.\\" Wayne's fighting words inspired her to work harder and she persisted to attain her special position, boost womens' status in broadcast journalism and get a nice salary. She learned Reasoner was wrong: \\"By hanging in there and working hard I could make the time and place my own.&quot;<br />  Not all are by news/media stars and their lessons are diverse. Other standouts include tennis great Bill Jean King (realizing how she helped women; actor/comedian John Leguizamo (how a high school teacher who believed in a wiseacre student steered him to comedy and acting); TV writer David Kelly (how hockey great Bobby Orr's recognizing him when he was a kid and shaking his hand changed his life); Supreme Court Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg (how her mother-in-law's wedding gift changed her personal life and helps her cope on the court); former NYC Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (911 essay stressing how surviving life is what should be constantly celebrated), and more.<br />  There is literally something for everyone: CNN Foreign correspondent Christiane Amanpour's tale of how she was literally laughed at by producers when she said she wanted to do foreign news and persisted and won; Mel Brooks, on how a Warners Bros executive's advice helped him risk being politically incorrect, thus unleashing creativity that brought him fame, honors and a historic number of Broadway Tony awards;former President Jimmy Carter, on how a teacher changed his life; Senator John McCain on what he endured in captivity; Beatle Paul McCartney on how Let It Be was created and who inspired him; singer Carly Simon, on overcoming stuttering.<br />  There are too many to list here. Get it, read it -- and gift it. The best, most solid book of its kind.

See No Evil is a great read. In fact, it reads like a great spy novel...except the scary part is: it's TRUE.<br />In the book's intro investigative reporter Seymour Hersch calls See No Evil \\"yet another body blow to the reputation of an agency(the CIA) that failed to protect America when it needed to be protected.\\" That is an understatement: this book confirms seemingly unconfirmed reports immediately after 911 about the CIA's flawed performance, and confirmed reports that have come out in several media outlets since then. This book is a GREAT --and vitally important -- read.<br />  Baer suggests some horrific forces were at work that helped the 911 plot succeed -- forces more terrifying than  the terrorists lurking in Afghanistan's caves and releasing<br />videos on Arab television, more hideous than sleeper cells in the US waiting to launch a bloody strike at their leaders' signal, more hideous than weapons of mass destruction.<br />These insidious forces were bureaucratic cowardice, careerists who didn't want to rock the boat (even if that meant the boat would be blown up along with the rest of the US),<br />unrelenting beltway wars, petty squabbles, and good old fashioned office-politics that gave personal agendas precedence over our national security agenda.<br />And, in the back of it all, he suggests there may be a hidden hand that the CIA and oil-influenced American interests do not want completely revealed: the hand of the Iranian government, manipulating and perhaps supporting terrorists in some of the worst acts of terrorism of the 20th and 21st centuries...using surrogate states and groups to carry out its hidden terrorism agenda and maintain a cloak of deniability.<br />See No Evil starts with a quick pace and never lets up. It traces Baer's decision to apply to the CIA, his training and stints in various countries. Baer outlines  how, with a sinking<br />feeling, he became disillusioned by the CIA's growing unwillingness to focus exclusively on protection and issues instead of politics. This started BEFORE the Clinton<br />administration. But by 1994, with Clinton in power, he writes, the CIA \\"seemed to be doing little more than flying the flag..\\" What happened to the agency  \\"didn't happen just by chance,\\" Baer writes. Rather, the  CIA was \\"systematically  destroyed by political correctness, petty beltway wars,  careerists and much more.\\"<br />Baer uses fascinating, detailed  high and low profile cases to show how the CIA's action-oriented  mid 20th century man was by the end of the century, more of  \\"a kind of see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, do-no-evil\\" individual who did not want to take real risks.<br />Basically, some employees (especially supervisors) were now more akin to Motor Vehicles Department bureaucrats than James Bond agents.<br />Baer's s turning point was the 1993 explosion of the American Embassy in Lebanon. He also gives a shocking account of how a tip he tried to give superiors on  a plot to kidnap agent Bill Buckley, the CIA's Beirut chief, was ignored, leading to Buckley's murder.<br />  Baer discusses the implications of 911, noting that in the end \\"\\"intelligence boils down to people\\" needed to give the US secret info to anticipate future attacks --  and the CIA is<br />still woefully lacking in this department. See No Evil's credibility is boosted by various sentences and words blackened out in the book's  by the CIA under the censorship agreement he signed when he became and agent.  It is also increased by Baer himself, who has been an impressive \\"talking head\\" on various television news shows. In all, See No Evil is GREAT read that will answer -- and leave you with -- a lot of troubling questions.and issues instead of politics. This started BEFORE the Clinton<BR>administration.

Fans of The Sopranos, the Godfather, and mob/crime fiction/nonfiction will find this Clint Willis-edited book a virtual Hometown Buffet of delicious crime treats. If you like mob fiction/nonfiction and don't read this you deserve to wake up with a horse's head in your bed.<br />A sign of this book's huge success is that it truly leaves you wanting more. You'll be so fascinated that you'll DEFINITELY want to go to each of the primary sources and read them too. It's a fast, fascinating read: chapters comprised of well-edited excerpts from books, magazine articles and two works of fiction.<br />I was especially fascinated (and motivated) by the excerpt from the fictional (I think) Godfather. I read the book when I came out, saw the flicks a zillion times but realized in reading this excerpt how great the original book was and how it differs from the movie (the Michael character actually seems stronger in the original story). I'll be re-reading that book soon.<br />Every chapter is a gem and there are too many to go into here. My favorites included Peter Maas' excerpt from Underboss, the story of Sammy the Bull Gravano; an excerpt from mob hitman &quot;Joey's&quot; book Killer (the code of honor, precisely how he makes a  hit with such efficiency and low risk); part of Nicholas Pileggi's Casino, describing how a horrified businessman one day found himself cemented to mob-connected business partners; Defending the Mafia, the eye-opening and ultimately sad story of mob lawyer Gerald Shargel's use of his considerable talent to keep mafiosos out of jail; part of Boss of Bosses, the bittersweet saga of aging Don Paul Castellano, eventually murdered by ambitious John Gotti's skilled associates; and the saddest and most poignent piece of all, Jeffrey Goldberg's The Don Is Done, about the lives of children of bigwig mafiosos.<br />This book MOVES. And it'll send you scrambling to read more. A MUST to read or to gift.	2002-07-30

It's incredible that such a HUGE treasure chest could fit into such a physically tiny book that can literally fit in the palm of your hand (and a pocket). Don't make the mistake of typecasting  Taro Gold's tiny hard-cover book for one of those books that have a drawing and a short line on each page. Quite the contrary, this little book is CRAMMED with useful, short and profound gems from Eastern thought that can influence (or ease) your life. One page might have three or four lines, another a full page. And each message is profound (some more complex than others). The philosophical WEIGHT is huge for such a tiny book. And the size is PERFECT: you can carry it in your carry-on when you go on an airline (which I do) or in your pocket (which I do) when you travel. And it makes a SUPERB gift, especially to a high school or college graduate. Just remember: it's small in size -- and GIANT in content.	2002-07-24

People don't want to give \\"the (domestic political) enemy\\" a full hearing, let alone even partly CONSIDER a foe's arguments, even if they're reasoned and make actually make SENSE.<br />  It's a shame because this book (published by the conservative publishing house Regnery, which is itself like waving a  red flag in front of a bull for some people) is so engaging,<br />well-written, convincing and solid that Dinesh D'Souza may one day be considered a modern day Alexis de Tocqueville.<br />  Three fascinating levels mark this highly perceptive book:<br />1. D'Souza, who became a US citizen in 1991, shares how his life would have been quite different if he had grown up in his native India.<br />2. He makes  fascinating observations about how US life and culture differ from various parts of the world, especially the Third World. These are the ones future generations may consider on the same level as de Tocqueville's.<br />3. And then there is material directly related to the book's title. He makes the case, in a nutshell, that other cultures (especially fundamentalist Islamic) detest the United States<br />because Americans are inner-directed and can write their own life's script, while Islamic culture seeks a life controlled and dictated by others.<br />  One key conclusion certainly will not endear him to Islamic  fundamentalists. He says the Islamic world is nothing without  oil revenues.<br /><br />  \\"The only reason it (the Islamic world) makes the news is by killing people,\\" he writes. \\"When is the last time you opened the newspaper to read about a great Islamic discovery or invention? While China and India, two other empires that were eclipsed by the West, have embraced Western technology and even assumed a leadership role in some areas, Islam's contributions to modern science and technology is negligible.\\"<br />  In this book, written after 911, he concludes that terrorism is merely \\"a desperate strike against a civilization that the fundamentalists know they have no power to conquer\\" so they try to \\"disrupt and terrify the people of America and the West.\\"<br />  The book is worth its price ALONE for his observations on how American culture differs from the third world and many Islamic countries: Americans have to be convinced they are fighting a war for noble reasons; young people go away to college and don't return, whereas in other countries this would be like \\"abandoning one's offspring\\"; other cultures cherish age, the US worships youth; people welcome visitors for long periods in the Third World where Americans want to get rid of visitors within days. And more.<br />  D'Souza also takes on the \\"multiculturalists\\" who, he writes, detest the melting pot idea and  \\"want immigrants to be in America but not of America.\\" And he shows many flashes<br />of great wit. Two of them:<br />--On French criticism of the US:  \\"Many Americans find it hard to take the French critique seriously, coming as it does from men who carry handbags.\\"<br />--On calls for reparations for African-Americans (he completely DEMOLISHES arguments for reparations) he writes debating foe Jesse Jackson: \\"I found the concept of this rich, successful man -- who arrived by private jet, who speaks at the Democratic<br />National Convention, whose son is a congressman -- identifying himself as a victim of oppression a bit puzzling and amusing.\\"<br />  D'Souza  decimates critics' arguments against American foreign policy, history and culture. . But  his greatest analysis is how World War II's \\"Greatest Generation,\\" tempered by surviving the Great Depression and the brutal war, upheld traditional values by cherishing necessity and duty -- only to fail to replicate these values in their offspring who made answering their inner voices, pursing their own desires and personal authenticities the focus of their lives....until. Sept. 11.<br />  \\"Only now  are those Americans who grew up during the 1960s coming to appreciate the virtues,...of this older sturdier culture of courage, nobility and sacrifice,\\" he writes. \\"It<br />is this culture that will protect the liberties of all Americans.\\"heir inner voices, pursing their own desires and personal authenticities the focus of their lives....until.

And even though it looks like a merciless segment of mankind (terrorists or terrorists-sympathizing governments) could WITTINGLY unleash this disease that already killed millions, mankind conquered smallpox once -- and it can do so again......but it will cost many lives.<br />  Just look at some recent news stories. It recently was revealed that some Russians died during the 70s of what was suspected to have been a \\"perfected\\" form of weaponized<br />smallpox secretly developed by their own government to use against the United States. July 2002: a news story notes a US plan to immunize nurses doctors and other health workers first and provide for treatment and mass vaccination AFTER the fact. July 2002: a news story says volunteers are trying a 50-year-old smallpox vaccine in the US, where vaccinations haven't been offered since 1972 (and they wear off after 10 years).<br />  In Scourge, biological and technical weapons expert Jonathan Tucker gives you the PERFECT briefing book on how the disease works, how it is spread, how doctors have painstakingly battled to decrease its murderous capacity over the centuries, and how, in 1978 under WHO's remarkable Dr. DA Henderson, international doctors proclaimed a relentless campaign against the disease over and successful:  smallpox was completely erradicated.<br />  One of the book's most fascinating parts is how he traces smallpox's use(with little remorse) as an early biological weapon by colonists against Native Americans, by the British against Americans and others. And why not? The disease kills 30 percent of the people who get it in the most horrific, painful ways: it would literally bring an enemy to its knees.<br />  This clearly-written, fast moving book then shifts: to one of the greatest betrayals of mankind. And when the shift comes you are shocked...and sickened.<br />  Tucker outlines in great detail how the rumors were confirmed: yes, the Soviet Union had LIED -- and HAD maintained smallpox stocks and HAD worked on developing it for use as The ULTIMATE biological weapon (confirmed by recent news reports). The Soviets wanted to \\"perfect\\" smallpox as a lethal weapon that could kill up to 100 percent of the time (in other words 30 percent was too low a death rate for them) -- to spray or bomb via missile or plane to finish off an already-reeling US population after a catastrophic nuclear attack.<br />  Today, Tucker notes, it's feared that virus stocks are held by North Korea, Iran, Iraq and China. Even worse: there are fears that terrorists can  get -- or already have -- the<br />smallpox weapon. All this in a world in which countries have stopped smallpox vaccinations.<br />  PERSONAL NOTE: I can personally attest to some of this book's accuracy. In 1974, as a freelance correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, I went down to Patna, Bihar with WHO teams as they went into tiny villages to find smallpox cases, isolate them, and vaccinate other areas. It wasn't pretty. But the doctors were so inspiring: they BELIEVED they had an unparalleled medical achievement within their grasp and that, for the good of humanity, they were close to totally exterminating this disease. And by 1978 they announced that they did.<br />  But in the end, as this book shows, they -- and centuries of dedicated medical workers, doctors and smallpox victims -- were betrayed. Yes, the doctors killed smallpox. But the military and governments kept it on life support. A pox on both their houses.the most horrific, painful ways: it would literally bring an enemy to its knees.<br />   This clearly-written, fast moving book then shifts: to one of the greatest betrayals of mankind.

But it's also  flawed: to make her case that liberals and the<br />news media demonize conservatives, author Ann Coulter consistently demonizes THEM.<br />It's a shame because Coulter often makes her case but resorts to the same tactics and language that she's criticizing.  After you read it you wonder: then, what was the point?<br />  She contends our political discourse increasingly resembles \\"professional wrestling,\\" yet uses that exact style when writing about individuals and groups who she often effectively demolishes with facts. For instance, how does calling former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite a \\"pious left-wing blowhard\\" make our political discussion more issue oriented -- even if it IS INCREDIBLY funny (which it is) and may indeed be true (I would not be a bit surprised)?<br />  If you are a conservative Republican (I am not) you will LOVE Slander and want to gift it to like-minded friends. If you are a liberal Democrat (I am not) you will HATE Slander and not finish it. If you're an independent (like me) you may feel sad since Coulter, an attorney,  at times makes her case so well. But her slash-and-burn rhetoric turns Slander into a case of the pot calling the pot a pot.<br />She makes many points with wit, such as on how New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was demonized by liberals until 911: \\"After September 11, the average New Yorker faced a risk of death or bodily harm not seen since David Dinkins was mayor...The<br />characterization of Giuliani as a heartless brute vanished into thin air like the blather it always was.\\"<br />  ABC's hiring of former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulous, she writes, is \\"the equivalent of a major network hiring Chuck Colson immediately after Watergate.\\"<br />  Coulter did her homework well, using extensive quotations, facts and statistics to bolster her case on several points. A few of the many:<br />--An overall defense of Fox News Network and what happened on its election night reporting.<br />--The number of high-profile Democrats who left politics to work in the news media's upper echelons. She names names --  and  it's DEVASTATING.<br />--How opponents constantly characterize conservatives as stupid and link them with things related to Nazis to spread fear and activate their own political base.<br />--Media and liberals' exaggeration and misinformation about the Religious Right's actual power and alleged  \\"threat\\".<br />--How the media use \\"ultra\\" and \\"far\\"-right labels on conservatives but neglect to use these words, or even  \\"liberal\\" on Democrats. This is her most devastating knock-out punch, using precise LexisNexis search statistics. She effectively PROVES bias.<br />--How liberals, feminists and the news media have ignored and ridiculed  conservative author and activist Phyllis Schlafly's considerable education, accomplishments and ideas.<br />This is among her strongest sections.<br />  Yet, this section points out Coulter's problem: to boost Schlafly she simply cannot resist attacking feminist Gloria Steinem who, she writes, \\"had to sleep with Mort Zuckerman, a<br />rich liberal media mogul\\" to keep the magazine Ms. afloat. This is elevating political discussion??<br />  Her weakest contention: she writes of conservative women being branded as ugly by liberals adding: \\"Only conservative women have their looks held up to ridicule because only liberals would be so malevolent.\\"  Patently FALSE: conservatives have ridiculed Janet Reno, Chelsea Clinton, and others for their looks and conservative talk show hosts still liken Clinton administration cabinet women to the bar scene in Star Wars (by the way I love ALL this ridicule and hope it continues...but we are talking about what's FACTUAL here).<br />  Elsewhere, she writes: \\"Liberals have been wrong about everything in the last half-century\\" while \\"conservatives in America are the most tolerant and long sufferingpeople in the world...If a conservative calls you stupid, you are stupid...Liberal lie even when they call people names.\\"<br />  Coulter is definitely on the right track with Slander.

In Hope Through Heartsongs he takes his already wise, visionary, and layered poetry a step FURTHER. In his two previous Heartsongs books he showed that he was astoundingly wise (and talented) beyond his years, or beyond any years for that matter. Just take his two past books and multiply the wisdom and talent multifold -- and you have Hope Through Heartsongs.<br /> When does this young artist and self-proclaimed peace-maker's incredible personal growth STOP?? There's absolutely no sign of it yet.<br /> Indeed, Hope Through Heartsongs, clearly originally in the works before 911 took place, includes an up-to-date introduction by Mattie: \\"We cannot let sad or traumatic events, or even acts of terror, be the death of hope,' he writes. \\"That is why this book explores these issues and finds that in spite of each struggle, we can and will find hope if we choose to do so.\\"<br /> And he has clearly chosen to do so, and to urge others with every fiber of his being to make the same choice. By now you may know the story: he has muscular dystrophy and<br />lost all of his three siblings to the same disease. Several poems deal with his losses, his thinking through the death's meaning and possibility, and pondering life's meaning -- and<br />opportunities. One of the most touching poems is \\"Walking Again,' a reflection on the situation, changes and his wishes upon discovering that his beloved mother could no longer walk or playfully toss him in the air.<br /> Yet his poems are not \\"downers\\" but about hope and peace, with titles such as Beyond the Pain, Bravery Prayer, On Saying Goodbye, Examination of Faith, Just Peace, The Bigger Picture, Believing in Someday -- and many more. He dedicates this book to \\"all people who are struggling to find hope\\" and divides it into three sections: Hope for Within, Hope for Each Other, Hope for Our World.<br /> People are WRONG who call Mattie a great child poet. He is a great POET...period. In another culture he'd be a guru and would have followers far and wide. Why? Because Mattie Stepanek just doesn't speak from the brain, or even from the heart, but from deep within his soul....a very old, experienced and wise soul.ulture he'd be a guru and would have followers far and wide.

In Big Honkin Zits (hey, it's named after ME when I was 16..or 26) you can clearly see WHY this strip by Jerry Scott and Jim Borgman is one of the fastest growing and most popular strips EVER.<br />The best way to explain it is: it's on the same quality level as  Bill Watterson's Calvin & Hobbes at it's funniest, most irony-laced and visually comedic BEST. Once again we have Jeremy...the self-absorbed 15-year-old who is constantly (in his view) humiliated by his parents' mere existance (except when he lowers the posture and briefly show he really cares). The strip shows things from the adult point of view but ALSO does a good job of pointing out how a teen might view the parents (his parents ARE dorky).<br />There are several reasons why this strip is such great COMEDY, and holds up so well in a treasury form such as this. The artists use a story-line of sorts (akin to the story-line Watterson would use where a given daily strip would stand alone but is part of a group with a theme). The shorter strips work as well as the longer ones. As in Calvin & Hobbes we often see things from the teen or parental view in the form of a fantasy (his father dressed like a clown; Jeremy with huge ears after his girlfriend mentions his ears are big).It's a strip that shows character evolution: his girlfriend finally gets her braces off; he goes to his first real rock concert; sneaks into his first teen porn film etc.<br />But above all it's the world-class visual comedy, character facial expressions and actual irony-heavy comedy that makes this strip among the best EVER. Since there are tons of strips I'll share one that is my favorite. Jeremy's mother reads an article that says \\"the average teenage boy thinks about sex once every eight minutes.\\" They look at each other and each says \\"Wow.\\" She thinks: \\"That much?\\" He thinks: \\"That's all?\\"<br />You're going to want to read Big Honkin' Zits again and again and each time you're going to laugh as much as the first time.

Perspective. Common sense. Trusting your feelings. A  reality check. Those are the watchwords of Gavin de Becker's highly informative, lively and supremely reassuring Fear Less. If I had the money I'd send this book to everyone I know...and especially to those who assign and edit terrorism stories in the broadcast/cable news media.<br />Touted as \\"real truth about risk, safety and security in a time of terrorism\\" his main message (in my words here) is essentially this:\\"Whooa! Wait a minute: look at the FACTS and take a deep breath.\\" It's a message that needs to be delivered more than ever, after the recent announcement about a suspect's arrest for reportedly looking into making a \\"dirty bomb.\\"<br />De Becker contends  that in battling terrorism everyone -- citizens AND policy-makers -- can better contribute (and react) if they are more attuned to their intuition. Intuition is not only using common sense, but also being keenly aware of subtle bits of information that spark uneasy feelings. Still others believe intuition is a kind of spiritual voice. Whether it's about your neighbor, someone you see getting on a plane, someone leaving a package in a mall, etc. the author argues: TRUST and MONITOR these little intuitive alarm signals...and don't be afraid to ACT on them (tell authorities and risk being wrong).<br />This book starts out with a story about about a terrorist plot  sound just like one in the year 2002...except that it was a  Nazi terrorist plot against the U.S. foiled during WWII. He points to times in history when all seemed bleak...yet the U.S. always survived. And what was so shocking at the time quickly became the new reality: people accepted it and lived with it, and moved on...until the next horror topped the last (and then that was accepted, etc).<br />In a superb chapter titled Apocalpyse Not Now he debunks myths about biological, chemical and nonmilitary nuclear attack. His point: yes there are indeed WORST CASE scenarios but the realities of what would likely happen, the difficulty of making it happen, and the actual impact if it were to happen are not as simple or catastrophic as the news media may make them sound.<br />The best chapter isin which in No News At Eleven, he debunks many qualifying and hype phrases used by the news media, especially broadcast and cable networks. His advice: turn off the TV and READ MORE PRINT news. He spares no one (he especially feels Fox News tries to heighten drama) and notes that his criticism of broadcast and cable journalism is aimed mostly at those who make the CHOICES of what to put on and how to package it to attract maximum viewership.<br />  \\"Every word you hear spoken is another choice, every image, every color -- all choices,\\" he writes. \\"Combine the words, the graphics, the logos, the music, the urgency, and what you end up with is information hidden behind sensation -- and the sensation is fear.\\"<br />  PERSONAL NOTE: I worked in the news media for nearly 20 years, as a freelance journalist overseas (check my reviewer profile) and then as a newspaper staff writer. There is definitely a news cycle to stories. And fear often generates bigger stories than reassurance. So PLEASE take a deep breath and read Fear Less.

LOVED IT!!!<br />  I'm one of those people who read Calvin & Hobbes when it was at its peak, but sadly took it for granted. You can't give a book a greater tribute than to say it makes you want to order the person's OTHER works....and we should be grateful Bill Watterson's output for this now-defunct classic strip is still available in book collections. And this collection is one of the BEST.<br />  This book works on several levels...or, should I say, works PERFECTLY on several levels:<br />--THE HUMOROUS LEVEL: The humor remains of a \\"cutting-edge\\" quality not seen in many comic strips (today's strip Zits is a great one). But it's humor that works on several levels, a la Rocky & Bullwinkle: adults  get \\"more\\" of the hilarious verbal and (quite frequently) non-verbal jokes while kids get enough so they love it, too.<br />--THE CRAFTSMANSHIP LEVEL: This book, originally created as a catalogue for Sunday pages on display at the Ohio State University Cartoon Research Lab, boasts his original uninked black and white drawings (you can even spot some White Out!) on the left side and the completed \\"product\\" (fully inked drawings) on the right side. You can see how each strip evolved. You soon realize that color selection is in itself a vital crafts/artistic decision.<br />--THE ARTISTIC LEVEL: Watterson has a SUPERB 7-page essay about his strip at the beginning of this book. But there's a LOT more to learn as you go through the strips. Under each completed strip he explains a bit about what he was trying to do: why he changed \\"okay\\" to OK, how he tried depicting personalities, how a given strip's characters became more three-dimensional, his experiments with verbal and sight jokes, how a strip was inspired by local scenery, his struggle over what kinds of pads to put on the tiger's feet ..even his attempt to use cubist art in one strip.<br />  How do I know this book works on several levels? As I write this my 10-year-old nephew Greg is visiting. He immediately took this book, looked at it and said, \\"Oh, I've seen these! I love this!\\" and wanted to read it NOW. He was fascinated by the notes under the strips...and I told him that this is a book he can not only read for pure FUN but can also probably read for reading credit at school, since this is much more than \\"just\\" a Calvin and Hobbes collection...which in itself would be better than many comic collections on the market.

Musician. Producer. Businessman. Composer. Arranger. Determination and incredible talent skyrocketing him over big obstacles. It's fitting that Jones' biggest passion is music because this outstanding autobiography truly SINGS.<br />  From the first pages, you're thrust into the drama -- and challenge -- of Jones' life. Born into a poor family, throughout most of his life (well into his adult years) Jones struggled with how to cope-with and at times how to distance himself from a mother who suffered from severe mental illness. Music became his savior and Jones embraced it like the stable motherly love which he sought and he lacked as a child. He embraced Mother Music, letting it's beauty embrace, comfort and sustain him.<br />  There are several things that sets this book apart from other show biz bios and makes it such sheer JOY for readers of ALL ages (old fogies like me who grew up with his music as well as young folks interested in music, interested in biographies or interested in show business and the arts in general):<br />1.PANORAMIC STYLE. There is so much in it that we can only list a little here, such as the poignant vignette of a young, arts-smitten Jones, just discovering his musical &quot;chops&quot; and bonding with a blind teenage musician named Ray Charles who basically mentored and inspired him; his later associations with greats such as Sammy Davis Jr, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson and many many more.<br />  Jackson, he writes, &quot;wanted to be the best of everything&quot; so he &quot;went to the top model in each (show biz) category to create an act and a persona that would be unequalled.&quot; But &quot;somehow later on the line between the reality and the fantasy got blurred.&quot; In the end, Jones writes, Jackson became &quot;a total sponge, a chamelon.&quot; Jackson practiced hours and hours to perfect every single move, gesture and facial expression.<br />  I am haunted by Jones' portrait of Sinatra. For all the tough-guy accounts elsewhere, Sinatra comes across as a noble and principled human being -- cooking Jones breakfast when he learned that Jones stayed up all night working; insisting that African-American musicians for his Vegas concert be allowed to play and get good rooms at a casino and telling his security to do significant bodily harm to any racists who harrassed them, even the slightest bit.<br />2)SECOND VOICES. Not all chapters are written by Jones. He also let others write their accounts about parts of his life, and not all of this material is complimentary. This adds a documentary feel and a sense of balance that most show business autobiographies lack.<br />3)USEFUL OBSERVATIONS. In his chapter on Michael Jackon's rise to the top of the music heap he notes that writes that he learned that &quot;Nobody stays at the top. Nobody.&quot;  Success, he writes, is &quot;about preparation, then finding the right<br />opportunity&quot; -- and that he learned that &quot;being chronically underestimated can be a gift.&quot;<br />  Jone's autobiography takes you through the 20th century's top musical and show business eras, and gifts you an incredible cast of famous well-etched cameos. The depth, ease, and detail of this panoramic journey is paralleled only by his private trek -- from poverty to aspiration to success, all amid personal family tragedies.

If Dr. Suess could order from Amazon.com from where he is now, he would be rolling -- with laughter -- in his grave. Al Franken spoofs the title of The Doctor's hit book and sticks it to the many self-help and inspirational books along the way.<br />  Franken is the early 21st century's perfect satirist, mixing late 20th century irony with HUGE vaudevillian, television and comedy club-style belly laughs. I liked this book better than his most popular book, Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot. Franken's genius is that he never overexposes himself so each book is a deliciously fresh comedy morsel -- and he keeps getting better, more perceptive and FUNNIER.<br /><br />  The laughs start early, when he talks about his pipe-smoking, good-humored father and how \\"this quantity time spent with my father, laughing and coughing phlegm...inspired me in choosing my life's work: making people laugh and raising money for the American Lung Association.\\"<br />  Chapter titles are hilarious. Among the many: \\"OH! The People You Must Trample to Get Ahead!\\" \\"Oh! The Weight You Will Gain,\\" etc. He throws in heaping helping of advice on such wide-ranging matters as sex, home ownership, religion, idiot bosses,<br />marriage, politicians,  international long distance phone calls (complete with area code list)-- and Northern Canada.<br /><br />  He constantly lampoons tiresome exercises many self-help books have at the end of  chapters. At the end of his chapter on advice he tells readers to make a list each night of all advice<br />given and gotten and at the end of a year \\"take a day to go through your 365 advice lists.\\"He offers observations, such as how people don't change: \\"The person you marry will be the same person you will want to murder five, ten or twenty years hence..\\"<br />  And it's worth the price of the book to read his MANY (many more than can be quoted here!)running-gag references to people such as Oprah, fired Enron CEO Kenneth Lay (\\"If an investment sounds too good to be true, Kenneth Lay is probably involved.\\") and Maria Shriver (\\"If I wanted something to read that didn't make any sense, I'd just read Maria Shriver's book.\\").<br />  And what about  conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, who provided him with considerable material (and a title) for a best-selling book? In an extensive section Franken offers this (limited) olive branch: \\"When I wrote a book calling him a big fat idiot, he lost weight and became slightly more accurate.\\"oo good to be true, Kenneth Lay is probably involved.\\") and Maria Shriver (\\"If I wanted something to read that didn't make any sense, I'd just read Maria Shriver's book.\\"). <br />   And what about  conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, who provided him with considerable material (and a title) for a best-selling book?

The Impersonal Life is being marketed by DeVorss &amp; Co as &quot;the Little Book in Which Elvis found the light.&quot; And for good reasons: it's a sound marketing move, it gets more people to read it....and this potent little book will truly help you find the (inner/spiritual) light if you are even slightly seeking it.<br />  This book has little to do with Elvis, except that he loved it second only to the Bible, handed out hundreds of copies to friends...and it enlightened and inspired him. The Impersonal Life was written in the early twentieth century by the enigmantic Joseph S. Brenner, who wrote and published it under the pen name ANONYMOUS.<br />  So what is it? Firstly, it is  definitely a little but very profound book. DeVorss' special Graceland-authorized edition (with a young and thin Elvis on the cover) is tiny enough to carry in your pants or jacket pocket, purse, carry on luggage etc.<br />  Secondly, it's basically an early 20th century version of Conversations With God, although it does not venture near some of the controversial areas that the later (and I think inferior) volumes of that contemporary book did.<br />  The Impersonal Life is also seems like a first-person work(the author speaking as that spark of divinity he contends is within all of us) that could have been written by the great Ernest Holmes, author of the landmark Science of Mind writings. Its core idea is that your mind is linked to a Higher Power so a &quot;Thinker is a Creator...(who) lives in a world of his own conscious creation.&quot;<br />  Brenner, writing as the voice of God and appealing and explaining to each reader's own divine spark, writes that &quot;every thing, every condition, every event that ever transpired was first an idea in the mind. It was by desiring, by thinking, and by speaking forth the Word, that these ideas came into visible manifestation.&quot;<br />  Why did Elvis care and be influenced by The Impersonal Life -- and why should YOU? This little book, with each of its words as potent as literary dynamite blasting away earthly mental clutter and worries, stresses the importance of belief and nonshakeable FAITH...and argues that inspiration and intuitive flashes just don't happen. There's a reason. And if you follow these impersonal flashes you can live an impersonal life....uplifted from the personal human concerns and preoccupations, better focused on spiritual concerns and increasingly empowered with increasingly documentable spiritual power.YOU?

Hanssen	Books	5	17	20	N	N	Quick moving, enlightening and masterful	Into the Mirror moves at such a break-neck pace that this book should be arrested for breaking the literary speed limit. Some may (and  do) quibble about the fact this is a docudrama -- a dramatization of a true, high profile news story -- but it is FUN, a can't-put-it-down read and highly enlightening.<br />  I\\"ve read many books this year but I will say in all seriousness: this was one of the most enjoyable, compelling books I've read all year. The story centers on FBI  Special Agent Robert Philip Hanssen, whose arrest on Feb 2001 on 15 counts of espionage pitchforked him into the headlines. I read many of the complicated, sometimes dry news reports -- but this book makes it REAL. So  when I heard he was sentenced in May to life imprisonment I had a MUCH different reaction than I would have if I had not read this book.<br />  The reason: when you hear about a spy case like this you wonder \\"how could he do this? He just wanted the money?\\" and it ends in puzzlement.<br />  Schiller's book, based on many interviews done by Schiller and Norman Mailer, and using Mailer's mini-series screenplay as a guide, really brings the story alive. It's as dramatic as<br />watching a top flight film or mini-series and more instructive than all the news reports I read on this put together. How did Hanssen get from Point A (an innocent child) to Point<br />B (one of the most destructive spys in American history and only the third FBI agent ever accused of spying)? This book provides some of the answers.<br />  There are a slew of revelations you'll find here that explain why. Just a few: constant abuse by his policeman father (lasting into adulthood); his almost sexual thrill at deception<br />and betrayal; the fun he had changing his grades in school; his betrayal of his wife, church, stated religious beliefs and best friend; his siphoning of gas out of FBI cars; his constant<br />problem with credit card debt and economic dependence on his gloating father. There are too many to go into here.<br />  The book makes sense of the whole chronology (included in the back of the book) ...and in the end you feel you KNOW Hanssen. He's NOT sympathetic.  You still feel outrage. But some puzzlement turns to pity. Hanssen was a master spy and Into the<br />Mirror is a master docudrama.go into here.<br />    The book makes sense of the whole chronology (included in the back of the book) ...and in the end you feel you KNOW Hanssen.

And if I rated it on what I liked about it I would easily give it five stars. It has very well-written and fun descriptions on various informational topics, coupled with addresses, phone numbers and websites from which you can get gobs and gobs of free information. Most of these sources are federal and state government agencies that will send you fact sheets, booklets, catalogues, and lists. And in the back of the book there is an enormously useful directory of state information sources.<br /><br />The problem is the book is advertised and titled Gobs and Gobs of Free Stuff! True, but the free stuff is INFORMATION so it should be Gobs and Gobs of Free Information.<br />I'm an entertainer and do lots of venues, including schools, so this book is going to be well used and it has already been placed in a pivotal spot on my desk bookshelf. But if you're expecting Gobs and Gobs of Free Stuff such as the stuff described on its cover (&quot;free gifts, posters, toys, videos, books, advice, travel, money and much much more&quot;) you will be sorely disappointed and feel that you did not get your money's worth.<br />Again: this is a valuable tool, is well-organized, with well-written, breezy descriptions (that are fun to read even if you're not looking for anything) and you can get TONS of information from it....but you're NOT going to see your mailbox or postbox overflow with free merchandise.

Each Challenge is on the left page of the book and written in one easy-to-understand page by Kinnear. Each one-page (spiritual) Solution is on the book's right page, next to the Challenge, and it is culled from Holmes' extensive writings with an explanation plus an affirmation.<br />  How is this useful? Thoughts Are Things not only outlines a problem but gives you the answer -- and a superb affirmation/prayer for immediate use. If you use it as prayer, there are a wide variety of topics. If you're not into prayer but are into affirmations, this book is also for you.<br />  Holme's basic philosophy is that &quot;there is a God-Power at the center of everyone's being, a Power that knows neither lack, limitation, nor fear, sickness, disquiet nor imperfection.&quot; But bad experiences, negative thinking and fear can checkmate a person's greater good....in other words, Thoughts Are Things so when negative thinking arises &quot;you must of necessity change the basic pattern of your thought.&quot; The reason: negative thinking has mental, physical and spiritual consequences: it can lead to a downward, negative spiral, while focusing instead on the reality (that positive God-center and its total power) can generate many good things.<br />  Thoughts Are Things is a manual to combat negative thinking, an antidote for hopelessness, and a roadmap for hope and fulfilling goals. PERSONAL NOTE: I'm not a member of the Church of Religious Science (but admire what it does). I started reading Holmes' more complex works in a time of crisis -- and this book was recommended to me by someone during a more recent crisis where I almost lost hope.

During George Carlin's four decades long comedy career he has been hailed as a comedic genius who has constantly pushed the envelope...and he is at his outrageous BEST in Napalm & Silly Putty.<br />If you are a Carlin fan, you will LOVE this 269-page book, take it with you and re-read it often. If you don't know who he is and want to find out what all fuss is about after reading<br />books on comedy, this will give you a good idea of who he is. You don't get his hilarious facial expressions here, or his act-enhancing body language, but you'll clearly see why he<br />has been hailed as the true successor to Lenny Bruce....except for the fact that Carlin is more often than not hilarious. If you're upset by x-rated language, this book isn't for you.<br />Napalm & Silly Putty is actually divided into three sections throughout. His various routines on various subjects such as driving, cats, dogs and Jesus, his Short Takes, and his<br />bits on the news. One of my favorites routines is his bit on the fear of germs, where he notes that \\"in prisons before they give you a lethal injection they swab your arm with alcohol...And you can see their point: wouldn't want some guy to go to hell AND be<br />sick...\\"<br />Then there are many riffs on the news. and his Short Takes. Short Takes are in the form of hilarious one liners, short jokes and blunt-but-true observations (\\"Joan Rivers has turned<br />into one of the people she used to make fun of.\\")<br />This book is GREAT for a)anyone who loves to laugh, b)fans and collectors of comedy books, c)Carlin's fans, d)anyone interested in comedy writing or comedy. I always highlight comedy and joke books, then re-read the ones I like -- and when I re-read<br />Napalm & Silly Putty I laugh out loud, all over again. Carlin is a treasure...and so is this book.	2002-05-28

In 214-fast-moving pages O'Reilly produces a fast-paced collection of commentaries on everything from politics to family, money, friendship, sex, media, drugs,(often ludicrous) celebrities -- and more.<br />What seemingly sets O'Reilly apart in his commentaries on Fox News and his shows is that although he's coming from somewhere politically, he will to look at gray areas in often black and white issues...and even concede a few points to those who disagree with him. No where is this more apparent than in this collection of commentaries artfully organized with bold-faced headers like \\"THIS JUST IN,\\" or \\"RIDICULOUS NOTE,\\" or \\"BULLETIN.\\" As in his Fox News Special on the media and America's children, O'Reilly masterfully uses media and artfully presents his material. This book is so conversational it's like you're listening to O'Reilly in his home or watching his show.<br />O'Reilly mixes facts with some bluntly-written opinion, but clearly tries to make his case and win over the reader, rather than just state it. But aside from the specific issues, I loved this book because of the way he weaves in autobiographical material about his childhood -- and about the snakepit he found himself working in when he became a reporter. In his account, he was idealistic and clearly naive and walked straight into office political buzzsaws while working as an Emmy-winning newsman for various networks.<br />My favorite chapter (which you don't usually see mentioned in a review): His chapter on the importance of cultivating and maintaining friendships. He says what some people don't want to say: friendship is a TWO WAY street which means being there for your friend and returning phone calls QUICKLY.<br />\\"Some of my old friends wouldn't make the time to keep our friendship alive, and they drifted away,\\" he writes. \\"I miss them, even though I'm annoyed by their stupidity.\\"<br />More than his other book, The No Spin Zone, in The O'Reilly Factor you get vital -- and fascinating --  glimpses into who Bill O'Reilly IS and what makes him tick. In my case, I truly liked what I found and enjoyed every minute of the discovery.e time to keep our friendship alive, and they drifted away,\\" he writes. \\"I miss them, even though I'm annoyed by their stupidity.\\"<br />More than his other book, The No Spin Zone, in The O'Reilly Factor you get vital -- and fascinating --  glimpses into who Bill O'Reilly IS and what makes him tick.

I LOVED this book which was a complete departure for me (I usually read books on entertainment, politics and various spiritual subjects)but I was in a bind: I wanted to learn how to run, and got all kinds of warnings from friends and relatives about how it could be dangerous. Meanwhile, the books I looked at either were too easy or were written for people who've run for a while. These books assumed the reader knew not just the basics or running but WHY -- besides the obvious physical advantages -- people run.<br />In Getting Real About Running, Gordon Bakoulis, a world-class marathoner, has put together a well-written, fun-to-read book that has it ALL.<br />  From the outset of this incredibly complete book (it's a cliche, but if you buy one book buy THIS ONE) the author explains the various reasons WHY people run, the kind of running &quot;high&quot; people feel, the beauty involved in running, and why people who run make it a part of their whole lives. And Bakoulis uses essays by people who explain it.<br />  It also gave me the perfect beginner walk-run schedules, plus mantras used by champions, what I'd need (equipment and physically), the dangers to avoid, the kinds of events that involve running, the pros and cons of running with others (events and/or clubs), diet dos and don'ts and specific strategies for avoiding injury.<br />  The book's design is topnotch. It boasts not only the usual white pages, but other &quot;sidebar&quot; topics and illustrations on grey-colored pages. And, above all, Getting Real About Running is chock full of information, fascinating quotes, anecdotes, scientific data and specific programs that helped educate me very quickly and enjoyably.<br />  What did it do for me? I now do some running and was also motivated by it to rejoin my old fitness club. And is this glowing review due to knowing the author or even knowing anything about running? Nope -- and nope. I chose this book strictly on a hunch, I'm a full-time ventriloquist (check out my reviewer profile) -- and the most energetic running I did as a kid was chasing after the Good Humor ice-cream truck.<br />  FOOTNOTE: A friend knew I was thinking about running and recently gifted me this SAME book.ntriloquist (check out my reviewer profile) -- and the most energetic running I did as a kid was chasing after the Good Humor ice-cream truck.<br />     FOOTNOTE: A friend knew I was thinking about running and recently gifted me this SAME book.	2002-05-10

Critics called Hardball a modern day version of Machiavelli's The Prince, it became a best-seller, and for many years was MUST reading for anyone event remotely in a political career or studying political science. Hardball also solidified Chris Mathews' role as a superb political analyst.<br />  Now, in Power Plays, Morris offers us another book with another great title -- and the content lives up to the title.  Even a person who finds politics and history a bit dull will<br />find it hard to put this book down. Power Plays MOVES...and DELIVERS.<br />  Lucidly and convincingly, Morris outlines what he calls the five classic kinds of Power Plays: Stand on Principal, Divide and Conquer, Triangulate (enacting some of your<br />opponents programs so they don't have ammunition, while still delivering to your supporters) , Reform Your Own Party, Use a New Technology, and Mobilizing the Nation in Times of Crisis.<br />  But Morris doesn't offer sleep-inducing stuff: he provides clear-cut, highly lively, quote-filled and painstakingly-researched examples of powerful politicos (in the US and in other countries) who succeeded in using, or failed because they failed to use,  these kinds of power plays.<br />  Power Plays is a primer for those in power, those who aspire to power, and those who analyze power. I suspect it'll be in print for a LONG time since much of it will  not be outdated. The only part that will date is his analysis of President Bush (who triangulates and mobilizes the nation) compared to former President Bill Clinton -- but this is a book  will probably be reprinted and updated for many years to come.<br /><br />  Morris also notes that these power plays can be applied to the business world -- for advancing a company or office employee's position, image and power.<br />  My favorite sections were his analysis of Al Gore (unsuccessful: didn't stand on principle), the late NY Governor Nelson Rockefeller (failed triangulation), Bill Clinton and<br />George W. Bush (successful triangulations), plus the chapters on FDR, JFK and Richard Nixon. The most dazzling foreign leader power plays: Churchill's (several kinds of power plays). The most dazzling American leader, in terms of using the power plays: Ronald Reagan.<br />  This 360-page, well-index book is MUST READING for anyone a)interested in a political career, b)students of political science, c)office seekers, d)students of history who<br />will enjoy the way he has classified events and personalities into specific political trends and strategies, d)anyone who is interested in politics.President Bill Clinton -- but this is a book  will probably be reprinted and updated for many years to come.<BR> <BR>      Morris also notes that these power plays can be applied to the business world -- for advancing a company or office employee's position, image and power. <br />     My favorite sections were his analysis of Al Gore (unsuccessful: didn't stand on principle), the late NY Governor Nelson Rockefeller (failed triangulation), Bill Clinton and<BR>George W.

Some say there were funnier comedy teams than The Three Stooges but the comedy team many women love to hate is undisputedly the most successful comedy team in movie<br />history. Their films STILL pack `em in at revivals,  Stooge conventions brim with Curly imitators and each year yet more books are published on America's favorite knuckleheads (American's LEAST favorite knuckleheads can be found in Congress).<br />  But the question is: with ALL of the countless hours on t.v. devoted to the Stooges, ALL of the videos and DVDs on them, ALL of the books and documentaries can you learn anything NEW from a book -- especially if the book was penned by writers who<br />wrote four other books on Stooges?<br /><br />  The answer is a RESOUNDING YES.<br /><br />  This  is the DEFINITIVE  The Three Stooges book, chock full of fascinating NEW INFORMATION  on their lives, personalities, and even the \\"unknown\\" stage Stooges who performed into the 70s. As if that isn't enough, the authors convincingly suggest that rough-stuff comedy contributed to at least three of the Stooges' strokes, and that the Stooges' vaudevillian creator Ted Healy may have been beaten to death by a Hollywood star and a gangland bigwig.<br />  Stooges fans will go nuts (as if they aren't already) over the superb collection of photos and illustrations, many of them never before published. Plus, this account brims with great new candid quotes from the Stooges and their associates.<br />  And, unlike some other Stooges books, this one is a ABSOLUTE MUST addition to the library of ANYONE  interested comedy and comedy history -- since gives the best account yet of the step-by-step evolution of the Stooges' comedy.<br />  There are countless new facts, twists, and explanations in this book. Here are just a few of the  new revelations I learned. I read how:<br />--Stooges founder Ted Healy was the FIRST comedian to play comedy off someone else (now a staple of comedy). Healy, one of the show biz's greatest performers, was on the verge of becoming a major movie star when he died (the authors suggest he was murdered and it may have been covered up). When Healy died, his wise-guy, smart aleck movie persona was  taken over by a young comedian named Bob Hope.<br />--Curly, Shemp, Larry, Joe Besser (the most unloved Stooge) all suffered strokes...and being on the receiving end of the Stooges rough brand of comedy may be a key reason why.<br /><br />--Shemp was one of the first Stooges, but even when he stepped out of the act and Curly took his place he played a key behind the scenes role (read what he did).<br />--Replacing Curly was always difficult since Curly was pure-vaudeville....and by the time he left the act, after a stroke while filming a Stooges comedy, vaudeville was dead. The book wonderfully accounts the searches for Curly replacements -- and the other stage versions of the Stooges, based on the Health vaudeville act.<br /><br />--Moe believed that SEVERAL comedy teams (the book names them) lifted parts of Curley's stage persona to propel themselves to fame and fortune.<br />  When an author writes too much about a subject, it's said he is  \\"written out.\\" There's no sign the Forrester brothers are written out on The Three Stooges -- but it's hard to see how they (or anyone) will EVER top this superbly written, illustrated and researched book.s greatest performers, was on the verge of becoming a major movie star when he died (the authors suggest he was murdered and it may have been covered up).

It is possible to write a celebrity autobiography that doesn't celebrate the famous person's achievements, personality and decisions but (perhaps unwittingly) gets into bigger issues?<br />  The answer, provided by Find Me, Rosie O'Donnell's potent, emotional and brutally honest autobiography is...YES.<br />  Even the best celebrity autobiographies (and I LOVE reading them) sometimes resemble huge literary self-pats on the back. The glorification of \\"self\\" often oozes off each page like oil...and what's ofen lacking is the \\"spirit.\\" You often feel that, no matter how hard he/she is on his/herself, the celebrity is saying: \\"Don't you wish you were me?\\" Or: \\"See how talented I am?\\"<br />  O'Donnell's main belief, though, is quite different: \\"Nothing happens by chance.\\" There's a reason for every success, failure or challenge...and a t.v. show and fame might not reflect life's REAL purpose and meaning.<br />  You almost never see an autobiography questioning the idea of celebrity itself, the values that drive people to want to become celebrities, and what a famous person does with the wealth and power that often accompanies fame. And most celebrity autobiographies don't raise questions that make you THINK about human beings' tiny spark, called spirit, or innner light, that makes someone think less about themselves than others, not just about their immediate family but their human extended family.<br />  Find Me is a HUGE SURPRISE. I ordered this before publication and fully expected a very readable, fun and enlightening light-weight autobiography...and instead I experienced a roller coast of emotions and surprises. At times suspenseful, always powerful and painfully frank, Find Me, is one of the most unusual and innovative celebrity autobiographies ever penned.<br />  From the early pages where Rosie contacts a 14 year old girl who she was told had been raped, you will be SURPRISED. And the surprises are STUNNING. This book can be ruined by revealing too much but here are some reasons to read it:<br />  It really moves. It's not ponderous, long or overwritten.  Ms. O'Donnell isn't trying to sell herself to her readers as a genius, as better than they are. Nor does she batter them with pity-seeking accounts of childhood traumas -- but DOES recount childhood traumas in a refreshing and moving way. Her no-holds-barred candor is what makes this surprising story and innovative approach work.<br /><br />  And, NO, this is absolutely NOT a book about her sexual preferences. That aspect clearly was exploited by some in the media as a news \\"hook\\" and by those who disagree with her political stands. Parts referring to that are exceptionally brief and mentioned only in passing. Anyone who blasts Find Me because of that clearly has not read it or doesn't know how to read.<br />  Find Me's drama lies in the tale of Rosie's attempt to help a young person...where this trail leads...and what she learns about herself and life itself. She accounts her growing feeling that it was time to leave her show because what constitutes the real Rosie O'Donnell was not necessarily the woman on the t.v. screen, even though increasingly large sums of money were repeatedly dangled in front of her.<br />  Her tale is told through a mix of narrative, emails, a smattering of poetry, even accounts of dreams. You'll FEEL her childhood and present day traumas and virtually taste her overwhelming desire to use her time on this earth helping others, especially young people.<br />  These are all bits and pieces of Rosie, held together by the highly dramatic central story.

About 11 years ago a series of events took place that left me emotionally, spiritually, and psychologically drained. I literally felt like things were hopeless. Then I got the paperback version of this book...and I mean it when I say it helped change my daily life.<br />  I followed the author's suggestions (I was willing to try anything): I held the book in my two hands, held the problem or dilemma in my mind, meditated a bit on it, let my mind (and body) be still...then closed my eyes, made my request in a question form...and opened the book. I would always open it and only look at the page that I \\"felt\\" I was being led to by one of my fingers.<br />  Most of the time I was amazed: the quotation on the page TRULY referred to my problem and gave me some insight. And I (more often than not) acted on it. Once in a while I'd get an answer that didn't seem like an answer, so I'd reframe the question and start the process again.<br />  Years later I gifted this book to someone in trouble. And I truly missed not having it. Then, last month, I bought it AGAIN...this time in hardcover.<br />  I STRONGLY recommend this book. Even if you read it from cover to cover (which is not really how it is designed to be used) you'd gain a wealth of insight, since the quotations -- from yogis, to Eileen Cassidy, to the Bible, to Walt Whitman -- are the BEST to help steer your thinking (and some say guide your intuition) towards helpful, often healing solutions.<br />  This is a small but potent book. Great to read. Great to use as a little voice that will answer your questions as you randomly turn to a page after a bit of meditation. And, most of all, GREAT to GIFT to friends, family or someone who's facing some difficult challenges. Once you use this book you'll never want to be without it.	2002-04-20

A Fine Balance, a novel that underscores the balance in life between hope and despair (everyone and every nation goes through it to some degree) is truly a work of GENIUS. From its opening pages to its final word this is a book MOVES as quickly, joyously, and brutally, as life itself. You're going to learn some lessons....and think about some issues.<br />  The plot SEEMS simple enough. Four people from different walks and rungs on the pecking order (called the caste system) are linked together by fate (or is it something greater??) and this bond will never be broken. No matter what happens -- and a LOT happens in this novel -- some giant magnet pulls them back together.<br />  Mistry shows each character as a REAL person with moments of courage and frailty. The Strongest Link is  the widow Dina Dalal, who wants to make it on her own in a culture in which that can sometimes be difficult. Villager Maneck Kohlal, a student sent to the city and the villagers Ishvar Darji and his newphew Omniprakash are tailors who had to flee to the city due to horrorific events in their village. These are the four main characters in this highly-gripping drama.<br />  But the biggest character is India itself under the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The novel unfolds at the height of her \\"state of emergency,\\" a dicatorship imposed in 1975 and later lifted. It's a country in which street beggars can be rounded up and hauled against their wills to work in labor camps on the prextext of slum clearance; where men can be tricked or intimidated into being sterilized (family planning) so a commission-seeking bureaucrat can get a quota; where beggars (some of whom are babies deformed at birth on purpose so they can  generate more money begging on the streets) work for a Godfather-like boss. Yet, Mistry's India is also a wonderful place where nobility survives among corruption, and the richness of its beautiful culture (food, family ties, etc) is celebrated and appreciated each day.<br />  Mistry's writing style is amazlingly easy to read. He paints mind pictures vividly, so it's like watching an epic film. Joys, tragedies, moments of realization and brutuality come SUDDENLY, just like in life.  There are few \\"I knew this was going to happen\\" moments in A Fine Balance.<br />  A PERSONAL NOTE AND ENDORSEMENT OF THIS BOOK: I love India. In college I studied Indian politics and other subjects. I went over to New Delhi as a student and interned on the Hindustan Times in my senior year at college. From 1973 to 1975 I was a freelance in India, writing for the old Chicago Daily News, Christian Science Monitor and other papers.<br />  This book brought a LOT of things together that I had been told about....or read about...or witnessed. The cultural setting made me feel like I was back in India again. Dialogue was HIGHLY realistic. I left just before Mrs. Gandhi's \\"emergncy,\\" but this book is an accurate depiction of some of the things I knew, heard, experienced, regretted and LOVE about India, a complex and beautiful country.<br />  I HIGHLY recommend this book to ANYONE who a)likes a good novel, b)doesn't like fiction because it loses your interest, c)is interested in India, d)wants to read a work by a true literary genius, e)is interested in doing any kind of writing. Character development, plotting, writing are all superb.

But in Fox's case, he beat the odds.<br />  It's no secret that some of the Powers That Be weren't entirely enamored when, as a young Canadian \\"unknown,\\"  he was cast in  the role as Alex, in NBC's hit t.v. comedy Family Ties.  But when the show debuted he proved that he had that certain \\"something\\" -- that rare talent to link up with an audience. Call it \\"charisma,\\" or likeability but it, plus<br />his considerable acting talents, drove the ratings -- and  his show biz career  -- sky-high.<br />  Now Fox has written one of the most genuinely honest, touching and moving show biz bios ever, Lucky Man. But it is MORE than a show biz bio, because it deals with how his life was impacted by Parkinson's disease, how he  coped with it, accepted it and how he wants to help others.<br />  Lucky Man should be titled Lucky Us, because anyone who reads it can't help walking away from it a mite richer, inspired, and more appreciative of the fact that the upsides and<br />downsides of life sometimes coincide...but, overall, it can be a joyous ride.<br />  Fox  did NOT have this ghost written and it certainly reads like an autobiography written by an actor known for his great sense of irony and sense of humor.  All the usual<br />biographical \\"boilerplate\\" material is there about his early years (a military brat who had a normal, well-centered childhood) quick rise to fame (Family Ties was a smash hit, largely of Fox's charisma -- which he is too modest to mention), and glimpses of the REAL show biz world behind the scenes (his account of how Cher snubbed him at an Academy Awards ceremony has already become an instant classic -- about how someone way up there in Hollywood's pecking order seemingly considers someone else not as famous and therefore perhaps not as<br />worthy).<br />  But aside from his natural humor, honesty, and the inside Hollywood tidbits, what's going to make this a book that will long be remembered -- and ultimately be turned into a<br />wide-screen or television movie -- is how he coped with news about his illness, emerged from  denial, and decided to dedicate his life to look for a cure for and to increase public<br />awareness about the disease.<br />  Some chapters may make you cry. For instance, I never knew until I read this that Fox KNEW he had Parkinson's when he signed on to do Spin City. It was only when he felt he had to quit the series to spend more time with  his family and his new cause that he did so.<br /><br />  In the passages that show him battling alcohol, and coping with his illness, not a word is there for dramatic effect. It's all sincere.<br />  I will be forever haunted by the passage where his he teaches his five-year-old son, Sam, how to stop his Dad's involuntary thumb movements, by squeezing his thumb or<br />twisting it, then counting to give and doing it again. Fox writes of how he saw his son's delight \\"in getting the timing down, short-circuiting the wiggle every time\\" but once Sam<br />realized it came back again he \\"detected a slight look of \\"Uh-Oh, what have I gotten myself into?\\"<br />  And I admit getting teary-eyed  when he concluded after his hopes that surgery would help him were dashed that (his problems returned fullforce) that  the Parkinson's was \\"just doing what it's supposed to do\\" and that he he was going to \\"just show up and do the best that I could do with whatever lay in front of me.\\"<br />  On every  page Fox's talent, humanity and decency shine through. Michael J. Fox  titled it Lucky Man, because of the love and support of his friends and family. But we're the Lucky Ones for having Fox write such a poignant, sincere and touching book.the inside Hollywood tidbits, what's going to make this a book that will long be remembered -- and ultimately be turned into a<BR>wide-screen or television movie -- is how he coped with news about his illness, emerged from  denial, and decided to dedicate his life to look for a cure for and to increase public<BR>awareness about the disease.<br />       Some chapters may make you cry.

US	52992914	R3BHW1R7L5JU6C	0786869429	32568553	Journey Through Heartsongs	Books	5	29	32	N	N	An 11 year old poet  -- with centuries of wisdom and grace	It has been said (accurately) many times: 11-year-old Mattie T.J. Stepanek's wonderful, often-haunting poems reflect a joy of life, an understanding of life, a full realization of what is important in life. His one-of-a-kind poems reveal a very wise, and perhaps very old, soul lurking in a very young body.<br />  And by now you've probably heard Mattie's story on television, read it in the newspaper, or read his bio in one of his books: in his young life he has had to deal with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, and has watched his siblings pass away one by one. He started writing poems at the age of three. But what you may NOT know is that this book truly differs from his first, earliest work, Heartsongs. His first was truly a work of art -- and in this book, he builds on his art and makes it a mite more personal.<br />  If his first book, Heartsongs, is a nifty little polished poetic gem, the self-styled \\"peacemaker's\\" second book, Journey through Heartsongs, is a natural sequel -- a highly-polished, multi-layered gem. For in THIS book of poetry, Mattie begins to broaden his subjects a bit to include works that more directly reflect his own personal life and struggles: the pediatric intensive care unit; an anniversary reflection on how he felt the day he learned his little brother passed on and what it was like for him to be at his brother's funeral; maintaining family unity amid tragedy (The Holding On Family); his new unsought role as the only child of parents of deceased children, and many other topics. Yet, in Mattie's artistic hands these subjects are tastefully handled in seamless poetry, 100 percent sincere -- so be forewarned that you may shed a tear or two.<br />  But there is a wide variety of other general subjects, too (the senses; the Vietnam War Memorial; angels; watches; wishing; growing up -- and many more). And in this volume (as in the first it is illustrated with his wonderful illustrations) you can clearly see his growth and maturation as he begins working through events in his life, questions of mortality, resolve, love, faith and the simple things that we take for granted -- things that make our lives beautiful and meaningful.<br />  This is a wonderful book of personal poems by a beautiful wise soul (and I am not just writing this to butter him up because he is a black belt in karate). I read Heartsongs first, was deeply moved and impressed. And when I read this I thought it would be basically more of the same wonderful poetry (and realize this: I generally do not enjoy poetry). But this book is different: in Journey through Heartsongs I could literally watch his incredible talent blossom. A great book to read and to gift to anyone, of any age -- and I'll be buying more volumes of Mattie's poems for many many years to come.as he begins working through events in his life, questions of mortality, resolve, love, faith and the simple things that we take for granted -- things that make our lives beautiful and meaningful.<br />     This is a wonderful book of personal poems by a beautiful wise soul (and I am not just writing this to butter him up because he is a black belt in karate).

Can someone write a satirical, witty, ironic, message-filled book on US politics and American life in general, have it published on September 10th -- and STILL have a hilarious book with serious parts that  hold up?<br />  The answer is YES. Michael Moore's Stupid White men  was published on September 10  and although Moore might consider updating this book if it goes to another printing, this book is a screamingly funny, politically razor-sharp, enjoyable read from start to finish.<br />  Stupid White Men oozes sarcasm and wit on every page.  Even if you don't agree with Moore, he has written a book that is the flip side of recent successful right-of-center political books. In fact, in many ways Moore presents himself as the mirror image (on the left) of Fox News' Bill O'Reilly: someone who probes for facts (presented to the reader),doesn't pull punches, reaches a strong political stand -- all the while defending the beset and disenfranchised common man against wealthy and uncaring Powers That Be.<br />  For instance, Moore's comment on the differences between Democrats and Republicans (he supported Ralph Nader) is an instant classic: \\"The Democrats say one thing (\\"Save the Planet\\") and then do another -- quietly holding hands behind the scenes..\\"with the powerful interests \\"...who make this world a dirtier meaner place. The Republicans just come right out and give (the interests) a corner office in the West Wing.\\"<br />  September 11 has made some chapters seem slightly dated, but that can be corrected in a future edition. Just of the few of the many chapters include A Very American Coup (on the election), Dear George (a hilarious sarcastic letter to GWB), Kill Whitey (on race), The End of Men (self-explanatory), Idiot Nation, and Democrats DOA.<br />  Some have blasted his use of \\"Kill Whitey\\" as a title, suggesting it is an instruction -- but they must NOT have read this book. Moore's specialty is irony, as typified at the<br />beginning of this chapter where he lampoons racial fears: \\"Didn't I notice suspicious gangs of white people lurking on every street corner, drinking Starbucks and wearing their gang<br />colors of Gap Turquoise or J. Crew Mauve?\\"<br />  Moore peppers the chapters with gray-shaded sidebar pages offering such information as literacy websites, leadership of the fifty largest countries, how to contact your elected representatives and the addresses of a few stores where you can purchase...ahem...exotic items.<br />  I found this book JUST as enjoyable as the two books by Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, even though Moore and O'Reilly are on different ends of the political spectrum. Both visually-oriented celebrities have written highly entertaining politically-oriented books where they take information(sometimes on the same issues) and reach (often different)conclusions. Interestingly, O'Reilly and Moore are united in their disdain for former President Bill Clinton: Moore's most devastating chapter is the one on the Democrats where he lambastes Clinton, calling him \\"one of the best Republican presidents we've ever had.\\"<br />  But let's just forget about political positions for just a second (which is hard to do in an increasingly polarized America). Even if you don't agree with it all (and I don't),<br />Stupid White Men is a FUN, FUNNY and fact-filled book. We need more Moore.br />beginning of this chapter where he lampoons racial fears: \\"Didn't I notice suspicious gangs of white people lurking on every street corner, drinking Starbucks and wearing their gang<BR>colors of Gap Turquoise or J.

When comedianne Rosie O'Donnell made her highly-touted appearance on Bill O'Reilly's hit Fox show \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\" she noted that her staff didn't want her to go on it. They thought he was a right-wing ideologue, with a political ax to grind, and an ideological message to sell. But, she told him in the interview, she decided to go on after doing her OWN research and learning a few surprising things -- such as the fact that he had admired Robert Kennedy.<br />  Rosie clearly read this book.<br />  For the Bill O'Reilly displayed here is someone who looks at all sides, then takes a firm position -- but he IS looking, and he is listening (and he will tell you in no uncertain terms what he finally thinks).<br />  At first I did not want to read this book. I had bought LOTS of good political and humor books written by people on the right and left. I usually read them and find them enjoyable for the first half, then lose interest (am talking about books by Republicans, Democrats AND Green Party members) because they are so clearly pitching one political viewpoint and belittling another. There are seldom any \\"gray\\" areas.<br />  But as a former journalist I liked what I had seen of Bill O'Reilly in some of his interviews. So I got the book -- and could NOT put it down. I read it in one sitting, through the wee-hours of the evening and early morning.<br />  What's surprising in this lively, HIGHLY enjoyable and enlightening book (and it would be no surprise to Mr. O'Reilly and those who've loved him all along) is how studiously he has worked through these issues. In O'Reilly's world, there DEFINITELY ARE gray areas: those who disagree with him are not immediately demonized, he conceeds they have a good point when he believes they do, and he generally ends the chapter on (most of) them with a respectful comment. Indeed, his ire and barely-concealed contempt is usually reserved for those who refuse to appear in the hot seat on his show's \\"No Spin Zone.\\" He truly does do ANALYSIS, but his journalistic training shines through in the way he reaches his heart-felt conclusions.<br />  I STRONGLY recommend this book for several reasons:<br />1)The style. This book, written in a consersational style, is well organized. O'Reilly sets up each issue, then tells you some behind-the-scenes info about what the interview subject was REALLY like. He  gives you part of the interview in transcript form, and has the last word (he acknowledges at the beginning that he will do this -- he is after all the author.).<br />  The book's quick pacing is similar to his fast-moving FOX News special on the corruption of America's children. This book zips along, yet you get a lot of info, interview snippets, plus a O'Reilly's final position...and even if you disagree with it he clearly has weighed the pros and cons...and is not simply offering either party's line (Democrats AND Republicans will find they do not completely agree with him).<br />2)The actual interviews. The book is subtitled Confrontations With the Powerful and Famous in America. Don't expect a book version of a scream fest or partisan name-calling. The 16 issue-oriented chapters include interviews with folks including Dr. Joyceln Elders, former Clinton surgeon general (he likes her as a person, feels she is sincere, and agrees with her on some things but not some others); Jesse Jackson (won't come on his show to answer tough questions but he talks to an associate); CBS's Dan Rather (O'Reilly's no-holds-barred background account of his years  working at CBS News in what he describes as an office political snake-pit further confirms some of the points made in the later book Bias, and Rather seems flustered by O'Reilly's grilling); former Clinton Advisor James Carville (always lively)...and much more.<br />3)The info. The many issues O'Reilly tackles here (from pedophiles to foul language on rock to sex to t.v. news, to taxes, to Hillary Clinton and her alleged aspirations etc) are nicely outlinedand it's clear he did lots of research. Indeed, O'Reilly seems to be one talk show host who would probably not be offended if you did careful research and came to some informed no-spin conclusions of your own.d it's clear he did lots of research.

It is partially a HISTORY of various roasts through the years. Well-written and well-organized, from the standpoint of LOTS of zingers the fun truly begins about 75 pages into the book. Before that there are wonderful accounts of the early roasts but not a lot of jokes.<br />  Not all of these laugh-out-loud (I mean REALLY laugh out loud) lines in this book are x-rated, but quite a few of them are. Dougherty also offers memories from some of the celebrity participants, which put some of the ribbing and behind the scenes stories (and egos) in focus. It's a GREAT approach...and it does work.<br />  But don't expect a mere collection of jokes listed by subject -- the emphasis here is on a given roast and the participants. In fact, in the index you will find names of performers, not subjects. Roast victims included such names as Al Jolson, Sophie Tucker, Milton Berle, Frank Sinatra, Phillis Diller, John Travolta,  Stephen Seagal, Drew Carey and many many more.<br />  The three roasters who made me roar the most were comedians Milton Berle (he will be missed -- something about Berle was a running joke at the club for years), Red Buttons and Buddy Hacket.<br />  I highlighted the jokes I liked as I read them so when I want a big (and guilty r-or-x-rated) laugh I can go back and re-read them. There were LOTS of markings in this book, and almost every line I marked is a winner. But be forewarned: this is not just a book of jokes and one-liners, but a fascinating history as well as a laugh-packed volume.	2002-04-03

They stop growing and mark time (while collecting the $$$).<br />  You CANNOT say that about Stephen King in Everything's Eventual. In this book of 14 highly-polished little literary gems you can SEE how he has expanded on his huge talents and advanced his art. Some of the stories are more-or-less horror stories. Others don't quite fall into that classification. But not a single one of them is stale.<br />  For instance Autopsy Room Four is a modern-day twist on the Hitchock-type tale of a man who's alive and considered dead. I'm NOT giving anything away by telling you that -- and as soon as you read it you'll howl with delight at the surprise ending (there are almost two endings to this story and both are a great).<br />  King's stories  move like guided missiles, climbing to new heights in plot and style, swerving in brand-new twists (funny and sad) -- and all the while he seems to be (respectfully) playing with the genre he has helped to popularize. If you ever thought King was repeating himself rest assured: he does NOT here. I love short stories and this is now my most prized collection (I will NEVER sell it or lend it...but I WILL  re-read it).<br />  Without listing them all, my favorites here include the book's title story, Everything's Eventual (a tale about a 14-year-old with an unusual talent; his narrative from the kid's<br />point of view sounds JUST like a 14-year-old I know...King gets inside the kid's head); The Death of Jack Hamilton (about gangster John Dillinger); In the Deathroom (a story about a captive with a twist with a great ending); LT's Theory of Pets (do you laugh or cry...or both?); the Road Virus Heads North (classic suspense from start to finish); Lunch at the Gotham Cafe (he got the idea seeing a couple argue at a cafe); and 1408 (offspring of The Shining?).<br /><br />  King explains along with each story how he got the idea and/or why he decided to end it the way he did. The bottom line: Everything's Eventual is a page-turner and one the BEST short story collections you will ever read.both?); the Road Virus Heads North (classic suspense from start to finish); Lunch at the Gotham Cafe (he got the idea seeing a couple argue at a cafe); and 1408 (offspring of The Shining?).<BR> <BR>    King explains along with each story how he got the idea and/or why he decided to end it the way he did.

Bush	Books	5	36	44	N	Y	FUN, enlightening, info-packed --  and a great view of GWB	Ambling Into History has polarized some readers because of the subject --George W. Bush. Author Frank Bruni has been accused of trivializing and belittling Bush, or of pumping up and promoting him.<br />  But as someone who truly has no political ax to grind (pro or con) I must say this: I absolutely LOVED this book. And in the end some of  things that people may have felt belittled Bush<br />were to me quite endearing. I FINALLY had read a political book and learned a lot more about how the subject of the book REALLY was as a REAL person.<br />  This political saga shows a politician who privately raises an eyebrow at many of the political process' pomposities, rituals and postures and who behaves as an authentic human being, rather than a character sent from Hollywood's Central Casting to fill a stereotypical role.<br />  This book is FUN and enlightening. It's all there: info about the campaign, and early evidence that GWB did not actually \\"grow in office\\" due to 911 as much as confront an unprecedented crisis with skills he already had -- and had honed. When I had done shows in Texas (I am an entertainer) I had heard stories about Bush's charisma in private but until this book never saw anything that communicated it in print (or on the networks).<br />  Most of Ambling is set on the campaign trail. After Bush's searing loss to John McCain GWB made himself more available to the press. In private he suddenly became a fun candidate to cover -- and he was clearly trying to win them over with humor. A reporter might find Bush playfully sticking his index fingers in the reporters ears to keep him from hearing something. Bush once jokingly put his hands around Bruni's throat. Such antics were a part of Bush's good-guy make-up, evident in college when he named a stickball team \\"the Nads\\"...so chants would be \\"GO NADS!\\"<br />  The behind-the-scenes GWB portrayed here is much more likeable and solid than the early, stiffer candidate publicly seen on the campaign trail. Bruni traces Bush's growth during the campaign masterfully. But the book's greatest success is in showing the absurdities, pomposities, and rituals of the press itself on the campaign trail. No book has ever done this better.<br />  Many of Bruni's lines are laugh out loud. For instance, after he describes how the press eats and eats and eats he notes: \\"The seats on the plane seemed to grow smaller and smaller as the campaign dragged on.\\"<br />  Does Ambling trivialize GWB? Not at all. Is it p.r. to pump him up? Nope. It shows a steely determination and quick-learner beneath an affable, refreshingly playful surface. As you read about how he overcame his campaign's and his own obstacles, how deeply he holds his values, how firmly he maintains his core beliefs, and how focused he is on achieving his goals, his no-nonsense actions after Sept. 11 come as no shock at all. Indeed, by the time we reach his final chapter about Bush's post 911 performance, we're not surprised to read about his patience, take-charge attitide and openess to new info.

But this book? I could not put it down.<br />  From the very first page, as we see the main character Samantha cope with her disintegrating marriage, I CARED about Samantha --  because Elizabeth Berg makes her so real (Samantha narrates her story). We see her as she decides to make the best of a devastating divorce, as she experiments with various aspects of her life, and as she copes with the outcomes.<br />  Now Sam has to raise a child on her own. Now Sam must cope with divorce. Now she has to decide whether to date. And, most of all, now Sam has to decide what SHE really wants and needs.<br />  Samantha is an amazingly realistic character because, as in REAL LIFE, neither she (nor the reader) can predict how each adventure will end. Other characters are also drawn realistically and the tale is written in a conversational style with with short, punchy, zippy-yet-graceful sentences. You HEAR these REAL characters speak: her mother, her new friend King, and her son. The portrait of Sam's 11 year old son, on the verge of teenage years but still a child, is perhaps the most accurate portrait of a &quot;tween&quot; I have seen in print.<br />  Berg packs tons of content, emotion and insight into her punchy and often witty sentences (it's so easy to read that you can see how this could become an almost instant motion picture -- the dialogue is so realistic and so good). And, plot aside, there is a lot to be LEARNED from this novel about how to cope with major, unwanted change.<br />  Open House is for anyone who loves fiction (she is a major talent) -- and even those who don't read tons of fiction will love it and, like me, literally be unable to put it down.<br />  You close the book...and miss Sam..and wish there had been more.	2002-03-14

It's a book adults AND children can read, savor, ponder, and re-again.<br />  It's a book that can be read to a child, or a child can read. It's a book that adults NEED to read -- to reconnect with what's important and what we (adults) often fail to appreciate.<br />  For 12-year old Mattie J.T. Stepanek not only \\"smells the roses\\" but he writes about doing so, and his short poems show how he enjoys and appreciates everything on this earth (and beyond). He was born with a rare form of Muscular Dystrophy and this year is the national ambassador for MDA -- but his illness is NOT why this is a great book.<br />  Heartsongs is the first volume of his poetry, which he started writing at age three. It is the simplest. Each heartfelt \\"heartsong\\" is a straightforward, yet profound verse on topics that many people take for granted, or just don't think about as they worry about their bills (adults) or when they'll get Playstation II (kids). This book contains his MANY poems on the senses (among these The Smell of a Noise, Angels-Wings), the seasons (among these Leaf for a Day, Important Things, The Eye of the Beholder -- a WONDERFUL observation about when people weed flowers from the point of the flower) and celebrations (Being Thankful, Circle of Happiness).<br />  This is a poet who is wise WAY beyond his years. And this volume represents his EARLY poetry (he deals with more complex subjects such as the deaths of his siblings in another volume, which clearly represents some of the later poems which again are wonderful for ALL AGES).<br />  Can I give this book 10 stars?<br />  PS: He appeals to everyone. I love this book so much I read another of his books. And when I showed Heartsongs to 6 year old Kayla she immediately siezed it and began to read. Even though I had to help her a bit, she wanted to keep reading more. Read it, lend it, gift it; his message is simple but profound.ed to keep reading more.

OK, so Bill Press lost his dayjob, as co-host of CNN's Crossfire (he is now a \\"contributor\\"). But not only will we likely still see him on the tube...but he has a great back-up day-job: as an author.<br />  Spin This! has to be one of the funniest, yet most painstakingly researched, books I have ever read. From \\"spins\\" dating back to Bibical times, to politics, to show biz, to male-female relationships, SPIN THIS laughingly explores (and exposes) it ALL. Whether you're a Democrat, Republican, Liberal, Conservative...or WHATEVER...you're going to find stuff that you'll LOVE in this book. Even if you don't know anything about politics it is not ALL about political spin.<br />  And there's this bonus: Bill Press is actually a screamingly funny and highly talented writer. And that ain't spin.<br /><br />  If you think you're going to get a diatribe from him, think again. You really don't.  And if you love Bill Press' views and expect him to let Democrats or liberals off the hook, think again, too. In reality, he sits back and explores SPECIFIC \\"spins\\" in all walks of life -- and comments on them with laugh-out-loud wisecracks.<br />  Still not convinced that this one-of-a-kind book (it is funny but it also can serve as a GREAT reference book due to the truly solid research reflected on each page)can appeal to EVERYONE?<br />  Then consider his Spin Hall of Fame where he lets famous commentators of all persuasions profile THEIR idea of the most outrageous spins. To name a few: Robert Novak (on Al Gore), Kate O'Beirne (Hillary Clinton), Cal Thomas (Satan), Al Franken (Karl Rove), and one of his CNN replacements, Paul Begala on GWB.  Clearly his colleagues on the right and left had a lot of fun with this project, too. Painstakingly researched -- and painstakingly hilarious. Gift it to those who agree and disagree with you!	2002-03-01

The advent of film in the 20th century made this a lot easier since when a comedian died the work was still available...and now with videos etc. it's easier than ever.<br />  But what about HOW these comedians made laughs...how they were inspired...what specific techniques they used and did not use...and what advice they would give anyone interested in going into any area of comedy?<br />  Those have been tough answers to get. To do it you'd have to buy a slew of good and sometimes rotten bios, many of them out of print. Until now. Stand-up comedian Larry Wilde's Great Comedians Talk About Comedy brings it all together.<br />  Great Comedians is a superb, singular achievement that collects within one lively, 402-page, info-packed volume, detailed interviews done over several years with some of the 20th century's greatest comedians and comedy actors.<br />  The selection is absolutely mind-boggling: Woody Allen, Milton Berle, Shelly Berman, Jack Benny, Joey Bishop, George Burns, Johnny Carson, Maurice Chevalier, Phyllis Diller, Jimmy Durante, Bob Hope, Dick Gregory, George Jessle, Jerry Lewis, Jerry Seinfeld, Danny Thomas and Ed Wynn.<br />  Each interview is presented in straight Q&A format so you get to \\"hear\\" the question and \\"hear\\" the response, from what the comedian/comedy actor says to his/her own speech pattern. These folks worked in venues from vaudeville, to radio, to night clubs, to radio to early silent movies to talkies to TV. And their responses to questions contain revelations and constant inspiration.<br />  A key theme: how \\"making it\\" in comedy requires timing, good material, dogged persistance, constant analysis of jokes/laughs and being LIKEABLE to an audience. Copying someone's stage personna or stealing their jokes just won't do it.<br />  My favorite interviews were with Woody Allen (how he writes ten jokes on everything from matchbooks to napkins and only uses a few; how he won't try jokes out on friends since they're often too negative; how audience appeal MATTERS...and his pointing to Jackie Gleason as someone who often had a lousey show but people loved him), Jack Benny (the importance of learning comedy and advancing step by step...an explanation of his legendary timing), Joey Bishop (\\"...Luck cannot sustain you.Only talent can sustain you..\\"), George Burns (tips on timing, attitude and the importance emulating but not copying other performers), Phyllis Diller (five truly SUPERB short inspirational tips that can advance MANY careers...Her high laugh per minute standards), and Jerry Seinfeld (timing, getting into a focused mental framework and how his love of comedy as a kid blossomed).<br />  This book an essential for ANYONE interested in comedy, or for  students of comedy, public speakers, or anyone who simply wants to be funny in public. It's ALL HERE: the inspiration, the tips, the stories, the bios...the TOOLS.<br />  It's now a cliche to say \\"comedy isn't easy\\" and the whole process is mysterious.  Larry Wilde's Great Comedians Talk About Comedy makes it less mysterious and -- a a bit easier.napkins and only uses a few; how he won't try jokes out on friends since they're often too negative; how audience appeal MATTERS...and his pointing to Jackie Gleason as someone who often had a lousey show but people loved him), Jack Benny (the importance of learning comedy and advancing step by step...an explanation of his legendary timing), Joey Bishop (\\"...Luck cannot sustain you.Only talent can sustain you..\\"), George Burns (tips on timing, attitude and the importance emulating but not copying other performers), Phyllis Diller (five truly SUPERB short inspirational tips that can advance MANY careers...Her high laugh per minute standards), and Jerry Seinfeld (timing, getting into a focused mental framework and how his love of comedy as a kid blossomed).<br />  This book an essential for ANYONE interested in comedy, or for  students of comedy, public speakers, or anyone who simply wants to be funny in public.

Among the many (not all are listed in this review) comedians' work contained here are: Louie Anderson, Richard Belzer, Elayne Boosler, Billy Crystal, Whoppi Goldberg, Richard Jeni, Richard Lewis, Bill Maher, Dennis Miller, Paula Poundstone, Gary Shandler, Bob Saget -- you get the idea.<br />  A question does arise: if you READ a comedian's routine (his or her &quot;set&quot;) is it still funny? The unequivocal answer is: it depends.<br />  I loved this book. I laughed at loud when I read this book. But it's interesting how some comedians you like a LOT are not as funny when you read what they are actually saying. The reason: their personna (their body language, their speech pattern) has a lot to do with the laughs they elicit. On the other hand, there are others who you may not have appreciated whose material is an absolute howl when you read it on the page.<br />  It's easy to see which comedians have achieved success partly due to their personna and which other ones seem to have  risen to the top largely due to sharp writing and editing that's funny even when you read it without seeing the delivery.<br />  So this book is worth OWNING for several reasons:<br />--If you love comedy, there's some great stuff in it. You can put this book down, then go back after a year and read it again and it's still funny.<br />--If you are a student of comedy, it shows you some great comedy scripts. You'll be amazed at how you'll react at some of these bits if you don't SEE the comedians...and how amazed you'll be at how well written some of these monologues are. If you're doing comedy writing or performing it has some excellent routines that you can analyze to see what makes audiences laugh.<br />  Standouts as far as being funny in script form include routines by Louie Anderson (the most anecdotal of all comedians), Gary Shandling, Richard Belzer, Richard Jeni (truly hilarious), Elayne Boosler, Rita Rudner, Stephen Wright (the best modern comedian to read in printed form), Bob &quot;Bobcat&quot; Goldthwait (whose mantra is &quot;Scott Baio is the antichrist...&quot;) and Richard Lewis (who seamlessly blends strong personna and extremely strong comedy script).<br />  This book also has short sections on homelessness and is a pitch for getting more money for &quot;the cause.&quot;<br />  Overall, a fun book to read, to own, to study (if you're into comedy and/or a comedian) and to re-read.being funny in script form include routines by Louie Anderson (the most anecdotal of all comedians), Gary Shandling, Richard Belzer, Richard Jeni (truly hilarious), Elayne Boosler, Rita Rudner, Stephen Wright (the best modern comedian to read in printed form), Bob &quot;Bobcat&quot; Goldthwait (whose mantra is &quot;Scott Baio is the antichrist...&quot;) and Richard Lewis (who seamlessly blends strong personna and extremely strong comedy script).<br />  This book also has short sections on homelessness and is a pitch for getting more money for &quot;the cause.&quot;<br />  Overall, a fun book to read, to own, to study (if you're into comedy and/or a comedian) and to re-read.	2002-02-11
US	52992914	R2JAJZA2O7IQ9D	0806511877	835289452	Babe: The Life of Oliver Hardy	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Solid bio on the most elusive of Laurel &amp; Hardy	Oliver &quot;Babe&quot; Hardy is something of a paradox: many comedians feel he is actually the funnier of the classic team of Laurel &amp; Hardy. Yet, there is so little biographical material available on him. True, if you buy a book on the comedy team you'll find out the bare facts. But there's always a wealth on Stan Laurel...not Babe (as his friends called him). Why?<br />A key reason, as John McCabe's solid bio points out, is that Babe wanted it that way. He deferred all creative decisions and most press inquries to Stan. In a sense, McCabe faced a Herculean task: he wanted to write a bio about a comedian etched firmly in world film culture, yet  actual sources of information (Hardy died August 6, 1957) were few. Could it be done?<br />Yes. Babe etches out Hardy's life. And we learn a few fascinating tidbits along the way: how throughout his life he always cringed at jokes about his weight (his weight always bothered him) but went along for the laughs (Jackie Gleason reportedly had the same attitude); how he developed his fuss-budget film-personna quirks from a relative; how he viewed himself more as an actor (or reactor) than a comedian; how his love for music pervaded  his life (he does sing in some of his films). And a LOT more. The book also gives fascinating details about his sad final year where he lost a lot of weight and his health went into a downward tailspin.<br />This is a solid book that also recounts some of the team's best shorts, features, and details their famous tour of England. And McCabe JUST pulls off his feat. His source material on Hardy is largely culled from interviews with Stan Laurel and Hardy's last wife, Lucille. If there is a complaint it's that this is still not as well fleshed out as a typical show biz bio where more sources and information were available -- but there is enough detail to make this a solid book that'll delight Laurel &amp; Hardy fans, show biz bio fans, and students of comedy of all ages. Babe would be pleased.	2002-02-10

If you're not into Religious Science's change your mind/change your life philosophy this book will still offer some revelations. If you are into it or involved with it, it is a must-read/must-own.<br />  Author Reginald Armor, who died in 1977, was a mere 12 years old when he met the older Ernest Holmes, who even as a young man in his 20s had embraced the philosophy for which he was to become famous. This book traces their lifelong friendship, Holmes' evolution, and the church's growth, from their first meeting (Holme's treatment helped cure Armor's warts) to Holmes' final years.<br />  Don't expect a long, ponderous detailed book. This book is not that at all. It's a simple account of a friendship that lasted until Holmes' 1960 passing. In sections tracing the steps of how Holmes' institute evolved into a church it resembles at times more of a history book than a memoir. These sections are the least interesting.<br />  But Armor also traces how Holmes' carefully considered and precisely articulated spiritual and metaphysical philsophy sparked a movement that would later have profound influences throughout the 20th century. Indeed, many classic and contemporary  self-help books and motivational speakers  are heavily influenced by his philosophy (the power of visualization; affirmative prayer; and &quot;releasing&quot; an affirmation and having complete faith in it after you make it).<br />  Armor also reveals several fascinating facts: even as a small child Holmes would never stop constantly asking questions (an answer meant he would ask another question), which is how he developed his thought; Holmes started as a public speaker because he truly loved speaking and sharing his philosphy about how applying what he called Universal Law could manifest a person's best good; and Holmes resisted until the very last his associates' attempts to create an church. He prefered a person's one-ness to and with God and felt organized religions' middleman institutions were unncessary. Plus he felt there were &quot;too many religions&quot; already. He made it clear he had no intention of founding a new religion.<br />  In the end, though, Holmes went along with the idea of a church (which today has some members who still maintain their previous religions even as they practice the all-inclusive Religious Science) to help spread his ideas...which he felt were really not HIS ideas, but ideas from a Higher Source.<br />  The bottom line: this is a simply written book which answers some key questions about who Holmes was, what motivated him, and how the then-innovative thoughts that he voiced led to the creation of an actual church.<br />  A MUST if you're interested in the lives of spiritual thinkers.w could manifest a person's best good; and Holmes resisted until the very last his associates' attempts to create an church.

And you, as a consumer, can save thousands of dollars in motivational training by just reading THIS small book.<br />  Holme's main point is that &quot;your thought decides whether your business shall be a success or a failure.&quot; Why?

Inside the Secret World of Osama Bin Laden	Books	5	3	8	N	Y	HIGHLY readable, compelling and understandable	A slew of books came out in the wake of 9/11. Some were eerily written before the WTC bombing. Others came out super-quick to capitalize on it. And others were long in the works. Some were seemingly cut-and-paste jobs -- and others were incredibly dry and boring, more suitable for those doing PhD research than for  general readers seeking answers and easy-to-understand background.<br />  But rest assured: Holy War, Inc. is THE book to understand Osama bin Laden and the terror war -- and it's a pleasure to read.<br />  It has the solid information. And it is written in a highly compelling style, so much so that you'll hate to put it down. The bulk of the work on it was completed in August 2001 so it wasn't written quickly to cash in on the tragedy. It represents four years of solid investigative reporting, written by a journalist who truly KNOWS how to write...so you want to turn the page and read some more.<br />  I firmly believe the stylistic pluses of this book can't be ignored for anyone who wants to find out more about Osama bin Laden and the new post-Sept. 11 world in which we all live. I personally have read --and suffered -- through some of the leading books on this subject. Although I'm a former journalist and no dummy (well, technically:  I am now a fulltime ventriloquist)I had to drink lots of coffee to plow through some of these other books. And when I put some of these books down I wanted to LEAVE THEM THERE.<br />  Bergen, CNN's terrorism expert, clearly has done his homework -- and presented it exceedingly well. This book clearly works highly successfully on SEVERAL LEVELS:<br />a)A vividly described account of how he interviewed key figures in the Jihadist terrorism network, including bin Laden himself. He describes traveling on the land, how key players look, and their attitudes. When you read these accounts, intricate word pictures are painted in your mind. It's as if you are THERE.<br /> His description of Peshawar, Pakistan: &quot;Seeking some relief from the noise and pollution, I paid a visit to the leafy graveyard where dozens of British officers and soldiers were buried.&quot;<br />  On his meeting with bin Laden:&quot;He is a tall man, well over six feet, his face dominated by an aquiline nose....he walked with a cane and seemed tired, less like a swaggering revolutionary than a Muslim ascetic...Those around him treated him with the utmost deference...&quot;<br />b)Boilerplate material. The facts, figures and histories of some of these folks, their groups, their funding, and the countries (one less, as of this writing...) in which they overtly and covertly operate. All presented in an easy-to-read, journalistic style.<br />c)New investigative info: How bin Laden lives, travels and communicates with cells. Since 9/11 some of this material has been borrowed by other media as part of research -- but it has never been better presented than in this book.<br />d)A context in which readers can get some idea of what comes next. Indeed, the book came out right after 9/11 and in in the book's afterward Bergen states &quot;we can be certain that al-Quaeda is planning another attack on an American target in a place no one expects.&quot;<br />  But American citizens -- and policy makers -- should be able to anticipate things (as well as they can anticipate things) a lot better by reading Bergen's masterful, can't-put-it-down Holy War, Inc.

The Associate starts in a gallery in an enticing prologue, when a lawyer sees a photo and almost faints. It then advances to what SEEMINGLY is going to be a mundale legal story, as a young somewhat naive associate in a law firm gets documents to review dumped on him at the last minute by an attractive co-worker who tells him she has plans for the evening and would he do her a favor?<br /> And when Daniel Ames agrees to review the documents, his life is turned up side down, causing him to lose his job, be arrested and get drawn into an intricate murder plot/conspiracy with dozens of deceptions at every turn.<br /> I LOVED this mystery novel. I sometimes have trouble reading fiction if the writer gets too carried away with his/her prose or the characters seem phoney. The Associate ranks as one of the best mystery/thriller novels I've read in many years. There are several reasons why I loved this book and YOU likely will too:<br /> 1)Ingenius plot: I thought I had guessed the key questions but I was totally wrong. The author brilliantly threw false clues my way and I fell for them every time.<br /> 2)A highly flawed character. Ames is self-absorbed through a lot of the book, makes a ton of mistakes yet we see him steadily grow.<br /> 3)Well etched other characters.<br /> 4)The legal setting: I'm not a lawyer and am now an entertainer but I worked on various newspapers in my old incarnation. This accurately portrays the jockeying for position, office politics, and ways that ambition impacts the way people think and often act in big corporations (a legal firm, a newspaper). The general public will love this book; lawyers will find it even more enjoyable (as will law students) for the depiction of a high-powered law firm.<br /> 5)The writing: Margolin doesn't waste words. There isn't a word, description or piece of dialogue that isn't relevant to the story.<br /> 6)The ending. I WON'T give it away, but when I finished this book I felt truly satisfied. You will NOT be disappointed that you read to the end -- but may regret that this wonderful book is over.<br /> Great book...would make a GREAT movie!!uly satisfied.

US	52992914	R39G73IILNB2X3	0895261901	148709607	Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News	Books	5	240	310	N	Y	Subtitle: BLUNT -- no-holds-barred &amp; fact-filled!!!	Former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg's BIAS became politicized even before it was out on the market. And it's a shame.<br />  This is a WONDERFUL, important, thought-provoking book and a GREAT READ...no matter WHAT your political stance is. Before this book was even in the general public's hands conservative talk-show hosts glorified it while some liberals (and news figures) badmouthed or down played it. But the bottom line is: Goldberg is a gifted writer who writes with incredible bluntness and supports most allegations with specific names, facts and quotations.<br />  Goldberg, the modern media's most high-profile whistleblower, became a non-person and was  marginalized until he left CBS due to his sin: he wrote a blunt and thoughtful piece in the Wall Street Journal questioning the objectivity of  CBS Evening News reporter Eric Engberg's Reality Check segment in which Engberg ridiculed presidential candidate Steve Forbe's flat-tax idea's &quot;Number One Wackiest Flat Tax Promise.&quot;<br />  There are two levels to this book. One, woven throughout, is the story of how due to his sin the CBS hierarchy, particularly his one-time friend Dan Rather, shunned him, kept him off the air, and was furious at him. He says one CBS bigwig warned him that the corporation would use &quot;all the big guns in its arsenal against him&quot; if he became too sympathetic. Rather was quoted as suggesting Goldberg, who was NOT a Republican, was trying to intimidate him and, Goldberg alleges, took a &quot;take-no-prisoners&quot; behind-the-scenes stance to undermine him. Even media types outside CBS were not happy with him leading him to conclude that media &quot;elites&quot;, which want to report on everyone, don't want anyone to report on them.<br />  The other level is more important: he gives specifics examples (names, quotes, specific stories) of deeply ingrained media bias. Some key ones:<br />--A CBS reporter in a conference call labelling former presidential candidate Gary Bauer &quot;that little nut from the Christian Group.&quot; And no editors listening objected.<br />--How a CBS producer didn't want images of black prisoners on a chain gang story since it might make viewers think many prisoners were black (which they were)...and similar problems on showing black looters in the Virgin Islands.<br />--How news producers generally don't like to feature blacks in news stories since it means lower ratings.<br />--How homeless activists bloated statistics and downplayed the role of the mentally ill, alcoholic and drug-users among that population. How the homeless story is heavily reported when Republicans are in power, then suddenly dropped once a Demcrat takes office. He makes a persuasive case.<br />--How the news media went along with early contentions by AIDS activists that the horrorific disease put the entire heterosexual population at risk versus specific segments (homosexuals, drug users and those that have sex with them).<br />--How the word &quot;controversial&quot; often means the reporter/show does not agree with the person or issue to which it refers.<br />--How conservatives are labelled as such but liberals aren't.<br /><br />  This book has a wealth of SPECIFIC, FACTUAL information...all peppered with Goldberg's blunt reporting, hilarious zingers (too many to count here!), and searing sarcasm.<br />  This should be required reading for anyone who is in or thinking about going into journalism. Ironically, the book's basic set-up is its FLAW. By being so blunt and taking on the issue head-on Goldberg runs the risk (as his appearances on talk shows prove) of being defined by others as being a disgruntled employee and conservative ideologue. He is truly NEITHER: due to his &quot;crime&quot; he ran into a buzz saw of office politics, sometimes subtle corporate retaliation, blatant efforts to discredit him and his motives -- and is clearly angry. But his ALLEGATIONS here are BACKED UP with SPECIFICS.<br />  If nothing else, Goldberg shows how news organizations operate from a ground-level assumption -- a conventional political wisdom. ALL news outlets do (take it from a former reporter, like me): CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN and Fox. In staking out his ground here, Goldberg does too.  But unlike others Goldberg's message is &quot;let's THINK about this and let's do SOMETHING to apply the same rules to everyone and be MORE objective.&quot; For that he became personna non grata in circles he criticizes, a hero to those who hate those circles -- but his message is a solid one and delivered with all the writing skill of a topflight pro.rg shows how news organizations operate from a ground-level assumption -- a conventional political wisdom.

So it'll please and disappoint some. This isn't a hedge, but a fact.<br />Nancy Cartwright is a supremely young talented actress/voice-over artist who, unless you live on Jupiter, know is the REAL voice of 10-year-old Bart Simpson (and some other characters on the show). The questions: Could she write a book that satisfied detail-hungry Simpson's fans with tidbits about how the show is created, animated, written, voiced. Could she provide bio info on the other cast members? Could she give behind-the-scenes stories about the various highpowered guest stars? And could she also do a SOLID  show biz bio that shows how she got from point A to Point B, from a child in awe of show biz figures, especially voice-over stars, to a behind-the-scenes star? The answers: YES...and no.<br />This book could be gifted to EVERY youth who seeks any career for one reason alone: it shows in the beginning how, at an early age, she was smart enough to pick a prominent mentor with whom she could consult, who could help open doors a tiny crack for her. It was Daws Butler, voice of a zillion cartoon characters such as Yogi Bear. She had the TALENT but was smart enough to seek out advice, meet her mentor, take his advice and let him guide her through the show biz obstacle course early in her career.<br />For Simpson's fans, the book is rich in enormous detail (also in italics and a conversational style that becomes slightly grating at times but is sincere). What comes across is Cartwright's underlying modesty (but she is confident) and her continued (endearing) ghee-whiz  awe at being in a business where she can meet all these famous people. There's also a nice collection of photos and a little cartoon in the lower right hand corner that animates when you flip the pages. Some non die-hard Simpsons fans MAY flip this book's pages since it most successful as a book for fans of the show.<br />On the other level, as a show biz bio of interest to more than die-hard fans, it doesn't work as well, but has definite merits. There's a superb blow-by-blow explanation of how the program is created, animated and voiced. Excellent descriptions are given about voice-over specifics -- so this would indeed be an IMPORTANT book for someone who wants to do cartoon or commercial voices. They can learn about what goes into voice-overs, the importance of goal-setting, the importance of trying to implement a goal and the importance of seeking mentors (for at least advice before leaping into things).<br />Yet, because it is a mixture it somehow doesn't seem to TOTALLY fulfill either mission, as a fanzine book or show biz bio. But that is NOT -- rpt NOT -- Cartwright's fault: she is an enormously talented young woman who has already shot to the top of the voice-over business NOT because of her mentor, but because of incredible talent. We might forgive her if her book is not as solid or fascinating as the immortal Mel Blanc's solid 1988 autobiography That's Not All Folks. He was about a lot older than her.<br />Cartwright has a long career ahead of her -- and will most certainly continue to skyrocket once the Simpson's is off the air. We're sure to see her write another autobiography some years down the pike -- and that one will surely be a classic. For now, My Life As A 10-Year-Old Boy will do quite nicely.mpsons fans MAY flip this book's pages since it most successful as a book for fans of the show. <br />On the other level, as a show biz bio of interest to more than die-hard fans, it doesn't work as well, but has definite merits.

The bottom line: for years (until 9/11) most Americans had no idea that behind the scenes horrific weapons were being developed that could potentially wipe out an entire country and that if these weapons did not work as expected the whole even world could be at risk. And, worse, that as unpredictable as nations might be, terrorists are far more unpredictable -- and these weapons could easily fall into their hands or be made by them.<br />  Ironically, the original run of this book was reportedly modest, but in the aftermath of Sept. 11 it shot to the top of the New York Times best seller list -- and again for GOOD REASON: it is the most &quot;accessible&quot; of the germ warefare books.<br />  Germs is a masterful work: full of blow-by-blow detail on the various &quot;germs&quot; (biological, chemical) and the lies and deceit practiced by ALL countries that worked on these unspeakable weapons(lies and deceit aimed at other countries and their own populaces). It's a book that you MUST read, or gift or lend.<br />  REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK: 1)It shows how various countries including the US secretly worked on biological/chemical warefare weapons  for defense purposes through the years. To it's credit, the US got mostly out of the germ warefare biz...but Sadaam's preoccupation with weapons of mass destruction forced the US back in. 2)It shows how the Soviet Union misled the US just as badly as Iraq's dictator did.  3)It goes into stark detail on how deadly these weapons are and how easy it would be for terrorists to develop and use them..and get their desired deadly results. 4)At times it resembles a kind of scientific MYSTERY or THRILLER: it's a whosedoing it with an easy-to-read narrative style. 5)It outlines how researchers discovered precisely who is working on what and what it means -- and does it with a journalistic approach: quotes, facts, but a story with a beginning a middle and an all too possbily frightening end. 6)It is in itself a STRONG argument for eventual military action against Iraq: Sadaam remains the lingering threat, according to the authors. 7)It sets off the alarm  -- but leaves room for hope.<br />  WHY YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS BOOK: 1)If you're looking for a research document this won't be for you since it is a journalistic work. 2)If you're looking for a pure recitation of each kind of threat and what it means that is probably another book; the info is there but it is woven into the overall theme. 3)If you're looking for a book that says we are just a minute away from buying the farm, this isn't for you -- but you will get a sinking feeling at the horrorific threats out there.<br />  Above all: this book was NOT written to capitalize on the present climate...it was written BEFORE the recent tragic events, which makes its well-delivered message even more compelling and credible.is working on what and what it means -- and does it with a journalistic approach: quotes, facts, but a story with a beginning a middle and an all too possbily frightening end. 6)It is in itself a STRONG argument for eventual military action against Iraq: Sadaam remains the lingering threat, according to the authors. 7)It sets off the alarm  -- but leaves room for hope.<br />   WHY YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS BOOK: 1)If you're looking for a research document this won't be for you since it is a journalistic work. 2)If you're looking for a pure recitation of each kind of threat and what it means that is probably another book; the info is there but it is woven into the overall theme. 3)If you're looking for a book that says we are just a minute away from buying the farm, this isn't for you -- but you will get a sinking feeling at the horrorific threats out there.<br />   Above all: this book was NOT written to capitalize on the present climate...it was written BEFORE the recent tragic events, which makes its well-delivered message even more compelling and credible.	2001-12-10

Soupy Sales was to kids growing up in the 50s and 60s what Ernie Kovaks was to adults: a comedian with attitude, a visual zaniness unmatched by other kids-show performers, a kids show host who just happened to do kids shows...but shows where he talked TO and never DOWN TO the kids. And his seemingly ad lib (a lot was planned), crazy, punny, pie-in-the-face and slapstick schtick won over may ADULT viewers too...such as Frank Sinatra, who asked to appear on his show -- and get a pie in the face (he DID, and Sales lived to talk about it..).<br />  Today's question: could the former Milton Supman, now 75, write a show biz bio that goes BEYOND being a syrupy fanzine bio to a tell &quot;all&quot; book offering something of interest to those who want to go into comedy or show biz -- yet STILL be a FUNNY book?<br />  The answer is YES.<br />  I collect show biz bios and this is one of the few that I actually underlined. It is outstanding in its genre. It's a book that will be interesting to those who SAW Sales in his prime AND those who want to learn more about show business' realities, the importance of self-confidence,  goal-setting, and comedy.<br />  If you loved Soupy as a kid, you won't be disapppointed. It's all here: info about his shows in Ohio, L.A. and New York, his battles with corporate &quot;suits&quot; who tried to typecast and creatively stifle him, the (in)famous joke where he asked kiddies in his New York audience to sneak into their sleeping parents' rooms and send him those little green pieces of paper in their wallets with George Washington's picture on it (many did), his hit record (The Mouse), details about who played his characters White Fang, Black Tooth, Pookie, info about his other television, movie, and radio work...and more. A key secret revealed: his favored pie ingredient was...shaving cream.<br />  If you like LOTS of puns and one liners, the book is crammed with them. In fact, Sales seems greatly influenced by the Marx Brothers' word play jokes (much as the late Steve Allen was).<br />  But there are some other qualities in this bio that you do NOT see in other show biz bios -- and it is HIGHLY refreshing...and WORTH THE PRICE of this book. It makes the book a great GIFT for any aspiring young comedian, actor or kids performer who also wants to perform for adults (his secret here: he did NOT change his act for adults...long before it was fashionable, he appealed to -- and was appealing to -- the &quot;inner child&quot; in adults).<br />  He talks about personal and career ups and downs with great candor. At an early age he was &quot;addicted to the sound of applause&quot; but upon entering show biz he admits he was &quot;unprepared for the kinds of people I was going to meet in the business, the kinds of people who didn't know how to be straight with you, the kinds of people whose only interest in you would be what you could do for them.&quot;<br />  He learned that when he was on top, everyone wanted him around, wanted to swim in his pool, eat his food, and drink his booze. When he wasn't on top, many of his show biz &quot;friends&quot; wouldn't return phone calls. In the end, Sales may not have received the recognition comedians such as Abbott and Costello, or even kids show performers like Buffalo Bob Smith, got. But he did his comedy HIS way with integrity -- usually walking away rather than compromising with the typcasting, penny-pinching corporate suits. So he never really compromised the kind of crazy comedy HE loved -- and his fans loved.<br />  Sales has had some physical ailments recently, but still performs and attends autograph shows, etc. His book was a LOT more enjoyable, meatier, and informative than I ever expected...and it's a great book or gift for his fans, comedy lovers, aspiring comedians -- or anyone who just wants to read an inspirational story about a guy who loved applause and kept plugging away, no matter what.' word play jokes (much as the late Steve Allen was).<br />      But there are some other qualities in this bio that you do NOT see in other show biz bios -- and it is HIGHLY refreshing...and WORTH THE PRICE of this book.

I've read a lot of (good, medium and bad) books on Abbottt and Costello -- and this is the BEST e-v-e-r.<br />  If you're just discovering Abbott and Costello (and a major movie is reportedly in the works so you will hear more about them) you'll discover in these lively, profusely illustrated pages why the team greatly inspired Jerry Seinfeld and others. If you're into comedy and want to learn about their techniques and routines, you'll get plenty of helpful analysis plus some superb transcripts of some of their most famous, classic routines. If you're a Baby Boomer and want to read THE ULTIMATE book to take you down a nostalgic path to your beloved childhood stars, this is all you need. Why? A few reasons:<br />  1. It's filled with tons of bio material about their careers, long lively quotes, a complete listing of their movies, tv and other appearances.<br />  2. It is not a fanzine book. It looks at the two, warts and all, dispells a few of the myths that grew up due to bad reporting and, in one case, apparently, a highly inaccurate Hollywood movie about them done nearly 30 years ago.<br />  3. It traces their whole careers, their triumphs, the sad loss of Costello's drowned son (how he went on the radio nonetheless with his show), their split up, Costello going solo, his tragic untimetly death, Abbott's attempt to stay in show biz, Abbott's tax problems and final years.<br />  4. It has the BEST interviews from people who worked with them and knew them.<br />  5. It has the BEST photos, illustrations - even a full color section that is not available in any other book on them. We don't usually think about this team in color, even though they made two color flicks.<br />  6. Its the BEST COLLECTION of info and the most UP TO DATE. This is basically a comprehensive rewrite (LOTS of new stuff) and expansion of an earlier book on them under a different title. I have both books now and will not part with either.<br />  The biggest compliment of a show biz bio book is that you read it and you immediately want to re-examine the artists' work. You truly won't want to put this book down if you're a comedy fan, just discovering this team, or remember them. Save your money on the other books -- get, read and/or gift this.

In fact, I can see the Oliver Stone movie now.....<br />  Historian Michael Beschloss makes it seem easy when you read it, but transcribing and annotating (so you know through footnotes what LBJ is referring to when he talks and get some historical context..and know when LBJ is spinning) these conversations taped between 1964 and 1965 could not have been easy. Yet, he gives you the meat and you get to &quot;know&quot; how LBJ thinks and, politically, works.<br />  It shows Johnson, warts and all, as a man who could have been one of the top presidents because of his skills, will and sincere desire to serve. But it also shows a highly conflicted, contradictory, at times paranoid and highly depressed man. On the night of his monster landslide 1964 election he is angry and &quot;down,&quot; steaming over Bobby Kennedy's influence, lack of political deference and possible future machinations. As he presses and manipulates to get his Great Society legislation passed, he's secretly leaking negative info on election opponent Barry Goldwater, keeping the lid on information regarding his number one aide's role in a sex scandal. He talks of victory in Vietnam, but repeatedly tells politicos and his wife that there is absolutely no way the U.S. can ever win, and he is tormented by his terrible choice and unwanted role. He wants to help the poor and the blacks, but will talk a little more &quot;southern&quot; if he has to while talking to someone who doesn't quite agree with him to make them think he's on their wavelength.<br />  The famous Gulf of Tonkin resolution? Even Johnson believed it may not have happened. But he took the resolution in Congress and ran with it -- using it to justify the war he knew he the U.S. could not win.<br />  In Feb. 1965 he told a Senator &quot;a man can fight if he can see daylight down the road somewhere. But there ain't no daylight in Vietnam. Not a bit.&quot;<br />  If you went back and contrasted his public pronouncements with what he was saying privately, it would be shocking: pep talks to the country (and troops) to the contrary, he never felt we could win. Meanwhile, he kissed J. Edgar Hoover's you-know-what to keep Hoover on his side (actually, they had been neighbors in Washington and Johnson had carefully wooed Hoover for years) in his battle against Goldwater, Kennedy and others.<br />  Not all of the book is about the sad, deceitful slide into Vietnam. Many of the transcripts deal with his election campaign, domestic legislation etc....but by the end of this fast-moving volume Vietnam is devouring LBJ alive as it did the country  -- and the innocence and joy of the early 1960s.<br />  I read this book rather quickly. It was an INCREDIBLE experience. Read it and you'll be a very sad fly on the wall in theWhite House.sad fly on the wall in the White House.	2001-11-24

Yet, he gives you the meat and you get to &quot;know&quot; how LBJ thinks and, politically, works.<BR>    It shows Johnson, warts and all, as a man who could have been one of the very best presidents because of his skills, will and sincere desire to serve. But it shows a highly conflicted, contradictory, at times paranoid and highly depressed man. On the night of his monster landslide 1964 election he is angry and &quot;down,&quot; steaming over Bobby Kennedy's influence and possible future machinations. As he presses and manipulates to get his Great Society legislation passed, he's leaking info on election opponent Barry Goldwater, keeping the lid on information regarding his number one aide's role in a sex scandal. He talks of victory in Vietnam, but repeatedly tells politicos and his wife that there is absolutely no way the U.S. can ever win, and he is tormented by his terrible choice and unwanted role. He wants to help the poor and the blacks, but will talk a little more &quot;southern&quot; if he has to while talking to someone who doesn't quite agree with him to make them think he's on their wavelength.<BR>    The famous Gulf of Tonkin resolution? Even Johnson believed it may not have happened. But he took the resolution in Congress and ran with it -- using it to justify the war he knew he the U.S. could not win.<BR>     In Feb. 1965 he told a Senator &quot;a man can fight if he can see daylight down the road somewhere. But there ain't no daylight in Vietnam. Not a bit.&quot;<BR>     If you went back and contrasted his public pronouncements with what he was saying privately, it would be shocking indeed: pep talks to the country (and troops) to the contrary, he never felt we could win. Meanwhile, he kissed J. Edgar Hoover's you-know-what to keep hoover on his side (actually, they had been neighbors in Washington and Johnson had carefully kept Hoover on his side for years) in his battle against Goldwater, Kennedy and others.<BR>      Not all of the book is about the sad, deceitful slide into Vietnam. Many of the transcripts deal with his election campaign, domestic legislation...but by the end of the volume Vietnam is devouring LBJ alive as it did the country and the innocence and joy of the early 60s. <BR>      I read this book rather quickly. It was an INCREDIBLE experience. Read it and you're a fly on the wall in the White House.	2001-11-24

Some are clearly for people who already know something or know a lot and, to the beginner, these books often don't make sense. Then there are the &quot;cutesy&quot; books that talk down to the readers as if they have been lobotomized. I have to admit that I have been absolutely confused (or frustrated) about most of the many I have read....until now:<br />  David Fontana has written a book that is not only a JOY to read and think about -- but a sublime pleasure to look at.<br />  The only way to explain this book to you is this way: it is not a long, pondereous book. Yet, it is crammed with info, inspiration and wonderful art.<br />  Chapters are generally short (a few pages). At the end of each highly readable and enjoyable chapter there is an exercise which (if you try it) is not only fun but greatly increases your understanding of what Zen is all about.<br />  And there's more: I have SELDOM had a book that is so tastefully and beautifully illustrated. It's like holding a little treasure -- a tiny art gallery in your hand. The illustrations are so simple, yet so inspiring (one exercise even has you interpret one).<br />  How much do I love this book? I am going to re-read it. I may eventually gift this to someone who is interested in Zen. And I am going to hunt for Fontana's other books.<br />  This is a book I want to re-read, carry with me on trips and take off the book shelf often -- to gaze on the little art gallery within its covers.

His<br />book Hardball was already a political classic due to Matthews talent for cramming tons of perceptive political insight into short, conversational chapters written in a breezy style.<br /> Let Me Tell You What I Really Think lives up to it's title: he outlines topics such as Al Gore, George Bush, Bill Clinton, JFK, Ronald Reagan etc. then at the end of each chapter under the title HERE'S WHAT I REALLY THINK he bluntly tells you. No hedging allowed. No political lines or spin. Just stuff from the gut -- and heart.<br /> Matthews is without question the best, most succinct newspaper columnist of his generation. Way before he hosted the confrontational Hardball, he wrote speeches for President Carter, had been a Democrat, Republican, Peace Corps volunteer, worked for Tip O'Neill, etc. What he was TOPS at was writing to-the-point newspaper columns...that often accurately predicted political outcomes (he won several awards for this talent).<br /> In this short, but opinion and idea-packed book, you can read the three pages on George Bush, written after the Sept 11 attack, and read the BEST, most insightful profile on GWB written by anyone yet. Read his Clinton chapter and he manages to actually give a new perspective on the former prez. Read the Al Gore chapter and he writes about a man he personally knows, explaining why he lost and will never be elected president (Gore's &quot;know-it-all&quot; personality did him in). Democrats and Republicans will alternatively love and hate this book, since he is not parroting a radio talk show host, member of Congress, or activist.<br />  Matthews marches to his own political drummer, so various partisans go through stages thinking he is &quot;on their side&quot; or &quot;against them.&quot; Wrong on both counts!<br />Reasons why you MUST read and/or gift this book: 1. It's a pleasure to read. 2. His chapters on political leaders are the best ever written. 3. His chapters on America, democracy and American spirit burst with his own enthusiasm, ideas and specific examples. 4. His chapter giving career advice should be REQUIRED READING for young people or anyone who has a dream. Again, in a few short pages he gives basic advice so forcefully and documented that you can throw out ALL your wordy and costly motivational books and tapes...and just READ and re-read this chapter. That'll do it! 5. His personal stories about the Peace Corps, his family and his political evolution show someone who is truly a national resource. Great to read...great to gift!written. 3.

I was a Political Science major in college so that did not bother me. BUT I was truly SURPRISED when I read this -- and STRONGLY recommend it to everyone who wants to get &quot;the complete picture&quot; of where the United States is in this terrorism &quot;war,&quot; how terrorism grew, where it is going...and how it may be contained.<br />  True, this book cannot be compared to a &quot;fast read&quot; nonfiction book or an informative news magazine piece. It is quite serious and that's not surprising since its author was deputy chief of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center. But it is NOT boring and is easily undertandable. It's sort of between an academic text and a standard nonfiction book.<br />  Even though it was written before the horrorific Sept 11 events there are plenty of references to Osama bin Laden..and many others terrorist individuals and groups. In fact, chapters are broken into headings such as states, groups, counterterrorist instruments, etc.<br />  What's MOST interesting about this book is this: immediately after Sept 11 American policymakers (government and elected) had been faulted with not knowing much about terrorism.<br />  But it is VERY clear from reading this book that this is THE book they have used to get up to speed. This clearly was their &quot;Bible.&quot; A lot of what is going on now seems to be based on the concepts and conclusions in this book; and when you listen to some elected officials on Sunday news shows it's clear they read THIS book.<br />  The most unsettling part of all this is: after you read it, and get a wonderful understanding of the groups, people, and options, you realize that: a)the US government and officials WERE indeed woefully unprepared (books like this and reports on terrorism apparently were used as doorstops by both political parties until disaster struck) and b) dealing with terrorism is akin to squeezing a half-full water balloon...for each push on one end, something bulges on the other end.<br />  I STRONGLY recommend this book to ANYONE who wants to understand the historical, military and political minefield that the U.S. now tiptoes through.<br />  Don't be scared off because it's a serious book! It's thoughtful, balanced with lots of quotes and analysis. Level-headed...and NOT a &quot;doomsday&quot; book. Academics will love it. Policy makers and elected officials already parrot it. And the average reader will find it understandable...and realize the challenges and dangers ahead as never before. Read it and keep it, or read it and lend it, or read it and sell it...but READ IT.

You'll roar at wisecracks so biting and mean that you'll feel guilty. And if you read a certain (in)famous chapter you'll howl with laughter, pretend you shouldn't have read it -- and read it again...and howl.. again.<br />The acid-pen Sedaris shot to fame reading his humorous stories over National Public Radio (and he still insisted on cleaning houses for money). The book's first half has stories on various subjects (family, art class, teaching writing, working for tough bosses etc.). The second deals with his experiences in moving to France with his lover.<br />Sedaris spares no one -- not his father, sister, teachers, artists or himself -- from his scapel-sharp, insight-filled humor. Some wisecracks are instant classics. When he tries to<br />become an artist, dabbling in questionable performance art, he writes of artists: \\"Their artworks were known as `pieces,' a phrase I enthusiastically embraced. `Nice piece,' I'd<br />say. In my eagerness to please, I accidentally complimented chipped baseboards and sacks of laundry waiting to be taken to the cleaners. Anything might be a piece if you looked at<br />it hard enough.\\"<br />When a museum wants him to do some performance art it seemed \\"as though I should play hard to get, but after a moment or two of awkward silence, I agreed to do it for what I called `political reasons.' I needed the money for drugs.\\"<br />In a chapter detailing the lives and deaths of his various pets: \\"When my mother died and was cremated herself we worried that, acting on instinct, our father might run out and<br />immediately replace her.\\" When he's invited to teach: \\"I was clearly unqualified yet I accepted the job without hesitation, as it would allow me to wear a tie and go by the name<br />Mr. Sedaris.\\" And what a sadistic French teach told him:\\"Every day spent with you is like having a cesarean section.\\"<br />In his most innovative \\"piece,\\" a chapter called Big Boy, he describes his battle with (ahem) something he sees in a toilet.

This book completely EXCEEDED my expectations! As a former journalist (who is now a ventriloquist believe it or not) I've always been interested in how and why gossip has grown in our news media.<br />I got THAT answer in this wonderful book written in a breezy, solid style that made it hard for me to put -- plus a LOT MORE.<br />Starting with Matt Drudge's meteoric rise, DISH backtracks to trace the growth in gossip over the years. You'll also find new revelations in here. In the end our news media (what it printed and NEGLECTED to print over the years) will make sense to you. And it reads like a novel. Some tidbits:<br />1. The overnight rise of Matt Drudge, using a computer his dad gifted him. Everything you wanted to know and what you didn't want or need to know (i.e. his alleged sexual preferences; media suspicions that he got some scoops through hacking) about him and how his lively internet column took over, confounded mainstream media and made him a huge multi-media star.<br />2. How the Hollywood studios along with fawning California politicos crushed Confidential magazine, the 1950s gossip sheet which dared to undermine the carefully-constructed phoney public relations images of many stars (some stars are named in the book).<br />3. Mike Wallace's pioneering role in bringing show biz to news, his fall from grace and professional rebirth on 60 Minutes.<br />4. The birth of the National Inquirer and why it's located in Florida (fears of problems from the Mob).<br />5. Why there wasn't more MAJOR NEGATIVE published gossip on the Kennedy administration (they virtually destroyed one person dabbling in info about them and many journalists were intimidated.) JFK's other marriage.<br />6. The OJ case, Elvis Princess Diana case, the gossip columnists of the 40s and 50s and their replacements, the explanation of why Rona Barrett had such a sudden rise and fall. The birth of People Magazine and it's influence on pushing tabloids to another level...which pushed the national media to a new level (or low?).<br />7. Hardball-playing p.r. and private detectives who contolled their clients images and staved off major scandals -- and how they do it (bullying, getting the dirt on and confronting critics and making sought after clients inaccessible to offending journalists).<br />This is a highly ENTERTAINING book, with lots of facts, quotes and info that you haven't read elsewhere. It's solidly written but an EASY read and you'll REGRET it when you come to the last page. It answered a LOT of questions for me about what &quot;really&quot; went on and why our news media is the way it is today. SUPERB!!!ia to a new level (or low?).<BR>7.

I thought about this book for days after finishing it. There are books on the Beatles as a group and individually...and then there are show biz books on the pitfalls of fame. This SUPERB book shows that his last years of his life, contrary to conventional wisdom, Mr. Lennon didn't live an ideal life -- free of money woes, free to contemplate, write beautiful music, travel, a life filled with hundreds of friends etc. In fact, as Mr. Rosen's GREAT reporting shows, he was worried about his physical appearance, jealous of Sir Paul, lonely, distrustful of people since he felt they wanted to use him, and striving to be a better father and friend to his son Julian.<br />Rosen temporarily had access to Lennon's diaries (which were later taken back) and the book quickly evolves into less a book about Lennon or a Beatle than someone enslaved by fame and fortune: the once rebellious Lennon had become highly materialistic, a boss who almost gleefully hired and fired servants frequently and a person emotionally chained and drained by Yoko. Indeed, the book confirms fans' suspicions that had he not been with Yoko he might have created MORE during his lifetime. With all his wealth, real estate and servants he led a somewhat depressing, hum-drum life, holed up in his apartment, creatively bankrupt until when, towards the end, he recorded Double Fantasy.<br />The irony is that just as he began to lift himself out of his creative and personal slumps, Mark David Chapman started going quickly downhill. This book brilliantly details Chapman's transformation into Lennon's assasin. And it's done with no corn or cliche -- just brilliant reporting that makes you feel the loss even more when it's over.<br />On a personal note, I was working on a newspaper in Kansas (I am now a fulltime ventriloquist) doing night shift the night Lennon was murdered. When the editor on duty said &quot;They shot John Lennon&quot; my reaction was &quot;Was he hurt?&quot; You'll feel the loss AGAIN when you read this -- but this time a SPECIAL LOSS since it was clear he was finally getting his life, priorities, work and relationships on track when he was struck down. EXCELLENT BOOK ON THE PITFALLS OF FAME EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE BEATLES.this -- but this time a SPECIAL LOSS since it was clear he was finally getting his life, priorities, work and relationships on track when he was struck down.

I've used this book for years when I customize a show. I am a ventriloquist so one of the toast lines in this book for me would be: Here's a toast to a typical ventriloquist -- someone whose lips move even when he isn't saying anything. BUT there's also lines like: She's such a simple-minded ventriloquist it's hard to figure out which one is the dummy.<br />Herein lies the problem: this is a decent sized book with lots of entries. Unfortunately, many of them are too punny or &quot;groaners.&quot; (The comment about which one is the dummy would provoke a &quot;titter&quot; -- polite chuckle). There are some good lines, to be sure, but if you check off really good, solid laughs, the pickings are not as good as you'd like (or expect). Again, I USE this book when I customize a show so I know some of it WORKS for speakers, entertainers, etc. -- and this is a valuable book to have your bookshelf. But some of these could fall embarrassingly flat due to the large proportion of puns.<br />SO: At first I almost gave it 3 stars...but in the end I gave it four because it IS so well-organized and easy to use, and there ARE some real gems... but not as many as you'd like for a book nearly 400 pages long.	2001-09-11

It's hard to find books on freelancing that offer solid advice but don't promise you the world. In the early 70s, after graduating journalism school, I freelanced overseas in India, Bangladesh and Spain for newspapers and magazines and learned about &quot;the realities&quot; first hand. Yes, I did write for some newspapers (Chicago Daily News, Christian Science Monitor and various other publications) and even did some contributions to National Public Radio (All Things Considered) from Madrid. (Then I dashed it all in 1990 to become a fulltime ventriloquist....but that's another story!)<br />I wish I had read THIS first!<br />True, this book is NOT a primer for that kind of freelancing (which may not be possible now anyway given the shrinking &quot;news hole&quot; for foreign stories in the American media). This book is geared, as the cover states, &quot;for educated people whose primary motivation for trying to get into print is the wish to effectively communicate their ideas, skills and discoveries in appropriate publications.&quot; But there's a wealth of helpful stuff crammed into this tightly-written book.<br />Marcia Yudkin uses personal examples and anecdotes where she feels it's necessary and offers sound, solid, advice on not only the nuts and bolts of becoming a successful freelance but setting yourself up as a business -- and doing it with integrity. The words &quot;journalism&quot; and &quot;integrity&quot; are not always linked these days...so her approach is to lift the craft and develop the craftsmanship.<br />Even if you don't totally like her approach, she includes a list of annotated resources for freelance writers that's worth the cost of this book. Many of these resources are additional how-to magazines and books. So her book is the perfect starting point since it'll get you off and running and guide you quickly to places where you can learn more.<br />The basics on query letters, targeting an audience, interviewing are all there...but I especially liked her chapters on the importance of revision and maintaining integrity. Integrity: What a refreshing concept these days! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.y liked her chapters on the importance of revision and maintaining integrity. Integrity: What a refreshing concept these days!

When I left a nearly 20 year newspaper career to become a ventriloquist and run around with a bunch of dummies (wait -- isn't THAT called political reporting??) I had absolutely no idea about the business side of show business. As a newspaper reporter I learned about \\"intellectual property\\" only when I did a story about it. And once I went into ventriloquism fulltime I had(and have) folks constantly urge me to set up a non-profit group for my extensive work with kids...but I had absolutely no idea what \\"non-profit\\" even meant, except perhaps some months of the year when it seemed as if I was in fact running a non-profit enterprise.<br />In all SERIOUSNESS: this wonderful concise book answers any questions you have. Entertainment actually involves having to deal with lots of complicated legalisms (contracts, kinds of insurance, what managers do, legal requirements on record keeping, leases, social security, etc.) This book covers them all (and more) and topics are alphabetized. Each topic is dealt with with the absolute number of words necessary -- not an overkill, not an oversimplification. It's a reference for any kind of performer, as well as anyone involved with or interested in the arts.<br />At the end there's even a listing of trade organizations, mailing list brokers, volunteer lawyers for the arts, and other associations and groups dealing with the arts. Each listing has an address and phone number. This book could save you LOTS of time -- and painful mistakes -- and free up LOTS more \\"creative time\\"!	2001-09-11

I could not WAIT until I got this book!<br />But I  found this book incredibly tedious.<br />At first I thought it was due to the fact that I'm American and Americans haven't seen as much of Hill's work as his British audiences. But I've read bios of comedians that detail work they did that I never viewed and I loved those books. This is a book crammed with research, whether it's about his early years -- how his comedy style came together -- or his years as the King of British TV, then American syndicated TV...and his sad fall as a victim of the relentless armies of political correctness.<br />The book reads like a collection of detailed research notes and staid business articles. There seems to be little passion (and when there seems to be passion it's a weird dispassionate passion!) for the subject, unlike the GREAT books done by authors on Laurel &amp; Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Chaplin, and most certainly, The Three Stooges. Those books make you want to go out and see more of their work, even if you don't like them. This book summarizes and informs -- and can bore a diehard fan.<br />It's so very sad because Hill was so incredibly funny. As an American I didn't like many of his verbal skits -- and certainly NOT his songs -- but his silent segments bordered on comedic genius a la Ernie Kovaks or (I know some will be furious at this) Chaplin.<br />This book is so clinical it took me a LONG TIME to finish it. I'm talking about MONTHS where I had to read other books to get back to and through it. Ross, who wrote a critically acclaimed book on Monty Python's Fying Circus, certainly did excellent research. There's a ton of info you can't get anywhere else -- inside information about each step of Hill's career and why he did what he did at pivotal times; who was in his corner, keeping him on t.v., and who didn't like him.<br />But I can only recommend this to die-hard Hill fans who want every single thing available on him -- NOT to anyone seeking a book that tells about Hill and communicates the joy and (until the end)uncensored craziness of his comedy. Today his comedy lives on in video tape, despite the enemies that ended his career and, some say, finally broke his heart.out each step of Hill's career and why he did what he did at pivotal times; who was in his corner, keeping him on t.v., and who didn't like him.<br />But I can only recommend this to die-hard Hill fans who want every single thing available on him -- NOT to anyone seeking a book that tells about Hill and communicates the joy and (until the end)uncensored craziness of his comedy.

Even with Milton Berle's amazing, thick-with-laughs two volume Private Joke Files this is one of the best joke books on the market. Why? It truly contains great one-liners, straight lines, gags, roasts, etc. from the Friars Club, many of them attributed to the world's greatest entertainers and comedians.<br />Don't give this to Little Johnny (although he may indeed like it) since some jokes in this superb book are adult oriented (with adult language, too) and - yes -- some are politically incorrect (\\"She's so fat she's my TWO best friends.\\" -- unattributed). But you'll howl with laughter as you read many of these.<br />And you can truly use them for any occasion or aim one at someone if you know his/her/its background (\\"You have to have a physical before you get into the Army. A doctor looks in one ear, another doctor looks in the other, and if they can't see each other you're in. If they can see each other, you become an MP.\\" -- Joe E Brown). Some jokes aren't attributed but you'll find many jokes directly credited to classic and modern comedians ... EVEN BETTER: It is well-organized into topics and indexed according to performer. I read a lot of joke books. Some I read, find mildly amusing and file in the basement. This one stays on my self for reference (I am a ventriloquist believe it or not) -- and if I just need a pick-me-up belly laugh. WELL worth the price!!	2001-09-10

Great WRITING=Great Comedy	Here's the book that partly answers why Seinfeld (and I Love Lucy and All in the Family and Married With Children and The Simpsons) is so funny: Great sit-com comedy doesn't just happen because you get a talented performer. It also depends HEAVILY on the writing guiding the performance.<br />Any Seinfed fan (or student or lover of comedy) MUST own this book. My only regret is that it only gives you  scripts for the first and second seasons (which, actually, many consider among the best). It shows you the solid comedic, consistently witty,  and highly ironic foundations behind the cast's classic performances.<br />The good news: this book READS funny. Unless you just don't like reading drama/comedy in script form, you'll howl almost as much (since you are missing actual facial expressions, timing and body language) as you read these. Quite a few of these episodes were written by Seinfeld and collaborator (who how has a critically acclaimed HBO comedy series) Larry David. The many episodes include &quot;The Jacket,&quot; &quot;The Pony Remark,&quot; &quot;The Deal,&quot; &quot;The Chinese Restaurant,&quot; (one of my favorites) and &quot;The Revenge.&quot;<br />According to published accounts, Seinfeld and David were absolutely adamant that there would be &quot;no hugging&quot; on THEIR show and that they would do the show their way or not do the show at all. They stuck to their guns. This book contains  highly original sitcom comedy which holds up exceedingly well in script form. Keep the importance of solid writing in mind as you see former cast members from his show (or even Jerry himself or former cast members of other big hits) try to clone their earlier success: without a solid comedic foundation -- which is funny on paper -- all the talent in the world won't create a hit sitcom.	2001-09-09

This was a book I almost didn't buy...and I am GLAD I did. I STRONGLY recommend it for anyone interested in the Rat Pack -- the male-bonded mega-and-not-so-mega entertainers Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop -- who epitomized Eisenhower/Kennedy era adult &quot;cool&quot; and were atop the show biz heap. If you've read other books on these folks and their era this pulls them all together (with a writing style that is fun, although at times a bit forced and annoying).<br />If you're a younger person and just want to learn about it, or in show biz and want to learn more, this is the perfect starting point. The reason: it's not just about entertainers but the sometimes insidious links between the entertainment, political, and organized crime worlds. A LOT has been written elsewhere about how Frank Sinatra used Peter Lawford for access to the Kennedys, and how he dropped him mercilessly when he was angered and was of no further use. The book also underlines the public images (&quot;cool,&quot; talented, pretending to be drunk at times as part of an act that audiences lapped up) and the behind-the-scenes near-sleaziness of excess drink, sex and egotistical acting out. You also get to know the era's colorful cast of characters, including Marilyn Monroe.<br />These segments are gripping enough, but major revelations include: 1)Their reign didn't really last more than four full years. 2)Being in or being forced out of the Rat Pack could make or break a career (Davis and Lawford found this out). 3)While Sinatra and others tried being &quot;cool&quot; and individualistic, they seemingly role played (Sinatra was influenced by Humphrey Bogart; some others by the Bogart-influenced Sinatra) but ONE member TRULY did it HIS WAY...and that was Dean Martin. He stayed himself, not allowing himself to be ordered around by either Sinatra or Mafia-tied figures. In the end, you walk away realizing the underrated Martin was the era's true &quot;cool&quot; hero --and Lawford and Monroe its true victims. A WONDERFUL READ!quot; hero --and Lawford and Monroe its true victims. A WONDERFUL READ!	2001-09-08

I can't say ENOUGH about this book (but I will obviously try!). This was one of the KEY books that helped teach me ventriloquism. Why? Because it contains many of the crucial parts of the world-famous Maher Studios ventriloquism correspondence course (it's sort of a small, condensed partial version of this all-encompassing course). If you read this compact information-filled book and practice its info you WILL learn how to talk without moving your lips and do &quot;vent.&quot; I now perform ventriloquism fulltime and the best way to show you how much I love and believe in this little book's effectiveness is to tell you this: I routinely gift this book to some low-income kids, groups, libraries and schools. And everyone who has used it has praised it. Ventriloquism in a Nutshell is ventriloquism's no-nonsense, primer that has been TESTED, PROVEN and been around for years. Author Clinton Detweiler is a former Ventriloquist of the Year (versus a Dummy of Every Two Years, which serves in Congress). He's a legend among &quot;vents.&quot; I only JUST discovered that this is available on Amazon...so I wanted to give this my highest POSSIBLE rating -- way ABOVE the five stars.

Whooaaaa! What a SOLID book! Don't let the fact that it's a paperback fool you. In some 204 pages Elaine Clark, a voice-over performer, casting director and coach, covers all bases -- and there is no padding. It's solid, useful, info that can be applied immediately. And if you read the book and follow her advice I suspect it'll shave YEARS off the typical hit-and-miss process that most of us (including me) go through in entertainment (I'm a ventriloquist, a lower form of voice life). There are many books on virtually every aspect of show biz and we're seeing more on voice-overs, an increasingly lucrative industry due to the explosion in cartoons, commercials, etc. Clark takes you through voice techniques, getting started, copy basics, looking for an agent and The Absolutely Crucial Step: doing a demo (just as most mere mortals are judged by how they present themselves on paper, entertainers are judged by what they choose to present in their demos). It even includes a section on staying on top. Nothing is left out; the writing style is to-the-point...no cutesy stuff that attempts to mask weak content. Each page is tightly-packed with detailed information. It's as if she is having her own private session with you -- and, actually, she is -- except it costs a lot less in book form.

True, she won an Emmy for her role as Alice on Jackie Gleason's classic The Honeymooners, which ran alternately as a sketch and for one season as an actual sitcom. If you ever want to see a TOP NOTCH comic actress at work see if you can get the Jack Benny Program (available on VHS)episode where Benny and his crew recreate the Honeymooners -- with Meadows playing Alice. No matter what the substitute cast does, she stays 100 percent in character as Alice.<br />This WONDERFUL book is chock full of info about her special chemistry with The Great One Jackie Gleason (to younger readers: he was the inspiration for Fred Flintstone and she was the inspiration for Wilma) both on and off the screen. This delightful book gives glimpses of the Honeymooners' stars lives on and off the screen, ,recounts key happenings on epidodes and traces the history of the show's various revivals in the late 60s and 70s.<br />HOWEVER: I strongly disagree with those who view this kind of book as nostalgia. It has valuable tips for anyone interested in acting and comedy. Gleason seldom rehearsed and she had a host of body language signals to help him with a line or move in a certain direction. As an entertainer (I'm a ventriloquist) I have always found one thing she said and writes here vital information for someone in a comedy team (even if your partner is wooden): When Gleason was doing key lines she generally froze. She reacted but kept movement, etc. to a minimum to keep the focus on him. Another tidbit: she was initially rejected by Gleason for the part of Alice (too pretty) so she had her picture taken when she woke up, without make up, and when it was submitted to him he KNEW this person (who he forgot he had seen and would not have recognized anyway) was his Alice.<br />You can sense her awe of and fondness for Gleason from start until she recounts his sad cancer death (she later died of cancer as well). She also sketches other cast members such as Art &quot;Ed Norton&quot; Carney so they come alive on paper. You sense the unappreciated professionalism of this actress who made doing these classic comedies actually done &quot;by the seat of the pants&quot; seem so easy, effortless and rehearsed.ther cast members such as Art &quot;Ed Norton&quot; Carney so they come alive on paper.

Second Edition	Books	5	89	92	N	N	One of my favorite and FUNNIEST how to do "vent" books!	As someone who got interested in ventriloquism (and eventually dumped a 20 year newspaper career to work with WOODEN dummies) I was often frustrated reading how-to-do-ventriloquism books. Most were either amazingly boring, unknowingly pompous, or filled with cutsey-comments that seemingly padded an explanation of what I believe is actually a relatively easy \\"art\\" (if you are nutty enough to practice in front of a mirror until you perfect the \\"hard\\" letters). This is one of my FAVORITE now to do ventriloquism books -- and to this day it remains the funniest. I still do a routine in my show based on the structure of one of Paul Stadelman's classic bits (I have long since replaced the actual jokes). The late Paul Stadelman was a \\"classic\\" and I believe underrated vent who performed, taught and was on television for many years. And this book is worth it's price just for the zippy routines with Stadelman and his dummy Windy Higgins. These don't go on and on with long set-ups but are punchy, quick pay-off bits (and if Stadelman used a pun it was seldom groan-inducing). Stadelman was clearly more influenced by vaudeville and comedy teams than by other ventriloquists (which I think is GOOD). At the least these routines help readers understand routine construction and setup-joke structure. The late, wonderful Col. Bill Boley (another performer who deserved a higher national profile since there are zillions of ventriloquists running around doing bits of his published work and others who painstakingly \\"emulate\\" his original routines) was the only other ventriloquist whose published routines came CLOSE to doing this. And to TEACH you vent? This book has it all. It gives you the substitute letters (to say for the hard letters) and words to practice to perfect them. It also tells you how to make a puppet out of your hand, gives you performing tips, has some great ventriloquism-related photos, and and list of suppliers and organizations (some of this is outdated now). If someone was interested in \\"vent\\" and had this book, George Schindler's Ventriloquism: Magic With Your Voice and the in-its-own-class Maher Studios correspondence course they'd have it all. Plus, if they have this book they're going to also have some BIG laughs while reading it.

Fun, factual and no-holds-barred. Not only does this book trace the history, creation, long run and bittersweet ending of the Howdy Doody Show but it goes into behind the scenes politics, personality problems, and sometimes adult-oriented rehearsals. There are lots of valentine-like books about this wonderful baby-boomer show (which still is FUNNY on videotape if you can get the right episodes!). But those usually gloss over the time the show fired most of its cast, the frustrations of some cast members, and the extent to which the show became a corporate money-machine for NBC. In the end it's demise had little to do with ratings or show quality but production costs. If you liked Howdy Doody, are interested in the show from a nostalgic standpoint, a show biz standpoint, a puppetry standpoint, or are simply interested in solid show biz history this is a CRUCIAL book since you won't find a lot of this info elswhere. Yes, it's lovingly written in parts...but it doesn't cover the warts. And it's a GREAT read!	2001-09-05

I say this as someone who was a journalist for nearly 20 years (and is now an entertainer). What's missing on the market: candid performers' profiles that still convey WHY great performers are GREAT performers and -- sometimes -- great people or great creeps. Show and Tell contains 15 of John Lahr's BEST New Yorker show biz profiles. The zest and verve of these creative folk and Lahr's excitement writing about them is all here. The subjects: Woody Allen, David Mamet, Frank Sinatra, Arthur Miller, Liev Schreiber, Roseanne, Irving Berlin, Wallace Shawn, Eddie Izzard, Neil Labute, Bob Hope, Ingmar Bergman, Mike Nichols, and his parents Bert and Mildred Lahr. You don't have to even know who these celebrities are (you'll enjoy this book if you're in your early 20s) to love these profiles: each chapter tells you how they got from point A (childhood) to point B (becoming great entertainers, playwrights etc) -- and about all the joys and obstacles along the way. Don't expect simplistic tabloid journalism but more detailed interviews. The Bob Hope profile was controversial when it was first published since it not only hinted at adultery but etched a portrait of a man who created a corporate comedy machine -- and even needed cue cards when performing at a private party. But there's tons of info amid these revelations. My other favorite profiles and tidbits include: Woody Allen (his casting method for movies sometimes boils down to him looking at someone for a few seconds), Bert Lahr (his frustration at not having made many movies, unlike some of his vaudeville colleagues), Roseanne (her rage-based comedy; how she wrested control of her t.v. show from what would have been sit-com mediocrity),Irving Berlin (the 20th century's most prolific and perhaps great composer adapting to all kinds of music from the century's beginning UNTIL rock...which finally did him in). There are many others but the point is: these are unlike any other profile's you'll read. They celebrate the joy, creative &quot;juice&quot; flow, toil, and heartbreak of show biz and performing arts creativity -- and you'll want to read them again and again.ck...which finally did him in).

Nancy's Letters from a Nut you know it's not going to be just another humor book. The premise is simple: Nancy (is it Jerry Seinfeld? Or Jerry's former collaborator Larry David? Or does Nancy exist -- or is he really some very SERIOUS author having fun?) writes seemingly serious, off-the-wall letters to various companies and indivduals. Some of the funniest are to hotels. In a 1996 letter he writes to the Las Vegas Hilton, saying he has saved up a long time for an Elvis concert and wants to make reservations for the croaked King's Sept 1996 show. Sometimes (as in the Hilton's letter)he gets back a form letter ignoring his letter's contents. Or sometimes, such as when he writes a hotel asking if they found his lost tooth, they answer seriously...as does the Disneyland Hotel, when he writes and asks if he could check in with his own ice machine (the hotel says no). This is laugh-out-loud stuff that you won't be able to put down: a letter to Nordstrom asking to buy a mannequin that looks like his deceased best friend; a letter to the University of Alabama praising the CITY of Alabama, etc. In each case, the complete letter is shown plus the often puzzled response. One note: this is modern &quot;ironic&quot; humor which means the humor isn't in just reading a single letter. It lies in reading the letter and THEN the response (or seeing a nonresponse). Nancy writes even nuttier follow up letters. FOOTNOTE: There are several additional books in the &quot;Letters&quot; series and they are all wonderfully, incredibly nutty. I own all three.	2001-09-04

The Song Is You: A Singer's Art	Books	5	28	28	N	Y	THE book for Sinatra fans and those who are discovering him	What better testimonial can you give to a book than saying it makes you so fired about about its subject that you want to discover more of his/her work? Will Friedwald's Sinatra! The Song is You will delight Sinatra fans and &quot;turn on&quot; anyone even REMOTELY interested in finding out why Sinatra was named the 20th century's Best Singer. It is without question the best book EVER written on Sinatra's music due to its style, details and because Friedwald does not pull any punches: he praises Sinatra for good work and criticizes him for work that falls short. All this is done without pretension, cutesy-ness or padding. The usual personal and professional biographical info is there, but mostly for historical context. Friedwald's interest is in Sinatra the singer -- and in Sinatra's VOICE as an instrument that developed, matured and eventually (and sadly) deteriorated. Going through each performing and recording stage of Sinatra's long career, Friedwald analyzes particular songs, explains Sinatra's trailblazing role in creating thematic &quot;concept&quot; albums, and gives fascinating details on how and why certain classic arrangements and songs were cut in the studio. He praises and blasts Sinatra's various arrangers. What's unquestionable is that Sinatra took this kind of music to an entirely new level. This book successfully conveys the ARTISTRY of Sinatra's music so you WANT to hear MORE. Reading this book took me from a mild to fanatical Sinatra fan as I started listening to the albums, remembering what I had read and appreciating what Sinatra was doing with his voice. Sinatra! The Song is You heightens an appreciation of a musical genre that is either on it's way out as we move into the 21st century --or waiting for a new innovative artist to come along to revive its popularity and take it to the next level.	2001-09-02

I always judge a joke book by how many jokes I circle the first time I read it. There are now a LOT of circles in this book! And the ones I circled were definitely above average jokes. In fact, I would say that with the exception of Milton Berle's Private Joke Files and More of the Best of Milton Berle's Private Joke Files this is the definitely the best joke book I've seen on the market(Uncle Miltie's thick printed laughfests will take a long time to match). My only MINOR complaint with this book is the title (which is why I almost gave it four stars): It's misleading to call a joke book NOTHING BUT WINNERS since comedy tastes vary so much from person to person that no one is going to like all or even perhaps 50 percent of the jokes. That being said, this is a GREAT collection for speakers, educators, CEOs, comedians and -- yes, like me (no joke) -- even ventriloquists. Most jokes (but not all) are one-liners. Some are tired old jokes (some I recognize from other comedians and even radio) that have been rewrittten. But quite a few are newer and hilarious ones that you don't find in most collections. There's also a nice collection of lines to squelch hecklers, &quot;save&quot; failed jokes, and lots of FUNNY one-liners specifically useful to speakers. Most jokes here are short and punchy. The book is well-organized by section with a table of contents so complete that it doesn't have (and doesn't need) an index. When I write routines, update a routine or do a customized show I sit down and start to write, then look at some favorite joke books for inspiration (and even &quot;switch&quot; a few jokes). This is now one of my favorites due to its well-classified sections and high laugh ratio. One interesting note: instead of offending possible readers with ethnic jokes, a section of secreamingly funny ethnic jokes is laid out with the word &quot;ethnic&quot; in place of an ethnic group (&quot;Did you hear about the ethnic...&quot;) That way readers can choose to fill in their own group name on the generic ethnic joke, and offend the group of their choice.their own group name on the generic ethnic joke, and offend the group of their choice.	2001-09-02

Relatives strongly suggested I read this book. It was (and is) on all of the best-seller lists. It has been a t.v. movie. It has been hailed as the kind of book that makes you pause and appreciate life -- a tool for a new spiritual awakening in many. It's one of these books that if you read it and don't like it people think you're out of it, or don't care or move your lips when you read. It is well-written and a quick read. I have to admit that during the first part of the book I was fascinated and deeply touched by story of the dying Morrie and his loyal former student and dear friend. Both teacher and student/author were folks I would have liked to have known and I admired them. And as the saga progresssed I became more involved. But the end of this book was very unsatisfying. It isn't that Morrie died (I sort of think that was not precisely a surprise...) but somewhere along the line this book seems to shift from a true, genuine testimonial to a wonderful man and teacher to a writing project concluded with a touch of triteness. In the end, I felt I had read something that manipulated my emotions, made me care, made me care partly because I knew OTHERS who read it cared... but didn't live up to it's beginning and middle in the end. True, it may take you on part of a spiritual journey...but towards the end it veers off course.	2001-09-02

This book is: a)a GREAT read that you'll want to re-read again, b)a MUST for anyone who has any plans to ever write any kind of fiction (it'll save you months of research), c)something you can send to your nephew who has been eyeing you strangely since he just learned you made out your will making him a beneficiary. He will realize he can be caught.. Have you been dying (SORRY..wrong word!) to find out more about strangulation, death certificates, embolisms, dominance theory, lie detectors, body disposal, dismemberment, cyanide, etc.? If so, it's all HERE in this well-written meticulously researched book. The authors are experts on murder and the forensic sciences. Not one word of this book is padded. All solid info -- a fascinating read!!	2001-08-31

Well, let's get it out immediately. I have a &quot;conflict of interest.&quot; I work with dummies. No, I don't work for (fill in your least favorite company, department or government agency or entity here). DRUM ROLL PUH-LEASE! I am a fulltime professional ventriloquist and I did my own little modest how-to-do-ventriloquism book, but it was privately printed etc. and isn't even in print anymore. ASIDE FROM THAT: This has to be one of the BEST ventriloquism books ever written. Period. When I first started out I read a ton of books on ventriloquism and except for the superb top-of-the-line Maher Studios how-to-do-ventriloquism correspondence course (which is in a class by itself), this was the one that is responsible (or to blame) for me running around with a bunch of dummies (insert another side put-down HERE). WHY? Most books on ventriloquism make one of several huge mistakes. They treat the subject as if it is The Most Mysterious Subject On The Face of the Earth (it isn't and it really is not that difficult). Or they are boring due to the author's extremely favorable impression of himself/herself/itself, which seemingly permeates every page. Or they are &quot;cutesy&quot; with all kinds of little jokes and comments thrown in that might spark a giggle but seem to pad the book and distract from the content. Schindler's book avoids all of these mistakes. It is crammed with content on how to do ventriloquism, blessed with wonderful historic photos, peppered with some good beginners' jokes and good practice routines, and it has a nice, solid explanation of how to &quot;throw your voice&quot; (i.e. you really don't).<br />I gave my original copy away to an interested kid, then bought another copy later. There ARE some other good books on the subject but I've always felt this was, overall, the most solid, entertaining and serious in my collection. A class act from start to finish.	2001-08-31

As sad as it makes me to say it, I can't agree that this book is good for anyone who is JUST starting to learn about Zen. Call me an ignorant illiterate (I will admit that!) but I read lots of books on various religions and here is how I would rate this book. IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING ALREADY ABOU ZEN OR ARE WELL INTO IT: Four and a half to five stars. Lots of great excerpts from various authors, many of them Westerners. They're diverse in content and vary in length. So it's a great for collection anyone who already has some knowledge of Zen. IF YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ZEN: You'll have to skip a lot of the sections as you start reading them, and not because that is the subject's inherent nature. Someone who picked up this book to learn about Zen would definitely have to go and buy a few more books to figure out the meaning of a lot of the sections. BOTTOM LINE: If there had been a bit more explanation about each section before the excerpts this book would be the &quot;essential&quot; Zen. But anyone just learning will have to get other books first to truly grasp the essentials in this book.	2001-08-31

As a child I watched his show. I still remember watching the last television appearance of my hero Lou Costello, doing a solo comedy bit, his famous Army march routine, right after he split with Bud Abbott. I loved Steve Allen's syndicated show in the 60s. And about 10 years ago, I wrote him a letter telling him how much I loved his shows and his book More Funny People which contains marvelous profiles of comedians. I asked him where I could get the first edition, Funny People. About two weeks later I was shocked to open the door to find a UPS deliverman standing there with a BIG box of various autographed Steve Allen books. He had sent them to me FOR FREE -- to me, a journalist and a nobody. Today I am a fulltime ventriloquist -- a professional nobody. And I am amazed by his generosity. So rating this book three stars, especially so soon after his untimely death, is extremely sad for me. I feel like a traitor. But I have to be honest: this book is a HUGE disappointment. From the cover it looks as if he had seen Milton Berle's Private Joke File and decided to quickly put out his own. But unlike Uncle Miltie's thick two volumes of hilarious jokes, you don't sense that these were Steve Allen's best jokes or best collection of humorous material from his actual files. Berle seemed to offer readers the best that he had -- insults, puns, long jokes, roast lines, you name it. It was as if Berle was trying to pass on a legacy. Quite a few of Steve Allen's jokes are puns and other kinds of plays on words. Some are extremely old jokes found in kids joke books. Some are jokes that he apparently did use but are so incredibly dated you wonder if he even had an editor on this project. I always circle joke books and I honestly circled few here; there are SOME gems -- but if the book didn't have the name &quot;Steve Allen&quot; on it, the joke portions would not compare favorably to many other joke books. This book's best part is at the very end: his collection of speeches, monologues and essays. Some are too punny (he truly seems to have been heavily influenced by Groucho Marx and Groucho's plays on words)but some will indeed make you laugh out loud. The contrast between these sections and the supposedly private joke file is huge -- and the boring, done-to-death and dated stuff is not outweighed by the occasional hilarity. In all, Steve Allen's Private Joke File's content does not live up to the brand name. I almost gave this four stars in deference to a comic great. But I had to be honest: if his name was not on it, this would qualify as a VERY weak joke book.n of speeches, monologues and essays.

Definitely don't buy this if you're looking for lots of info or an extensive essay on the &quot;beat&quot; generation, etc. The awesome Alan Watts does deal with that topic, but almost in passing. He's goes into more detail explaining Zen and Hindu ideas with a huge helping of humor. Some ideas will stay with you. His emphasis on the key concepts of living the moment and a job as an avocation (not just to spend x number of hours making money but to do for the JOY of it)forever will be imprinted in your mind, as well as various clever examples he sites. Especially memorable is his explanation of how we Americans often live too much in the past and future and don't appreciate the present. He likened it to a coin: one side is the future, the other the past -- but the REAL stuff is the metal in between (the present). A small book with lots of big ideas that are cleverly presented.	2001-08-30

Veteran Wisconsin politician Carol Roessler collected some of the dumbest, most stupid quotes from politicians -- in other words, typical things politicians say every day -- and put them in a small but potent volume. There's a section on Clinton Speak, George Bush Sr., dumb Kennedy quotes and lots of anonymous ones. She is even gutsy enough to quote herself (&quot;I caught that out of the corner of my ear..&quot;). I'm a former journalist who is now a fulltime ventriloquist, and I can tell you that in nearly 20 years freelancing oversea in Asia and Europe and working as a reporter on American newspapers I covered politicians and got a LOT lot of experience dealing with dummies. This small-sized book's quotes are short, one to a page, but it's the kind of book you'll read, want to read again, and will pick it up so often it'll wear out. I've read mine often the pages are coming out -- and it is not because of shoddy production. My only reservation is: you can watch unedited Congressional press briefings, political debates, and presidential press conferences and experience similar dumb quotes &quot;live&quot; for FREE. But this lets you savor the pompous stupidity on your own terms, without setting a VCR or having a radio talk show host add his/her/its own dumbness on top of a stupid quote. NO JOKE: I roared out loud when I read it, read it until it fell apart -- and give Roessler a LOT of credit for her talent in selecting idiotic quotes and her ability to include herself. The edition I own was published in 1999 and with a new White House administration and new Congressioinal Democratic/Republican and Independent politicos she could easily expand her edition...to maybe several volumes....	2001-08-30

Uncle Miltie does it again! This is a fine companion to his first big, fat hilarious volume. The good news is that the topics are not all the same as in the first volume (you do need both to have a complete collection) but the big laughs are as big as ever. You truly get a sense when you read Berle's jokes from this and his first book that he wanted to include some of his best and favorite stuff and get it out there to the public (and maybe other comedians, as a kind of legacy). I only wish I had the $ to buy his file's CD-rom version but until I do this and the first book are on my office reference shelf for use when I need a laugh, when I want to appear brilliant when visiting friends, or to plug a gap in a routine that I'm writing or a special show that I'm doing (I'm a fulltime ventriloquist). You can see how many of his jokes were \\"switched\\" from others over the years and that is a common practice. You can take a joke on X subject and reword it and customize it for a specific person or group. The main thing is: Berle didn't issue a thick, joke-filled book containing filler. Every joke, every page MATTERS. He gifted to all who pay the price some of his funniest stuff: one-liners, longer jokes, insults, riddles. Super high quality --and worth a LOT more than the book's price.	2001-08-29

Books about the show Seinfeld and Jerry Seinfeld have become something of a major industry in the United States since the show leap-frogged from it's cult status into a bigtime ratings hit. A lot of these books recounted episodes, offered bios of the actors and had lots of information about Seinfeld's private life. What was MISSING? A book that had a lot of this information but also put it into a comedic context -- into the context of who Jerry Seinfeld was, who he is and how and why his series had such innovative humor...humor that would define a generation. This book truly explains it. It's clear that Seinfeld and his collaborator Larry David had a concept for the anti-sitcom sitcom. They were willing for it never to be aired, rather than compromise on it. They did add cast members if the network wanted...but there was no &quot;hugging&quot; and topics were unusual and even the comic payoffs were different than on other shows. They weren't trying to be cutting edge, they were trying to execute their creative idea with integrity. They truly didn't compromise and that's why the series remains so unusual and consistently funny to this day. Stylistically, this is a good sized book but a very quick read due to the easy writing style. Quotes are used very skillully throughout. Of all the books I've read on Jerry Seinfeld and the show, this is the best...because it explains why this show is among television comedy's best.	2001-08-29

This has to be the most impressive joke book ever asssembled. I've seen others that have lots of very funny stuff. Others that are better organized. And others that better reflect a comedian or editor's particular humor page per page. This one is truly a joke file. It's a big, thick, fat book with highly readable type -- and jokes that &quot;rock.&quot; These jokes range from old-style vaudeville, burlesque jokes to jokes more &quot;modern,&quot; from puns to insults, to long anecdotes. I'm an entertainer and when I do a show and am looking for a joke I look to this; sometimes I use one of them to fill a gap but often it gives me an idea upon which I can expand. If you like to laugh or need laughs for your speaking programs, shows, etc. you MUST have this on your library shelf. I often enter jokes that I like in my database but there are just so many I have cirlced here that I love that I go to the original. Also, it is big and fat and hilarious but the subjects may not include every single subject you want. Some other &quot;big&quot; joke books have more subjects, but this covers most of the basics and the selection is so wonderful that it's worth it. Actually, if you get this you should have the second volume he did, too -- which I also have and enjoy. Joke per joke I think this is the best, most diverse joke book ever published. Well worth the price in the enjoyment you'll get and the laughs you'll generate!	2001-08-29

I have to admit I was highly skeptical when I bought this book. I buy lots of joke books (I'm an entertainer) and a lot of times if I circle the jokes I liked I find I circled one of two. NOT IN THIS ONE! This is truly a &quot;little giant encyclopedia&quot;: small but quite THICK. These aren't jokes jokes that go on forever but short, punchy one-liners. And although this book DOES have some from famous current and legendary comedy mavens, it has a LOT of original stuff. Gene Perret (Bob Hope's former writer who has a lot of GREAT books he has penned himself) compiled and wrote this with Terry Marin -- and all I can say is that a &quot;jaded&quot; entertainer like me read this and laughed out loud. You can use these one-liners in your conversations with friends (remember that many of the BEST ad libs you see on tv are rehearsed!), for a speech, toast, roast etc. There are new ones such as: &quot;I told my doctor I couldn't lift my hands above my head. He told me to stay away from muggers,&quot; and &quot;He wore a toupee that made him look 10 years sillier.&quot; And there are ones from comedy pros: &quot;She's so fat she's got more chins than the Chinese phone directory.&quot; (Joan Rivers) and &quot;He's so old his blood type is discontinued.&quot; (Bill Dana)Jokes are divided into categories and there's a nice index so you can look up what you want when you need it.

What can I say about this book except that it is so good, such a pleasure that I am re-reading this for the THIRD TIME? I love anthologies, but oftentimes anthologies has stories that go on for too long (padded by sometimes self-indulgent and self-impressed writers) or stories that are simply weak. This anthology avoids those traps -- mainly because the 365 stories are incredibly short, punchy and memorable. It's set up so you read a story or two a day but I could not put this BIG, THICK paperback down. I carried it with me and read it in between shows (I'm an entertainer). I read it on the airplane. And I wound up finishing it up late at night -- yes, it's the cliched \\"book-you-can't-put-down.\\" Most of these incredibly effective, tightly written pieces don't last more than a page or two. But you think about them. And when you've completed this book, you're sad because it's over. Of course, I found a solution to that: I re-read it periodically. I sometimes sell some books that I love on ... or trade them in used bookstores. I'll never sell this one. It's going to be re-read many times.	2001-08-26

As an entertainer who writes, reads, and uses a LOT of humor (not stolen...occasionally \\"switched\\"!) I LOVE joke books. But a lot of the ones on the market become old very fast. NOT THIS BOOK! The Mammoth Book of Humor has it all. There's a lot of old stuff, hilarious stuff, some corny stuff and some stuff that has apparently been lifted from internet joke lists. Its very well organized and indexed so if you're looking for something specific it is exceedingly easy to find it. And if you're like me and deface your joke books -- I circle the ones I like and tell friends, etc. -- you're going to find that a LOT of these jokes in a row will be circled. You'll find everything from puns, to putdowns, to politically incorrect jokes. And YES: if you are someone who believes it is a heinous crime to tell a joke poking fun at a given group, you probably won't like it. This contains ALL kinds of jokes including a section on politically incorrect jokes. And in that section EVERYONE is blasted. In my own case, I love to poke fun at myself (short jokes), my \\"group\\" etc so perhaps I am a bit insensitive. If you like to LAUGH and want to have a well-organized treasure chest of jokes, epigrams, riddles, etc that will get BIG LAUGHS you MUST have this book in your collection. This is one of those joke books that I read, circle, then go back and read the ones I liked again. With a lot of joke books I only have a few jokes circled. This one has circles all over the book. It even has more than its HUGE collection of well-organized jokes: there are hilarious bumper sticker slogans, misprints, a comic dictionary, epitaths, humorous quotes, quotes from kids. Limericks. If you like jokes, you'll want it. If you're a professional speaker or comedian, you'll NEED it. I'll do a show tomorrow for a guy who loves singing. I'm going to look through the singing jokes and adapt a few.

When people look at someone who is successful (even if the definition of &quot;success&quot; varies from person to person) they usually have a tendency to think that someone went from point A to Point B with nothing in between. It's the old story of the &quot;overnight success&quot; that may have taken someone a lifetime or may have been achieved with great heartache, pain, and stress. One way of being inspired is to read biographies constantly. I'm an entertainer (ventriloquist, believe it or not) and I love reading show biz biographies. And I've found that when I read them there is a LOT of drama that took place between Point A (starting out) and Point B (succeeding). In The Road to Success Is Paved with Failure Joey Green has boiled down these life stories into a small book that completes its mission so thoroughly you will not only want to read, keep and refer to this book again and again -- but you'll want to gift this book to some loved ones. The concept is simple enough: each page, in large type, refers to a less-than-successful, unflattering or downright failure item involving a now famous successful person. At the bottom of the page, in smaller type, he tells you who this person is and why they are now famous for succeeding. This is &quot;no frills&quot; inspiration. And it works. Here's one example: (Big type) &quot;Barbara Walters was told in 1957 by Don Hewitt, who became executive producer of 60 minutes, to &quot;stay out of television.&quot;&quot; Bottom of page (small type): &quot;Barbara Walters became a host on the television talk show Today, an anchorwoman on The ABC Evening News, and a host of 20/20. She has won six Emmy Awards for her work on television and was elected in 1990 to the Television Hall of Fame.&quot; There are many others. But this is the kind of book that you can quickly re-read, or just grab a few pages and read if you're feeling &quot;down&quot; or discouraged. It gives you the mental vitamins to resist the naysayers and ignore discouragement and focus on the possibilities. Great concept. Great execution. Great biographical examples.

It's in the &quot;natural (RIGHT!) flavoring&quot;. Eric Schlosser's Fast Food National is a zippy, fun, fact-filled and enormously sombering read. The recent events surrounding Hindus protesting the beef flavoring put on McDonald's fries make me think perhaps this book's amazing revelations had something to do about it. Firstly, I LOVE fast food. I make no bones about it. As an entertainer who travels a lot I often am pressed for time and have no problem with a hamburger, fries, etc. And, yes, I have known SOMETHING about how the animals were slaughtered -- but the graphic, haunting descriptions in Fast Food Nation have made me think a lot more about it and, to be honest, sometimes seek a different thing to eat (pasta is &quot;slaughtered&quot; more humanely!). This book covers the entire panorama of the fast food/corporate take over of the United States, which has been in turn spread by these companies -- with their family-friendly imagery -- to the corners of the earth: the creation of fast-food restaurant visits as a family &quot;event,&quot; the uniformity in food products and lack of room for innovation or deviation; the use of &quot;natural flavors&quot; on meats and potatoes (lab-created chemicals, actually -- sprayed on). And there's more: the dangers in the meat used, the revolting process by which animals are slaughtered and the way in which this opens up areas where meat can be contaminated, the role of fast food in broadening more than the horizons of the world's citizens (i.e. getting them FAT), it's role in widening the gap between rich and poor (almost as fast as it is widening people's waist-lines), fast-food's role in real estate, impact on farming, and food design. But, above all, what in the end haunted me in this compelling &quot;I-can't-put-it-down&quot; (maybe because flab from eating all those fries) book is: the inspiring dream and success of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc, the blatant appeal to rope in kids to bring families to fast-food restaurants, the sickening description of the slaughter of the animals -- and those chemicals sprayed on the food to give them a certain taste.

He followed his dreams, even though many tried to discourage him, told him his ideas would never work and he stuck with his dreams... even resolutely going through a bankruptcy.  The Quotable Walt Disney is just that: quotes. But if you're interested in what made the man who founded an empire (with a little help from a mouse he saw one day) tick...then you need to buy, read and even underline this book. True, these ARE quotes. And, true, as a former journalist (who is now a ventriloquist) I recognize a lot of &quot;statements&quot; in there -- pro forma quotes given to journalists, self-serving statements, etc. But there are also tons of gems. There are inspring quotes you can go back to and read again and again. I'm going to read it again and mark the ones I want to go back to, and paperclip them. Some entail the importance of determination; others such qualities as open-mindedness, the importance of surrounding yourself with capable colleagues, the wonder of finding inspiration for creativity in the least likely places. Yes, this IS a book of quotes. A small book. But it'll save you LOTS of time if you &quot;listen&quot; to Walt in this compact book, rather than having to read the many (and sometimes bad) biographies about him. And amid the formal statements given in countless interviews you'll find true gems. Like any gem, you can look a jewel of quote in wonder again and again. If you apply these gems in your life, it will be worth far more than the price of this quote-filled book.	2001-08-24
