This book is devoid of professional boasting, score settling, or gossip about unnamed stars.  Wilder is more reflective and straightforward.  His views of fellow actors are honest but never mean.  He shows how serendipity plays a major part in an actor's career.  He relates how he came to be married for the wrong reasons, and how he later learned to love. He is honest about his experiences with love and sex, his early ineptitude, his growing abilities to commit to and support a partner, his love of his stepdaughter and bewilderment as their relationship founders.   <br /> <br />These honest memoirs seem to offend some other reviewers, but I am impressed with his ability to look back at his younger self with acceptance.  He discusses Gilda Radner with love, while acknowleding the difficulty of living with her neurotic temperament.  Wilder spends more time covering Gilda Radner's illness than his own very serious cancer. <br /> <br />I've liked Wilder since his breakout in The Producers, and admire his comic abilities and manic zaniness.  But this book shows a serious artist, a mature and grounded man, who has written thoughtful reflections with more honesty than most of us could manage.	2005-03-25

But after she marries and moves to Ireland, the book starts to drag.  The characters she meets there are never fully fleshed out, so their eccentricities seem incomprehensible. <br />I skimmed the second half. <br />I recommend The Dower House, also by Annabel David Goff, instead of this book.	2005-03-01

The author claims it was Hillary's idea to trash the White House offices as the Clinton administration left and the Bush's moved in, including the famous &quot;removal of the letter 'w'&quot; from the computer keyboards.  The problem with this tale is a GAO investigation found it wasn't true, just another right wing attempt to tarnish the Clintons.<BR>There is certainly plenty to say about Bill and Hillary, but I'd rather read something  factual rather than rummage through a National Enquirer style trash dump.  Hillary haters will love it though.	2004-07-09

It was a funny spoof of office life, (particularly in a big corporation). The plot centers on a lawsuit charging sexual harrassment in the office.  This allows a thoughtful look at how ordinary office interactions, the ones that allow us all to express a bit of personality, a little humanity, even within the confines of the corporate mold, may be twisted and misinterpreted to seem unfair and oppressive. <BR>The narrator is a sketch, a very funny \\"unreliable narrator\\" who tells us all we need to know without always realizing it.  It is rare to find a book that captures the corporate ethos the way this one does -- the camaraderie, the understanding of rank, latitude in behavior depending on position, the helplessness of the senior managers without their support staff, the addiction to expense account living.  <BR>The ending is bittersweet, the only ending possible.  Don't miss this book!	2003-12-04

The book has beautiful photos of creative but simple kitchen creations for kids.  Some don't even require cooking, just assembling.<br />The 50's style has a nice retro appeal for adults, but for my kids the fun is in the simple recipes.

Hepburn was so sure of herself and opinionated, so enthusiastic and competent, and these qualities come out in his stories.   He ate dinner with her, stayed at her homes in New York and Connecticut (where she always helped him turn down the bed!), visited relatives and, as she became more frail with age, assisted her through her last movie appearance.<BR>Her love for Spencer Tracy is bedrock in her life, not dwelled upon, merely included as part of her story.  Her respect for her other suitors, and her admission of her own selfishness with some of them, are candid and refreshing.<BR>Berg kept up with her until the end, and Hepburn's death after a physical decline, was dignified and brought me to tears.  This book was a total pleasure.	2003-08-26

He criticizes all of the (usually) men in charge, and spares no one out of political correctness.  He is interested in results, not what party or group our political and corporate leaders are attached to.  This is a refreshing change from most commentators, who only go after the \\"other side\\", refusing to honestly assess their own.  Mr. Moore has marshalled the facts, and gives phone numbers and addresses to contact now that he has stirred you to action.  He is funny too, which is also a refreshing change from the humorless media names!<br />It is a shame that while there are many famous right wing media opinion-makers, Michael Moore is the only one who fills this role for the equal oppotunity center and the left.  He acknowledged this week in an interview (quoted in the January 1 New York Times) that he is \\"tired of picking up the slack for, well, everyone. 'I think it's an embarrassment that it's somebody in a ball cap with no college education that's going in to ask these questions,'he said. 'It's disgraceful. I can't stand to look at myself on the screen cause I look at that and I think, `Boy if that shows there's anything wrong with the American media, it's that the job is left up to this guy.' ...I'm just waiting for the media to start doing their job so I can go back home and watch more sports.

Here is a book that captures with humor the countervailing forces that pull mothers today apart -- to keep their hard won career and continue to accomplish professional goals and earn money, and to be a good mother to their children.  But as this book so deftly shows, society cuts mothers no slack, work expects slavish obedience, and there aren't enough hours to do it all.  The compromises required leave us guilty and sad.  <BR>Kate Reddy has the added disadvantage of being English, and working in the London's financial center, a place that is years behind the U.S. in maternity policy and sexual harassment law and even more riddled with sexist, boorish men than our own Wall Street.  (Believe it or not!  From my experience she does not exaggerate.)  Kate works hard, travels incessantly, misses her children, loses touch with her hapless but kind husband, not to mention her friends, and observes her own frantic life with a wry wit.  Her observations on the primary role women play in the home, even when they are the chief breadwinner outside, are on the money.  Men who leave work early to attend their daughter's class play are showing a wonderful fatherly interest.  But if a mother does the same she is shirking and overburdened with her home life.<BR>But Kate is always sympathetic -- all mothers will understand when she gets exasperated with her husband when he refuses stock the house with paper towels as requested because he can't bring himself to ask for the brand: Kitten Soft.  Or when she reflects with regret on how she left her first child to return to work too soon, before she and the baby had a chance to settle in together.  Or when she gets upset with herself because when she tries to cook she is a stranger in her own kitchen, and when asked her daughter's eating preferences, finds she doesn't know.  No successful working father would have to deal with these issues or the guilt and regret they cause.  Kate's love for her children is palpable, which is what makesthe book work.  <BR>Read this book, whether you work or not.  You'll find things you'd been thinking reflected here, but in a funny and entertaining style.	2002-11-08

She doesn't complain, but she articulates the strangeness of the experience and brought back vivid memories for me.  Learning to nurse is a challenge -- it only LOOKS natural!  Like her I had a colicy baby, which everyone treats as if it is a benign condition while you as the mother are faced with a fiercely inconsolable child.  She describes the oddness of arriving home from the hospital with the baby, a new person totally dependent on you, and looking around at your home that encompasses your former life, the life that is gone forever.  And the common feeling pre-baby, that life will continue as it is and the baby will fit in, is shown as it changes, as Rachel can't leave her child for an evening out without calling so often that she is finally forced to return home to her screaming child.<BR>When a mother says, &quot;Why doesn't anyone tell you what it's really like?&quot; she should be given this book.	2002-07-05

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Great Ideas for Easy Parties	I am a convert to Ina Garten's belief that parties should be fun for all, even the hostess!  She tells how you can arrange as much as possible in advance so you can enjoy your guests and provide a relaxed atmosphere.  She admits to having made the same mistakes we all have, such as producing individual omelets for 20 breakfast guests and never getting out of the kitchen!  <br />The recipes are great, and are grouped together for different types of parties: lunch in the garden, pizza party, Sunday breakfast.  Most recipes are simple and well tested, thanks to her successful store.  So I was bewildered to find that the filet of beef recipe calls for a VERY expensive cut of meat to be spread with butter and then cooked at 500 degrees!  Smoke started billowing from my oven (I had to carry the meat outside!) and I had to refer to another cookbook to adjust the temperature and time.  But I loved the Sour Cream Coffee Cake, Hummus, Asparagus and Snap Peas, and Orzo with Roasted Vegetables.  <br />I will be using the cookbook often, both for recipes and for approach.	2002-05-04

Beware of Dr. Sears and his many strong opinions!  He will make you doubt yourself if you have any other inclination.  His \\"Attachment Parenting\\" steps may suit you and that's great.  But when they don't (such as when the Family Bed didn't work for us) he will tell you to question your motives.  Although he claims that co-sleeping is the norm in most of the world, it seems that the Family Bed is actually quite rare.  It is sleeping in the same ROOM that is common.  Of course those same people frequently live in one room also.<BR>As the reviews here show, this book has a cult of avid believers, people who claim their child is wonderful and credit Dr. Sears.  But many people in my parents generation, none of them attachment parented, grew up happy and healthy and secure, not because the parental world revolved around them, but in a busy family where they were NOT the center of attention.  Why are those of us who follow that model at fault?  This book does seems to hit the right note with our times.  I wonder what people will think when they read it fifty years from now?  It will be a timepiece, a relic of our age, adamantly spouting a philosophy that will surely change, and we will be laughing at Dr. Sears for his humorless insistence that he is right, all others wrong.	2002-04-01

I am the mother of two children who were both breastfed (the second only weaned this year), and this book was my resource.  Don't let any of those soft focus ads fool you into thinking breast feeding is natural and easy: getting started is a challenge!  If you make it through the first week you are well on your way, and after the second week the hard part is over -- why not keep going for your child's health?  The strange things you notice (lumps in my breast, white \\"fluff\\" on my nipple, etc.) are explained and remedies offered.<BR>This book was my support when I started and beyond.  It was recommended by a maternity ward nurse, and I used it whenever I had a question.  My first several days were painful, but the book was reassuring.  I'm so glad I persevered.  The nursing experience is a godsend when you need to soothe your child; there is nothing that will calm them like you can by nursing them.  And as experts will admit, we STILL don't know all the components in breast milk, and can only put the ones we know about (and can produce) in formula.  Use this book and get over the hurdle of getting started and you'll be starting your baby off right and giving yourself a sweet bonding experience.	2002-04-01

However, for a book focused on entertaining, one that suggests preparing as much as possible in advance, there are no specific directions on when to stop preparing, when to add finishing touches and reheat.  (It took a LONG time for the refrigerated Parmesan Smashed Potatoes to get hot -- the whole dinner was delayed.)  I am not a pro, and I need the advice.  Books like Lora Brody's Entertaining Survival Guide are more useful, in giving advice on doubling the recipe, freezing, etc.  This is an irritating oversight in such a beautiful book.

Nowhere does he deal with the attendant problems of the family bed.  Once my child grew used to  my physical presence to fall asleep she was unable to fall asleep without  me!  This has gone on for years, while my friends who sleep separately from  their children are all able to put their child to sleep with a happy 15 to  30 minute nightly routine of stories and songs.  I also spend 15 minutes on  stories, but then the hard part begins.  As I wait for my daughter to fall  asleep (sometimes a one hour wait) I fall asleep myself!

Although on medical matters this book seems perfectly valid, I think Dr. Sears should stop pretending that Attachment Parenting is so great.  That is only his opinion and not a medical one at that.  I took his advice to  try Co-Sleeping,also known as the Family Bed.  What a mistake!  It should  be called &quot;Lying Down with your Child Until He Falls Asleep&quot;  because that is what this practice turns into!  My son used to sleep alone,  but now that he's had all this co-sleeping he requires my physical presence  to fall asleep, which sometimes takes an hour.  When he awakes he needs me  with him to fall asleep again.  This means every nap and every night!   I  don't have household help like the eminent author and don't have time to  spend half my day in bed trying to help my child sleep.  This problem has  happened to other parents I know who practice the Family Bed.  Why doesn't  Dr. Sears even mention this problem or how to deal with it?  I won't follow  his advice on this matter again.  My future children will learn to sleep on  their own unless Dr. Sears wants to pay for my housekeeper.	1999-12-04
