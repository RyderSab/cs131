Immediately thereafter, in a freak accident, his finger is severed, but reattached (sort of).  Then the fun starts.<br />&quot;The Lecturer's Assistant&quot; is a great read.  It's got humor and great pace.  Many readers (especially white males, I suspect) will empathize (at least initially) with Nelson's plight.  On the other hand, most of the characters in the novel are overblown caricatures (although this certainly adds to the humor), and the plot does spin out of control in the latter parts of the novel (borrowing a phrase from previous reviewer Steven Poris).  <br />The novel would have been more effective had the author restrained himself to one (or maybe two) preposterous plot twists  (e.g., were the sprites at the end, entertaining as they were, really necessary? (velcro?? what??)).  Nevertheless, this is a fine novel which I found very entertaining (and ripped through quite quickly) -- I've already recommended it to others.	2001-04-14

I found the description of aristocratic competition in provision of public works and entertainments to be most interesting, and useful in understanding the political process of the period.<br />As some other reviewers have noted, general familiarity of 1st century BCE Roman history would be helpful to readers.  I'd add that more maps would improve the presentation.	2001-04-08

But, now, I have to think hard to remember it.  As I think about it, details come back, and I smile remembering (what's a &quot;drowner?&quot;, the idea of the aquaduct, that French guy!).  A great book imprints itself, so one recalls it without effort, and this book isn't there.  But it's a fine novel nonetheless, certainly much better than most of the bestselling tripe available -- it's just not quite as good as I'd hoped it would be.<br />&quot;The Drowner&quot; appears to be unavailable to the US audience today, and that's a shame.  It's probably not worth a whole lot of effort to track down; but, if you run across a copy, it's worth picking up.  Then, tell me I'm wrong.	2001-04-08

Those who believe that the Bible is the the literal Word of God will reject the very idea of the book outright -- in that case, who cares who may have written the Bible, or the social conditions that may have influenced the writing?<br />Others will find this very interesting.  Extensive familiarity with the Bible is probably required to get the most out of Fox's work.  Those readers who, like me, have a general familiarity but haven't committed the entire work to memory, probably should have a Bible at hand for reference.	2001-04-08

The author comes off as a very sympathetic character, and, when I closed the book,  I was sorry that Joyce had not continued the story for a few more years.<br />I was struck by how much the intellectual world has changed in the last half-century:  In 1950, the cultural avante-garde could be found (almost by definition) only around some Ivy League schools (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, etc.), a couple of midwestern schools, and, I guess, Stanford &amp; Berkeley.  Today, &quot;place&quot; is not nearly so important.<br />This is a very nice book.  If you've gone to the trouble of getting to this page, you ought to take the next step and read the book; you won't be disapppointed (although you may continue to wonder just why the beatniks faded away in the early 60s).	2001-01-16

For golfers, this is a can't miss collection.<br />That being said, &quot;Heart of a Goof&quot; doesn't rate 5 stars.  They are not quite on the level of Wodehouse's &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; stories.  Furthermore, I found the story's structures annoying after a while:  In each story, a younger club member starts a casual conversation with the &quot;Oldest Member,&quot; then fails to escape in time to avoid the old guy's narration of the story.  This was a clever construction in story #1, getting old by story #5, and downright annoying by story #9.<br />It's clear that Wodehouse loved golf.  But his game differs in some particulars from that which we play today.  For example, his talk of &quot;match play&quot; vs. &quot;medal play&quot; might be unintelligible to some golf novices today, and a mention of a casual two-to-three hour 18-hole round will stupefy the modern player accustomed to trudging six hours on a weekend behind a foursome of cart-riders.  [Irrelevant aside:  I really miss the old names for clubs.  Really, would you prefer to swing a 4-iron rather than a &quot;mashie,&quot; or a &quot;niblick,&quot; or, better yet, a &quot;mashie-niblick&quot;?]<br />But Wodehouse has it right (from the Preface): &quot;When you turn in a medal score of a hundred and eight on two successive days, you get to know something about life.&quot;  True.	2001-01-16

In the 3rd installment of the Flashman novels, Harry Flashman (rogue, dandy, coward) takes on the mid-19th century trans-Atlantic (and within-America) slave trade from pretty much every angle.  Although I thought it was not among the best of the Flashman books, it's great entertainment, and provides a great &quot;feel&quot; for the period.  Who other than Harry Flashman could, in the space of a few months, inadvertantly find himself chatting with a young Disraeli, then a young Lincoln?  And then (who knew??) provide inspiration for &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot;?  And meanwhile be a slave buyer, slave stealer, slave emancipator, slave protector and, well, slave, while still being the irrepressible Flashy (oh, yeah, not for kids or for the easily offended).  A fine book -- lots of fun.	2000-11-25
US	52473406	R1Q5OJI0M55AHZ	0399145761	539869630	What if...?	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Uneven	I started reading this book with great expectations of an intellectual  stroll through history.  On the whole, the essays contained in this book  were disappointing, although (as one should expect) there is an uneven  quality of entries.<br />First off, the reader should be aware that the book  does not, in general, provide &quot;alternative history;&quot; instead, it  is a compilation of important moments in world history (with weight on US  history).  Perhaps it should have been called (as is another, regrettably  unread, book on my shelf) &quot;Turning Points in World History.&quot;    Some of the essays are excellent - inspired and thought-provoking (e.g.,  the first essay by W McNeill on ancient Jerusalem).  Others are silly - the  first such, by Lapham on Teutoburg, induced me to do a web search to  discover his credentials (he hadn't appeared to have given it much  thought).  Some were infuriating (why did I waste my time?): for example,  McPherson's essay on the &quot;Lost Orders&quot; in the Antietam campaign  (OK, here comes the rant).  Sure, this was a random, low-probability event  that had a major effect on the war, and could easily had turned out  otherwise.  But McPherson (a highly regarded historian) goes on to  speculate that, absent the discovery of the orders, the 1862 campaign would  have been similar to the 1863 MD-PA campaign, with the Confederates moving  north as far as Harrisburg and the Susquehanna, then concentrating (from  the north and west) at Gettysburg; while the Union army, shielding  Washington, moved up from the southeast (OK...).  But then he supposes that  the armies somehow switch positions, with the Union army attacking the  Confederates from the north and west at Gettysburg!?!<br />Well, I know it's  just for fun, but I'd like to see the authors put a little bit more into  it.  As it is, I can recommend this book for its entertainment value, and  occasional nice essay.  But, most of the time, you could probably do better  yourself.	2000-09-03

The narration is in English (although Jean was French), but is in  a strangely archaic voice (although readable by us).  It's as if the 13th  century French were translated to 20th century English, but with 13th  century speaking tempo.  I'm not sure how well it works - it takes some  getting used to, but I ended up enjoying it.<br />Not being an expert on the  subject, I can't vouch for the historical accuracy of the novel (it is,  after all, a novel) - I recall one mainstream reviewer taking Connell to  task for reporting that the streets of Jerusalem were ankle-deep in blood -  how could that be, given the number of inhabitants and the slope of the  streets?  (Who cares?  He gets the point across).<br />What Connell attempts  (successfully, I think) is to introduce the reader to the mindset of a  reasonable 13th-century European nobleman, through his speech.  Two  examples: (1) A nobleman approaches an enemy tent, for purposes of parley,  &quot;entirely alone&quot; - we soon see that the nobleman has many  retainers (including translators) with him, but they don't count as  &quot;persons.&quot; (2) when Moslems die in battle, they are cast  screaming to hell (or something similar); Christians in similar straights  ascend to eternal bliss.<br />This book is slow going, and not for everyone.   But, I think it succeeds.  Maps would have been nice.	2000-09-03

The book is  structured around a single game in June 1982, with a description of the  game and asides on players and events.  Each chapter covers one inning,  although the events of the inning may occupy only a few lines in each  chapter.<br />By now (2000), most of the players and events are ancient  history.

Although not as quickly paced as Bobrick's earlier works on  Russia, &quot;Angel&quot; is well-written and quite enjoyable.  I was  particularly impressed by the effort to provide background and context for  the events of 1775-1783:  the first 20% of the book gives information on  life in the colonies and the evolving (i.e., deteriorating) relationship  between Britain and the future US.  The first shots at Lexington green  don't appear in the book until page 117 (of 495).<br />All the characters and  events one would expect are here.  I have two quibbles with the  presentation: (1) It would have been nice to see more discussion of why the  British gave up after Yorktown; and (2) (as with almost every book of this  type published today) More maps are needed!	2000-09-03

I'm sure you're not surprised to hear that this one  doesn't disappoint.<br />One hundred years from now, people will still be  reading Rumpole (even if Titmuss is unknown), just as we read Sherlock  Holmes today.  Why?  Because Rumpole is a great character -- like all great  characters of literature, he reminds us of ourself.  Sure, we're not all  lawyers, nor drink red wine to excess at the end of each day, nor enjoy  reading from the Oxford Book of English Verse, nor are we all married  (empty nest) and close to retirement.  But, we know all the people he works  with, and we are really Rumpole.  You know it.<br />My only regret reading  this book is that it may be the last we see of Rumpole.  I'd wish him a  happy retirement, but I don't know what he'd do outside of chambers.   Perhaps some pro bono work, with extended hours at Pommeroys.	2000-09-03
US	52473406	R3DBYIV1QUHZCM	0880296674	80950321	Hannibal	Books	3	35	37	N	N	Pretty Good	This is a standard biography of the Cartaginian military leader Hannibal, which is now (summer 2000)out of print, I believe.  The writing is fine, and the story line (if one can use that term for a non-fiction book) is  interesting:  despite an (apparently) unending series of tactical and  operational successes, Hannibal loses the war against Rome, due primarily  to strategic considerations outside of his control (i.e., Carthage should  never have taken on this war unless they had changed their approach  substantially).  There are lessons here for modern man (sometimes, despite  having the smartest generals, the best trained and most experienced troops,  cutting-edge military technology, the wealthiest society in the known world  supporting you, and pretty good luck (to boot), it's just not enough) --  well, I could go on here for a long time, but will refrain from doing  so.<br />Although perfectly enjoyable, the book suffers from 2 major  shortcomings; one unavoidable, but the second easily addressed,  but  evidently addressing it wasn't worth the time and effort of the author  and/or publisher:<br />1. The sources on Hannibal's life are Roman (only).   There simply are no other sources of information.  The author recognizes  this explicitly, and tries to balance the Roman accounts with &quot;common  sense&quot; interpretations and a modern understanding of the  situation.<br />2.  The absence of sufficient maps:  This is just inexcusable  (unfortunately, it is very common in modern books of this sort). Repeatedly  throughout the book, the author uses phrases such as &quot;Hannibal marched  to (this town), then to (that town), while the Romans marched to (someplace  else)&quot;.  These towns generally don't appear in modern atlases, and  there is no further description in the book (is it on the coast? in the  mountains? north? south&quot; east? west?).  Without any additional  guidance, this is simply useless information.  One is tempted to believe  that the author has read this information in source materials, but never  bothered to discover what it actually meant (could this be true? Nah).   It's more likely that the publisher was unwilling to spring for a couple of  pennies per book to provide the maps (or that the author couldn't be  bothered to spend the couple of weeks necessary to get them included).  In  any case, it's a shame, and detracts from an otherwise excellent book.	2000-07-29

Author Peter Gay has successfully avoided the  heavy-handedness present in some of his other works (e.g. in the  &quot;Bourgeois Experience&quot; series), and the result is a pleasant  stroll through the late 18th century.  Gay concentrates more on Mozart the  person rather than on Mozart's music, although the evolution of Mozart's  style is an important theme.<br />A quick, easy, enjoyable read.	2000-07-12

I feared that this would be yet another nonfiction book that starts out like gangbusters (California!  Gold! Sunken treasure!), then fades into 400 pages that should have been a magazine article.  I was mistaken -- this is  a terrific book that (amazingly) maintains the reader's interest all the  way through.<br />As I write this, there are &gt;120 reader reviews for this  book -- I assume that they are overwhelmingly positive (they should be,  anyhow), and there's little I can add to the previous effusive  commentaries.  I will add the following critical comments, which (in my  mind) forced a 4-star rather than a 5-star rating: (1) I found an excessive  level of hero-worship here.  Perhaps it was deserved, but I'd rather get  there by myself, rather than have it force-fed (&quot;he's a hero! &quot;).  (2) The really huge news in this book was the development of deep  underwater techniques and tools.  Yet, this is treated almost as an aside  (e.g., over the next 2 months, the underwater robot (which nobody had ever  built before due to technological deficiencies) was put together).  This,  it seems to me, was the big breakthrough, not guys poring over sonar  charts.  It would have been great to hear more about this story.<br />These  are minor issues.  It's a fine book.  Go ahead.<br />And read it now, before  they make a movie out of it.	2000-07-12

They didn't make a huge impression (unlike, e.g., Tolkein's Lord of the Rings), except  that I remember them as enjoyable.  Roth was then off my radar for almost  30 years.<br />At some point, I bought his &quot;trilogy &amp; epilogue&quot;  from a remainder table ($2.98, according to the sticker still affixed), and  eventually got to it.  Here's all you need to kmow about my recommendation:   halfway through this book, I was trolling through Amazon, trying to decide  which Roth book to pick up next.  Why I dropped him in 1970, I don't know  -- it must have been the ... oh, never mind.<br />I found &quot;Zuckerman  Unbound&quot; and &quot;The Anatomy Lesson&quot; to be the strongest of the  4 components (any can be read alone, but they're best read in sequence).  I  found &quot;Prague Orgy&quot; to be a little bizarre, and never saw how it  fit in.  I guess that's the only reason for the 4 rather than 5 stars.	2000-07-12

I've read several medical/historical essay collections (e.g., Karlen's excellent &quot;Napolean's Glands,&quot; Baden's (OK) &quot;Unnatural Death&quot;,  Sacks' entertaining books on cognitive disorders), and expected this book  to fall in that genre.  I ended up scanning through most of the second half  of the book -- I'd just run out of patience.  I just found it generally  uninteresting.<br />The initial essay is interesting, but it feels a little  creepy reading it (OK, he drank too much again, hung out with a prostitute,  and (again) contracted a venereal disease.  And, this time, the symptoms  were...).  Although, I must admit, the table documenting the 19 VD cases  over 31 years is mind-boggling.<br />Perhaps I should have paid more attention  to the subtitle: &quot;Medical analyses of literary men's  afflictions&quot;.  I've no training in medicine, so the results of the  &quot;analyses&quot; meant nothing to me.<br />Beside the terminal affliction  of dullness, I have the following complaints with this collection: (1) It  deals with uninteresting subjects: e.g., &quot;Swinburne's masochism&quot;  or &quot;Thomas Shadwell&quot; -- when did you last read Swinburne or  Shadwell? (2) It's dated:  Most of the essays were written within a few  years of 1970 - the essay on Keats and opium (1968) talks about the  &quot;current&quot; popularity of LSD and other psychodelic drugs.  OK,  with some effort I can relate to that, but ...<br />These pieces were written  30 years ago, and were probably considered daring at the time.  I recommend  you go elsewhere.	2000-07-12

This is not the best of the bunch (I found &quot;Flashman and the  Redskins&quot; and &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot; to be stronger), but  great fun, nonetheless (as well as hard to put down).  Difficult as it is  to believe, there appears to be a greater emphasis on &quot;rogering&quot;  here than in the other books.<br />If you've read (and enjoyed) other Flashman  books, then you know what to expect: go ahead and read this, you won't be  disappointed.  If you haven't read &quot;Flashman&quot; yet -- what are you  waiting for?  This is great fun, you won't be sorry.

The text is a transcript of the successful television series  (which I never saw):  I suspect that the book suffers (relative to the TV  series) due to the lack of music.  On a broad level, what the author's  survey of &quot;civilization&quot; is most lacking is any attempt at  explaining causation:  why was great art found first here (e.g., Italy),  then there (e.g., Netherlands and North Germany).  More attention to  economic (and military) matters would have made this a much stronger  history book.    As it is, it is an extremely enjoyable (great  illustrations!) and thought-provoking cultural history survey.  [I read the  folio Society 1999 hardcover edition.]	2000-06-21

It is a very enjoyable (and exhaustive) account of the most productive professional years (Bretton Woods aside) of one of the great figures of the  20th century.  Keynes was the son of Victorian intellectual academic  bougiousie; a star of the public school system; trained in mathematics and  economics (student of Marshall); student of philosophy, then a bureaucrat  in academia and government, becoming an expert in public finance as a  high-ranking Treasury official during WWI; a traveller in artistic circles  (later a benefactor),  part of the Bloomsbury group (intimate with Duncan  Grant, Virginia Woolf, etc. (to differing degrees, of course));  statistician/philosopher (his first major published work was &quot;A  Treatise on Probability&quot;); pamphleteer (&quot;Economic Consequences of  the Peace,&quot; etc.); publisher/editor for both the popular and academic  press; institutional investor; currency speculator; husband to a Russian  ballet dancer; and most influential economist of the 20th century.  Keynes  would not be possible today.<br />The one drawback to the Skidelsky book is  that it can be slow going.  Those with no background in economics should be  prepared to skim sections (or work hard).  If you're already familiar with  the difference between Ricardo and Malthus, and how their thinking carried  through Jevons, Marshall, and Marx, and can follow arguments on gold  standard vs. floating exchange rates, then you should be able to breeze  through.	2000-06-21

The most amazing part of the story concerns the (almost  unbelieveable) rapidity of scientific advance in this field during the  early 19th century -- then again, perhaps people 75 years from now will be  saying the same about computer or DNA knowledge during our era (I'm certain  the same won't be said of my field).<br />I enjoyed this book, and recommend  it highly.  Anybody with a rudimentary understanding of nuclear physics  (e.g., who can understand the meaning of the terms electron/ neutron/  proton) and early 20th century history will have no problem with this book.   I gave it 4 stars out of 5, because I reserve 5 stars for books that, when  I'm finished, I wish would continue: this is a very fine book, but I was  ready to move on by the end.  If I were the author, I would have included a  section on the long-term costs of the US atomic program -- i.e., the  environmental cleanup costs we are paying today as a consequence of the  &quot;victory now at any cost&quot; mindset of 50 years ago (yeah, I know,  I just implied that it's already too long -- but it really isn't).	2000-03-03

Publication of a short biography of Augustine, an influential but little-known (to modern Americans) figure in Western  history, was a great idea, and I'm pleased that Penguin took on the  project.<br />Writing a biography of someone like Augustine is difficult --  little information is available other than Augustine's surviving writings.   The successful biographer needs to ground the available information, and a  critical rereading of previous biographies, in our current understanding of  the state of society at that time.  Garry Wills has pulled that off  nicely.<br />Augustine lived in interesting times:  Church doctrine was  evolving while identifying heretical docrines (e.g., Donatists); the Roman  Empire was effectively split in two, with the Western capital moved from  Rome to Ravenna;  and (mainly) Christianized &quot;barbarian&quot; groups  were taking over large sections of the Western Empire (Alaric's Goths  captured Rome during Augustine's lifetime, and Augustine died near the end  of the Vandal conquest of Roman Africa).  Wills successfully places  Augustine's life in context of these important events.<br />Other Amazon  reviewers have noted that this is not a good introductory volume.  I  disagree, as long as the reader has some knowledge of the historical  period.  Even in that case, however, the early sections of the book can  drag -- e.g., with lengthy reinterpretations of specific Augustinian  phrases.

US	52473406	R3T7EQ2IKHA94M	0399145672	857420607	Big Trouble	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Very funny, no attempt at depth	This book is a great romp from beginning to end.  As the author notes in the &quot;Acknowledgements and Warning,&quot; however, this is not a book for kids.<br />Although my edition runs 255 pages, it actually reads about 1/2 that length -- it has big type and lots of white space.  And it reads  really fast because it is a heck of a lot of fun (and I'm not making that  up).  I read it in one day (I was home from work -- &quot;sick&quot;).<br />My  recommendation is:  If you are anything like me (and, if so, you have my  deepest sympathies), you will love this book.  For those who enjoy this  book, I offer the following recommendation:  Barry's narrative style  (especially in the 1st half of the novel) reminded me of that of Tom  Sharpe, a Britisher who wrote a bunch of comic novels in the 1970s and  1980s.  They were published in paperback in the US by Vintage in the  mid-1980s, and may be the funniest novels ever written in English...	2000-02-08
US	52473406	R3GV4FDJSAAZEJ	0684859114	371330467	Damascus Gate	Books	3	19	22	N	N	Tried to Reach, and Grasped Nothing	Getting close to page 150, I put the book aside in exasperation.  I'd just finished reading an almost page-long description of a room that wasn't entered -- a room that was, evidently, irrelevant to the story (was there  any relevance to the Holman Hunt reference?) -- followed by a description  of the clothing of a guy in another room (&quot;A man in an ugly brown  lightweight suit, wearing a tie the color of faded broccoli pizza...&quot;  ) who then said &quot;Hi there, fella.&quot;  Faded broccoli pizza?   I'd  grown tired of the lengthy descriptions, the pointless dialog, the  meandering plot (actually, there may have been no plot -- the  &quot;meandering&quot; was probably due to my effort seek order in chaos),  the blizzard of characters introduced (then left behind) for no apparent  reason.  But, most of all, I was annoyed by the passing references and  especially by the italicized non-English words on almost every page, a  literary device used to make those in the know feel smug and knowledgable,  and the rest of us feel awestruck at the author's erudition (by the way,  I'm familiar with both Holman Hunt and &quot;The Eighteenth Brumaire of  Louis Bonaparte&quot; (not &quot;...Louis Napoleon,&quot; as the author has  it) -- Ha! so there!).<br />Fortunately, I picked the book up again and  eventually discovered a fine novel, with an interesting plot, great pacing,  and excellent writing.  One scene, an execution, is among the best fiction  passages I've ever read -- absolutely rivetting.  Anyone who enjoys snappy  dialog, deep plots, realistic settings (however, I've never been to Israel,  so I take no sides on the &quot;realistic/ not&quot; debate over this book  (although I don't believe that riots in Israel are as ubiquitous as they  appear in &quot;Damascus Gate&quot;)), and mysteries to unravel will enjoy  this book, as long as you can hurdle two major obstacles: (1) Not one of  the characters in the book is sympathetic:  They are all  jerks, imbeciles,egomaniacs, or a combination of the three; (2) This would be an outstanding  200 to 300 page novel -- unfortunately, it is 500 pages, so there's a lot  of stuff to wade through.  Perhaps a tougher editor could have removed most  of the first 200 pages.<br />I've never read a Robert Stone novel before this,  so I can't place this in context of his other work.  I get the impression  that Stone had a fine, perhaps great, novel in hand, and tried to take it  to another level.  That attempt was not successful.<br />In my edition (the  1st paperback?) there is a map at the front where the white/gray/black  overlay of Israel and the surrounding area is the mirror image of the text  (with, e.g., city names), making the map difficult to read.  I'm afraid  that the editors' attention to the map (obviously, none) reflects their  attention to the text.  It's too bad.<br />I guess I'm also left wondering  what the NBA nominators were thinking. Yeah, this is a fine book, and I'd  recommend it to my friends, given the caveats above, but...	2000-01-18
US	52473406	R43NHBFGZITEH	0670880574	193009937	Marcel Proust	Books	3	26	31	N	N	A good overview, but not very deep	Hmm.  I'm not sure what to make of this book.  It's relatively brief (165 short pages), informative, well-written and easy to read.  I'd read &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot; 15-20 years ago, but knew  next-to-nothing of Proust himself.  I was most interested in (1) his  background, primarily his childhood; and (2) how it was possible that an  unpublished author could get such a beast published.  Edmund White  addresses both issues to a degree (most satisfactorily on the second), but  concentrates (not unreasonably, I guess) on people and events from Proust's  life that make their way into the novel.<br />I found White's &quot;Marcel  Proust&quot; to be enjoyable, but it mainly whetted my appetite for a more  substantial biography.  Perhaps that's part of the purpose of this series  of books.	2000-01-06
US	52473406	R1N2GM9OVH62BD	0395759242	966326914	King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Highly recommended	This is a marvelous book, addressing a little-known subject (really, what do you know about the turn-of-the-century Congo?).  I recommend it to all students of the European expansion, and to all Americans.<br />This is a  well-written book that I recommend without reservation.  If I were editor,  however, I would have made two changes: (1) less discussion (especially in  the middle of the book)on the activities in England of the anti-Leopold  groups (despite the undoubted nobility of their actions); and (2) MORE  MAPS! (an unmet requirement for almost all modern historical books).  I am  ecouraged to re-read &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot;<br />The saddest passages  in the book are in the epilogue (unlabeled as such, however): the Congo  experiences (as much as 10 million dead, 50% mortality, which exceeded  Europe's Black Death as a demographic catastrophe) was not unusual for  sub-Sahara African experience for the time.  Just something to think about.	2000-01-03

US	52473406	R2A9CJBVCBKVD7	0312169655	858699391	Popcorn	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Good novel, but not Dostoyevsky	I was surprised to see so many reviews posted for this novel, and particularly surprised to see the intensity (pro and con) of some of the reviews.  Prior to reading the book, I'd never heard of the author -- I  bought it on the strength of a recommendation of a trusted bookstore.  My  general impression is that this is a well-written novel, but nothing to get  excited about.<br />&quot;Popcorn&quot; is an entertaining, non-serious novel  addressing a very serious subject -- the effect of violent media images on  human behavior. The tone of the book seems a little strange, but I think  the author pulled it off - it is a very entertaining book.<br />I ripped  through this book in two days (i.e., much less than my average 7 days per  book), and recommended it to my wife.  She also finished it in 2 days,  without comment.  This means that, despite my recommendation, it was  actually good enough to finish (! ), but not good enough to elicit comment.   I guess I agree -- this is an OK book, but I wouldn't even consider it for  a &quot;best of 1999&quot; list.	2000-01-03
US	52473406	R7VIGJ8PIF6ZT	0812693337	698179602	Music of Yes: Structure and Vision in Progressive Rock (Feedback: The Series in Contemporary Music, Vol. 1)	Books	3	14	19	N	N	Good subject, but I would have done some things differently	Bill Martin surveys the recorded music of Yes, concentrating on the sequence from &quot;The Yes Album&quot; (1971) to &quot;Going for the One&quot; (1977) -- what Martin terms the &quot;main sequence&quot; (I  would have excluded the latter from the primary discussion, concentrating  on the five studio (plus one live)albums from 1971 to 1974, setting aside  the 1977 effort that followed the almost three years of absence of group  effort).  I recommend this book to fans of Yes music (those unfamiliar with  Yes would be lost, I'm afraid), with the following two reservations: (1)  Often, the author writes as if he is addressing an academic audience -- the  lengthy asides do demonstrate that he is familiar with the literature to  which he refers, but (I think) are unnecessary in this book. (2) The  discussion of Yes' work is less about the &quot;structure&quot; of the  music than it is about the lyrics (with the notable exception, in places,  of Squire's bass work).  Furthermore, it is explicitly about the author's  interpretation of the lyrics, rather than about (e.g.) Anderson's intent  (&quot;I have not relied on interviews....  I have also not attempted to  contact band members&quot;, pg xxiv).  There's nothing wrong with this  approach, but the reader should be forewarned...  In my opinion, the lyrics  don't really matter; they are just part of the song, and don't necessarily  need to have deeper meaning.<br />Finally, I note that the author is the  &quot;series editor&quot; for this series of books -- perhaps the book  could have used another editor.<br />If you're a Yes fan, this is a worthwhile  read.  Just be prepared to skim a page here and there.	1999-12-30
