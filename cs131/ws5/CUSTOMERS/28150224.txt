It continues with drama, drama and more drama.  The only bad thing about it is you'll have to wait another year for the ending of the series to find out what happens.<br /><br />At the end of every book Morrison leaves you hanging but resolves the issue with the next installment.  The next book \\"When somebody loves you back\\" is supposed to give closure to all the main characters in the series except for one.  That one will be in the seventh and final book of the series.  I can't wait!  I think Mary B. should release these books a lot sooner.  The ancipation is too high.  It's worse than a soap opera.  At lease you get to find out what'll happen the next day or on Monday, but waiting a whole year for the next book is too much!	2005-10-03

All opposites.<br /><br />1. Tanya-Several events in her life have her confused.  One her drug addict mother and two the death of her baby daddy.  She uses men to get what she wants and also puts her life in danger in Miami.  Sleeping around for money with men she didn't know a hot minute.  One didn't even pay her.  She had time to party all night but couldn't help her son by getting him some paper for a science project because she was too tired.  Then when he failed and had to attend summer school she was mad at him.  But was it his fault?<br /><br />2. Natalie-Tanya's childhood friend who's married to a loser and momma's boy.  His lazy behind could sit and watch tv all day but refused to watch his baby while his wife went to the grocery store.  Natalie got fed up with him and snuck off on a trip.  All though she did it the wrong way and begged for this dude not to leave her and then when he came back she wanted him gone again.  Make up your mind!  She was very messed up.  Thought she couldn't live without the momma's boy and did all kind of goofy things.  In the end she finally got over him but was it too late?<br /><br />3. Janelle-My favorite character of them all.  Independemt and sassy.  This girl had her mother living with her instead of the opposite.  She went to Miami on a mission and it was accomplished.  Although she became accustomed to the finer things she eventually sacrificed for love.<br /><br />I think there are actually stupid people like Tanya and Natalie who put up with crap.  Hopefully they'll eventually get it together and realize the most improtant things in life are their children and their self-esteem.	2005-09-25

Talk about sharing.  Michael new what he was doing and that was out cold!  A brother and a sister for crying out loud!  Now Kennedy has to deal with this dude for the rest of her life.  This book has so many issues roled up together.  Abuse, sexual issues, death, statutory rape, you name it.  I never expected this little book to have so much drama going on.

Usually Beverly Johnson's books are linked to another.  I don't know if this one is or not.  The characters don't sound familiar.  It must be a new assortment.  Beverly Johnson writes from a historical point of view and also the new age.  You can usually link one of the historcal novels to the new aged ones.  They're all about romance, mystery and they also give information about our history.  Ms. Johnson reinacts the past and brings it to life.  You can envision the characters as if they were real.

If you read Beverly Jenkins books you'll notice that most of them have a link to another.  It makes you want to go back and read the book before this one.  I want to know the history of Cyclops (Galen) and his family now.  The ending was not a disappointment in this book.  In fact it ended beautiful.

But when she finds them both out boy is she in for a shocker!  I think she should have left well enough alone, but things between her and her husband may have not improved if she didn't do what she did.  That's a plus.  Sometimes you have to rattles the chains to get some action.  This was my first read by Gloria Mallette and it was truly a good one.  Full of suspense, and the ending was not a typical one which makes it stand out.	2005-05-14

If you read the entire series from beginning (Soul mates dissipate; Never again one more;He's just a friend) and now \\"Somebody's gotta be on top\\"  then you know the story about Darius, Jada, Wellington and the host of others caught up in the triangle.  He's just a frined and Somebody's gotta be on top\\" take place at the same time.  Somebody's gotta be on top is narrated by Darius and He's just a friend is narrated by new comer Fancy.  It will be fun to see how these to character's pan out over the next three books to end the series.  I think that the best books in the series are \\"Soul mates dissipate and this one because they are both page turners and there's always sonmething happening.  It makes you think before you turn to the next page and ask youself what will happen next.  Darius is a straight up womanizer and control freak in this book.  He's never really truly loved and cared for a woman and I hope that Fancy Taylor will change that.  The ending keeps you on edge because you want to know what'll happen in the next installment.  Was she talking about Daryl Jr. or Sr.  The wait for the next book in the series \\"Nothing has every felt like this\\" will be long but I think it will be worth the wait.  The ending was definitely a mystery for several reasons.  In addition to what was stated above I'm also curious to know exactly how many children Darius has fathered.	2005-04-24

The characters are realistic and storyline is so fast past you just can't stop reading.  Before you turn to the next page you're wondering \\"man, what's going to happen next?\\"  This book ended perfectly as well.  It didn't leave you hanging.  I myself by growing up in the church as a bishops step-daughter know how it is to be judged and watched all the time so this book to me was very real.  I think everyone who claims to be a man or woman of the cloth should read this book.  I also think people who like to judge should read it as well.

Both of the main characters went through many trials and tribulations before they got together.  But it was worth the wait.  The only part of this book that I didn't like is what Zane did in the end to one of the main characters.  The way it was done was off.  It didn't match the rest of the book.  It could have been done in a different way and would have been more accepted.  Other than that the book is a page turner and a must read for Zane fans.	2005-04-23

It wasn't what I thought it would be compared to soulmates dissipate.  A sequal is usually better.  I still don't know what Darius looks like and plus the book skipped a lot of things like births and deaths that were all of a sudden just spun upon you in the middle of the story.  The next book in the sequence is \\"He's just a friend\\".  I'm assuming this will focus more on Darius' character and not just relationships that don't last.	2005-03-03

Had no escape and was from the streets but had no street training.  Her main focus was her brother Jimmy and taking care of him.  If it wasn't for him I don't think she would have settled for that low down G.  He cared for no one but himself and enticed Juicy with his bank.  The way he treated his own son proved he had a black heart made of coal.  Juicy sacrified her life and her soul at the G-Spot for her brother.  She loved him to death.  But she got what she wanted in between all the rage.  The sex scenes in this book were off the hook!

The way he treated innocent women in the past was just awful.  He tried to change but he can't.  He's back to his old ways.<br /><br />I think the next book should focus on Curtis' children or child which ever one is true.  I think it should focus on the baby Marissa and her possible \\"mental illness\\".  That would be a good story line.<br /><br />Even if you haven't read the first two books of this trilogy you can still read The Best kept secret.

I think it's only because the author is fairly new she made it a little to wordy.  It could easily been 50 pages less and I would have still gotten the picture and enjoyed it more.<br /><br />I had to go back and read sometimes because the phrases confused me.  This book mainly focused around Thea a very fair skinned sister who had gone through many twists and turns throughout her life.  But in the end I think everything worked out with everyone around her.  All of the trials she'd been through, she deserved some final happiness in her life as well as Xavier.	2004-10-31

When I was reading it I just knew that there would be emphasis of a dream sequence at the end.  But there wasn't.<br /><br />The part about Diana, I was relating to at first.  She was hurt by a man and because of this she was particular about how she chose one.  She thought that she should have one at least on her level or better.  Which I can agree with.  If you have a college degree you don't want to be with someone who only has a GED.  It just won't work out.  Men can't deal with women who they are inferior to.<br /><br />But in the end, I don't get why Diana was never promoted and why didn't her and Edmund end up getting married.  They were taking it a bit too slow if you ask me.<br /><br />I mean some of things that happen in this story just don't make any sense.  The part about what happened to Zetta and Zora was one of them.  I can see Anastasia getting her act together, but then what Bradford and Donald had to do at the end was just down right stupid.<br /><br />Believe me, this book takes fantasy to another level.  Whether that level is bad or good, you'll have to decide for yourself.  I suggest you read this book if you have not.  There will be plenty of head shaking and frowning.	2004-10-17

It was recently re-released, but I'm sure none of the original information was deleted.<br /><br />What I read was reverse discrimination.  That's right a light skinned woman who was jealous of dark skinned people.  She was jealous of her own best friend and didn't even know it.  It took losing her husband to realize her faults, even though he was wrong for what he did because he knew how she was before he married her.<br /><br />But Regina was more of a woman than I would have been if I had caught my husband with his guard down.  She took it as best she could I guess.  Even though she did pout for awhile and almost went postal, she finally got it together.<br /><br />Her best friend on the other hand had to deal with a gambler who wouldn't admit he had a problem and ended up losing a lot.  Now the way she handled this situation was not good because the first time I would have found out the fool lost all that money he would have been gone.  But just like a love struck woman she kept taking him back because of the promises.<br /><br />The end proves good for both women though and you'll find that one is not so color struck anymore.

But you have to realized that the company that published this book is an up and coming independant minority owned publisher that probably does not have a lot of money yet to hire a &quot;professional&quot;.<br /><br /> Overlooking the errors, the book was off the chain. Yarni held true and did not slump in the end. She stood by her man through good and bad times. She even did time herself to prove her love.<br /><br /> If someone needs to learn how to love unconditionally, this is the book to read.<br /><br /> I read it over the weekend.

The language was over written in novel form and most of the words could have been cut to be contractions.  Like &quot;I will&quot; and &quot;I have&quot; which was repeated several times.  I don't know anybody in the streets that uses novel form language.  This book is not the real meaning of the streets like B-More Careful was.  Carmen (Pam) was just a love sick fool who needed money to support her son after a heartbreak.  She got greedy and couldn't stop.  Not even after making over a million dollars.<br />It took me awhile to get into this book because of the way it was written and it's very slow until you get to the middle of it.  There are way to many characters and they just pop up out of the blue.  I got confused with all the guys.  There was G, T and Jamaican Erik.  Then there were brief characters like Infa that had not purpose what so ever.  But the terms used for drugs were accurate though.  Just didn't fit the format of the book.<br />The ending was not what I expected.  There has to be a sequel.  Maybe call it &quot;Let that be the reason to read this because the ending left you hanging in the last book&quot;.	2004-06-22

Her father is the one who implanted in her the idea that a rich man is the only thing she needed.  So he too was blinded by all the glitter when Lionel showed up.  His insecurity about his wife leaving him made him really spoil his daughters and put them in a mind to be &quot;Gold diggers&quot; as was Tiara.<br />The only people that had enough sense in this book were Aunt Charlie and Rashad.  Aunt Charlie had pinpointed Lionel from the begining.  Rashad could see people for who they really were on the inside.  The glitter and glamour didn't please him.<br />The title to this book did not fit the storyline at all.  Tiara didn't know how to use what she had.  She had brain power and looks.  Even the end she was still in that golddigger frame of mind but refrained when she realized how it would hurt her father and the man she loved.  I believe if her father would have accepted that proposal that was offered in the end Tiara would have also went along with it.  But that's just my opinion.	2004-05-11

It may have the same characters but the concept was totally different.  But it was a good book though.  The addition of Jasmine and the plot between Amir/Myles' parents added a twist to the story line.<br />But the characters that I wanted to see more of who were the main course in &quot;Good Peoples&quot; were Myles and Marissa.  They really didn't have much story line in this book.  There just has to be a trilogy about the Moores somewhere in the near future.	2004-05-04

From one tragedy to the next, this by far has to be the most depressing book that Ms. Lawson has written.<br />I am so happy that I started off with her newer books first.  The only one that I haven't read is the very first one that she wrote &quot;Behind closed doors&quot;.  Now I'm scared because I think that one may be depressing as well.<br />Her writing has definitely improved since this novel.  Depression should not be felt throughout the whole entire novel.  There should be some sunny spots.  Well I guess the ending was nice, but Marcella still has no man, and a no good baby daddy to contest with probably for the rest of her life.	2004-04-05

This novel is a very pleasent read that captured my heart.  Marissa was a very hurt soul who had trouble expressing her feelings to Myles.  But the end proves well for the couple.<br />Other things that drew my attention were the explaination of black people of Spanish decent.  Major explains this well through Myles.  a lot of people still don't understand that there are black people in many different countries.  We all originated from the same place but just got thrown around to all kinds of places.<br />I plan to read the sequal to this novel next.  I want to see how Myles and Marissa are doing.  This couple is very interesting to read.  The image is one of true love that is explained very well.	2004-03-10

This book relates to what many women in abusive marriages have to go through including the beatings, threats and sexual abuse.<br />Each of the three siblings obviously experienced something tramatic to have the personality that was exposed from each of them.  The book reveals each of their problems and as usual the middle child has the most.<br />In the book Gina asked the question, is it considered rape if you husband forces himself upon you?  Yes, every woman is entitled to say no.  The things that Phillip forced Gina to do in this book should be labeled as sodomy.  It seemed like when Phillip was mad that's when he wanted Gina to do all those awful things to him sexually.<br />Then there's Delores, the mother of the three siblings Sidney, Gina and Rick.  Her illness brought the family together in a sense.  But Gina's abusive relationship actually kept her from really being able to spend time with her mother the way she wanted to.<br />As usual Roby tells about life issues.  Roby tells this story as truthfully as it can get.  Anyone who has experienced any type of abuse should read this book.  At the end there are numbers to hotlines that can help you in your given situation.<br />Although I myself have not had any tramatic experiences as the people in this book had, I do know other people and family members who have. I will certainly recommend this book for reading and help in their situations.	2004-03-03

I first heard about Kimberla Lawson-Roby at a bookstore in the African-American section when I was talking to a lady who advised me that she heard &quot;Casting the first stone&quot; was an awesome read.  And the sequel &quot;Too much of a good thing&quot; was even better.  I read both of those books and decided to read other novels by this aspiring writer.<br />I was definitely not let down.  Roby tells real life stories about racism, abuse and even jacked-legged preachers.<br />&quot;A taste of reality&quot; was an excellent book to pick to read during black history month.  If you have not read it I advise you to do so.  Discrimination still exists and the way the story was told in this book is as real as it gets.<br />Even the way Roby tells of how black men choose a dark woman as their mate before they make it is truly a real issue.  Think about how many celebrities have done this and then once they become famous they choose women of other races.<br />In the end Anise was victorious.  She did what she should have and faught for her rights. She did as an intellegent black woman should do in this day and age.<br />Hats off to Ms. Roby for another insightful novel.  Keep them coming and I'll keep reading them.	2004-02-23

First of all why would you choose to have a baby by someone who doesn't want to marry you.  That right there should prove how responsible Malik would be and were his mind was at.  Second why would you continue to let a man live with you who does not want to get married and basically support him financially.  Third why would you pay for your own ring when he final asks you to marry him.<br />Then there's Shonda, the most selfish uncaring person in the book.  The fact that she herself had a child didn't play any part in her decisions obviously.  Why would she want a man who already has a woman who is pregnant, and is engaged to be married.  I'm sure if she was in that situation she wouldn't want it to happen to her.  She was basically accepting left overs that were spoiled.  Then when she ruined the wedding that just took the cake.  How selfish can you be.<br />Remember what goes around comes around.  Malik is a big liar and he will definitely cheat on Shonda.  And did you notice he bought both women the same Christmas gift?  Probably from the flea market.  This book was outrageous.  It's definitely the young woman's guide to stupidity.	2004-02-17

This sequel to &quot;Casting the first stone&quot; was even better.  Curtis is definitely the vilan you just love to hate.  The only thing that I didn't like about the book was the part were Ms. Roby tries to turn it into a soap opera by aging the characters.  Alicia was six in the last book.  The scene in this book takes place five years later but now she's fourteen.  What's that about?<br />The way the book is set up and the way all of the characters go through twists and turns, especially the dangers of minors and the internet, makes it hard to put this book down.<br />There just has to be a trilogy to this Curtis saga.  The ending gives clues that it will be.  I just hope we don't have to wait another three years like we did for this one.<br />Keep up the good work Ms. Roby.	2004-02-02

These things are happening right now right under all of our noses.<br />My mother is married to a minister and this man has been my step-father for over twenty years.  I remember so many things that my mother had to go through when I was little girl.  I also remember finding evidence of him cheating and he came up with some of the same lies and excuses as Curtis did.  And of course my mother believed him.<br />Still to this day there are many unanswered questions to my step-father's whereabouts most of the day and night.  I mean just like Curtis he's gone all the time, and most of the time he has no explanation for his whereabouts.<br />I will definitely give this book to my mother to read.  Maybe she will finally wake up and smell the coffee after over twenty years (I doubt it).<br />In addition to my step-father, I have also worked with many ministers in my line of work as a radio broadcaster, and I have meet many so called &quot;jack legged&quot; preachers.  I have been flirted with by married men who were supposed to be men of God.  One time one actually came up and kissed me right smack in the mouth.<br />Reading this book brings back memories. And it should alert any woman who is married to someone envolved in a ministry who has shifty ways.<br />Always remember God is first, but your wife should be your number one priority after that.  This is another reason to have been suspicious of Curtis in the first place.  Why was he always the minister who had to go and pray for all the sick and shut in?  A church as large as the one he was over had to have many more ministers and of course a prayer team.  The church that I attend at the present does.<br />The bottom line is that all first ladies should watch their man.  The flesh is definitely weak.  Especially for a man who doesn't stay prayed up.	2004-01-26

I myself have to juggle between my two children, a full time job and being in college full time.  But this book is definitely missing something.  Sure there are struggles with single mothers from the ghetto. But what exactly are the struggles?  This book only gave sparse details.  Nothing was told of what happened to Denise and her son when she was left at JD's mother's house after he was sent to prison.  Was she put on the streets or did she just move in with her friend and her two kids?  This book has too many holes that should have been filled.  I mean as long as it was you would think that a little more information would have been included.  This is the first book that I've actually read by Tyree but it seems like he tries to go in the minds of women and think like them.<br />There was a good part of the book though.  When all the men involved tell the story from their perspectives. But it still does not give enough info.  Single mothers have to go through a lot more than what Denise had to.  Being a single mother myself I know this. I have been through a lot more and I'm still striving, and I'm not even from the ghetto!  There was just not enough spice to this book.  It needs a tad bit more flavor.  Or maybe Tyree should have actually interviewed a single mother and based the book on a true story or actual facts.	2004-01-23

Lynn Harris' books and this by far was my favorite.  Basil and Yancey have to be one the best love/hate couples ever created.  The sad thing is that the relationship probably would have had a better chance of survival if that crazy mother of Yancey's &quot;Ava&quot; hadn't been trying to sabatage things for Yancey.  Can you believe she actually called her own daugther the &quot;b&quot; word.  What kind of mother is that?  But at the end of the next novel you really find out how crazy she is.  The Harris novels only get better and better.  I can't wait for the next one.  I guarantee you Basil will probably be in it.  Just look at the pattern.  I am glad that he finally had a child.  That's something he really wanted.  I'm also glad that he got to finally start to find out the real truth about his mother and bonded with his half sister and her son who looks just like him.  Basil needed somebody to calm his hot tail down.  Can't wait for the next novel Mr. Harris!	2004-01-23

Does she every rekindle the relationship with her husband?  I mean everything up until that point of the book was intriguing.  It definetly has the potential to be a great movie.

Lynn Harris fan but I was not impressed by this biography.  He leaves out too much detail.  The only thing I really got out of it was that his step father Ben was a main source behind his homosexuality. Calling him all kinds of names such as sissy, I think that scarred him for life.  That type of verbal abuse usually does.  Although I don't encourage homosexuality, Harris' books do make me think and now I'm more understanding to people who are homosexual or bisexual.  I've read all of Harris' books and this is the worse one.  I think he should have put a little more personal info into it.  Just because you're a great writer doesn't always mean you can do a biography.  Some people are just better at creating things than they are with telling a true story.	2003-11-28
