I am happier now than I have ever been, am calmer and more centered and have more control over the events in my life and a deeper spritual relationship with my God.  This book is easy to read, easy to understand and the methods the author presents are very easy to apply.  I only wish I had come across it sooner in my life.  For a very small investment, you can reap great benefits from reading this book.	2005-09-24

It was really bothersome and disruptive and I was angry and confused because of my reaction every time I tried to go somewhere on that route.  I felt like I might \\"pass out\\" or otherwise lose control as a result of my panic reaction.  The first thing this book made clear to me was that it is physiologically impossible for your body to \\"pass out\\" or otherwise lose control during a panic attack.  Your blood pressure is too high to do so, and the actual emotional state is truely one of control, not the opposite, to do so.  You are not going to pass out or otherwise lose control of the situation.  When you feel out of control in a panic attack, you are actually in a state of high control.  You must realize that and remind yourself of that fact.  I used a method they mentioned, putting a rubber band on my left wrist when driving that route, and smacking myself with it whenever I felt overwhelmed.  It worked.  The first time I took that drive, I had 5-6 rubberband whelts on my left arm, but I drove it, I got to my destination and the panic issue was gone.  I now drive that highway on a regular basis.  Even if you don't do all of the exerercises in the book, you will experience results and resolution.  It's worth it!	2005-05-26

This is not a large book on how to ovecome your anxiety issues, but it gets right to the point.  I read it in one day and used the principles it suggested and I actually overcame a specific phobia in one afternoon.  I had, for no known reason, developed an anxiety reaction to driving on one particular highway in my city.  It was a busy, 5 lane route with a speed limit of 70 mph. with an average speed of 80 mph for most drivers.  Every time I used that highway, I experienced an anxiety reaction that could be classified as a panic attack.  It was intolerable.  I suffered for weeks until I got this book and read it the first day.  I used the coping methods suggested and it worked for me.  I now drive that route at least once a week and on the rare occasion that I get anxious, I tell myself that \\"I feel nothing, this is uncomfortable, but many things in my life are uncomfortable and I can handle this\\" and I get where I have to go without incident.  Read this book and use it, it can be very helpful, if not a cure!  Who knew something as simple as wearing a rubber band on my left wrist and tweaking it whenever anxiety became an issue could actually revise a panic situation.  It works!	2005-05-26

She left because he bid it, she thought him dead and raised her daughter well, as he wished.  She also risked everything to be back with him again, once she knew he did not die in battle.  Not an easy choice.  She came back to a world she hardly knew, tolerated endless trials (most modern women would not) and a little betrayal, to be with the man she loved more than life.  This book takes off where Dragonfly left off perfectly and leads us on to the next chapter of Claire and Jamie's lives.  As in Outlander and again in Dragonfly, life in that time is not easy or sweet, but the good can be found and savored, as our characters did, dispite insurmountable obstacles.  This is not a series of books to be undertaken lightly, which is the meat of the whole endeavor, but the end result is just as it should be.  Keep the faith!

It is a story of love, cat adoration, travel to the South of France and a beautiful life.  I ordered this book from Amazon.com.uk because it was not originally available in the US, and it was worth every extra dollar.  It is a love story, without all the fluffy and erotic nonsense, a story of a couple that loves and admires cats and a story of two people living an authentic life in the South of France.  If any portion of this description appeals to you, you will enjoy this book.  If you truly dislike cats, don't buy it, as the auther is a real cat lover, but the story is not devoted to cats.  What more can I say, except that if you love travel and relocation stories, if you have any admiration at all for cats and if you have even the smallest dream of living in the South of France, you will love this book.  I ordered extra copies for friends and family, but my original copy is a keeper for my personal library.	2004-07-13

I had a hard time finishing this book because I knew the outcome when I bought it, but I was still compelled to read it because I knew that both the subject and the auther were extraordianary.

That said, my take on this diet plan is unsatisfactory in that it is not comfortable or easy for someone like me to follow.  I have a high intake of fresh fruits and especially vegetables, but this diet plan insists that you exclude red meats and alcohol of any sort.  If you already follow or appreciate a vegetarian lifestyle, this plan will really appeal to you.  If, like me, you truly enjoy a good steak or BBQ'd burger and wine with your dinner, you will not be able to subscribe to this plan.  The research and basics of this diet are sound, but stringent.  It might be okay for a few weeks and you might even lose a few pounds, but I can't help thinking that there has to be a better way.  I had a good level of success with the Fat Flush diet plan and with Atkins, but I can't help but hope that there is a reasonable alternative to exreme dietary restrictions that will actually yield success.  I am now trying the theory that it is okay to eat like a normal person but watch your intake amount/combined with moderate excercise as the real way to lose weight and keep it off.  I like the idea that you can eat what you like, moderately, and increase you activity as the lasting method for fitness. Good Luck to all!	2003-05-15

I bought this book, along with the cookbook, on Amazon a month ago and followed the diet plan closely for the first two weeks (I lost 13lbs.) and loosely for another 7-10 days for a total weight loss of 27lbs.  It is not the easiest diet to follow, as the flax oil tastes really icky and the flaxseed fiber supplement drink is equally hard to swallow, but if you actually do what the author suggests, you Will lose weight.  What I found the most difficult was eating eggs without salt and topping my protein portions with the flax oil as suggested.  I think (I cannot prove it with personal research), that flax oil is much the same as linseed oil.  It's not the initial taste, but the lingering aftertaste that put me off.  I did learn how to cut back on carbs, fats and sodium (it's amazing what you can do with mustard and hot sauce) and did manage to modify my long term dietary intake, but after a month, I wanted to taste a grilled steak with garlic salt and maybe even a touch of butter, not to mention a crusty bit of bread!  If you are more committed and have more willpower than I do, you can really lose a significant amount of weight on this plan and alter your palate.  I have maintianed my weight loss (except for 4 lbs.), which is probably water weight due to increased sodium intake) and am very happy with the plan.  I did lose a good amount of weight and learned alot on how to control portions and refined carbs without any real discomfort.  The cookbook has lots of really good recipes, most of which could be elevated to stardom with some off-limits additions of butter!  The mock mashed potatoes, using cauliflower was a real hit in my household and is still something I will fix regularly.  This is an effective but not entirely painless diet plan suited for someone with real dedication.  I thank the author sincerely for the many pounds I lost initially and for the good advice that I continue to follow.  It's worth trying, especially if you have 20+ lbs. to lose!	2003-04-29

I started the Fat Flush Diet Plan less than 30 days ago and am happy to report a weight loss of 27lbs. in that short time frame!  This cookbook is essential if you wish to follow the Fat Flush Plan!  This diet is not totally easy if you really value the addition of salt or butter, but really effective!  Flax oil is a primary ingredient and I believe it does promote weight loss in addition to many other health benefits, but it is not at all tasty, in my opinion. Try the mock mashed potatoes, using a cauliflower puree and several of the breakfast suggestions (eggs are vital to success), plus the smoothie recipes and you will lose weight and (most importantly, inches) in a short period of time!  This book contains many delicious and health smart recipes, using ingredients you may previously have discounted, and the diet plan works. After a month on the plan, I craved salt on my entrees more than anything else, but I did lose a great deal of weight and inches and truly recommend the diet plan and cookbook to anyone committed to real weight loss and helpful insights to healthy eating.	2003-04-29

I bought this book after reviewing all the buyer's reviews, followed the plan and lost 27lbs. in 3 weeks!  There is no other diet plan or program that I know of that can offer results like that!  It was not always easy to bypass the salty and sweet extras that I usually crave, but after only two weeks on this plan, I did not feel any real cravings for the things I used to eat regularly!  True, flax oil is not a tasty treat, but just knowing that by following the plan and doing the things the author suggests will really result in pounds and inches lost, it's easy!  This is not a plan that I think anyone will actually subscribe to for life, but the initial weight loss and inches gone are incentive enough to follow at least the beginning phase and apply the principles in the future.  I also purchased the Recipe book and highly recommend many of the listings, especially the mock mashed potatoes, using cauliflower puree...it is delicious on it's own and if you embellish it with a touch of butter or cream cheese, it is to die for!  This book is perfect for initial weight loss and altering life long bad patterns of eating.  I am following the plan loosely now and am still losing inches and feeling great!	2003-04-27
