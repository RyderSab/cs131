The Best Little Boy in the World was one of those formative books I read when I was coming out in the 70's. I naturally assumed this was going to be a powerful follow-up to that volume. It was anything but that. Mr. Tobias tells us all about the wonderful, glamorous, rich and political un-gay and then gay-gay life he has had. With references to that book. If not for the fact that the book was cheap, I would've been furious. As it was, I just threw it away when I was done with it.	2002-10-18

It separates the communicative activities and grammar review into different parts of the book, which is convenient and logical for students and instructors. There is a workbook and lab manual with lab cassettes as well. It does not include videos, CD-ROM's, overheads, and flamenco dancers, but in a 1-semester course, you may not have time to get all of that in anyway. It's not ground-breaking material, but at least your students aren't buying a two-semester book for a 1-semester course.	2002-10-18

I devoured it! Finally, it was OK to have sex with another guy. I wish I would've kept my original copy and put it in a glass case or something. There's lots of safe sex issues that are not included in the original edition that you obviously need to be aware of. Buy this one for sentimental reasons, then get a current book for practical use. This one gets 5 Stars for what it did for gay men when it was published!	2002-05-29

There are plenty other reviews written on this book already that pretty much say what I'd like to say. This author has a unique style of writing that I do not enjoy. He is bitter about his life, gay life, and American life. As in his other books, there are some fun one-line zingers, but mostly he just crabs on and on. Maybe as a stand-up comedian he is funny. As a writer, I found him intolerable. My partner, on the other hand, roars with laughter as he reads his books. To each his own.	2002-05-27

The Fifth Edition, with Rodney Bransdorfer added to the author team, appears to be their hottest edition yet. The grammar activities are better organized and cleaned up, and the presentation in the book is sharper and more comprehensible than ever.

The book is excellent - without question. But to simply hand to it the student and expect instant results in the public school system in the United States is a bit of a stretch. You would do better to use the book yourself as the teacher. If you are the student, do not hesitate to buy and utilize this book - it is excellent, but you must STUDY this book.	2002-05-18

I read it in one delightful sitting on a rainy evening. The characters came to life, aroused me at times, made me almost cry a couple times as I thought of some of my own really awful experiences coming out in high school, but brought me right back to the triumphs of surviving high school and those experiences.<br />This reviewer only gives the book 4 stars because the author tries SO hard at times to make the book self-help for teens when it could have just been an absolutely wonderful on its own. Do not let this deter you from reading it or recommending it to any teenager - it is great and informative, and the last few pages offer resources for teens. Maybe I should've just given it 5 stars and let it go, but the self-help angle takes away from the integrity and flow of the story from time to time.	2002-05-18

I watched this book grow from drill and kill in earlier editions to its present, bloated 6th edition. I have taught out of the 5th and 6th editions of this book for 4 years. The students absolutely hate it. It is cluttered and confusing. The order in which grammar and vocabulary are presented defy logic and all current research in second language acquisition. This book has been torn down and put back together so many times, that it is a hellish mess. Language methodology has changed and evolved over the nearly 25 years this book has been in use, and now this book doesn't know what it is or wants to be. The exercises in the book are worthless. All the instructions are in Spanish from chapter 1 on, and the students cannot interpret them, which renders the activities useless. Dicho has had a good, long run. It's time to shelve it and move on. The only reason I still use it is because I have no choice in textbook selection where I teach.	2002-04-11
