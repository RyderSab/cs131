US	52605029	RY2DO4GF7ILBN	1892145022	219288755	Here is New York	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A swell little essay	I bought a 1949 first edition of this and just loved holding the 4\\"x6\\" (or thereabouts) gem in my hands. It has a sepia \\"Fairchild Aerial Surveys\\" image of Manhattan on the cover, as well as blurbs calling E.B. White \\"swell\\" and \\"meaty\\" and \\"original, all wool and a yard wide.\\" I'm just starting to learn that part of the pleasure of a book, occasionally, is its packaging - and this was a swell example. I barely know what to add to the other comments here about White's writings. If you know him only through his three beautifully crafted childrens' books, this is one place to start with his essays. Here is New York was originally written for Holiday magazine. You can read the essay (and, consequently, this book) in one sitting. The ideas here are admittedly romantic and, from my twenty-first-century perspective, sometimes a tad cloying. That said, White's sentences always deliver spare, direct ideas. He is truly a joy to read. If you love Manhattan as I do, you'll want to have this as part of your library, if only to be reminded every once in awhile that someone voiced your own feelings 60 years ago.	2005-08-29

One of the great things (among many) about Haruf's novel is how he creates story lines that he doesn't necessarily resolve.

I loved the book whenever it was focused on James...found Grady a little tedious for the length of the story. I wasn't as enraptured of the story as some others here, but I still respected how beautifully written it was. I was struck by how Chabon develops some extremely fascinating characters and then moves them offstage or drops them almost entirely. But I'm recommending the book, nevertheless, because of how entertaining most of the story is...and how well written.	2005-08-12

I don't know why it took me a decade to get around to reading one of the most critical pieces of children's fiction published in recent years. But, at last, I absorbed it in several sittings. I enjoyed getting to know the Watsons (who never seemed as \\"weird\\" as Kenny kept telling us they were), but my hesitation in embracing it centers on how much Curtis throws at us. It feels as if we know this family's problems - primarily, their troublesome oldest son - far better than we know the family members themselves. This may be because we get the story firsthand from 10-year-old Kenny, whose innocent perspective is not quite up to the task of the subject matter as it develops. By the time we move into the near-tragedy of Kenny's encounter with the \\"Wool Pooh\\" and the very real tragedy of the church bombing, the tone shifts so drastically that things feel tacked on and not as emotionally involving as they should be.	2005-07-03

I don't remember my reaction then (except for the nagging feeling that it was something I was supposed to appreciate because it was a classic and because I was right around Holden's age). So here I am 40 years old, reading it again. And I think it's magnificent. As a teenager, I probably thought Salinger was a lot like me because of the voice he has created for Holden. As an adult, I think Salinger is a brilliant stylist because he obviously \\"captured\\" the voice of an angst-ridden (and for good reason!) teenager. There is so much complicated stuff to consider amidst a seemingly uncomplicated tale. And it's always fascinating to consider what literature sticks around and what doesn't. Just for grins, I checked out the Pulitzer site and discovered that Conrad Richter's The Town won in the same year that Catcher in the Rye was eligible. Makes you wonder which 2005 titles will still be around 55 years hence.	2005-04-17

I haven't yet read Saturday. I haven't even gotten into Atonement yet (which has gobbled up a little of my time with two false-start attempts - just haven't been in the right mood yet, but that day will come). But I have such glowing memories of The Child in Time and Enduring Love (one of my all-time favorite books), that I decided to tackle another McEwan \\"brief\\" novel. Glad I did. Even in its spare vision and mechanical structure, beautiful machine that it is, Amsterdam brought me a lot of reading happiness. But anyone who is going to touch this one needs to know that it's a very dry comedy at heart. I own the original British hardcover edition, which has a cover illustration of a 19th-century duel. That artwork perfectly establishes the tone - something the silly photograph on the new paperback edition does not.	2005-04-07

Eleanor Estes caught my attention because her novels, many published 60 years or more ago, have recently been reissued. This one has terrific illustrations by Louis Slobodkin, a huge talent in his own arena. The story here is simple, which may be obvious, but I'm fascinated by how something so basic becomes so beloved. The writer's style is skilled and serviceable, but there's nothing magical about the language (as with E.B. White). The dated material is occasionally offputting. The main characters are so thinly sketched as to be cliche. And the true payoff, the reality of the \\"hundred dresses,\\" is almost thrown away. Is the childhood memory of a beloved book what makes it a classic?	2005-04-04

And while that ending may be built on some roll-your-eyes coincidence, the pleasure of the puzzle makes you overlook these slight weaknesses. I've been recommending this one since I read the last page (and then returned to the first page to do some rereading...and then read the front-cover flap and the back-cover flap and the back cover and basically tried to wring all the language out of what was a real joy).	2005-04-04

This time around, I felt like she had picked up where Robert Cormier left off. She's our new Cormier! She explores complex ideas, which is always a reason to put your hands together. In swift, smart strokes, she creates breathing characters. Our hero Darren is no exception. But I'm not convinced she's mastered the art of the short novel (teenage or otherwise). This book is crowded with so much drama that demands further exploration, and you see this in some of the more minor characters. Stereotypical jock friends. Give-themselves-over-too-easily girlfriends. Vacuous parents. School administrators who are like chess pieces in Oates' game of plotting. And a sneaky little subplot about Darren's sexuality that is barely mined, almost as if some editor told Oates she couldn't dig deeper in a young adult novel.	2005-03-22

What a great afternoon I had - stuck on the runway at Logan Airport, then stuck at the gate during my connect in Milwaukee. Thanks to Elinor Lipman's most recent novel, it was all good. There are so many great things about The Pursuit of Alice Thrift, including Lipman's trademark snappy dialogue and sharp first-person perspective. And when Alice begins to transform, the story really begins to fly (even when my planes were earthbound). One tiny shortcoming: It all seems to wrap up a bit too rapidly in those final 20 pages. But by that point, I was sorry to leave the story, so maybe the rapid-fire conclusion was tainted by my own regrets. Elinor Lipman is one of my very favorites, and Alice Thrift is now one of my very favorite Lipman creations.	2005-02-16

Some scenes are whimsical. Others are ominous. He creates a world that you can see in your mind's eye. His craft is obvious, and I would gladly read anything else by him. BUT: This is one frustrating novel because it feels like it's wandering aimlessly most of the time. There is one highly dramatic plotline that feels pasted onto the story. Because Russo tells stories grounded in a very real world, it's jarring when characters speak like eccentric characters from one of David E. Kelley's television series. In other words, like characters from a very unreal world. And this won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction?	2005-01-31

His essays in Magical Thinking had me smirking sometimes, nodding with recognition other times, rolling my eyes occasionally. Some of the early ones smack of exaggeration, and so I trod suspiciously through his memories. But that didn't keep me from being entertained.

This is a great glittery novel that points itself at Henry James - but I found it a nice offspring of Austen. Frankly, not a lot happens here outside of dinners and parties (and dinner parties). Yet, I came to the final third with the feeling that I'd been part of the era. There are a couple of critical, yet thinly drawn, characters. And maybe there has been so much media surrounding this coked era that it now seems cliche. The first criticism is the author's problem, the second is not. And what a fine antidote this is to the sad collection of \\"chick lit\\"-type gay novels (with their cartoon covers) that have stacked up in recent years.	2004-11-24

As wayward as her work may often be, I can't think of another novelist who says so much with such skill so frequently. Oates' sheer volume doesn't necessarily make her great. But it is astonishing how consistently terrific she is across the vast landscape of words she has thrown at us. The Falls is one of her grand operatic works: arias that go on too long, scenes heightened to melodramatic unbelievability, characters (including the heroine here) painted in such hot or cold colors that they are hyper-real - and all of that is a collective good thing. I really rolled through (and in) this one. (And the amazing thing about Oates is that she has so many more that I haven't yet read. She could stop writing now, and I'd be set for life, but I hope she keeps turning them out.)	2004-10-18

I didn't think his world was bleak. I just thought it was straightforward, and I even remember thinking (all the way back then) that he wrote like a newspaper reporter writes: clean sentences, openings that grab you, spare word usage, economical description. The Rag and Bone Shop, his last published novel, is all of that. Just like some of Mr. Cormier's other books, it straddles an awkward space between \\"children's\\" or \\"teenage\\" fiction and a real adult sensibility. This one is especially uncomfortable, as it often takes on the perspective of adults (and their career or romantic concerns), and I felt those sections quickly shot into predictable territory. I kept wondering if this was the finished work that Mr. Cormier wanted it to be. It felt truncated, unrealistic. But I have to admit that I zipped through it the way you would an interesting feature article in the newspaper.	2004-09-17

This novel is full of heart and graceful writing. The only thing that bugged me - after I had finished the book and let it settle in my brain for awhile - is a somewhat philosophical quibble: Would the story have been less embraceable if it hadn't been set on its fantastical-yet-almost-realistic plane? I read that the author, who is an acclaimed editor at a major publishing company, wrote the book that he wished someone had submitted to him. So I can't help but wonder if he's still looking for that novel that's set in the real world (whatever that is) and deals with gay teenagers in a literate, realistic way?	2004-09-17

Back when I was working at a bookstore 15 or more years ago, Anne Tyler was exploding: Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, The Accidental Tourist, Breathing Lessons (the one that won the Pulitzer Prize even though everyone knew she deserved it for the previous book). And then my literary friends began to turn (right around Saint Maybe, I think). I loved Ladder of Years, but my contemporaries shrugged at how they thought it was more of the same old Tyler thing. And now, so many of them didn't even pick up The Amateur Marriage. I'll admit that some of Tyler's recurring character traits tickle preciousness. But if you wrap yourself in big chunks of the book, you learn her power: She creates fully realized people, whether or not they're fully realistic, and those people pull you into their worlds. I especially applaud the final chapters of The Amateur Marriage. Not to give anything away, I'll just say that they demonstrate that Tyler is always in control of her characters, rather than the other way around.	2004-09-16

Because I've made the mistake of fawning over a book, then fading in my enthusiasm, I decided to give it some time before hopping around with excitement. If anything, my memory of the story has warmed. You can read elsewhere about the novel's conceit. Andrew Sean Greer's talent is in making that conceit work so well - and doing it with style and language that just glows. Here's a warning: I felt somewhat confused and skeptical for the first third of the book. This is, again, one of those novels that you need to embrace for long stretches, as the atmosphere is designed to pull you in, not just entertain you for a few pages at a time as you doze off before bed. If you commit to the book, you'll be overcome with real emotion in the final third of the story.

Things begin to crumble halfway through when (don't worry, I'm not going to give away any specifics plot points) the mystery's solution begins to be uncovered via some very flimsy \\"feelings\\" and coincidences. That's something of a betrayal to a setup that was, until that point, so clean and logical. I was so charmed by Petra and Calder that I would happily read another book about them.

Joins a commune. Gets a new boyfriend and becomes all caught up in his world. Breaks up and falls into a bunch of deep funks that keep her at a distance from you. Well, reading Paradise Park is like having that friend - twenty years later - tell you what the heck was going on during those years.      That's probably the inherent problem in Allegra Goodman's novel, which, incidentally, sincerely captivated me. Lots of us have friends like Sharon, and sometimes we're just not patient with their flightiness and hyper-self-exploration and, yes, self-centeredness. Maybe if I really had a friend like Sharon, I could care less twenty years hence what she'd been doing all this time.      Frankly, though, what is especially unique about Paradise Park is how Allegra Goodman really explores the role of spirituality and religion in a contemporary life.

Meg Wolitzer accomplishes something astonishing here. She creates a  compelling character in Sara Swerdlow even after her sudden death at the  end of the first chapter. Surrender, Dorothy is, I think, about how each of  us is the sum of our impact on others in our lives - and their collective  perceptions of us. I eased through the story, as sad as it frequently is,  quickly, and Wolitzer's style is similar to that of some of my favorite  authors: Elinor Lipman, Anne Tyler and Stephen McCauley.	2000-09-09

It's been a few years since I've read one of Jane Langton's Homer and Mary Kelly books, but this was a welcome return to the series. Langton's style tends toward the humorously melodramatic, which fits this particular  plotline well. While the conclusion was no huge surprise, getting there was  the most fun. (I especially liked her &quot;bad seed&quot; child character,  Charlene.)	1999-09-18
US	52605029	R2KB15XNTSIZVA	0380732009	554500702	Openly Bob	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A writer first and foremost...	While Bob Smith's unique claim to fame is that he is a gay comedian who uses his sexual orientation as part of his act, this collection of essays demonstrates that it all begins with his intelligent, incisive writing.  Some of his tales will make you laugh aloud. Others are more gentle (but  never sentimental) and go to the heart of what it means to be an adult,  partnered gay man in the '90s.	1999-06-26
US	52605029	R2DMUGZ1VG8UNE	0395877334	748915804	The Lost Language of Cranes	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Even better than David Leavitt thinks it is!	This is a stunning novel - beautifully crafted with three central characters that bind themselves to your heart. I am amazed that, in the latest edition, David Leavitt writes an introduction that is almost  apologetic in tone. As if he had something to be sorry for! The Lost  Language of Cranes is satisfying on so many levels. What's more, it is an  addictive piece of fiction that you'll consume - and finish - faster than  you wish.	1999-05-30

I had no idea it was going to be one of the funniest novels I've ever read. Rob is a perfectly sympathetic character, regardless of his shortsighted faults. As  frustrating as he is, it's hard not to wish him the best. I've been through  a slew of great contemporary comedies recently - Bridget Jones' Diary, Was  It Something I Said?, Animal Husbandry, Isabel's Bed, etc. - and this is  one of the best I've encountered. Can't wait to read About A Boy now...	1999-05-13

I hope Marion Winik's new life - I recently heard her talking about her plans for her second marriage in one of her NPR essays - is less of an emotional carnival ride. I was especially struck by how bravely she lets us  see that she was less than a perfect partner...especially in the final  years of her Tony's life. This is such a gripping story that I stopped my  internal conflict with the appropriateness of raw memoirs and just let  myself be pulled along by the tragic spiral of their lives. Marion Winik is  a terrific writer, and I wonder if anyone has read her follow-up and  enjoyed it as much?	1999-05-03
US	52605029	RRAB88V443RN4	0671015648	249435806	Isabel's Bed	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Now I'm going to read her other novels...	I read Elinor Lipman's latest novel, The Inn at Lake Devine, last summer and was a little disappointed. A friend had recommended her to me as being &quot;fun.&quot; I persisted by getting ahold of Isabel's Bed and have to  admit that this one is what my friend must have been talking about. This  novel is contemporary, witty, smart - and really hard to put down. Not only  does it provide commentary about our current culture, but the characters -  especially Harriet, Isabel and Pete - attach themselves to you fast.	1999-03-10

I've already recommended this to several friends, although I have to admit that it's not as good as it should have been. The gimmick is put to terrific use - spurned girlfriend obsesses hilariously, creating a science  out of male-pattern-dumping. But so many things here don't add up. First,  why the utter hysteria over a failed relationship that was a mere few  months old? Why the surprise over a failed relationship with a guy who was  cheating on his fiancee? What the heck is wrong with Jane? And, alas, the  novel just falls to pieces in the final chapters as if the author didn't  quite know how to wrap up the high drama. All this said, though, there sure  are a lot of funny observations about relationships, realistic or not. I  stampeded right through it in a couple of days, entertained (if not always  impressed) all the way. Moo!	1999-01-09
US	52605029	R1KVIHDMHQRSBJ	0671025864	182852244	Was It Something I Said	Books	4	2	2	N	N	It all begins with a plane crash...	...and it only gets better. &quot;Was It Something I Said?&quot; is thoroughly involving. While the two main characters are indeed frustrating at times, they're realistic. Barry and Justine have both been single for so  long that they're comfortably established in their independence - both are  suspicious of a relationship that could lead to marriage. And the subplots  involving Pippa and Vince deliver solid insight into two other &quot;single  perspectives.&quot; This is a nice companion - albeit more fully  fleshed-out and less comic - to Helen Fielding's &quot;Bridget Jones'  Diary.&quot; And I especially appreciated the male perspective this time  out - especially surprising from a female writer!	1998-12-31

I'd heard so much about Bainbridge...how she has been nominated (and overlooked) for the Booker five times...how her short novels are beloved by a cultish following. So I grabbed Master Georgie while on a business trip  and buried myself in its atmosphere. I don't think I've read anyone like  her. One of the reviewers here compared the experience to browsing through  a collection of photos, and that is true. Somewhat frustrating, though, is  that - as with aged photographs - you never quite get the feeling that you  know these characters or have their full stories. Maybe if Beryl Bainbridge  were sitting alongside me to fill in the gaps. Nevertheless, I'm ready to  plunge into another Bainbridge and am curious to know if anyone else has  favorites.	1998-12-23

Sydney Taylor won the Follett Publishing Company book award - she didn't even know her husband, Ralph, had submitted her first novel to the publisher! - for this, her first children's book. Thus began a career that  is most distinguished for the series detailing the adventures of five  sisters early in this century. Most distinguishing about them is the fact  that they are Jewish, not as a stereotyping characteristic but rather a  means to explore landscape that hadn't yet been handled in children's  literature. This first in the series is particularly insightful in its  introduction of the Jewish high holy days - Sabbath days, Yom Kippur, Purim  and Succos among them. (Plus, the author even throws in the Lower East  Side's celebration of a purely American event - Fourth of July - to  demonstrate that this bright-spirited family is tied not merely to its  religious roots but is nationalistic as well!)      While All-of-a-Kind  Family is one of those falsely sunny books that came out of the 1940s and  1950s, it's nice to believe that this is the life that Taylor lived as a  child. (Incidentally, Taylor's real name was Sarah, and the stories are  based loosely on her own childhood. All of the sisters' names are real.)       Sydney Taylor died in February 1978. This initial story was followed by  four more books in the series: More All-of-a-Kind Family, All-of-a-Kind  Family Uptown, All-of-a-Kind Family Downtown and, published posthumously,  Ella of All-of-a-Kind Family.	1998-12-14

It's quirky, centered on two main characters - an eccentric couple of Upper East Side roommates - who really attach themselves to you. Read it slowly, because you'll miss  them when you're done with the book.	1998-12-07

My favorite essays: &quot;Insert a Carrot&quot; - about the Fadiman family's obsession with typographical and grammatical errors in everyday life - and &quot;True Womanhood&quot; - I actually located Father  O'Reilly's book, although I'm not sure I know someone who would appreciate  it! This collection of essays is truly a delight for anyone who knowingly  owns two paperback copies of Catcher in the Rye or The Great Gatsby.	1998-12-07

Lois Lowry ties quotes (some of them memorable) from her various novels for children (including Newbery Medalists Number the Stars and The Giver, as well as her popular Anastasia Krupnik series) to memories from her life.  The words create masterful links between fiction and fact. The bonus - the  photos. Each vignette is paired with a photo, entirely appropriate because  of Lowry's skill as a photographer (and, from the looks of it, an inherited  skill it is). The effect is absolutely affecting. This is a book for  children AND adults.	1998-10-29
US	52605029	RA00XTE0F6Y79	0679443541	478067272	Helen Keller: A Life	Books	4	5	5	N	N	She's not the &quot;Helen Keller&quot; I read about as a kid.	If her perspective is accurate - and it is certainly compelling - then  Herrmann has accomplished something extraordinary in giving us this  realistic picture of Helen Keller's life. Earlier biographies of Helen made  you feel like Helen was otherworldly; Herrmann's telling is a much more sad  tale - and more believable. Nicely written, although the story seems to  lose its way after the death of Annie Sullivan Macy, which could be a  reflection of what happened to Helen. Great photos too.	1998-10-16

After seeing a preview of the film version of this novel, I picked up a  copy and began to read. While the story is insular--almost claustrophic--in  its setting, it is nevertheless gripping. The characters, especially Dr.  Rivers, are sympathetic. I'm disappointed to hear that the two succeeding  novels are of lesser quality!	1998-09-07
US	52605029	R3IJQNUU120KF2	0380731479	529493659	The Kiss	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Beautifully written, but lacking in personal responsibility.	In reviewing this title, do you admire the clarity of Harrison's language or scorn the muddled logic of her interpretation of what happened? Her writing is superb (if a bit excessive in its mournfulness...who could blame her?). But there's something horribly disturbing at the center of this memoir, and it's not just the monster who is her father. At times, Harrison seems to acknowledge the role she played in the most-dysfunctional relationship she had with her father. Other times, she seems to make herself a victim. While she certainly was &quot;abused&quot; by her father, she was 20 years old when the affair began, not an innocent child unable to control her environment. This must have been a wrenching book to write; otherwise, we might have had more background on her relationship with her grandparents and her mother. Instead, coverage of those aspects of her life is cursory as we're made to wallow in the darkest aspects of her younger life.	1998-07-13

After reading the first few chapters of A Widow For One Year, I was madly recommending it to my friends. After digging into the second section of the novel, I'd begun to doubt whether my friends would actually enjoy this. Having completed the novel today, I have mixed feelings. A glorious start, a touching conclusion--sandwiched around an Amsterdam-focused central section that nearly brings one's interest in the book's main characters to a crunching halt. I must admit that it was all interesting, but it sure doesn't rate with some of his better novels (I'm not just talking World According to Garp here...this isn't as great a novel as The Cider House Rules). Now I hope my less literary friends who pick this up don't think I'm some kind of a weirdo...	1998-07-04
