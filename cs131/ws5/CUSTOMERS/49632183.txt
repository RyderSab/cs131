I've been trying out lots of ideas in The Romantic's Guide by M  Webb and it has really improved my ability to get in the mood.	2000-06-27

I had heard good things about this book a while back but I was severely disappointed. The book was a bit shallow.

I think Corn's 101 Great Quickies is better. The RoMANtic's Guide is not a &quot;sex&quot; book but it is probably more effective. My girlfriend  has never been more responsive.	2000-06-27

A great book for Father's Day or for any son who wants to honor his father.

I was hoping for a bit more positive information from this book instead of it just telling me where I went wrong.

What makes you land the big contract or get fired? As women have told men for decades, it IS the little things. I love how this book makes the point clear that it isnt  always the huge productions that make something soar or bomb, it is the  little things, like grains of salt that tip the balance, often  unrecognizably. Surprisingly, I read a similar book last week -- Romantic's  Guide by Michael Webb. Both show how little things can make the biggest  differences. I give both two thumbs up.	2000-05-05

Afterall, it the passion went from sizzle to fizzle in this  marriage, it was likely that it might happen in any other relationship.  Once I realized what was wrong, I was on the road to fixing me. I bought  The Romantic's Guide -- a book I can't recommend highly enough. There is  now more sizzle in my marriage than we have ever had.	2000-05-02

Thanks to the Arps for advocating that adults should be dating even if they have been married for  dozens of years. Another excellent book on this subject which has even more  dating ideas than this one is The RoMANtic's Guide: Hundreds of Creative  Tips for a Lifetime of Love.

Long after the couple forgets what I have told them,  hopefully they will have these two books to look back upon to remind them  of the essential ingredients necessary for a happy marriage.

In this time of enormous wealth, you would think people are donating more money to churches and charities, but they are giving even less. Wealth is at an all time high, but happiness and  contentment are at historic lows. In the US we are so physically blessed  but are nearing spiritual bankruptcy. We are unhappy at work, our marriages  are falling apart and we walk aimlessly through life -- searching,  searching, searching for &quot;what's the meaning.&quot; This book aptly  points out the real meaning has been there all along. Without a spiritual  anchor, we'll continue to drift. I wish every American would read this  book. <br />Highly recommended for failing marriages: &quot;The Romantic's  Guide&quot; by Michael Webb.	2000-05-01

With my busy schedule I rarely have time to delve into the 300 pagers that fill up the bookstore shelves. Maria shares a lot about her life in an open, honest way and  really gives a lot of food for thought on marriage, work, children and a  lot of other aspects. I'm sure it is a popular book simply because Maria is  a celebrity, but even if it wasnt written by someone so well known, it  would be worth reading. I'd also recommend The RoMANtic's Guide and Opening  to Love 365 Days a Year. They are fantastic too.	2000-04-28

However, simple is beautiful as Sarah writes about it. When I began my own simplicity movement 15 years ago I felt all alone and sometimes felt like caving in and jumping  back on the materialistic bandwagon. <br />I discovered Sarah's books several  years ago and I've been simplifying every part of my life eagerly and with  glee. It is like I have lost 100 pounds. All those extra things I added  onto my life since birth rarely gave me lasting happiness.<br />I think a  couple of other outstanding books in this vein are The Romantic's Guide by  Michael Webb. It shows how you can be simple and yet &quot;The World's Most  Romantic Husband.&quot; Also, Simple Living is a good read.	2000-04-28

This book makes a good case that fighting is indeed not healthy, but can cause  massive destruction in a relationship. I've never met any couple who  characterizes their relationships as &quot;blissful&quot; if they are  frequent fighters. I admire Michael Webb, author of The RoMANtic's Guide.  He is one of the few professionals who say fighting is harmful but he also  gives wonderful ways to fill your relationship with love instead.	2000-04-26
