In fact, Winston has crafted a story with characters who are accessible and interesting to read about.  My main criticism of the book is the ending which wraps up a bit too quick and is a bit unrealistic (I am referring to the &quot;Grand Opening&quot; and will leave it at that).  After reading that scene I must say that I lamented &quot;Good Grief!&quot; under my breath!  This and the annoying Drew are the reasons it gets only 3 stars.<br />In the end, though, Sophie is able to define success and family in new and different ways; ways that she is comfortable with.  I think this would be a good read for anyone who has dealt with a difficult tragedy, as Winston does have a way of putting a comical spin on things, while never minimizing the loss one experiences with such tragic events.	2004-06-20

In fact, it's probably the best I have read in the past year.  LITTLE CHILDREN focuses on small town suburbia and a cast of unhappy 30-somethings going through the motions of their lives.  With the return of a resident who has served time for sexual assualt the community is on alert.<br />The more prominent storyline is that of Sarah and Todd, two people caught in marriages and lives they hadn't pictured for themselves.  Together they attempt to create a better one and you will have to read the book to find out whether or not they are successful.  <br />Despite the darker story lines of adultery, and the returning sex offender, Perrotta has written a story that will make you laugh, perhaps even out loud.  Yes, you will also cringe at times, and you may also readily identify with many of the people featured in the book.  People who live on two different canvases - painting a bright picture for outsiders to see, while painting something entirely different when supposedly no one is else looking.  Perrotta brings us in to see what is going behind closed doors.<br />Perrotta has a knack for writing in a very engaging way and that makes for a really satisfying and quick read.  I haven't read any of Perotta's other work, but LITTLE CHILDREN will be changing that.	2004-04-20

I am a fan of Southern fiction and was pleased when my book club selected this book for our April read.  However, quickly into the novel and I was frustrated, bored and wondering how I was going to get through all 384 pages.<br />The premise is a good one: College girlfriends reunite to journey down the river as they did in college, only this time, it's to spread the ashes of one of their own.<br />Now, interestingly enough, there were 12 girls that took the initial trip back in 1965 and only four meet up for this tour.  The most interesting of the four women discussed is Harriet, the shy, never married best friend to the deceased - Baby Ballou.  Harriet is both interesting and endearing and everytime the author gives us a glimpse into her, she changes the direction of the story. In fact, Smith never gives you enough time with any of the characters to develop a real connection.  For that matter, she spends more time on the husband of one of the women rather than the woman herself!.<br />I was also perplexed that the women who were reunited on the boat never really seemed to reconnect with one another or have any real interest in being there.  It left me wondering what the purpose was in even telling this story. <br />Overall the story seems scattered and lacking of any real focus. Furthermore, I did not understand the author's need, after 370+ pages of no real mention, to &quot;update&quot; us on the lives of the women who didn't take the reunion ride.  Who cares?  If they weren't important enough to write about in the bulk of the book, why are they now?  Why even have them at all?<br />Ms. Smith may have a large following of readers, however, I will not be one of them.	2004-04-04

The organization chooses a book, each April, that they encourage all Arizonan's to read. This year, Plainsong was the worthy recipient.<br />As he read from the chapter which has a teacher, Maggie Jones, asking the old bachelor farming McPheron brothers to take in a pregnant 17 year old Victoria Rubideaux, I was instantly engaged. Haruf has a gift of enabling the reader to envision his cast of characters and the desolate Colorado plains on which they reside as richly as if they were watching it unfold before them. Plainsong walks you through the lives of several individuals and exposes you to the grief, pain, fear, joy and sometimes mundaneness they experience. While their situations may not be envious, Haruf maintains their dignity in sharing their stories and does so by writing simply and without exaggeration. Many authors attempting such direct and honest storytelling would faulter, yet Haruf succeeds.<br />Simply written, the story covers a wealth of complicated situations and unconventional definitions of family. To fill the pages with fancy words would have detracted from the elements and not allowed the reader to accurately view the rawness and beauty that life brings.<br />While I do not believe everyone will appreciate Haruf's style, I, for one, am a new fan.	2003-04-22

Within the first few lines of text you learn that a man has been murdered by his friends.  The remaining 500+ pages recount the events that led up to the murder and deal with the aftermath. Tartt's tale is a dark one and her characters are shallow, complex, frustrating and unremorseful.  Yet, she does a great job of keeping the reader interested and turning the page.<br />Tartt falls short, however, at the end when things definitely take a bizarre and hard to substantiate twist.  Furthermore, she spends too much time on the bit characters in her very last pages and not enough on the ones we loved to hate.<br />Despite this, I think the book has more going for it than against it.  Tartt is a talented writer, from whom we can likely expect more interesting stories in the future.	2003-04-10

Mr. X is a high powered business man on wife number two whom he acquired through an affair he had with the first Missus. Mrs. X a la deux is an impeccably outfitted Prada machine who is as much of a decoration in her museum-styled penthouse as are her pieces of fine art. Finally, there is Grayer, the precocious little boy who is placed on a designer diet to match his designer duds.<br />It is clear that the authors have the knowledge to write such a romp and clearer that the X's are not a freak of fiction. As much as I laughed, I felt a twinge of bittersweetness. Fake as it may be, there are indeed many of these trust fund babes who grow up clamoring for the love and affection from their parents only to be shoved off onto a make-shift mommy making $9.00 an hour while their parental units worry about buying low, selling high, parties in the Hamptoms and whether or not the other is having an affair.<br />But enough of reality - this is a delicious slice of fiction cake is just perfect for the dog days of summer!	2002-06-26

After scheduling an appointment with her doctor, she seeks solace on the web by posting her questions and concerns on a bulletin board about breast cancer. <br />It is here that she meets Susan, a breast cancer survivor.

It is clear Becker knows her stuff and has elicited help from the medical community to provide the most current information on breast cancer.  At times, the story reads a bit like a public service announcement, but the message is an important one.  Becker has created two very likeable characters and a format that is very easy to read.<br />Dear Stranger, Dearest Friend is an important read for all women and anyone who wants to learn about this disease and the power of new friendships.	2002-04-15

Comprised of Papa Hugh, Mama Laura, brothers Everett, Irwin, Pete, Kincaid, and twin sisters Beatrice and Winifred, the Chances are a baseball loving, God-fearing (most of them anyway) family living during the height of the Vietnam era.<br />The Chances struggle with issues of religion, humanity, love, life, and death throughout the novel - themes that are always relevant. While the story focuses on the Chance brothers, Duncan has a way of giving each character a distinctive personality and voice all masterfully led by youngest brother Kincaid, who narrates the saga. THE BROTHERS K is a masterfully crafted story that is funny, tragic and hopeful. After 645 pages, I had fallen in love with the Chance family - each and every one of them - and was sad to say goodbye.	2002-02-26

Ellen Franck is in a loving but frozen relationship with Malcolm, a divorced father who lost his only child to leukemia.  At 35, Ellen wonders if she will ever be able to have a baby. It certainly doesn't help that every woman she knows is a mother or mother-to-be.  That is, except for Amy, an old high school acquaintance Ellen runs into on the streets of New York.  The two begin a friendship and wade through intracacies of their own lacking relationships and desires for more.<br />Ellen is supported by a wonderful cast of characters who are both hysterical and endearing.  You will want to pick up this quick, funny and heartwarming read to discover Ellen's fate.  By the end of the book Ellen learns, and we are reminded, that life happens when you begin living it.	2002-01-04

Her two relationships in the story involve young, broke, and dumb Jeremy (who considers their running into each other at a laundromat their second date) and millionaire Ray Porter who is relationally immature in his own ways.<br />In only 130 pages, Martin shows quite an evolution in all major characters and a fabulous stagnation in sex-starved supporting character Lisa.  Martin has carefully woven wonderfully humorous insights into each of the characters, making them interesting and likeable, even when they sometimes aren't.<br />I hope this is the first of more fine fiction from a clearly talented man.	2001-12-25

Walking to lunch, I ran into a coworker who was laughing hysterically while noshing on a sandwhich and chips at our office deli.  It turns out that she was reading Naked.  I must say her laughter was infectious as she read me a passage and it was decided - Naked would be my next read.<br />The book is a collection of essays chronicling Sedaris' upbringing with 5 other siblings and his wild and sometimes crazy parents.  Sedaris covers his adolesence and early adulthood with wit, sarcasm and a few poignant moments. But mostly, it's a rip-roaring good read.  Pick it up and grab a box of kleenex - you'll be laughing that hard.	2001-12-01

But for whatever reason, I never picked it up.  Then a friend of mine read it and said I must do the same.<br />I said, &quot;Great, can I borrow your copy?&quot;  <br />&quot;Absolutely not.&quot; was her reply.  <br />She said it was good enought to warrant my purchasing and important enough to have in my own modest book collection.  So, I picked it up.  In two short days, I read this wonderful little book and feel that I too had the luxury of my own personal sessions with Morrie.  How lucky Mitch Albom was to have known him and to become reintroduced to him at such an important time in both of their lives.<br />Morrie's messages are simple and they focus on living in the moment, sharing ourselves and loving one another.  He is wise, funny, poingant and right on the money with his thoughts and observations.  <br />Many people already have this book.

Bragg's memior, All Over But the Shoutin' chronicles the Pulitzer Prize winning reporter's ascent from poverty in rural Alabama to the offices of the New York Times and the pinnacle of a journalist's career.  Forever cognizant of class and treatment, Bragg never loses his heritage when rubbing elbows of the Ivy League elite and it actually aids him as a reporter known for covering the stories of the disenfranchised.<br />I am confident that his upbringing, with an alcoholic sometimes-father, but a strong loving mother, in the poorest of poorest towns created the Rick Bragg of today.  Perhaps he would have made the same mark on society under different circumstances - but would he have hungered for it and done everything he could to make up for the lack of money, education and sophistication so many others in his field demanded?<br />A sad and inspiring story it is.

We soon become enamored with Rita, and as she hopes to direct John's grief into happiness, we learn of Rita's own troubles and her steadfast optimism through all she encounters.<br />What I loved about this book was the decency of it and its characters.  The people are real.  They love, they fear, they hope.  It's a story free of flash and drama - a real story, an honest story.

Coetzee's novel is engrossing and well written.  The prose is sparse and lends itself to the story's environment.  However, I expected more from the characters.  Not so much a happy ending, as much as a greater evolution in their choices, their motivations, their lives.<br />The story focuses on David Lurie, a communications professor in Cape Town.  After an affair with a student leaves him jobless and shunned by his community, he retreats to the rural farm of his daughter.  Here he hopes to reconnect and rebuild the last important relationship of his life.  A horrific tragedy occurs while David is on the farm resulting in an even great distance between father and daughter.<br />While tragedy and circumstance can yeild a multitude of varying reactions, I struggled with David and daughter Lucy's choices.  They seemed trapped by and resigned to what lay before them.  I was eager to find a sense of hope by the novel's end, but was instead struck by its emptiness.  While the book is good, it is not uplifting and not for everyone.	2001-08-05

There's Bradley, the coffee shop owner, his two ex wives and their lovers; Chloe and Oscar the adventurous gen-xers with an uncontainable love; and Harry and Esther, Bradley's neighbors who mourn the son that has walked out of their lives.  <br />This cast of characters is insightful, yet unknowing, and is always learning, hopeful and searching for the tables from which they can consume their feast.

True the examples are rather simplistic.  It's a parable folks. And while there is nothing hugely revolutionary about the book, what it does provide are reminders on how to embrace change and follow the cheese (change), or become immobilized by fear and, thus, stagnant. <br />The two main characters, Hem and Haw, really drive the point home of how we should all try to be.  We all know we are supposed to be more like Haw, but isn't funny how easy it is to get comfortable with our life, our work and how angry or fearful we can become when change occurs?  Through Hem - and there a lot of Hem's in the world - you realize how utterly ridiculous it is to not work with change, roll with the punches and go with the flow.  <br />No matter where you are you will experience change -- that is the only constant we can expect.  So learn how to cope with it, manage it and learn from it.	2001-06-14

As in Come to Me, Bloom writes without judgement, simply sharing pain, hope, fear and love felt by ordinary people. Her language is exquisite and her stories memorable. My favorites of the collection include:<br />Stars at Elbow and Feet - After the loss of a child a woman, not feeling worthy of life, finds a new reason to live. <br />Hold Tight - The story of father and daughter reconnecting after cancer takes the family's wife and mother.<br />The Gates are Closing - A man asks his lover, not his wife, to help him end his battle with Parkinson's disease.<br />Despite the grim circumstances these characters are under, Bloom has a way through her luminescent prose of bringing hope and peace to both the characters and the reader. If you pick this up, which I highly recommend, make sure you read Come to Me first. Two of Bloom's most compelling characters in Come to Me, Lionel and Julia, make a repeat performance in this second collection and provide closure to their long-held secret.	2001-06-10

Peggy Cort and James Sweatt are at first an unlikely pair, but through closer investigation of their relationship it appears they are a perfect match.  McCracken has crafted a delightfully unique story that will not be soon forgotten.  I can't say much more for fear of spoiling the secret of this hidden gem of a book.	2000-12-08

Her column was always witty.  Always insightful.  Imagine my delight, when I heard her interviewed on NPR.  Listening to her talk about Come to Me had me severly intrigued and I purchased it that afternoon.  What a fascinating look at relationship dynamics -- I read it in a few hours.  Her stories offer no apologies, only unflinching honesty.  You often feel like you have happened upon people you shouldn't be overhearing as they work through their grief, anomisity, anger and fear.  If you can read it with the open-mindedness Ms. Bloom intended, you will have read one of the best short story collections out there.	2000-12-08

The first chapter reads like a poets dream -- not mine, mind you.  Thank goodness I didn't give up.  Janet Finch's novel is a breathtaking account of mother/daughter dysfunction.  Finch's words maintained a sensual rhythm as they wove the tragic story of a daughter's physical abondonment and emotional entrapment by her mother who is sent to prison for murder.  <br />I felt maternal toward Astrid as she stumbled through the foster care system cheering her accomplishments, cringing at her missteps and experiencing heartache at the various levels of abuse she received by her mother, the system and her changing environments.<br />I recommend this read to anyone looking to experience one of today's best writers tell a devestatingly beautiful story.	2000-10-04

Karr is able to tell her tale in the most conversational tone I have encountered...I often wondered if I wasn't experiencing the events with her!  Her prose is engaging. Simultaneously, she makes you laugh out loud while putting an ache in your heart.  I highly recommend this worthwile read.	2000-09-25
