I found the cartoons and the text a little too simple and hokey for my tastes, but they do get the idea across. The authors concept is that you should respect your children and that if you phrase your requests in the right way you'll get less complaints and whining. Some of the examples are sorely outdated -- based on the at-home, baking-cookies kind of mom and non-involved dad. No real examples for step-families or single parent families. If you're looking for a good book on positive, encouraging parenting that's a little more in-depth and current try these: Positive Parenting OR Kid Cooperation.	2001-07-14

I like to have my kids listen to me the first time I tell them to do something. When one of my kids is having a public tantrum I want  it to stop NOW, not after I give three warnings. There's something stange  about calmly saying &quot;Thats 1.&quot; to a child who is engaged in  intentional misbehavior. It's like saying &quot;You have three more  warnings before you have to stop.&quot; I also think that kids need to  learn from their mistakes. Saying &quot;That's two&quot; doesn't teach  anything. I'd rather use more descriptive explaining so they can learn how  to behave in the future.

He's an everyday kid - a  bit unsure of himself, he makes mistakes, but he also makes good decisions.  He has friends, but there are also kids who don't like him. He's average  looking, a bit clumsy and wears glasses. He has courage, but he also gets  scared. This ordinary kid gets to have extraordinary adventures. And even  after goof-ups and enemies along the way - he always ends up successful in  reaching his main goals - which are always for the greater good. These  books are also packed with creative imagination that kids love: life-sized  chess pieces that move themselves, invisibility cloaks, magic pets, secret  passageways with mysterious passwords. Harry Potter books have enough  mystery, intrigue and adventure to keep my 8-year-old ball-of-energy  enthralled enough to sit still no matter how long I read - and always  begging for more. Yet the books are fascinating to my 12-year-old bookworm  who re-reads them numerous times.	2000-03-11

It's set up in a very easy to read way. The indexing, blocked sections, pictures and clearly bolded titles make it easy to find what you're looking for. Dr. Sears is  best known for his position on Attachment Parenting - so if that method of  parenting is not your style then take from those sections only what you  feel good about, since everything else is helpful to all parents. In the  preceding review the reader states \\"Most Doctors are against the things he  suggests\\"  I don't think so. According to this book, Dr Sears' 5 attachment  tools are 1- Connect with your baby. 2 - Respond to your baby's cues 3 -  Breastfeed your baby (Science supports that this is best for baby)  4 -  Wear your baby (in other words, carry him often) 5 - Share sleep with your  baby.  I'm willing to bet that the only point any Pediatrician would \\"be  against\\" would be co-sleeping - and as Sears clearly says in his book  on  page 7 - \\"Wherever you and your baby sleep best is the right arrangement  for you, and it's a very personal decision.\\"	2000-02-26

I expected psycho-babble from a PhD and an MD - but was delightfully surprised with a down-to-earth, realistic book. I agree with the authors basic premise that we need to be positive, loving parents to raise great  kids. The authors do an outstanding job in the area of infants, babies and  preschoolers, HOWEVER, I think they fall short for older children. The  ideas are waayyy to permissive for me! Page 184 - if your child doesn't  like a certain chore - don't make him do it; if he has an 'off' day let him  skip his chores. Page 185 - If your 7-yr-old son fusses over taking a bath  - let him bathe only conce a week. (that'd be one seriously dirty kid!) Pg  199 - if your child is a bad sport, stop the game and play something else  with him. These ideas seem to put 'immediate gratification' over life-long  discipline - which I think is a big mistake. If you agree with the author's  basic ideas but want a better guide to positive discipline try these books:  Kid Cooperation, Perfect Parenting, Positive Discipline.	2000-01-11
