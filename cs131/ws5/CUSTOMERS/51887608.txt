To Kill A Mocking Bird was by far the best book I read this year. Harper Lee has extrordinary talent that could be identified as soon as you've even finished the first page. The small southern town where the story took place  was the home of bigotry and all forms of racism. The two children in the  story, Jem and Scout lived so innocently. After I finished the book I  finall realized that Tom Robinson symbolixed the Mockingbird who harms  knowone and therefore should mot be killed.	1999-06-04
