While the MO is all the same - bodies bitten by hybrid wolf-dogs, heads sliced off and set away from the body- discovering a motive or the killer has been unsuccessful.  However, as the two agents are drawn further into the search for answers, they find there is a larger evil at work.<br /><br />In Israel, an ancient society of antichrist supporters have raised up Luco Scaramuzzi to power.  Claiming he is the Antichrist, Luco has convinced the group to back him up in his crusade to become the ultimate authority - and evil- of the world.  He will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  Though the shocking murders and this dangerous sect seem to have nothing in common, the connection is still there - it just has to be discovered.<br /><br />Comes a Horseman was an intense novel that kept me at the edge of my seat almost the whole time.  If you love authors Ted Dekker and Frank Peretti, you'll almost certainly enjoy reading this book.  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more from the author, Robert Liparulo.	2005-10-11

Together the two work to unravel the mystery surrounding the deaths of her fellow missionaries and stop the killer that pursues her.<br /><br />In Sheep's Clothing is a fast paced thriller that keeps you involved the whole way through.

Older brother Luke Delaney had mysteriously disappeared six years earlier and nobody had seen him since.  After Luke's best friend, Nick, is injured by an unknown shooter, Angel suspects that whoever was behind her brother's disappearance has resurfaced again.<br /><br />As Good As Dead, the third book in the Angel Delaney Mystery series, was not quite as interesting as Deadly Aim (book 1), although I liked it more than Dying to Kill (book 2).  I've really enjoyed following this series, as I've always been liked mystery novels that focus around the female detective type.  Definitely a recommended read for mystery lovers.	2005-10-07

Her world immediately starts spinning out of control as the incident quickly draws the attention of the media.  Even more devastating for Angel is finding out later the gun the boy had pointed at her was in actuality a toy gun.<br /><br />With the media portraying her in the most unflattering light, Angel starts looking for answers.  Investigating the incident is Police Detective Callen Riley.  With important evidence from the shooting scene gone missing and facts not adding up, Callen believes there might be more to what happened than meets the eye.  Together Angel and Callen team up to solve this mystery.<br /><br />Deadly Aim by Patricia Rushford was a great start to a promising series.  Angel's role as a female officer made the book especially enjoyable for me.  The twists and turns throughout the book kept it interesting and suspenseful.  This book is definitely a recommended mystery novel.	2005-10-07

When Will's partner is killed before they can intercept a package needed to help a defecting general, he's left to find it on his own.  Unfortunately, the package comes in the form of General Nazar's teenage daughter.  Escaping Hayata, Fadima Nazar is hiding somewhere in the woods running from the pursuing terrorists.<br /><br />As a Search and Rescue worker, Dannette Lundeen, finds herself involved with finding a young girl who has been reportedly lost in the woods.  Complicating Dani's search is an annoying reporter, Will, who insists on teaming up with her to look for the girl.  Despite her mistrust of Will, she allows him to help as they race against time to find Fadima.  Although Will feels bad about keeping Dani in the dark about his real reasons for aiding her, as well as his real job, he knows that saving the girls life depends on his silence...<br /><br />Escape to Morning, the second book in the Team Hope series, was a very enjoyable read.  Susan May Warren once again delivers a romantic suspense novel that keeps you engaged the whole way through.  I'm always excited when I see she has come out with a new book.  I don't think Warren has written a book that I didn't like yet.	2005-10-05

It seems that every time Cass Claxton and Susanne McCord meet, tempers clash and trouble ensues.  When Cass refuses to take her to an aunt's house in Saint Louis, Susanne resorts to trickery.  Claiming that Cass has ruined her, her father forces Cass to marry Susanne despite his protests of innocence.  Furious, Cass takes her to Saint Louis and leaves, assuming she would quickly have the marriage annulled.  Unfortunately, Susanne believed that he would be taking care of that.<br /><br />Six year later, Cass and Susanne meet again.  Susanne has taken charge of the nine children her aunt took care of in her orphanage.  When her aunt dies and the house is taken away from her, Susanne finds that she needs the help of Cass.  When the two discover that they are still married to each other, she agrees to sign the annulment papers in exchange for him to escort her and the children to Kansas, where her father lived.  But what neither expects is that their journey might lead both to have a change of heart.<br /><br />I loved reading this third book in the Men of the Saddle series.  The Maverick is just as good a book as the previous two, which I also highly recommend.  As usually, Lori Copeland has created an excellent novel with well developed characters and the right combination or romance and humor that you are sure to enjoy reading.	2005-10-04

A year after the events of The Joiner King, the threat of Dark Nest has appeared again.  Sent to investigate, the Skywalkers and Solos visit the Utegeta Nebula, the new home of the Killiks.  Confronting UnaThul with their concerns with Dark Nest, things go unexpectedly wrong when they find themselves accused of aiding in the mysterious attacks on Killiks nests.  Han and Luke stay behind to look into the source of the attacks and find more answers about Dark Nests, while Mara and Leia are sent back.<br /><br />Summoned by Queen Mother Tenel Ka to Hapes, Jacen Solo finds he is responsible to protect a special secret that she reveals to him.  An attack by the former queen of Hapes in alliance with Dark Nest, alerts him to danger they face.  Jacen is also the recipient of visions that show the looming disaster of another galactic war.<br /><br />The Unseen Queen was an excellent second book in the Dark Nest series.  The pace was a little slower than in the Joiner King but that's normal for a middle book.  I love the way Denning has added the scenes where Luke discovers the recordings R2 has of Anakin and Padme.  Leia's involvement in a more Jedi capacity has also been great to see.  I'm looking forward to reading the final book in Dark Nest, The Swarm War.	2005-10-01

He seeks Togira Ikonoko (the Cripple Who is Whole) who has promised him answers to questions.  Before he can leave, however, the Varden leader, Ajihad, is killed during a surprise attack.  To keep the Varden from chaos, Eragon find himself dealing with political intrigue as different power factions attempt for control and power.<br /><br />Back in Carvahall, Roran is working to rebuild a life after his father's horrible murder.  He is understandably angry with Eragon for his part in Garrow's death.  When the Ra'zac return to Carvahall, he is caught in a battle of his own against the Empire.  Roran is forced to fight to save not only himself, but also the people in his town, including the woman he loves- Katrina.<br /><br />In Eldest, the book's focus is not only on Eragon as in the first.  His cousin, Roran, is given a part of the story, as well, with his adventures after Eragon left.  The tone of Eldest was a little different from Eragon, sadder and darker, though the style of writing that I enjoyed in Eragon is still the same.  I assume that this is the intended effect, to set up for a climatic conclusion in the final book.  Those who loved Eragon will also be delighted with Christopher Paolini's second book in the Inheritance Trilogy, Eldest.	2005-08-24

As a 22-year-old bookstore owner, when she's not running her business she reads suspense and mystery novels.  Then on one stormy night, Kathy meets Ben Tilman, a pastor, to whom she is immediately attracted.  Despite first thinking Kathy too young and bold,  Ben also finds himself drawn to the cheerful, yet sometimes painfully unsubtle, woman.<br /><br />I haven't read the book this particular Jane Austin spin-off is from (Northanger Abbey) so I can't say how well Northpointe Chalet follows the original.  However, I personally found this book as well written as all of Debra White Smith's previous Austin Series books.  First Impressions (Pride and Prejudice) will always be my favorite in this series but Northpointe Chalet has become my second choice.	2005-08-13

All he has to do is convince billionaire (and nemesis) Victor Van Doom, to help him reach a cosmic storm in order to observe it.  While Victor agrees to the use of his private space station, the price is almost all profit made from this research.  On the space station, Reed and the rest of his team: best friend, Ben Grimm; ex-girlfriend, Susan Storm; her hotshot brother, Johnny Storm; as well as Doom himself, are shocked when something goes amiss and everyone is exposed to the cosmic storm.<br /><br />Back on Earth, they discover that the cloud has altered their DNA, giving each a type of super power.  Reed, Susan, Ben, and Johnny band together in an effort to analyze what has happened to them and find a way to reverse the effects.  Mr. Fantastic: Reed has the ability to stretch and contort his body.  The Invisible Woman: Susan can make herself invisible and create an energy shield.  The Human Torch: Johnny is able to go up in flames- literally- and fly.  The Thing: Ben is now rock-hard and has superhuman strength.  Unfortunately, Van Doom has also been given powers, and unlike the others, decided to use them for evil.  Now he is bent on revenge for the loss of power the cosmic storm fiasco caused and will do anything to destroy Reed and the rest of the `Fantastic Four'.<br /><br />While the Fantastic Four novelization was not up to the same level as others have been, it was still a good read.  There were a couple discrepancies between the book and movie, which was a little annoying.  The storyline itself focused on how the FF got their powers and why they became a team more than anything else.  The book makes the characters seem a little more real, which I liked.	2005-08-13

With the help of Danae, Vartan fights against not only physical but also spiritual enemies as well.  Lessons of courage and faith will be learned as they face dangers together, in their quest to save the land of Gadiel and obey the tasks Athan has set before them.<br /><br />Kathleen Morgan's new fantasy 'Giver of Roses' is an excellent novel, surpassing any of her other books I've read.  People who enjoy authors like Karen Hancock, Donita Paul, or Bryan Davis will certainly find this book to their liking.  The ending of the first book in the Guardians of Gadiel series has left me eagerly awaiting the next.  A praiseworthy beginning with the anticipation of more to come.	2005-08-12

In her mind, Antonia relives her life in Sonoma and the reason she left her beloved home with her husband, Marco Michelli.<br /><br />Unforgotten by Kristen Heitzmann is an excellent sequel to `Secrets'.  I love the characters of Rese and Lance, who are complete opposites.  Lance is unreserved with his affections and undaunted by the difficulties life throws him.  Rese tries to always stay cool under pressure and keeps all her emotions bottled up inside until they explode.  I've enjoyed all of Heitzmann's books, but I would say that Secret and Unforgotten are my favorites.	2005-08-06

Teaming up with EuroNet newscaster, Hunz Vonner, the two will work together to find the force behind these shocking attacks.<br /><br />The idea behind Death Watch (the spiritual aspect) was interesting, though unexpected.  Based on the summary on the back cover, I was prepared for more of a psycho-thriller type story line, which ended up not being the case.  Instead, the emphasis was more on a spiritual attack rather than anything of this world.

The new government, the Galactic Alliance is working, along with the Jedi community, to restore war-ravaged worlds and bring back peace and order to the galaxy.  In the midst of these efforts comes an unusual cry for help through the Force, heard by only a select few Jedi Knights.  Hearing this strange call, eight Jedi have departed for the Unknown Regions.  Tahiri and Tekli leave their work on Zenoma Sekot; Jaina, Zekk, Lowbacca, Alema, and Tezar discontinue their assignments from the Jedi Council; and even Jacen has ended his journey in search for the meaning of the Force to answer the call.<br /><br />Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Jedi Council are uncertain why the Jedi have left their current duties to go on an unsanctioned mission of their own.  When the Chiss come to the Galactic Alliance to demand an explanation for a group of Jedi becoming involved in a Chiss border dispute, the government asks to Council to investigate.  Concerned, Luke, Mara, and Saba, with 8-year-old Ben Skywalker in tow, go to the Chiss border.  Worrying about their children, Han and Leia also join the Jedi Masters to look into these claims.  There they find more than they bargained for, including an amazing revelation connected to the Myrkr mission (from NJO: Star by Star) to destroy the voxyn queen.<br /><br />The Star Wars universe continues with another exciting series, featuring the characters from the New Jedi Order.  The story quickly plunges into the adventure and continues the whole way through with a fast pace plot.  Luke, Han, and Leia are given a large part of the story- good to see these characters back in action again.  I haven't bought into the new `enlightened' view of the Force (no absolutes- dark and lights are relative) but this isn't talked about in-depth.  The Joiner King was very interesting and enjoyable to read.  I'm looking forward to seeing what the author does in the next book, which promises to be just as exciting.exciting.	2005-08-01

Blinded by ignorance, the town of Woodend is unprepared by the assault of evil.  Yet despite their grave danger, the people of Woodend seem oblivious of what is exactly happening or how pivotal the survival of their small town truly is.  Once before they had fought against evil and gained a partial victory, but the enemy has amassed itself and is striking again.  The enemy, the Shieth, know that the prophesy must not be allowed to be fulfilled in order to defeat Woodend.<br /><br />Woodend's governor, Willerdon, is on the verge of resigning and the townspeople are becoming increasingly restless and agitated.  It seems unlikely that anyone will arise with the strength and courage to resist the enemy as the Shieth lord, Wrathar, sends his evil servants to take over the town.  However, in these troubled times, the King of Arvalst has sent his messenger, Gildareth, to Woodend to aid the town and its inhabitants.<br /><br />Shadows in Woodend by Peter Dudek was a well-written book.

It most definitely is not for the moderate reader or someone with a short attention span.  While The Silmarillion ended up not being quite as hard to get through as I was expected, it did still consume a good deal of time.  The beginning took the most effort to read, but after that, I found the Silmarillion very fascinating.<br /><br />If you're interested in getting an in-depth look on how Middle Earth came to be, where elves, dwarves, and men came from, or how certain events or peoples pertain to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Silmarillion is a wealth of information for anyone who will read the book.<br /><br />It also shows how much time and thought J.R.R. Tolkien spent on his imaginary world of Middle Earth.  The book has a very well documented history of Middle Earth from before it's creation to a brief summary of the events of the LotR books.  Everything makes sense and fits together in a way no other fantasy has ever come close to doing.  The Silmarillion is a highly recommended read for those who also love Tolkien's writings.	2005-07-10

Shoshannah, the daughter of Karen and Zekaryah, has grown up with belief of her parents in the Most High God and loves to hear the stories I'ma-Annah tells her of before and during the Great Flood.  However, she was unaware of the enemies her mother made years earlier when Karen was involved in the death of Great King Nimr-Rada.<br /><br />When Shoshannah goes to visit relatives, leaving behind Kaleb, the man she plans to be betrothed to, Karen finally warns her daughter of the danger of going to the Great City. Both Karen's sister, Sharah, and brother, Ra-Anan, would like nothing better than to kill Karen.  Nevertheless, events force Shoshannah to go through the Great City and her cruel relatives take her captive.<br /><br />A Crown in the Stars is a bittersweet finish to an excellent trilogy.  It was very sad to see the falls of mankind, first with the Flood and then the Tower of Babel, through the eyes of the three women: Annah, Karen, and Shoshannah.  Each of their stories were beautifully written and seemed so realistic.	2005-06-30

When his hesitation during a mission causes his best friend to be wounded, Jason gets out of the military and searches for a new job.<br /><br />He finds one in the billionaire CEO of defense contractor ABL Corp., Eloise Webster.  She is organizing a team of specialized experts to go into dangerous situations, using only non-lethal weapons to accomplish the mission and insuring no casualties.  While it takes convincing, Jason joins as team leader and begins training with the other members of Team Firebrand.  The rest of the team includes Rachel, language specialist/con artist; Trieu, sniper/doctor; Lewis, computer and electronics expert; Garth, former Green Beret/explosives and escape-and-evasion specialist; Chris, former Marine Force Recon/point man.<br /><br />Operation Firebrand was an interesting, intense read.  The plot was well-thought out, though slightly unbelievable.  The constant restating of the fact Team Firebrand would use only non-lethal weapons did get tiring, as did the rather negative attitude toward lethal weapons but it wasn't blatant enough to make the book not enjoyable.  I look forward to reading the next book in this series.	2005-06-28

This discovery soon has an unknown force after him and the now hatched dragon, Saphira. When the enemy kills his uncle, Eragon and Saphira begin a long trek across Alagaesia to hunt down and destroy them. Coming along with the two is Brom, a historian who will teach Eragon to become a powerful Dragon Rider. He also will educate them on who their enemy is: a former Dragon Rider who betrayed and destroyed the legendary group before becoming the ruler of Alagaesia. Brom warns the duo that they will soon have to make the choice weather to join King Galbatorix or fight against him with the Varden.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading Eragon and was interested to know it was written by a teenager, which I thought was really cool. Eragon wasn't as great as Lord of the Rings was, but it definitely has the right idea. I am looking forward to reading the second book in The Inheritance trilogy, Eldest, when it comes our later this year.	2005-06-24

Sammy Kidman is planning to go with his wife, Marni, her parents, and the parents' pastor for what is supposed to be a quiet and relaxing fishing trip to Lake Texoma- with the operative words being 'quiet and relaxing'.  Wishful thinking?  Yes.  Trouble follows Sammy wherever he goes- even on vacation.<br /><br />Vacation is put on hold when problems in a nearby town, Bastion, have Sammy posing as a producer, come to create a documentary of the fair town of Bastion, Oklahoma.  Using his charisma, acting ability, and skills of persuasion, Sammy pulls off the ploy with an amazing performance.  Yet despite how well this goes, it also causes Marni irritation as well.  As time wears on, her patience with Sammy's affected `flirting' wears thin and he finds himself dealing with a very irate wife.<br /><br />Robin Hardy did a very good job with this fourth book in the Sammy series.  There was more character development in this book than in the previous two Sammy books.  Marni's parents were especially given a larger part in the story.  I love how the book has so much humor in the face of disaster.  This is definitely a recommended read for all Robin Hardy fans.	2005-06-22

The Rising was an okay novel- as far as prequels go-, but all it really does is show you how Nicolae Carpathia came about and tells you a little bit about Rayford Steele when he was younger.  There wasn't much excitement and the book could have been written in half the length it was.  As  far as I can see, this book will only be enjoyed by the hardcore Left Behind readers.	2005-06-11

The whole crazy adventure starts when Reed and Beck Shelton go on a trip to get away from the pressures of life.  Reed is hoping that it will give Beck more self-confidence and she is just going along to placate him.  Neither expects to spend a terrifying night in the woods, during which Beck is taken captive by a nameless `thing'.  Now Reed and others are racing against time to find his wife before it's too late, while trying to discover just what- or who- the 'monster' is.<br /><br />While Monster was an interesting read, I wouldn't say it was up to the same level of intensity as most of Frank Peretti's books.  I found there were no mind-blowing revelations or totally unexpected twists.  However, even if it's not his best novel, this was a good book and I still enjoyed reading it.	2005-06-10

With the apartment's owner, Taylor Franks, missing, Mick is the perfect suspect with no alibi and obvious opportunity.  To prove his innocence, Mick will flee from the police in his own attempt to discover the truth.<br /><br />Mick and his brother Aaron have had their share of differences, mainly being Aaron getting engaged with Mick's former girlfriend and Mick's lack of faith in God.  However, when his brother is in trouble, Aaron will to his best to help him out.<br /><br />As a prequel to 'The Splitting Storm' by Rene Gutteridge, 'Storm Gathering' takes us back in Mick's past to before he became a special agent for the FBI. While the prequel was not up to the same level of intensity as Splitting Storm was, it still was an exciting read that is sure to be enjoyed.	2005-06-06

Billy Bannister and his fellow dragon comrades, Bonnie Silver and Ashley, are thrust into another adventure when they travel to England.  They soon are faced with new enemies in the deadly New Table Knights and Morgan Le Faye.  Billy and Bonnie enter a new dimension called the Circles of Seven- on account of there being seven circles they will be required to go through- while Ashley, Walter, and the Professor do their best to help them from the outside.<br /><br />In the Circles, things are not always what they seem and danger constantly surrounds Billy and Bonnie.  Guided only with the words of Merlin's poems, the courageous duo will face their greatest trials yet.<br /><br />The third installment in the Dragons in Our Midst series takes the story to new heights with increased intensity as it nears the final book, Tears of a Dragon.  I love these books, especially because of the Christian values and themes that are hard to find in most fantasy.  This series has exceeded all my expectations and is one of my absolute favorites in Christian fantasy.	2005-06-06

Both rub each other wrong and despite a minor attraction for the other, both will do their best to keep their distance. However, circumstances throw them together when Eddi and Dave volunteer for an reenactment of the play `Pride and Prejudice' their town is putting on.  Because of their mutual stubbornness preventing either from withdrawing, they find themselves having to work together as Eddi is given the part Elizabeth and Dave the part of Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />First Impressions, a modern retelling of Jane Austin's classic novel 'Pride and Prejudice', is the first book in The Austin Series by Debra White Smith.  While I love them all so far, this one is absolute favorite.  She captured exactly how I imagine the story would have gone if it truly had been written in this period of history instead.	2005-06-02

However, everything goes completely wrong when Ethan brings home a female friend, Carrie Casper, and her brother Hugh.  While distrusting the motives of the two, Francine also has to battle intense jealousy of the close relationship that Ethan and Carrie are beginning to have.  Suddenly aware of all her shortcomings, especially in light of the beauty and sophistication of Carrie, Francine begins to doubt that she will ever have the love of Ethan<br /><br />As I've always loved Jane Austin's classic novels, I found these modern retellings of her stories to be wonderful reads.  While my favorite so far has been First Impressions, Central Park is an excellent addition to Debra Smith White's The Austin Series.  Though a little harder to read than the previous two books, it has the same charm and appeal that makes them very enjoyable to read.	2005-06-02

While having serious misgivings, Bonnie agrees to go with him to a secret lab in Montana in an attempt to help her mother.<br /><br />I love the Dragons in out Midst books, they are so good.  They have dragons, knight, sword-to-sword battles, and fair maidens in need of rescuing.  I haven't been able to find many Christian fantasy series but this one is definitely worth reading.	2005-04-22

As pretty much everyone knows this is the one where Anakin becomes Darth Vader, so it's a given that this was a very dark book, more so than any other Star Wars book I've ever read.<br /><br />I think it's worth saying that there was almost no mention of Chewbacca and the wookies.  Based on this, it looks like the role of the wookies has been severly exaggerated, which is a huge disappointment to me since that was something I was looking forward to in the movie.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is a great book that I'm sure you'll enjoy reading.	2005-04-19

Even though he believes she killed her husband and was a traitor to her country, Micah unwillingly comes to Lacey's aid, only to be drawn into her world of espionage and covert ops.  A world more dangerous than he imagined.<br /><br />Flee the Night had a good plot but many times I felt it didn't flow together the way it should have.

Fear is his constant companion. He fears for those he loves, especially his secret wife, Padme Amidala. Dark secrets are revealed and loyalties are pushed to the breaking point. His love and dreams are falling apart before his eyes.  No longer does he feel he can trust those he's considered his closest friends. He isn't even sure anymore the side he has been fighting for in the Clone War is the right side.<br /><br />Revenge of the Sith doesn't start out very dark, with lively banter between Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi, but as it progressed I found it to be the darkest, saddest, definitely the most emotional Star Wars book I've ever read.  It was obviously one of the more difficult books to write but I think Matthew Stover did an excellent job.<br /><br />As a hardcore Star Wars fan I found everything I would want in this book: the greatest lightsaber duals ever dreamed up; enough built up suspense to drive a person nuts; an in-depth look at all the characters in the book, from the small role of Count Dooku to the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious; and a climax to end all climaxes. However, I do think that a Star Wars fan of any level could enjoy it and won't become very confused if they haven't read all the book between Episode II and III.	2005-04-02

She is going to kill Cass Claxton for leaving her at the alter and taking off with all her money. When her stagecoach is robbed near her destination, she meets Cole and Beau, who unbeknownst to her are Cass' brothers. Cole and Wynne immediately take a dislike to each other when the brothers try to help the people on the stagecoach and she points a gun at their heads, thinking they are more robbers. The feelings continue as events keep putting them together. Cole's manners irritate Wynne, 'pompous idiot' she called him, and her lack of common sense aggravates Cole, 'addlebrained and careless' was his description.<br /><br />After finishing this first book in the Men of the Saddle series, I am looking forward to reading the next one.  The Peacemaker was a very enjoyable read and I recommend it to those that like Christian western romance books.<br /><br />~~~~Rebekah~~~~	2005-03-17

When Billy accidentally sets off the bathroom fire systems at school because of it, he realizes he can't conceal his problem any longer. That's when Billy's parents drop the bomb: his dad is a former dragon that has been living in human form for hundreds of year- not the sort of thing a guy is expecting to find out!<br /><br />The bathroom episode has other serious repercussions too. Billy and his family's dragon heritage has been revealed to the dangerous sect of the dragon slayers who- as the name suggests- are out to kill all the dragons pretending to be humans as well as their children.<br /><br />I love to read fantasy, but there seems to be so little of it in the Christian market.

The novel is set in the early nineteenth century England, during a time that society had three distinct classes: the rich and powerful, the working people, and the tradesmen.<br /><br />While the characters personalities in the book seem exaggerated to make there qualities or faults more obvious, Eliot's detailed descriptions of the people made it easy to create a mental picture of them. Though the book is well written, the style of language makes it hard to read and even harder to understand. I found I had to read it more then once and spend time thinking it through to get to the point of enjoying it. Silas Marner has many valuable moral and lessons in it, the most important one being that people are worth more than gold.	2005-02-21

This book emphasizes the importance in believing the Bible is 100% true. Trying to make evolution and the Bible agree results in deciding the Bible is totally false.<br /><br />I thought the many points made in this book were well thought out and accurate.

Watching a chance meeting between Kat and a known smuggler from an organization that has been stealing from Russia, FSB Agent Vadeem Spasonov believes that she has a connection with the group and takes her in for questioning. Deciding to use her to distract Vadeem, the smuggling group helps Kat to escape so she can continue to search for her families past. Vadeem chases after her, now sure she is part of the illegal group, and finds Kat just in time to save her from an attempt on her life.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book so much. It has adventure, mystery, and romance. The whole plot was well written and all the characters were well developed. The romance between Kat and Vadeem was especially great. It wasn't overdone to the point of ridiculously sappy, like some books, but was simply sweet. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this series, Nadia, which appears to be about Ekaterina's mother.	2005-02-14

Together they follow Darth Sidious' trail, hoping to finally unmask and destroy the Sith Lord that has caused such turmoil in the galaxy.<br /><br />This is not your typical Star Wars novel. The style is different from most and the story itself is not the normal plot. However, I found this novel to be very interesting. As the prequel to the greatly anticipated Revenge of the Sith movie, Labyrinth of Evil is written more like a middle book to bridge the gaps between Episode ll and Episode lll. It shows the changes that have taken place in the Republic and the control over the galaxy that Darth Sidious has established. Also shown is the newest Star Wars villain, General Grievous.<br /><br />Labyrinth of Evil mentions people and places from previous novel throughout the book, which can be a little confusing for those who are not up to date with all the Star Wars books. Those who are, however, will enjoy how well this prequel fits with all the Clone Wars books. After reading this novel, I am more excited than ever to see Episode lll and I recommend this as a must-have for all Star Wars fans.	2005-01-31

In Ted Dekker's novel 'Obsessed' we meet Stephen Friedman and Roth Braun who are about to find out. Stephen is a wealthy Jewish immigrant who came to America from an orphanage in Russia. Having searched to years with no success, he has come to believe the mother he never knew is lost forever. Roth, the son of a Nazi Commandant, is determined to finish what his father started decades ago in a Nazi labor camp, no matter what the cost.<br /><br />The adventure begins when an article in a newspaper convinces Stephen that he is the son of Rachel Spritzer, who had recently died, leaving behind one of the very valuable Stones of David, believed to be one of the five Stones chosen by David to kill the giant Goliath. Obsessed with finding the rest of the Stones, Stephen will go to any lengths to secure the treasure and discover his past. To complicate matters, Roth has also learned of the Stones and is able to buy Rachel Spritzer's house before Stephen is able to. Convinced that clues to what they seek are hidden in her house, both men are working feverishly to find them before the other can.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Obsessed as a great read. As those who have read his books before would already know, Ted Dekker writes a novel that keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole time. The pages are filled with twists as unexpected as always, action, adventure, mystery, and a bit of romance. If you enjoy this is book, I'd also suggest Blink, Thr3e, and his Circle Trilogy.	2005-01-27

So many of their fellow Jedi are being sent on missions, never to return. Padawans regularly are losing their masters before they have learned enough to go on missions of their own.<br /><br />Dark Rendezvous is also really cool because we get to see a lot of other Jedi, including Yoda, that haven't been in other books. We also get to see Count Dooku and get into his mind. Anakin, Obi-wan, and Padme do appear briefly in a couple scenes but do not play an important role in the story.<br /><br />Dark Rendezvous is a great addition to the Clone Wars novels, and my personal favorite.	2004-12-16

Those that have drowned in the red lakes and put their trust in Justin and Elyon are free from the disease that still afflicts the Scabs. They are still hated by the Horde and the Scabs continue to try to kill Thomas.<br />  In our reality, the virus has been spread throughout the entire world. Using her brother's blood sample, Kara Hunter crosses over to the other reality where she shares minds with Mikil, Thomas's second in command.<br />  Like in the other two books, White is filled with unexpected twists. The story is incredible and almost believable in an amazing way. After reading White, I have to say this is one of the best series I have ever read. Every time I thought I had it figured out there was a new twist and I was left guessing again. Make sure you have plenty of time before you start this book because yet again Ted Dekker has written a book you can't put down.	2004-10-07

When I first got it I wasn't sure I'd like it but by the second chapter I loved it- and by the fifth chapter the house could have buned down around me and I wouldn't have noticed.  The next week, the other girls and I discussed it with our leader and we all said the same thing- it was an amazing book.	2004-07-13

They started out all wrong and neither were sure they like the other-which wasn't good since they are expected to get married very soon. It takes a lot to work out thier differences and it didn't help that Megan had a scheming sister who wanted nothing more than to cause Megan pain.	2004-07-09

Amazingly I actually liked it. Luke and all the rest looked like they were supposed to-not like in some Star Wars comic books.<br />I would have preferred a novel about Luke and Mara's wedding like Han and Leia's but I have to admit that this comic was okay. So for those that like comic books or those that just want this because it has Luke and Mara's wedding--get it!	2004-07-02

This book wasn't what I had expected for the last book in this series.It was so different from the other two books. The book was an allagory and was really good. Fletcher,Adair, and their son Daniel go on a trip to the town Beaconville in response to a letter Fletcher had recieved asking help from him. This book was sort of like the Narnian books by C.S. Lewis in that you can read it over and over again and always find something new. The ending was a little dissapointing because it didn't have a real ending like I had hoped for this book but I enjoyed reading it anyway.	2004-04-19
