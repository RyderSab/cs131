US	51701526	R1CA5HS4AJZQ7Q	0066214750	591611942	Twelve Times Blessed	Books	1	24	25	N	N	YUCK!	I have to agree with most of the previous reviews.  This one is a disappointing, incredibly long read that I plodded through without much enthusiasm.  The heroine, True, is a very immature woman who is impossible to like.  She continues to do incredibly self-destructive things, is a lousy mother to her so-called beloved son, and doesn't listen to a word anyone says.  She's condescending to everyone - including the medical professionals who saved her son's life.  Her so-called beloved, Hank, is equally a jerk.  But I didn't need 500 pages to find out that they deserve each other.  Even the minor characters were neither interesting nor likeable.  I have found Mitchard in the past, for example in her first book, to show a great insight into the issues and \\"voice\\" of adolescence - but I'm not sure she hits the mark with Guy - a pretty obnoxious kid. The adults in this story seem hell bent on [messing] him up as much as possible - his self-obsessed mother ignores his medical symptoms, slaps him across the face when he's in the hospital, talks about washing his mouth out with soap for swearing, and obviously emotionally drags him through hell and back during her ambivalent new marriage.  It's hard to like a heroine who supposedly is motherhood personified when she's such a jerk.  Finally, I don't understand this author's obsession with sexual issues and body fluids.  Much more information than I need to know - for example - who wants to hear about a 10 year old boy's balls flapping as he runs down the stairs?  Come on!	2003-05-01

I do find it fascinating that Mr. Richardson spends much of this book describing his own cognitive struggle with the concept of dwarfism - the historical information he shares about cosmetic beauty, the activism by individuals with disabilities, etc., is pretty interesting.  But Mr. Richardson is really approaching this with half a loaf here - for example, one does not have to be an investigative reporter or a therapist to realize that the sum of his relationship with Andrea is that she has an incredible crush on him.  Yet while he acknowledges his confusion about this &quot;friendship&quot; he is seemingly clueless about this issue - even when his wife points out that Andrea's demand for him to go into &quot;therapy&quot; with her is strange, he doesn't have an insightful moment of realizing what is going on here.  His detailed description of the situation with Jocelyn and her family is heart breaking, and echoes other similarly written accounts of how a child's disability and dependencies takes it toll on marriages and families. But by the end, we really are less empathic for the parties involved, and more stunned by the blinders they all have on....<BR> By focussing on some of the dysfunction here, though, I think he does a disservice to individuals living with dwarfism.  We are left looking at the problems, the dysfunction, rather than the function. There is no question that this is well written, and Mr. Richardson puts himself front and center in the book - examining his own values as if they were a microcosm of all of us &quot;talls&quot;.  But by limiting his &quot;stories&quot;, I think he does these folks a disservice.  For example, why not tell the story of a dwarf and family who HAS decided to have limb lengthening surgery - to look at the other side of the coin?  I'm not saying that the book must be comprehensive, but it's such an interesting subject - I feel shortchanged...	2002-10-14

It is getting really old to believe that Alex Delaware is stupid enough to run around sleuthing in such a bizarre way - following suspects in cars, arranging private meets on the beach, kayaking on the water to get a peek at an estate?  Come on!  What's interesting about this series is that he is a psychologist, often involved in forensic puzzles and complicated cases.  In this book, he's pretty much not working, but we are supposed to believe that he has some type of burning interest in pursuing a case of a girl he only saw twice as a teenager?  it's totally improbable...  No wonder his girlfriend decides she's had enough - so would anyone if they lived with him.  PS - the book is not well edited with several mistakes, and why does he keep saying, &quot;Confidentiality ends with death&quot;.... Confidentiality about what?

First of all, we're expected to buy that the very first and only hate group that Decker investigates after the synagogue trashing is the one involved with the crime and subsequent murders - and the first prep school he goes to after the crime turns out to yield the perpetrator.  Then the kid who does the crime ends up magically going to the therapist who ends up being linked to this hate group, etc. etc. etc.  And Decker's step son magically knows all of these people.  Wait a second, is this a small town?  I thought it was Los Angeles!  You expect some coincidences in mystery novels but this is just too much.  It's not a well-crafted novel, and although the familial relationships are still quite interesting and endearing (although Decker's love/distrust relationship with stepson is a bit overdone)...

I can't believe that many of the reviews for this book use the words &quot;well written&quot;.  I enjoy mystery, suspense, and intertwined romance like everyone else but this was lame, lame, lame.  The characters  were beyond superficial.  If you hadn't read the previous books by this  author which featured some of these characters, you were totally clueless  about Eve, her adopted daughter Jane, what happened to Bonnie, etc.  So you  felt like you were truly in the dark.  And the dog/wolf romance - come on!   The romance didn't sizzle, and the story line was preposterous.  I don't  think the attention this author is getting from the public is warranted.	2000-07-14

However, in these days of AIDS  and unsafe sex, it's interesting that Lucas runs into bed with Jael with no  sense of consequences - since she seems pretty indiscriminate about her  sexual partners...

The characters sizzle along, the plot is unusual and interesting, and the  resurrection of the love story which appeared doomed (stay tuned) was done  quite well...  I was happy that Gail seems to be acting more responsibly  and ethically and thus more believable - she is flawed, but not stupid...    One suggestion - the relationships of the various characters took awhile to  iron out, and other than the &quot;surprise&quot; one - perhaps it would  have been helpful to include a family &quot;tree&quot; in the opening pages  - it would have helped to focus on the story as it got going.....	2000-05-19

I have loved this series - from characters to plots to recipes (especially recipes!)  But I felt this book was not her best.  First of all, the same themes repeat themselves over and over again - Goldie's life is falling  apart.  In this case, the improbable issue of not being able to use her  home kitchen for catering because of inadequate drains is just absurd.   It's painted as a financial problem and then, miraculously, with no new  influx of cash, husband Tom takes a couple of days off from work and fixes  the problem!  Why did he take so long - was he enjoying washing the dishes  in the bathtub?  And if Goldie is so short of cash, why not take out a loan  from her best friend, Marla, who is loaded?  Then, protective police  husband Tom is not concerned that Goldie drives around Colorado in snow  storms with bald tires - ? And then, after an accident, just says &quot;be  careful&quot; when she goes out again?  This is so unrealistic and  unbelievable that I laughed out loud.  The plot was silly and contrived -  more than usual, and there is nothing new with Arch - same old stuff - and  Goldie has no new ways of handling him either - and I'm confused about the  time frame - they act like it's years since Arch's dad &quot;The Jerk&quot;  got incarcerated but has Arch gotten any older in this time?  Even the  recipes didn't excite me as much.  Come on, Diane, you can do better!	2000-03-23

As a long-time Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitzky fan, this series just gets better and better.  I just read the whole book during a snow day when I had better things to do, and I just couldn't put it down.  The characters are  familiar, and they've grown over the years, and Lescroart is so good at  making it clear why real people can't live happily ever after...  Dismas  has come a long way, and his character continues to have depth and be  interesting to observe.  But best of all - this is a great thriller, a real  page turner.  Lots of twists and turns, and interesting political and  social issues are represented all over the place.  He has a nice touch  writing about kids, about marriage, about relationships - okay, some of the  stuff here is a little far-fetched but it's a mystery novel, that's why we  read them.

Susan and Paul seem to be in it for the sex(and  we do have a couple of nice sex scenes, but where does he get off dumping  his kid there for days on end and why does Susan mysteriously have time to  take care of her when she seems pretty tapped out herself?- Susan's sense  of ethics are pretty strange, and much of the plot revolves around  this...the climax in Mexico is beyond believable in so many ways, and  the  &quot;surprise&quot; ending is a bit of a steal from Scott Turow's Presumed  Innocent but if you like a page turner.....	2000-01-31

But this book is a bit of a slow read, and I think it's disappointing to those who are  looking for twists and turns as in his other books.  I agree that this is  much more of a novel than a legal thriller.  One literary device I found  disconcerting was his use of a first person narrator, who is basically  anonymous as we know little or nothing about him although there are a few  not very satisfactory details, but then large sections of the book take  place without the narrator present.  I found this awkward and didn't feel  that it worked well.  Also, I didn't think Eton was particularly believable  nor did I find her story as it unfolded all that interesting - I kept  waiting for the big revelation which would make sense but it really wasn't  there.  I do offer a tip of the hat for Scott's very sensitive portrayl of  ALS(Lou Gehrig's disease); he obviously did a great deal of research and  this piece of the novel was very well drawn and empathic.  This was by far  the most interesting part of the book.	1999-11-03

This series is really a lot of fun, and the setting of a not-so-prosperous Philadelphia prep school, plus the relationship between Mandy and CK is well done.  This book didn't knock my socks off, and while it attempted to  reach into the dynamics of a relationship gone a bit awry, it was just a  little TOO unbelievable.  Mandy's mid-career angst - do i really want to be  an underappreciated, underpaid teacher - seemed real enough, but that she  would actually give up without a fight(initially) over the potential of  being sued by irate parents where there is absolutely no valid reason -  doesn't make sense.  Her overall depression and malaise - where did that  come from?  All seems well in the end - but maybe a little pre-marriage  counseling to seal the deal would make sense, or some Prozac for Mandy...   trying to get a real handle on who she is, and Roberts' balance between  humor and pathos - seems a little off.  Mandy resenting CK because he is  doing research about schizphrenia in regard to Mandy's student - what's up  with that?

Why is she constantly, on the air, inviting  individuals with evidence, to expose themselves publicly, making them  targets?  Why does she show no remorse when everyone gets killed?  Her  psychiatrist cohort violates the rules of confidentiality without a pause -  telling our heroine who he treated privately - what is that all about?

Yes, MHC writes trite, formula, suspense novels but at  least in the past, they might have been a smidgeon believeable.  This one  is beyond absurd.

The short story format within the novel was interesting, and at least progressed in a linear fashion, and Ms. Hoffman definitely writes beautiful, lyric prose.  However, the characters  just were amazingly depressing, especially because you could see how  impaired they were but no one did anything to reach out and help.

The plot, the characters, the settings, are all exquisitely  developed in perfect Irving-esque style - with humor, with pathos, with  love.

Fans of his Saratoga series are familiar with his wonderful sense of humor, great characters, and spectacular  mishaps, all surrounded by a great deal of local color.  This novel, like  his &quot;Church of the Dead Girls&quot;, is serious, haunting, and  mysterious, set in winter in New Hampshire, with predictable villains and a  great deal of foreshadowing.  This book reminds me a bit of a PD James  novel,(the snowy mountains instead of the foggy moors) not quite as thick,  and certainly with a New England twist. I enjoyed every minute of it, found  the characters likeable, believable, and interesting.  I loved the subtle  changes in the boarding school which Jim Hawthorne was able to implement  during his troubled first semester there, as evidenced by the scenes with  the students; Dobyns has an excellent eye and understanding for the  behavior patterns of abused kids.  This was a great read, and highly  recommended.  My only criticism is that the foreshadowing is a bit heavy,  the &quot;bad guys&quot; are pretty obvious even though our hero seems to  be oblivious, and the ending is a bit strange - we see the aftermath of the  climax of the novel through the eyes of a very minor and peripheral  character and there is no alternative wrap up.  An interesting literary  device, but I felt a little cheated.  Maybe foreshadowing of a sequel, Mr.  Dobyns?	1999-06-23

This latest entry in the Gail Connor series is a page turner at the very least, if only to watch the heroine get herself into deeper and deeper difficulties!  While loyal readers have been following the love story of  Gail and her Cuban fiance with excitement and passion(Ms. Parker does write  sex scenes that sizzle), one cannot help but groan each time Gail makes  incredibly dumb moves.  She is the epitome of gullibility, and it's hard to  admire her legal acumen; she seems to be marginally competent and pretty  unethical to boot.  Her 11 year old daughter's resiliency in the face of  more episodes of post traumatic stress than anyone could imagine in a  lifetime are beyond belief.  The plot is intricate and the twists and turns  are somewhat predictable, but the characters are pretty interesting, and  one wonders what will happen in the next installment.  But it's hard to  know who to root for at this point - whether it comes to raising her  daughter, taking care of her clients, or her future with men, Gail seems  pretty inept. I'm rooting for the daughter, but she better have a great  amount of resiliency cause she certainly isn't getting much parenting!    The glimpses into Miami/Cuban power and families is fascinating, and the  writing is crisp and evocative.  She sets the scene, and the characters  seem to develop from book to book, except for poor Gail who seems to be  regressing.  Hopefully, Gail will make some better decisions in the next  book - Please?	1999-05-27
