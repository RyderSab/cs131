Contrary to much that has appeared in the media, Kelley's biography is not a 'hatchet job', but rather a heavily documented popular history of the Bush family's rise to national prominence.<br /><br />Kelley covers the business activities of Samuel Prescott Bush and George Herbert Walker, whose entrepreneurial acumen brought the family into the first ranks of American enterprise, following with a close study of the political careers of Prescott Sheldon Bush, U.S. Senator from Connecticut; George H.W.<br /><br />Bush, the 41st U.S. President; and George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the U.S.  Kelley examines both the positive aspects and flaws of these men's personal and political lives, and leaves us with a better understanding of the social, policial and familial forces that shaped them.  There are juicy bits of scandal, yes, but the lasting impression is that these men are human beings, albeit flawed ones, rather than larger than life icons, a welcome portrayal in this age of bitter partisan division about the Bush presidency and the family's record.<br /><br />If you're looking for a readable page-turner, Kelley delivers. She provides a behind-the-scenes look at the marriages of Geroge and Bar and George W. and Laura, giving the reader a clear but compassaionate look at what it means to be a political wife in the Bush clan, and delineating where reality stops and myth begins.<br /><br />All told, a worthwhile and absorbing read that delivers much more than its critics would want you to believe.  Four stars.	2005-10-02

Steve Berry's 'Romanov Prophecy' will keep history buffs turning the pages to learn the outcome of this tale of the possible survival of the Romanov dynasty.  Berry's premise is tantalizing: what if the post-Soviet disintegration of Russian society led to an attempt to restore the tsar?  Who would come forward to claim the throne... and who might try to control the process?<br /><br />Berry's thriller is tautly plotted and written, with ingenious narrative twists and Uzi-like pacing.  The author's historical research has been thorough, and Berry artfully combines a depiction of the Romanovs' 1917 fall with legends of the dynasty's survival to produce a first-class read.<br /><br />History buffs will especially appreciate this five-star thriller-- recommended without reservation.	2005-08-31

In Father Joe, Tony Hendra has penned an autobiographical tale of human frailty, moral failure and possible redemption, told through the lens of the author's relationship with Father Joseph Warrilow, a Benedictine monk.<br /><br />Hendra meets Father Joe when he is just 16, dragged to Warrilow's monastery for a talking to by the cuckolded husband of a young mother with whom Hendra has embarked on a relatively chaste, if tormented, affair.  Warrilow, much to young Hendra's surprise, offers sage and sophisticated moral guidance and the boy's gratitude turns to admiration and enthusiasm for monastic life.<br /><br />Over the subsequent two years, Hendra begs to be allowed to join Warrilow's order, notwithstanding his winning of a place at Cambridge University.  He is dissuaded gracefully by Warrilow, and ultimately replaces his desire to become a monk with a desire to save the word with satire, becoming a successful-- and wordly-- humorist and writer.<br /><br />But if Hendra's career flourishes, his spiritual life founders.  His memoir portrays his first marriage as a loveless error, and his two daughters from that marriage are presented so sketchily as to seem like discomforting footnotes.  As Hendra reaches his forties, his second marriage comes close to dissolution as well, and worldly successes have turned tasteless in his mouth.  Through it all, Hendra has retained his friendship with Father Warrilow, although he has increasingly relegated the monk and his advice to irrelevancy.<br /><br />Warrilow, for his part, has continued to offer Hendra spirtiual wisdom and unbounded warmth, despite Hendra's difficulty in accepting them.  The book culminates in Hendra's return to Warrilow with a second offer to join the Benedictines, a visit which leads Warrilow to help Hendra to uncover his true purpose and to begin to live it.<br /><br />Joseph Warrilow is an inspiring man.  Warrilow's goodness and, more importantly, his embodiment of God's goodness, moved me to tears.<br /><br />And what of Hendra?  Like most of us he is highly imperfect, easily seduced by self-interest and the lures of the material world.  The interesting question about Father Joe is whether Hendra, despite his repeated shortcomings, continued to deserve God's acceptance, generosity and spiritual guidance, dispensed through the person of Warrilow.  Readers may disagree on this point, but those who accept Warrilow's belief that God is love will likely offer a 'yes'.<br /><br />Father Joe therefore offers a modern illustration of the premise that God's love can be all-embracing and transformative.  But the story has an even more poignant frame.  Since the book's publication, one of Hendra's daughters from his first marriage has publicly accused her father of sexual abuse. Whether or not the charges are true, Hendra and his daughter have a great deal of healing to do.<br /><br />Does Hendra's daughter's charge undercut the message of Father Joe?  Oddly not, in this reader's mind.  The theme of God's continuing acceptance of those who err, as well as the possibility of human redemption through God's love, with hope will continue to assist Hendra, his family and us all through the challenges and repeated shortcomings of our lives.<br /><br />Tony Hendra, clearly a flawed man, has written a fine book about the possibility of redemption.  Whether or not Hendra has in fact redeemed himself, his depiction of the process is worthy of your attention.  And, of course, it is a blessing to meet Joseph Warrilow through Hendra's pen.o tears. <br /> <br />And what of Hendra?

Samantha Joyce, the heroine, is an attractive 20-something who serves as a policy aide to an Ohio senator.<br /><br />Sammy's quirks are legion-- she worries incessantly about contracting exotic ailments, has trouble caring for her Japanese fighting fish, and nurtures friendships with telemarketers.  And yes, she becomes embroiled in numerous romantic confusions of the type that one might expect of a young, smart, but slightly naive Senate staffer.<br /><br />This novel works because of its goodheartedness and the sympathetic portrayal of its heroine.  As one might expect, Gore (the daughter of former Senator and Vice President Al) also does a nice job with the Capitol Hill setting and the depiction of a presidential campaign.<br /><br />Recommended as a light page turner that will serve readers well on planes, beaches or after a difficult day.	2005-07-30

But unlike many or most Baby Boomers, Gottfried was not seduced (at least not permanently) by a high income at a young age, Armani suits, power and illicit sex with an enticing, if manipulative, co-worker.  Instead, he chucked it all to codify and promote the emerging industry of green (read: environmentally sound or healthy) real estate development.<br /><br />Gottfried's rebirth as a do-gooder was not without its setbacks: his workload rocketed, his income dwindled for a time, and he briefly succumbed to the allure of venture capital and the tech boom with disappointing results.  But he emerged from the tumult of his transition successfully and has had an enormous and positive effect on the real estate development industry both in the U.S. and throughout the world.<br /><br />Greed to Green works on a number of levels.  It is a good story, clearly told, for those interested in the real estate industry and in environmentalism. Gottfried ably discusses both fields with a minimum of technical mumbo-jumbo. But the story is more important as a tale of personal transformation and the influences that shape a life.  Gottfried is especially moving when he discusses his father's influence and when he relates his search for personal meaning and balance.  Such candor is rare and unexpected, especially in the commercial real estate industry, even in its greenest segment. Best of all, Greed to Green is written with real humor-- Gottfried is smart enough to laugh at his foibles and to include us in the joke.<br /><br />Altogether a fine read, a worthy four stars.	2005-07-14

The life situations examined include an unfaithful husband, a daughter's out-of-wedlock pregnancy, marital doldrums, a deteriorating and elderly mother, and the inability to bear a child to term.<br /><br />What distinguishes this novel are the well-drawn portraits of the five protagonists and their families.  I grew to care about the key characters and admired the depth of character development.  No, this is not an artistic triumph or a highly complex read, but the author creates a well-realized world and fully engages the reader's sympathies.<br /><br />The book club backdrop provides a good vehicle to examine the way that women develop friendships and bond.  One caveat-- if you are looking for sophisticated analysis of the works under discussion, this is not your read.  The book club could just as easily have been a gardening club, a cooking club or a support group.<br /><br />This novel was a best-seller in England and deserves a broad audience on the American and Canadian side of the Atlantic.<br /><br />Bottom line: highly enjoyable; four stars.	2005-06-12

The novel explores the secrets of a Midwestern family, centering around the troubled relationship between the mother of the clan and her second of three children, Caroline.<br /><br />The novel opens well after the children of the family have come to maturity.  Caroline contends that her mother surreptitiously subjected her to physical abuse.  Her siblings, both happy and well-adjusted, are angry and discomfited by Caroline's claims.  Caroline has always been difficult, and these charges fit well with her lifelong pattern of overly dramatic behavior.  But could Caroline be right?<br /><br />Elizabeth Berg adroitly sifts the secrets of an all-American family in this accomplished novel.  The shifting evidence-- do Caroline's claims represent the lingering effects of the abuse of a small girl or the self-serving histrionics of a discontented woman?-- is weighed delicately and uncomfortably by Berg's narrator/protagonist, the family's elder sister, Laura.  All families have secrets, and Berg's probing of one such family is a worthy read.<br /><br />Highly recommended: five stars.	2005-06-07

It is slyly humorous and must be fully read and pondered for complete enjoyment.  This novel is a subtle pleasure-- not fully appreciated until savored and digested.<br /><br />Fowler's plot is superficially quiet: a six-person book club-- five women and a lone male-- gathers to read the six novels of Jane Austen.  Little happens on the surface, but the characters' lives change significantly during the progress of the novel and the reader grows to know and appreciate each member of the club. In reflecting back on the novel, one is struck by how much Fowler packed into this read, and how effortless she's made her achievement appear.<br /><br />All told, The Jane Austen Book Club is a worthy homage to Austen herself.  Don't skip the summaries of Austen's novels, diverse critical reactions to Austen, and the hilarious questions for readers (done in the voices of the novel's principal characters) at book's end.	2005-05-26

The novel focuses on the yawn-inducing romantic and social aspirations of a group of New York City heiresses who live for shopping, parties and romance, in that order.  (A fiance is viewed first and foremost as a fashion accessory.)<br /><br />Our heroine, who seems to be based loosely on author Plum Sykes, is a fashion magazine writer with (given her limited interests and disappointing wit) an improbable Princeton degree, who has penetrated the inner circle of the top echelon of New York party girls.  She and her friends live an exhausting life of dieting, attending sample sales and engaging in an unending series of beauty treatments.  Can our protagonist find happiness, or will life just devolve into a disappointing parade of unsuitable men?<br /><br />You might not care about the answer, as Bergdorf Blondes is largely a listing of name designers, in nightspots, and \\"glam\\" beauty treatments.  The plot is thin and character development is almost non-existent.  I did appreciate the chance to learn some of the lingo favored by Park Avenue socialities (glam is glamorous, ana is anorexic-- usually a compliment used to describe an enviable thinness-- and beyond is superb, so much so as to defy description).  But slang, however entertaining, isn't enough to carry a novel.<br /><br />Bottom line: Bergdorf Blondes boasts a plot and characters that are way too \\"ana\\".  The novel, while superficially \\"glam\\", never manages to approach the back side of \\"beyond\\".	2005-05-15

And learn I did in this massive, if flawed, book.<br /><br />Randall Sullivan focuses his narrative on the Virgin Mary's appearances at Medjugorje (pronounced Med-yu-gor-iya), a small village in the former Yugoslavia.  The Medjugorje visions, experienced by six children and adolescents, began in 1981 and have continued into the 21st century.  Sullivan visted Medjugorje on several occasions, most notably for seven weeks in 1995, and provides a thorough and fascinating examination of the appearances, interspersed with an account of the bitter war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.<br /><br />Sullivan also reports capably on the Marian apparitions at Fatima and Lourdes, as well as on the Vatican's exhaustive vetting of new saints and its investigations of Marian phenomena-- interestingly, the Church has never taken a position on the veracity of the Lourdes, Fatima and Medjugorje visitations, despite Pope John Paul II's ardent support for the Virgin Mary and strong interest in these events.<br /><br />Sullivan's investigations of Medjugorje, the Vatican's examinations of candidates for sainthood and Marian claims, and his visit with Father Bernard Groeschel, an erudite Dominican priest who has worked extensively in these fields, are the strongest portions of this book.  I also admired Sullivan's candor in revealing his own experiences in Medjugorje, and how his visits to the area affected his inner life.<br /><br />Sullivan is less successful when documenting the most extensive set of alleged Marian visitations in the U.S., which emerged in Scottsdale, Arizona in the 1990s.  This portion of the book, including a discussion of Sullivan's growing distress about the difficulties of verifying Marian phemonena and a period in which he experiences a dark night of the soul rambles... and rambles... and could have been edited significantly to good effect. The Scottsdale experiences, however, have interesting parallels and contrasts with the Yugoslavian ones, and have the virtue of demonstrating that religious visions are influenced by the identities of the visionaries and the clergy involved.  And Sullivan's inner turmoil will be recognized by many struggling with questions of personal faith.<br /><br />An unsettling and jarring undercurrent in this book is provided by a number of accounts of demonic manifestation, including an episode allegedly experienced by Sullivan. Be forewarned if you are easily spooked-- these episodes are taken literally by Sullivan and those who experience them. (Oddly, there appears to be more skepticism among Church fathers and the public about the veracity of Marian visions than about demonic intrusions, at least in Sullivan's telling.)<br /><br />The need for judicious editing makes this interesting book a three-star read.  But Miracle Detective is instructive about Marian visions in general and on Medjugorje in particular, and will fascinate those interested in these subjects.<br /><br />My own impressions were that the Medjugorje visionaries are sincere and that the Marian visitations there were very likely authentic, especially in their early phases. The Scottsdale events were less persuasive, albeit interesting.<br /><br />At book's conclusion, I had developed an unexpected sympathy for the Vatican in its role of vetting presumptive saints and evaluating the authenticity of Marian visitations. Passions surrounding these events run high and testimony is invariably varied and colored by the observer's worldview. And in the ephemeral world of visions and visionaries, fraud and delusion are potential explanations for unusual events.  The Vatican may be excruciatingly conservative and maddeningly slow in its pronouncements on saints and visitations, but it does provide some much-needed quality control in the examination of these areas.wever, have interesting parallels and contrasts with the Yugoslavian ones, and have the virtue of demonstrating that religious visions are influenced by the identities of the visionaries and the clergy involved.

These incognita excursions allow Reichl to skewer the pretensions and omissions of such well-known restaurants as Le Cirque and Tavern on the Green.<br /><br />Garlic and Sapphires sets a refreshing tone due to Reichl's insistence on recognizing excellent dining in all of its venues, from humble ethnic restaurants to New York's most elegant establishments.  Reichl's penchant for ferreting out little-known gems earns her the opprobrium of Bryan Miller, her predecessor as the Times's restaurant critic, and his supporters, all of whom charge Reichl with \\"letting down standards\\". But the many New Yorkers who experience life without expense account or trust fund appreciate her excursions to the wrong side of the tracks to identify dining delights.<br /><br />Most important, Garlic and Sapphires provides a poignant look at what it is like to be too old, too unfashionable, or too poor to fully take part in the glories of the Big Apple.  Reichl's disguises frequently place her in one or more these overlooked groups, and she provides a sensitive picture of what it is like to be marginalized-- not only by headwaiters at four-star dining establishments, but by society.  One hopes that Reichl's tenure as Times restaurant critic made top restaurants more likely to treat all of their patrons with dignity and respect.<br /><br />Garlic and Sapphires led me to develop the following advice for restaurant patrons:<br />  --As Reichl notes, restaurant preferences are subjective.  Go to the places you enjoy, rather than the places fashion dictates.<br />  --Restaurants are there to serve you.  If you are unhappy about food or service, speak up-- preferably to a manager, if your waiter or waitress hasn't dealt with the problem.  Above all, don't be intimidated.  If you need instruction on what fork to use or what wine to order, you should be able to ask without embarrassment.<br />  --You are especially entitled to fine service and cooking in a top restaurant-- don't let the establishment off the hook.  If you have arrived on time for your reservation (or called ahead to notify the restaurant if you are delayed) and behaved courteously, any lapses in food or service reflect a deficiency in the restaurant, not a deficiency in you.<br />  --At least in the U.S., tips are discretionary.  If you're not happy, reduce the tip accordingly. Feel free to advise your friends of the restaurant's shortcomings.  And fortunately, you're not a critic who must return to give the establishment a fair chance. If you're not happy, you need never darken its doorstep again.<br /><br />One final piece of advice-- if you enjoy books about the food world, read Garlic and Sapphires.eferably to a manager, if your waiter or waitress hasn't dealt with the problem.

When not identifying the next consumer trend, Cayce is an afficionado of a sequence of mysterious video footages that are being posted to the Internet.  Financed by a powerhouse ad agency whose CEO longs to identify the creator of the footage, Cayce is deployed to track down the auteur behind the new video sensation.<br /><br />The pursuit of the hidden video designer takes Cayce from London to Tokyo to Moscow, always amid highly-styled, slightly surreal surroundings.  Much of the fun of this novel is watching Gibson swaddle his characters in sleek, high tech finishes and film noir-ish situations.  Also appealing is his depiction of Cayce-- the arbiter of cutting edge design who is herself phobic about the labels and branding in which she traffics. Gibson's decision to make Cayce vulnerable and human-- in marked contrast to her high style existence-- distinguishes this novel, as does its cinematic imagery.<br /><br />It would be fun to see this book turned into a Matrix-like film.  And additional Cayce Pollard novels would be welcome-- happily, Gibson's denouement leaves plenty of room for a sequel.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a fast, fun read.	2005-04-06

Among his accomplishments are the development of a comprehensive guide to perfumes, of which he is a connoisseur.  He is also passionate about opera and knowledgeable about wines.  Unfortunately, Turin's considerable talents do not include the management of academic politics and the ability to humor slower mortals.<br /><br />The Emperor of Scent follows Turin's revival of a previously discredited theory of how the nose processes smell, and his herculean efforts to publish the results of his research. Despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that Turin's research could potentially revolutionize the science of smell and the development of commercial fragrances, he encounters stunning difficulties in publishing his results and gaining the attention of the scientific community.  The novelty of Turin's theory presents one barrier to acceptance.  Additional barriers are created by Turin's reputation (partially justified) as a difficult, eccentric and renegade scientist, as well as by the fact that his theory embraces aspects of biology, chemistry and physics, which discomforts scientists who have difficulties in bridging diverse disciplines.  In combination, these conditions dissuade the scientific community from considering Turin's work seriously.<br /><br />The Emperor of Scent is a fascinating read.  It is not a balanced journalistic account-- according to the author, Turin's theory is so unnerving to the scientific establishment that Turin's opponents almost uniformly refuse to read and comment upon his work. The book therefore focuses on Turin's rejection by the scientific community, and in so doing offers a briiliant case study of closed-mindedness in the dissemination of ideas. This outcome is unfortunate, because Turin's theory (at least to this non-scientist) seems highly credible.  The refusal to consider Turin's theory is also a fascinating cautionary tale of how readily established elites reject innovators-- particularly unpedigreed, outspoken innovators like Luca Turin.  The Emperor of Scent explores these themes brilliantly.<br /><br />Yet another reason to read and enjoy The Emperor of Scent is to make the acquaintance of Luca Turin, a scientific ground-breaker in the tradition of Galileo or Copernicus.  Turin's forays into the perfume industry and his eccentric lifestyle also make for fascinating reading.<br /><br />Highly recommended-- a five star read.  One quibble: The Emperor of Scent does not portray the ending to Turin's saga very clearly.  At book's end, he has turned his research interests to other areas and earlier allusions in the book indicate that he has lost his post at University College London.  But the concluding chapter of the book is sketchy and unsatisfying at best, and leaves Turin's fate unclear.  Which led me to research Turin's whereabouts on the Internet.  Inquiring readers will be pleased to learn that he is now using his theory to develop new fragrances for a new U.S. venture based in northern Virginia.  Let's hope that this is a happy and lucrative outcome for a multi-talented man whose ideas are ahead of their time.o doing offers a briiliant case study of closed-mindedness in the dissemination of ideas.

The pets are chiefly avian-- parrots, canaries, doves, starlings, turkeys, geese and the ducks of the title-- as well as rabbits and cats.  All are enthusiastically adopted by Linda Tarte and, sometimes less so, by husband and author Bob.<br /><br />Enslaved by Ducks is the perfect feel-good book for those entranced by pets, particularly bird-fanciers.  Tarte's low-key humor goes down easily, and the animals' antics-- never dull-- range from the exasperating to the hilarious to the touching. Not a bird fancier myself, I was nonetheless touched at the depth of feeling shown by the Tartes' birds-- they are indeed capable of a full range of emotions, including love.  The same is true, of course, of the Tartes' other pets.<br /><br />If you are an animal fancier in need of a heartening read, try Enslaved by Ducks.	2005-03-28

Kevin Phillips has done a comprehensive job of tracking four generations of the Bush and Walker clans that produced George H.W. Bush, 41st president of the U.S. (Bush I), and George W. Bush, 43rd president of the U.S. (Bush II).<br /><br />American Dynasty is a sweeping history of the intersection of the Bush/Walker family fortunes with the top levels of American government-- ties that extend back to the late 19th century.  Phillips' work is fascinating and erudite, although an admittedly challenging read that is often academic in tone.<br /><br />Phillips tracks four generations of Bushes and Walkers.  The family's fortune was forged in manufacturing (the Bush lineage) and, more significantly, in investment banking (the Walker lineage). The Walker family operated near the peak of American finance, with significant ties to the Rockefellers, National City Bank and the firm of Brown Brothers Harriman. In this capacity, two generations of Walkers influenced both American finance and American foreign policy through two World Wars. Phillips makes a compelling case that these relationships paved the way for the family's long-term involvement with the CIA and to a fascination with covert foreign entanglements.  Phillips also argues persuasively that the family's roots in investment banking led to the endorsement of economic policies centered on the well-being of investors, rather than on the betterment of workers and families.  Phillips makes a strong argument that the Bush family's economic stance is inherently elitist-- the recent veneer of Texas populism notwithstanding.<br /><br />There is much to admire in the Bush family's rise to prominence. The Bush and Walker clans were not only lucky-- the early generations embodied considerable business genius and hard work.  That said, Phillips demonstrates that the public policies born of the family's privilege appear to favor wealth consolidation at home (the rich grow richer) and ill-advised and possibly clandestine foreign policies abroad (was the 2003 Iraq invasion well advised?; did Bush I inappropriately lengthen the captivity of the Iranian hostages to engineer a Reagan election victory in 1980?).<br /><br />The key question is whether such policies are truly in the best interests of the American people.  American Dynasty might help prepare Americans for the 2006 mid-term elections and for the presidential contest of 2008.<br /><br />Although American Dynasty is frequently a slow, rather academic read, it is an important one.  The book is notable for its scholarship, depth and scope and is most worthy of your attention.reign policies abroad (was the 2003 Iraq invasion well advised?; did Bush I inappropriately lengthen the captivity of the Iranian hostages to engineer a Reagan election victory in 1980?).   <br /> <br />The key question is whether such policies are truly in the best interests of the American people.

Marc Gunther's superb Faith and Fortune explores a variety of businesses whose managers have been guided by values as well as by profit.<br /><br />Two aspects of this book are especially compelling: (1)Gunther does not shy away from a discussion of spiritual values-- a subject often greeted with unease or disdain  by the business community; and (2)Gunther reports the ups and downs of the companies he covers-- his book is honest, rather than a feel-good tract.<br /><br />Gunther develops riveting profiles of executives who guide values-driven companies and their efforts to reconcile philosophy with the bottom line.  An especfially dramatic example: the furniture company Herman Miller's painful downsizing after the decline of its business in the wake of the 2000-2001 downturn. Was the downsizing necessary? Yes.  Was it wrenching for a company that prided itself on taking care of its workforce? Yes.  And were the layoffs handled as hunanely as possible? Yes, again.  As this suggests, values do not free companies from the need to make a profit-- indeed, the practice of values might raise the bar-- but Gunther introduces us to individuals who have achieved significant success in building more ethical companies while continuing to operate profitably, and that is something to cheer about.  Even more cheering is that Gunther-- a senior writer for Fortune Magazine-- has explored this theme with sophistication and compassion, rather than with sentimentality, and that he has recorded both successes and setbacks.<br /><br />Faith and Fortune honors businesspeople who have conducted themselves in ways consistent with the idea of a higher purpose, while continuing to grapple with the bottom line.  The book is inspirational reading for the many in the corporate world who would like to see business make a positive difference, as well as for consumers interested in socially responsible purchasing or investing.  Faith and Fortune also should be read widely in undergraduate and graduate business programs to spur discussion of alternative models for business success.<br /><br />Bottom line: buy this book for a thought-provoking and inspiring read.  And thanks to Mark Gunther for his sensitive and sophisticated handling of a worthy and sometimes controversial topic.and graduate business programs to spur discussion of alternative models for business success. <br /> <br />Bottom line: buy this book for a thought-provoking and inspiring read.

Bad breaks or poor luck managed by middle-class families with relative ease pose far greater obstacles for the poor.  Take a mundane example-- a broken car.  The middle-income family would get a tow to a repair shop and lease a new vehicle until the first was fixed.  Inconvenient, but hardly disastrous. The same episode could force a poor family over the edge-- an inability to fix the car combined with the possibility of inadequate alternative transportation, public or otherwise, could lead to job loss and additional economic hardship.<br /><br />The addition of family instability and hard-to-access or inadequate public services compound the difficulties faced daily by poor Americans.<br /><br />Does individual responsibility affect the ability to defeat poverty?  Shipler answers with a resounding yes, but reminds us that poverty imposes challenges of which wealthier Americans are unaware.  Read this excellent book to gain additional insight and compassion.	2005-01-16

Holy Blood, Holy Grail takes a fascinating subject matter to, ultimately, an unsatisfying conclusion.  A more interesting and spiritually significant treatment of this subject can be found in Margaret Starbird's The Woman with the Alabaster Jar.<br /><br />Holy Blood, Holy Grail explores the purported relationship between the Priory of Sion, the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, the Plantagenets, the Hapsburgs, and their links to the bloodline of Jesus.  The long and the short of it is that Jesus may have married Mary Magdalene, and fathered a child or children with her whose bloodlines are perpetuated in various European royal families, including the Plantagenets, the Hapsburgs and others.<br /><br />The secrets of this bloodline and the true story of Jesus' life and death are allegedly guarded by a secret organization known as the Priory of Sion, which reportedly has held historic ties to the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons.  Leaders of the Priory of Sion are alleged to have included Leonardo da Vinci and, more recently, Jean Cocteau.  The Priory reportedly wishes to reorganize the continent of Europe under the rule of Christ's descendants and to depose the Catholic Church in the process. The alleged intent is to restore a unified Europe under the most royal of bloodlines.<br /><br />All of this is fascinating, but only the credulous will take Holy Blood, Holy Grail at face value.  The authors have a tendency to discard evidence which discredits their theories, and to selectively present those interpretations that bolster their position.  Thus, Holy Blood, Holy Grail is ultimately unpersuasive and a less-than-satisfying read.<br /><br />There is, however, an unexpected dividend from this book: it inadvertently explains the persistence of some of the conspiracy theories that appear to have regularly inspired various right-wing crackpots and anti-Semites over the centuries.  The Priory's supposed tolerance for religions that do not believe in the divinity of Christ, combined with its reputed power, are a seeming explanation for the persistent belief in a powerful secret cabal of international power brokers, bankers and Jews intent on world domination.<br /><br />Did Christ leave descendants?  Are the secrets of Christ's lineage kept by the Priory of Sion?  And is the Priory intent on reunifying Europe under the rule of Jesus' descendants?  Fascinating questions, but Holy Blood, Holy Grail is hardly a balanced look at the subject.  On the other hand, the book should be required reading for anyone seeking to understand the origins of a variety of conspiracy theories.ith its reputed power, are a seeming explanation for the persistent belief in a powerful secret cabal of international power brokers, bankers and Jews intent on world domination.

This novel tells the story of Ann Holmes, an impoverished and sickly runaway who encounters a vision of the Virgin Mary in a forest near a failing Pacific Northwest logging town.<br /><br />Is the vision real, the product of Ann's fervent belief in Our Lady, or the result of a mind addled by stress, poverty, sickness and a history of marijuana use?  What is to be made of Mother Mary's message to forsake evil, rededicate ourselves to God, and to build a church on the site of the visions?  Are the priests involved in investigating the vision competent for the task? And what does the mass arrival of pilgrims at the site mean for the declining fortunes of the logging town of North Fork?<br /><br />Our Lady of the Forest transcends most usual genres.  There is too much black humor and sharp observation to classify it as a mystical novel, and it is too raw and heartfelt to be a comedy or satire. Readers who expect a predictable plotline might be disappointed.  At the same time, the characters are sharply drawn, the plotting is original and author David Guterson has crafted a fully-realized small-town drama.  If you are interested in a well-executed novel that goes beyond the usual, it is a worthy read.	2004-10-30

The venerable and crotchety summer home, the Big House, towers above Buzzards Bay and serves as a faithful repository of the family history from 1903 to the next century.<br /><br />Colt is among the fourth generation of his family to occupy the Big House-- his children represent the fifth.  This beautifully-written memoir will transport you to summertime Cape Cod, educate you on the rise, flourishing and decline of Brahmin Boston, and allow you to enter the poignant, often difficult but ultimately loving history of the Atkinson-Colt clan.<br /><br />The Big House works on numerous levels, as a travelogue, as a social and architectural history, as an intimate family saga, and as a musing on permanence, impermanence, change and renewal.  At book's end, you will have steeped yourself in Atkinson and Colt lore and will believe yourself a honorary-- if temporary--  member of the family. And you will have acquired-- if temporarily-- a remarkable summer home.	2004-09-12

This extensively researched and soberly reported book produces remarkable revelations and important findings about the Saudi royal family and its dealings with both Islamic fundamentalism and America's political and business elite.<br /><br />The book explores the following themes:<br /><br />--Long-term Saudi support for Islamic charities and causes that have contributed to the rise of Muslim fundamentalism and related terrorist activities.<br />--Close ties between the Saudi royal family and the bin Laden construction empire, and possible on-going ties between the bin Laden family and al Qaeda.<br />--Potential involvement by certain members of the Saudi royal family-- who have since died under suspicious circumstances-- with al Qaeda. At least one of these royals was among those allowed to leave the U.S. without FBI questioning in the week following September 11.<br />--Assiduous cultivation of American business and political elites by the Saudi royal family over a period of close to 30 years.  These relationships, backed by significant investments and charitable gifts, have been forged both with Republicans and Democrats.  Saudi ties with the Bush family and its business associates have been especially strong.<br />--Little reported business relationships between Bush advisors, the U.S. oil industry and Saudi energy transactions. Did you know that national security advisor Condoleezza Rice served on Chevron's board of directors for mujltiple years, and had an oil tanker named for her? (The tanker's name has since been changed.)  Did you know that Bush I Secretary of State James Baker's law firm undertook substantial energy transaction work in Saudi Arabia after the election of Bush II?<br /><br />This web of relationships deserves heightened public scrutiny in the wake of September 11.  At minimum, it would appear that the Saudi royal family has been playing a dual game-- to preserve its Islamic credentials in the Arab world by tacitly supporting al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism, while building close relationships with the United States.  Saudi reluctance to assist in the American investigation of al Qaeda following September 11 is particularly troubling in this context-- if understandable.<br /><br />The Bush family's longstanding political and business ties with the Saudi royal family are simultaneously understandable, praiseworthy and upsetting. The close relationship between George H.W. Bush (the 41st president) and the Saudis contributed to global political and economic stability.  The same can be said for the continuation of this relationship during the presidency of George W. Bush (the 43rd president).<br /><br />At the same time, these longstanding ties led the second Bush administration to minimize the threat of al Qaeda, overlook Saudi links to al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism, to permit the post-September 11 evacuation from the U.S. of members of the bin Laden and Saudi royal families without questioning by the FBI, and to tread lightly in pressing the Saudis to align themselves with the war on terrorism.  As a result, American abilities to fight terrorism might have been, and may continue to be, compromised.  On the other hand, Saudi oil reserves continue to be controlled by a royal family that is comparatively sympathetic to American political and economic interests.<br /><br />The question going forward, is whether American foreign policy is best left in the hands of an administration with especially strong ties to the Saudi royal family.

Bush.  If you are interested either in Bush the man or in the application of psychoanalytic technique in a political context, this text is well worth your time.<br />Author Justin Frank is especially persuasive in his analysis of material drawn from Bush's childhood.  The future president was raised by a well-meaning but highly reserved mother and a frequently absent father. Bush's sister contracted leukemia when Bush was six and died when Bush was seven.  Frank speculates persuasively that the president also likely suffered-- and considers to suffer-- from attention deficit disorder and perhaps from dyslexic tendencies.<br />Frank posits that these circumstances led to a highly anxious childhood and a lifelong difficulty in processing language and concepts.  As a result (or so the author proposes), Bush developed a rigid, incurious world view (limiting perplexing or ambiguous information helps to contain anxiety), a need for set personal routines (routine is helpful in relieving anxiety), and a need to dominate or control events (which further reduces the likelihood of unanticipated occurrences).<br />These traits have been carried forward into Bush's presidency, which has been characterized by reliance on a rigid worldview of &quot;us&quot; against &quot;them&quot; (somewhat defensible in the wake of September 11, but highly consistent with Bush's supposed  thought process), the use of a small coterie of trusted advisors, and strict adherence to a rigid schedule dedicated in good part to  exercise, relaxation and rest. (Frank reports that the president's staff restricts Bush to three to four 30- to 45-minute policymaking sessions per week, to prevent the emergence of-- in the words of chief of staff Andrew Card-- &quot;a grumpy and angry President.&quot;)<br />Frank also speculates that Bush's need to compete with and surpass his famous father has affected his life and his presidency.  As a result, Frank believes that George W. Bush relishes the chance to dominate advisors who first served his father, and requires absolute loyalty from these appointees.  And of course the 2003 invasion of Iraq surpassed George H.W. Bush's Desert Storm in firepower and scope.  Might the son have been trying to outdo the father on the world stage?<br />These and other provocative interpretations make Bush on the Couch worth reading, and I honestly wish that I could have given this book a higher rating than three stars.  Unfortunately, the book looks at every Bush utterance as psychoanalytic fodder, disregarding the fact that Bush is to a degree &quot;managed&quot; by a substantial staff. (Was the infamous &quot;looking for WMD in the Oval Office&quot; video for the 2004 White House Correspondents Dinner-- an event at which the president is expected to poke fun at himself-- a revealing bit of psychodrama, or a misdirected effort at humor by the White House media team?  Frank believes the former.  I would argue the latter.)  The book also conveniently ignores the fact that many policy decisions are brokered or made in response to perceived political needs, rather than providing unalloyed reflections of the President's psychiatric condition. (Was Bush's support for the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security a reflection of the President's tendency to offer superficially reassuring but ultimately hollow approaches to dealing with anxiety, or a political compromise responding to an initiative introduced by then-Presidential candidate Joe Lieberman?  Frank chooses the first alternative, but political accounts state that Bush-- who initially opposed the creation of a new federal agency-- was persuaded to support the initiative to avoid ceding advantage to the Democrats.)<br />While the tendency to overlook all non-psychoanalytic explanations for Bush's behavior flaws this manuscript considerably, Frank offers many worthwhile explanations for the president's worldview and operating style.  This is a three star book with a five star core.  Extract the insights and ignore the rest.ffers many worthwhile explanations for the president's worldview and operating style.

Bush decided to pre-emptively invade Iraq, this book reveals the president's mindset.<br /><br />Woodward also draws sharp portraits of Colin Powell, Don Rumsfeld, Condie Rice, Dick Cheney, George Tenet and other principals in the foreign policy firmament.<br /><br />The book's strength is its extensive use of personal interviews with the Administration's principals.  Woodward does convey a strong sense of \\"you are there\\".  Unfortunately, however, there is little attempt to balance the interview contents with independent reporting by the author.  The result is a text that occasionally descends to \\"gee whiz\\" credulity, which somewhat undercuts its effectiveness.<br /><br />The bottom line: four stars-- a worthy read, but not a great one.<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT FROM REVIEWER:  It is 2007, the situation in Iraq is difficult at best, and I have just read State of Denial, Woodward's sequel to Plan of Attack.  State of Denial revisits some of the events of Plan of Attack and it is clear that the above-referenced \\"gee whiz\\" credulity of Plan of Attack withstands neither the test of time nor Woodward's subsequent reporting.  My Amazon software won't let me change my original rating of Plan of Attack, but if I could, I would downgrade it to three (3) stars.<br /><br />If you've not yet read Plan of Attack or State of Denial, I'd recommend that you proceed directly to State of Denial-- a five star read--  for a more balanced investigation of the White House's decision to go to war and eventual management of the war effort.  That said, Plan of Attack contains some fine writing and is interesting for its perspective on the beliefs of the President and his inner circle in the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq.  As well, Woodward's sympathetic treatment of the White House in Plan of Attack testifies to the strength of America's desire to support the President in the wake of September 11-- a desire that Woodward appears to have shared.	2004-06-24

Literally dodging bullets and sharing the company of warlords, Lamb is a latter-day swashbuckler who will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />Whether accompanying 'mullahs on motorbikes' in 1988 raids to dislodge the Soviet Union, interviewing a sinister Pakistani intelligence czar, or maintaining a correspondence with a young Kabul woman confined to a burkha in 2001, Lamb offers a vivid and sensitive first-person look at Afghanistan.  And she gets around-- she's met and interviewed everyone from Hamid Karzi to Taliban stalwarts to the leading tribal warlords and their underlings.  Nor does Lamb ignore ordinary citizens ranging from schoolteachers to housewives to glassmakers to shopkeepers: her depictions of daily life and acts of courage in the midst of deprivation and repression are among the best pieces in the book.<br />Lamb's Afghanistan and its people are romantic, exotic, haunting, and damaged by centuries of war.  The book will deepen your understanding of this fascinating nation, even as it makes you wonder whether Afghanistan is doomed to repeat the cycles of the past or whether it will rise phoenix-like to transcend its history.	2004-04-14

Firoozeh Dumas (occasionally known as Julie-- read the book to find out why) has written a delightful memoir of her family's transition from Iran to California.  I laughed out loud reading it and marveled at how much Firoozeh's family reminded me of my own (non-Iranian) relatives.  This book reminds us that all people are bound by humanity and humor-- a heartening message in today's world.<br />  The hero of the piece is Kazem, Firoozeh's dad, an engineer by trade and a do-it-yourself handyman and bargain hunter by avocation.  Firoozeh's mom, Nazireh, tries gamely to master English, but continues to find American diction tongue-tying.  Happily, her mouth-watering meals taste good in any language.<br />  Both Kazem and Nazireh have hearts as big as the sun.  You'll enjoy meeting them in this light-hearted family saga.  Be aware, as well, that Kazem actively monitors this book's Amazaon rankings.  Buy a copy and give him even more to cheer about!	2004-02-11

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Excellent Look into the Workings of Bush 43-- A Must Read	This book is a must-read for thoughtful Americans and for students of federal policymaking under George W. Bush.<br />As O'Neill and Suskind demonstrate, the George W. Bush administration depicts a style of governance in which the building and marketing of a political base trump policy pragmatism.  Put simply, the policy makers have been shunted aside by the political team and decisions are made primarily on whether they appeal to or can be sold to the base of voters who support Bush.<br />An important aspect of this narrative is the extent to which  the top political and administrative team that surrounds Bush (Cheney, Rove, Rice and Card) dominate the establishment of federal policy, to the exclusion of the Cabinet officers and subject matter experts in the executive branch.  The process described is one in which the top political/administrative team sets policy direction (frequently on the basis of campaign stands or personal belief), and then summons Cabinet members to support that decision with specific information. According to O'Neill, discussion is infrequent and an open examination of alternatives seems to be actively discouraged. By contrast, previous presidents whom O'Neill served (Nixon and Ford) were committed to the discussion of policy alternatives with their Cabinets and to an active discussion of the data underlying these alternatives.<br />How do Americans want federal policy made?  Those comfortable with a presidency that discourages discussion and debate by Cabinet members and others outside the innermost circle should be comfortable with the George W. Bush model. Those who prefer an administration that actively pursues data and encourages Cabinet members and others to participate in the policy decision process might wish to support another candidate in 2004.<br />The book also reflects the extent to which discussion in Washington has become dominated not by discussions of the merits of particular policies, but by what appeals to and can be sold to the electorate or one's political supporters.  In other words, the political and communications gurus are in charge, and the folks responsible for policy definition and development take a back seat.  This has usually been the case with election campaigns, but recently has become common after the election, especially in the House and in the Senate.  As O'Neill's experience demonstrates, the George W. Bush administration has adopted a governance approach centered on political and media concerns.<br />The book rings true.  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's theory of asymmetric threat as described by O'Neill (due to technology advances, America can be threatened by attacks from rogue nations or groups; a pre-emptive strike is necessary to intimidate or quell these nations or groups) is a coherent explanation for an otherwise bewildering war in Iraq.<br />The use of moderates in the Cabinet (O'Neill, Whitman, Powell) for political cover rather than for meaningful input into the policymaking process also rings true.  O'Neill and Whitman have left the administration, and Powell will leave in January 2005.<br />All told, this is an important and thoughtful book that deserves to be read.to the electorate or one's political supporters.

Starbird's journey reflects that of many men and women who have sought a deeper spiritual connection and arrived at the belief that a new paradigm-- that of male-female partnership-- is needed in the temporal and spiritual realms.<br />Interestingly, Starbird's thesis is reflected in Native American wisdom teachings and in the Jewish Kabbalah, as well as in<br />secular studies such as \\"The Chalice and the Blade\\".  This memoir extends the concept of a shared male-female paradigm to a Christian context, and is important in this respect.<br />Note that this book is a memoir, and should be read as such.  Those interested in evidence that supports Starbird's thesis are best directed to her Woman with the Alabaster Jar, and the extensive bibliography provided therein.  In addition, Starbird has clearly been in the vanguard of spiritual exploration-- her efforts began during the 1970s and have extended over a period of close to 30 years.  Thus, her views should be of interest to those who have embarked more recently on a spiritual quest.	2003-08-11

Following is my view of why this book is a valuable addition to the libraries of those who wish to know more about various concepts of life after death from a Jewish perspective.<br />Rabbi Spitz's book is meaningful for many, precisely BECAUSE Rabbi Spitz comes from a rationalist background that is highly skeptical of the notion of life after death.  Like many contemporary readers, Rabbi Spitz has begun to question a worldview that embraces the purely empirical at the expense of the metaphysical.  Rabbi Spitz's questioning has led him to explore the teachings of traditional Judaism on life after death, and he finds much to embrace and admire therein.<br />Rabbi Spitz's journey mirrors a journey that many Jews and non-Jews are undertaking, and his candor and scholarship deserve plaudits.  People of all faiths will find this book provocative, and the book is particularly useful for Jews who were brought up in a secular tradition, but who wonder if the soul survives death.  If you are building a library about spiritual beliefs on the concept of life after death, or a library on the diversity of Jewish beliefs on this subject, buy this book.	2003-03-22

As another Amazon reader has written, this book will challenge your thinking-- both conscious and unconscious-- about abundance, prosperity, money, and your worthiness to receive. I recommend that you give it a try, for it can lead to more happiness, security, peacefulness and-- yes-- abundance and prosperity.  And your expenditure will be modest: only $7 plus shipping. As you will see below, this book worked for me and gave me many gifts.<br />SUMMARY: Simply put, The Abundance Book defines God and God's manifestation within you (however you care to define these concepts) as the sole source of your prosperity. God is characterized as all-providing. (Note that this book can be used by agnostics and atheists as well as theists, in that the program can be modified to refer to God as the force of natural law, as the intelligent force in the universe, or in similar terms.)<br />While God must, of necessity, work through people and material events, you should not confuse these vehicles with God, the Source. Rather, you should allow God to work with you, inside you, and through you and others to bring you abundance and prosperity.  The book, through a 40 day program, teaches you to incorporate these principles into your daily life.<br />WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I TRIED IT:  I was laid off in the summer of 2002.  I determined that I wanted to use a spiritual approach as well as conventional means to conduct my search for employment.  I started the 40 day program on August 14, 2002. After the 40 days were up, I continued to read affirmations and excerpts from the book daily.<br />Initially, the program was difficult for me, for it caused me to realize that I had subconscious views that I was unworthy of receiving abundance, particularly in the form of money.  I also had difficulty in believing the concept that I was a part of or a manifestation of God, and that God worked in me and through me.  With time, these concepts became more and more comfortable.<br />The next thing that I noticed was a greater feeling of peace, security and calm acceptance of my circumstances.  I continued to look hard for work, but became more comfortable with the belief that a job would come to me with time and that I would be taken care of by God until it did.  This belief gave me a sense of comfort and ease during a very unsettled time, and allowed me to conduct my job search with more confidence and peace than I normally would have done.<br />This feeling of serenity also allowed me to use some of my savings to attend a conference related to my profession, to visit distant family, and to take a brief vacation. I also continued to make charitable contributions and made a financial gift to a friend in need during this period. These actions were very uncharacteristic for me, because I had been raised to worry about money, especially in lean times.  Instead, this more liberal use of my savings left me feeling empowered. (Note, however, that I did not enter into any expenditures that would lead me into financial jeopardy.  Confidence and peace should not mean foolhardiness.)<br />I completed the 40 day program in late September.  Coincidentally or not (and I recognize that employers are more active in late September and October than they are in the summer) my resume began to get better response and I began to have more interviews-- a trend that continued through the autumn.<br />HAPPY ENDING: I accepted a job offer at 20% above the total amount of my previous salary AND bonus (and at an even higher percentage above my previous base salary). The salary is the highest that I have ever earned-- and this in a recession.  In addition, I was told that I was selected for the position from a field of extremely well-qualified candidates and that the selection process was competitive.<br />I believe that The Abundance Book has helped me materially.  More important, I KNOW it has enhanced my view of God and God's works, and made me into a happier,more spiritually evolved, more secure and more generous person.  These last are treasures not easily gained.  I am supremely grateful to The Abundance Book, to John Randolph Price and, most importantly, to God.<br />I hope that you buy The Abundance Book and follow its program.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.ed, more secure and more generous person.  These last are treasures not easily gained.
