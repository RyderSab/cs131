My sister recommended it to me and since she teaches at a private school in Boston and since we lived in South Bend during our childhood, it seemed to pull me in.   <br /> <br />Lee Fiora is the key character and if you expect her to be beautiful and smart and talented and everything a prep school student should be, you'll be surprised.  There's very little special about her except she's different and confused and not someone that I would particularly like if I met her.  Her self-consciousness raises all types of flags and causes her serious confusion as she goes through four years of a prep school where she seldom fits in.   <br /> <br />I became interested in this book for some reason I can't actually explain.  Because it was different from what I expected, because Lee was the way she was, because visiting her and the fringe relationships she had with her classmates (and this is NOT a book about her classmates) intrigued me.   <br /> <br />PREP is not to be taken lightly.  It has some truths to it, and it probably makes some people uncomfortable, but if you like stories about people and their lives, there's a good chance you'll find it to keep your attention from beginning to end.	2005-08-17

Bitsy, Violet, Dorothy, and Clancy Jane all grow and change throughout the years that are covered in this story and as you read about their loves, marriages, divorces, and sexual adventures, you will love them even more. <br /> <br />I've been waiting for this book to come out for a very long time, checking its release date on a regular basis, being disappointed when the release date changed to a later date.  My disappointment changed to delight as I started the book.  This is the kind of book that starts out good but just gets better until you don't know how you're going to get anything done because all you want to do is read. <br /> <br />My only complaint - on page 482 Ms. West credits the Doobie Brothers with Clancy Jane's \\"peaceful, easy feeling\\" when we all know that was the Eagles.  Despite that, I love this book.  If you love southern fiction, southern women, and southern ways, get this today.  You won't regret it.	2005-07-22

From beginning to end.  THE ROCK ORCHARD tells the stories of the people in Leaper's Fork, Tennessee focusing on the Belle family of women.  What I liked best about the story was how it became a series of connected short stories, like pieces of material all pulled together into one beautiful quilt.  <br /> <br />Even though this is a little simple, a little hokey, a little quirky, it is definitely worth reading.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy your visit to Leaper's Fork.	2005-02-10

It made an impression - a beautiful story about India, a woman who must make a huge decision in her life when, at the age of 40, she ends up pregnant.  Between a schizophrenic twin sister and a mother whose secrets fill the pages between India's thoughts, we are taken on a journey through New Mexico (a magical place whether in person or on paper when Barbara Samuel is writing about it) which is a reflection of an earlier journey when India and her sister Gypsy were children.  Love is my favorite thing to read about, but this is not a romance novel.  It's deeper and shinier and has a sharper, meatier edge to it.  And it also has a warmth that wraps around you like a soft, thick afghan as you read each word, each page, each chapter. <br /> <br />If this sounds mysterious it's because I want you to read this book and experience it yourself.  All of Barbara Samuel's books have been incredible to me, and this will not disappoint those of you who are already fans.  Those of you who haven't tried her yet, please do.  If you're disappointed, let me know and I'll send you an email apology.  I don't expect to be sending any at all.	2005-01-26

But for some reason THE SAME SWEET GIRLS appealed to me so I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  I love southern fiction and wasn't disappointed this time.  The relationships between these six women are complex and unpredictable and I liked that.  They are all very different as individuals and different in terms of what they're doing with their lives.  This is no \\"Desperate Housewives\\" - it's better (and I like Desperate Housewives for the most part).   <br /> <br />Being a fan of Michael Lee West (Crazy Ladies) and Rebecca West (Divine Secrets of the Yaya Sisterhood) I can't say that Cassandra King is quite there yet, but nearly so.  I'm already looking forward to her next novel and am planning to go back and read her 2nd one that I skipped.   <br /> <br />Try it - not too sweet and you might just like it!	2005-01-13

Sorry I missed him even though I probably saw him on t.v. more than once.   <br /> <br />At any rate, THE MEMORY OF RUNNING is a book I'm glad I didn't miss.  I got it because it has a great cover and, yes, sometimes I do pick a book by its cover.  Admit it - you do too.  And the title was great as well.  A slow start, but once I got into it, I didn't want to put it down.  I would wake up at 3 a.m. and decide to read for a few minutes and this is something I rarely do with a book.  But I did.  More than once.   <br /> <br />Ron McLarty has put together a great story.  Compare it to whatever you want, it's not like other things I've read recently.  Maybe because I read mostly female authors and literary fiction, it was different, but maybe because it's far from a formula novel and right up there with one that will stay with you for a long time.	2005-01-13

It has a clever cover and looked like it might be a lot of fun, but I resisted the purchase and checked it out instead.  Saving money on books is not a primary goal in my life but it was definitely a relief when it comes to ADMISSIONS by Nancy Lieberman.   <br /> <br />It's not a bad book.  It's just rather ordinary.  I read the whole book but didn't look forward to getting back to it.  Another review mentions how unlikable Helen, the main character, is, but I didn't find that to be the case.  To me, she didn't come across as catty or snotty or rude - she seemed like a pretty ordinary woman who was married to an ordinary man and they had enough money to spend $20K a year to send their only daughter, Zoe, to private school.  Must be nice.  Or not.   <br /> <br />I saw potential in this book.  Some of the characters (the head of the school, the crazy parents of the anorexic Alice, the Toppler's son, Julian) were interesting but it wasn't enough to make me read late into the night.  I kind of liked the fact that Helen and Michael and Zoe made a pretty normal family.  That doesn't happen much, but when it does, it's pretty ordinary.  Back to that word again. <br /> <br />I'll never read it again nor will I recommend it to any of my friends or family.  Why not?  Too ordinary, of course!	2004-10-31

Libby, the free spirit of their childhood is living in the Midwest, near Chicago, having turned into a control freak of sorts.  They haven't spoken in six years even though as children they were closer than twins.  Now, Libby must go through dialysis and needs a donor to give her a kidney.  Can she ask Sam?   <br /> <br />But this story is much deeper than that.  It's a lyrical and poetic story about sisterhood, love, betrayal, forgiveness, and hope.  It's a story about families and friendships and marriage.  Anne LeClaire has created a landscape of words that capture your interest and surround you with the spirit of giving without being predictable or ordinary.   <br /> <br />Better than her other books (which were pretty darn good), you'll be glad you chose THE LAW OF BOUND HEARTS and look forward to LeClaire's future books.	2004-10-02

And then she's gone, back home to Ogunquit, leaving him behind without telling him she's pregnant.  Ten years later she and their daughter Rachel are in a traffic accident leaving Anna in a coma.  Her mother calls David who has been meandering meaninglessly through his life since college, and tells him about Anna and that he's a father.  And so the story begins.<br />Except for the occasional intensive pages with horticulture terms, I enjoyed this book.  The story moved smoothly and the end results, although predictable, are what we want.  The interesting sidebar of this story is that Rachel, David &amp; Anna's daughter, has Asperger's Syndrome which is on the autistic spectrum.  This adds a different flavor to the story and makes the artistic side of things as well as the trip through the mountains that David guides Anna through as she sleeps, a bit more believable and understandable.  <br />This story has no great surprises though.  Nothing that excites you or causes you to wish it would continue when you finish it, but it's definitely worth the exploration.	2004-07-07

Everyone is affected by this decision.  Their adoptive mother has serious concerns over her role in their life once they've met the women who gave birth to them.  Their spouses have to sort through where they fit in the overall picture.  The birth mothers have to face their past and decide how or if it will fit in with their present.  Even the children of the two siblings feel the changes around them and react in their own way.  Trollope tells a good story.  Perhaps there are some issues that seem to be a little thin.  I would have liked to know a bit more about the after affects to Cora and Carole, the two birth mothers.  But overall, it's an interesting storyline and has some merit to it.	2004-06-15
US	51768899	R2685UOWEFU4K7	0142004421	576876921	The Photograph	Books	5	5	6	N	N	An Excellent Picture	There's something rather charming and certainly delightful about the English novel. I'm often attracted to those that take place in current times, but when I started this one I was a little put off for some reason.  Not sure what it was but since I was already in bed and didn't feel like getting up and searching for something else to read, I continued and thank goodness I did.  <br />THE PHOTOGRAPH is so well done.  I love a plot that wraps around itself, telling us the story through the eyes of more than one person and doing it in such a way that is both clever and artistic.  Penelope Lively accomplished that easily.  We never actually meet Kath in life but learn about her in death through the words of her husband, sister, niece, friends, and a somewhat insignificant lover.  <br />Perhaps no one knew Kath while she was alive.  The secrets she kept from everyone made her life mysterious in a way no one recognized until after she was gone.  Her sister Elaine is so wrapped up with her business of designing gardens and her husband Glyn so engrossed in his career that even if she told them, they probably wouldn't have heard her.  So it's rather remarkable to watch as Kath changes the lives of these people even after she has died - and maybe for the better.<br />A good read for those who like this type of book - people, problems, solutions, and how life goes on.	2004-06-06

I find the stories in this book disturbing because it demonstrates how women can be to one another and how the relationships between men and women can be so linear.  But it also shows some growth in some of the sisters and so that's good.  But the main thing that I found disturbing about this book is how redundant it was.  We kept hearing about one drinking party after another, one chapter meeting followed by another, one bitchy remark followed by another.  I got bored reading this and finally, after believing I'd read enough, I scanned the rest of it and returned it to the library.  Of course there is room for me to be wrong, but not wanting to waste my time reading something that just doesn't have much meaning in the big picture of our lives, I believe I did the right thing.  <br />I can understand why Greeks would object to this.  But I don't think there are lies in this book.  I think there are differences throughout the Greek system and there are good things and bad things that come from this.  When my son entered a fraternity it was with my support and it was an amazing and positive experience for him.  But sororities may have a different lesson to teach.  <br />Read it if you must but don't expect to close it when you finish it and feel a sense of satisfaction.  I'll be surprised if that's what you have.	2004-05-30

They don't know one another in the beginning of the book but by the end, each knows no one better.  <br />Their lives aren't parallel in style or nature, but their stories are told in a parallel style which is done well by Hegland.  As we watch their lives change and develop, we become their friends.  We share their unhappiness, their fears, their concerns.  We understand what is happening and wish we could help them.  <br />I found this book to be powerful in its presentation and beautiful in a sharing, compassionate way.

I love the flow of her writing and the way she casts her characters who are obviously born right out of her heart and sent straight into the readers'.  Anyone who has been hurt by infidelity will find this to be close to the real feelings you go through although Trudy's errant husband, Rick, might be a bit different from the usual adulterer.  Still, you have hope for them.  I think that's probably what I like the most about Samuel's novels - the hope, the desire, the passion, the strength, and the realism of relationships that are doomed and relationships that are meant to be.  Call me a romantic, but keep those stories coming!	2004-03-19

Luna McGraw, a former therapist, a recovering alcoholic, and in the midst of trying to quit smoking is working in the floral department of the local supermarket in Taos, New Mexico.  Luna's life is finally becoming balanced again when she meets Thomas Coyote, the man she's had a crush on for years, and when her daughter, Joy, comes to live with her.  The story is lyrical and luscious.  Samuel brings New Mexico to the reader in a way that makes you want to go there and visit if not to live.  <br />I think it's a mistake to classify Samuel's books as &quot;romance.&quot;  They are more than that.  But if you like romance novels (not that there's anything wrong with that), then fine.  And if you don't, please try this one.  You'll be pleasantly surprised to find this wonderful artist who takes words and weaves them into a literary treat.	2004-02-09

I had a &quot;snow day&quot; this week and spent most of the day reading GIRLS IN TROUBLE making a free day off from work even more fun than usual.  Although this is perhaps not quite as sharp as Leavitt's last book, COMING BACK TO ME, it is still a good story about family and love.  And even though there is no &quot;happy ending&quot; Leavitt shows us that life is full of surprises, twists, and turns that we must deal with in our own way.  <br />A pregnant teen-ager is an old story and has been done hundreds of times, but the open adoption puts a new slant on it and gives us something else to consider.  <br />I did find there to be a lot of unnecessary negativity throughout the story.  The negativity Sara experiences upon her return to school after having the baby; the negativity and non-support from her parents; the negativity of the birth father's mother.  There seemed to be so much going against Sara throughout her life and her character was overshadowed by these issues from time to time.  Just as there can be too much of a Pollyanna attitude in a story, there can also be too much of just the opposite.  More of a balance would have been more believable to me.<br />I had a flashback to the writing of Jacqueline Susann while reading parts of this book, especially near the end when things seemed to move along too quickly for earlier parts of the story.  <br />After reading this, if you haven't read COMING BACK TO ME, pick it up and compare. I think you'll see the difference in styles.	2004-02-02

I am wishing I could travel back in time to start this book all over again, not knowing when I start it how much I'm going to love it.<br />I am not a fan of books or stories involving time travel.  It's okay, but it's not something I look for in a book.  I like books about people, love, difficulties, marriage, children, lives.  And I got all of that and more in Audrey Niffenegger's THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE.  What a wonderful book, what a glorious story.  I want all my friends and sisters to read this book because it will enrich their lives, even for a little while.<br />The author has given us something in this book that will not fade away quickly.	2004-01-10

I have some favorites and some that left me feeling flat.  This one isn't something I'd read again even if I had the time (which I don't).  It's ordinary.  Cindy Carver was a bumblehead.  She couldn't leave well enough alone after her daughter, Julia, is missing.  Okay, maybe if my child were missing I'd go a little ballistic too.  Okay, I would.  But I think I would have more faith in the police to do the right thing and I would definitely not be running around town checking things out.  I wish we'd gotten to know a bit more about Heather, Cindy's daughter who isn't missing.  Also, the ending is just a little too abrupt for me.  I can't go into it because it will ruin the ending (which, by the way, has already been ruined by another review with the word &quot;suspenseful&quot; in its title but if you read the review the book will no longer have any suspense to it whatsoever!).  <br />I don't know if Joy Fielding has changed or if I have, but her last few books have left something to be desired as far as I'm concerned.  I read it.  I closed it and I began to wonder what I'd do with it next.  Mail it to my sister?  Donate it to the library?  Or put it on my shelves just to fill up space (as if I need more books to take up space!).  <br />Read it if you must, but if you don't, you won't miss that much.	2003-11-15

I loved BREAD ALONE and finished it, coincidentally, the day ISABEL'S DAUGHTER was released.  While wandering through the bookstore with my son on his birthday I was delighted to find her second novel.  Yes, it took me four months to get to it because of all the other unread books on my shelves, but it was worth the wait.  The story is interesting and beautifully written.  Ms. Hendricks' enchanting style pulls you into the story and, in this case, into New Mexico, a state that is already magical to me.  Avery James, the discarded orphan, is far from perfect, but she has good reason to live a life that is disconcerting.  There are many mysteries in her life which she works to unravel, leaving the orphanage and traveling south into the art world of New Mexico.  For those of you who already love the Southwest, this will bring it home to you in a nostalgic and romantic way.  For those of you who have never visited or lived there, you'll want to change that as soon as possible!  <br />Judith Ryan Hendricks is on my list to watch out for all future novels.  She has a gift and here's one reader who hopes she uses it often and well.	2003-11-03

It's mostly a transition book to get me from one great book to another which was on order and so I suppose that's the main reason.  There is nothing complex about this story.  Silly, perhaps, but not complicated.  The story itself is ridiculous and the characterizations are absurd.  Kayla and Raoul are shadows of real people; their son, Theo, an overdramatization of a young boy in love with an older woman who has mysteriously disappeared.<br />These are the things that bother me about this book:  1) Kayla throws glasses into the ocean after Antoinette disappears to destroy the &quot;evidence.&quot;  2) Kayla and her &quot;best&quot; friend Val are called down to the police station to be questioned about the disappearance of their other &quot;best&quot; friend Antoinette.  Kayla's husband doesn't even bother to go with her and stays at home and gets drunks while she's being harassed by the detective.  3) Val is a lawyer but she's not smart enough to say she's not talking without an attorney present. 4) The community calls them incessantly, leaving phone messages on the answer machine with accusations and questions.  Do people really do this?  5) Kayla and Jacob - what was that all about?<br />Nantucket Nights is one of those books that makes you think you could write a book and get it published because this one just isn't that great.  Well, maybe that's a little harsh, but you get my drift.	2003-09-11

She wrote a sequel to her first novel THE SECOND COMING OF LUCY HATCH.  HONKY TONK ANGELS is even better than her first and that's saying a lot.  This is a book that once you read it, you can't find another book good enough to start because the images Ms. Moyer has written continue to dance through your head and you're not sure you want to replace them with something else! <br />Lucy and Ash are back with us again along with Ash's daughter, Denny.  Their lives flow like a Colorado river when the snow has melted - there are some rough spots, but lots of calm ones too.  But you never know what's going to be around the next bend.  And that's fine too.<br />I can't describe the beauty of this story because I don't have the talent Ms. Moyer does, but reading this book has given me the push to start writing again, to make an effort to put my own words into my own story.  <br />I will be recommending THE LAST OF THE HONKY TONK ANGELS to all my friends, my sisters, and even people I don't know.  I'll probably walk up to strangers in a bookstore and the library and tell them gently to try this book because it's such an incredible read.	2003-08-25

I can't say that I've enjoyed all of Jane Smiley's books, but I like them enough to always look forward to her newest.  I had no idea what GOOD FAITH was about, but when I started reading it at the bookstore it was something I thought I could sink my teeth into.  I wasn't wrong, but I have to admit, it took some doing.  I also have to admit that there were a few pages that got turned without me reading them just so I could get to the next part.  Not many, but a few.  <br />Jane Smiley does build some momentum and it got to the point where I wanted to find out what was going to happen next and how.  The main character, Joe, was likable (something that's important to most readers, I believe) and realistic.  A simple man with a simple life.  <br />Like Smiley's other books, this is well done and although I found the story a bit unusual, I liked it in the end.	2003-06-12

She takes you into the homes, minds, and hearts of her characters and introduces you to their environment, thoughts, and feelings.  Her characters are real and likable.<br />I have a certain affinity for the short story that lets me eavesdrop on the lives of others, and these fit the bill in every way.  Most of them take place in the San Francisco area and if you have ever visited you may be reminiscent of your time spent there and even yearn to return again. <br />Other than relationships, there is no true formula to these stories, and that's a good thing!  \\"Ninety\\" is about the curmudgeonly Papa Louie's 90th birthday, his daughters and their families.  \\"Lightning\\" describes a childless couple who take in a pregnant girl before they adopt her baby.  \\"My Mother's Yellow Dress\\" describes a gay man's memories of his parents' marriage and his relationship with his mother.  All unique, all excellent reads.	2003-05-17

ALL HE EVER WANTED was a surprise for me in that before I started to read it I didn't know it was a period piece, so to speak.  Nicholas Van Tassel is a stuffy professor at a small college in New Hampshire in the early 1900s.  His stuffiness, at first, rubbed me the wrong way.  But I've been pleased with Anita Shreve's past books and was determined to keep going, despite this.  It was also a little difficult to get used to the way the book is written.  The stilted words as Nicholas tells the story of falling in love with Etna and their life together was an initial drawback, but after the first 40 or 50 pages, I was at ease with it.  <br />This is a sad tale.  A man who only wanted a few choice things in his life, Nicholas has a way of screwing those things up so that even if he gets them, it doesn't make him happy.  He's not a particularly likable fellow although there are certain things about him that make you at least understand him.  It was somewhat refreshing not to have to read about a perfect person since so few of those exist in real life!  <br />I enjoyed reading this book and was pleased with the skill used in telling the story.  Anita Shreve gets my vote for a job well done.	2003-05-10

I want something to entertain me without insulting me as a reader.  This novel does just that.

Renee Zellwiger will be perfectly cast in the lead role.  This book is funny, brilliant, exciting, and enjoyable.  You have to like Kate Reddy and you have to laugh and commiserate with her as she faces all the problems of a talented executive as well as those of a wife and mother who is losing it fast. Even though this is the story of a working mom (mum), you will like this even if you aren't.  My days of small children are long gone, but I still enjoyed this tremendously.<br />There's nothing particularly deep about this book.  It's just good entertainment.  If you have a few days off, a long week-end at the beach, or just want something to fill the time between important matters, pick this one up.  It's quick and easy and will keep your interest.	2002-12-16

Well, it turns out those were three pretty lousy reasons for reading a book.  Oh, I read it.  I guess primarily because it was kind of interesting to read the references to familiar things.  The church ladies were certainly familiar.  If Cassandra King isn't a minister's daughter or former minister's wife, she sure had an inside view to what goes on in the parsonage.  The descriptions of Florida were good too.  But the plot was predictable and overly complicated for something that just wasn't that difficult.  It wasn't a bad story, but for my tastes it needed to be better edited. There were too many details about things that just didn't matter.  I want to know what the people are thinking and feeling, not about how long the trip is between Sarasota and Crystal River.  But we got both and sometimes not enough of the thinking and feeling.  Ben Lynch, Dean's self-centered minister husband was so one-dimensional that there were times I wondered why he was even in this story.  <br />Don't read this if you want good southern fiction.  I'm sorry to say, it's not.	2002-09-28

I read some of the other reviews of Carol Shields' novel UNLESS and wondered what on earth they were talking about.  Maybe that's another review though, and one which has no purpose in this medium.  <br />This is what I &quot;got&quot; from UNLESS and it just seems so different from what some of the other reviewers got.  Women are still treated as inferiors in this world and because of that Reta's oldest daughter Norah is now sitting on a Toronto street corner with a sign around her neck.  Women are not recognized for their worth.  This is what I hear Carol Shields telling us.  Or was that Reta Winters?  Whoever.  I heard it and it's so true.  I had lunch today with the father of a friend who twice called me, &quot;My dear,&quot; in a tone so condescending that if he weren't my friend's father, I would have left and never had another conversation with him. Why does he talk down to me?  Because he fails to value women.  Why does he fail to value women?  I'm not sure.<br />Do all men think this way?  Absolutely not.  But the majority of society does, has, and will continue to do so.  Norah's statement of goodness, the sign she wears around her neck as she sits on her corner day after day after day, is not meant to change the world but to change her feelings that the world isn't good and especially isn't good to women.  There will be many detractors of this belief, but most of them will be men or people living on another planet.  <br />Perhaps I've oversimplified this but I could probably write a thesis on much of what I'm hearing and thinking because of reading this novel.  This is an important book in many ways and one you need to read with your eyes and your mind wide open.  <br />I am saying all of this because Carol Shields' book made me think about this.  This isn't a story without a plot as one review said.  The plot is there for all of us to see if we're just willing to look.	2002-07-27

I've always enjoyed the way she creates relationships in her books, whether it's platonic, romantic, or even the &quot;old married couple.&quot;  She does it well and continues to do it well here.<br />This is not a romance novel.  It's not a novel that takes you where you think it will, with two people utterly and totally in love with one another and giving up everything they love to be together.  How refreshing!  Henry and Gillon have their own interests, their own lives.  They have found a passion in their lives and it isn't based on another person.  I found this to be inspiring.  And a good lesson for those who think you can only find happiness when you find the right person.  <br />This is different because it takes place in South Carolina (one of my favorite states) and England.  An interesting change and even though there were times when the southerners spoke like they'd been raised in London, it wasn't something that detracted from the novel's plot or point.  <br />I found GIRL FROM THE SOUTH to have a more modern attitude of relationships.  She introduced us to individuals who were still searching but learning their way through life with intelligence and adventure. <br />I liked it.  No disappointments for me at all.	2002-07-01

In THE BUFFALO SOLDIER, a story about grief, marital strife, friendship and neighbors, and the sad past of a little boy trying to survive in the foster care system, Bohjalian manages to pull the reader into the stream of the story easily.  <br />The death of their twin girls has naturally changed Laura and Terry and even two years later we watch as they both continue to deal with their grief, albeit in very different ways.  Terry, the cop, and Laura, the animal shelter supervisor, are going to react differently to this tragedy and it's interesting how their job choices reflect their reactions.  Bohjalian does this in a very realistic way.  Terry wants to be able to control his life, take charge, make things right.  This is a very accurate portrayal for a dedicated law enforcement officer.  Laura brings another child in their life, Alfred, an African American boy.  Not only is this a challenge because his years in foster care have left him distrustful of most everyone, but they are living in Vermont where there are very few other African Americans.  <br />Just as it is Laura's nature to want to help others, protect and love those who don't have someone to care for them, it is Terry's nature to want life to feel more normal, even though he knows it never can.<br />I was a little disturbed with the ending.  It ends well but there were a few questions left unanswered for me.  Perhaps Bohjalian is thinking of a sequel in the years to come.  Or maybe we can fill in the blanks ourselves.<br />At any rate, this is another good story by Chris Bohjalian as he continues to make interesting stories from unusual circumstances come alive.	2002-06-09

What courage it took for her to write this, letting everyone not only understand but feel the pain she lived.  It amazed me that she was able to write about the terror and the sordidness of her life without leaving out the details and without turning it into a slimy expose of her experiences.  Don't misunderstand, she is very open, not sugar-coating these experiences, but her way of expressing them is remarkable.  Katie, her faithful dog, gets us through her story just as she got Connie through those years or abuse.  We always know that no matter how horrible it gets, Katie will be there for her.  Connie May Fowler's story will inspire you.  This is wonderful work!	2002-03-19

I love to read a good short story and was not disappointed with any in this book.  She shows us how even an ordinary life can be remarkable, how something as simple as sharing a story, looking in the mirror, or saying a few words at the right time can make our lives extraordinary, even if only for a moment.  Elizabeth Berg's world is our world, not one that exists only on soap operas or in the movies.  She is one of us and reading her words brings her right into your home where you feel you could welcome her with a cup of tea and some interesting conversation.  Perhaps these stories reflect an ordinary life, but they are written exquisitely.	2002-03-02

Lily, a fourteen year old girl growing up in South Carolina in the sixties, escapes the abuse of her father and ends up living with the Boatwright sisters.  The story of beekeeping and how it relates to our lives is fascinating.  Lily is searching for her mother's past, a mother who was shot and killed when Lily was only four years old.  August Boatwright offers Lily a place to be safe.  August's sisters, May and June, provide an interesting background to the story along with Lily's fugitive housekeeper, Rosaleen.  I thoroughly enjoyed the southern side to this story, a behind the scenes look at what might have happened when the Civil Rights Act was signed in 1964.  This book is appropriate for all ages of women, from teen-agers on up.  It teaches us so many lessons about race, religion, and the strength we all have within us but may not recognize without some guidance.<br />A side note - the cover of THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES is exquisite.  I would love to have a poster of this cover on a wall in my home.	2002-02-17

Although I should've read this book when it first came out, I'm glad I waited until now. Jonah Moran has Asperger's Syndrome and two years ago I wouldn't have had a clue as to what this was all about. In the past month I have done a lot of research on this syndrome since the child of a friend was diagnosed with it. I had no idea this book referred to A.S. until I started to read it. When they say there are no accidents, they're right. <br />Back to the story though - this is a wonderful book. I loved Ms. Reynolds' first novel and was not disappointed with this one. Although there are some complex twists and turns to the plot, she manages them with ease and clarity. The relationships between Jessica and her family are realistic & well-developed and the changes that take place are logical. I've spent very little time in the Pacific Northwest, but I enjoyed reading about the area and the Native American side of the story makes it even more interesting. <br />I place Marjorie Reynolds right up there with Elizabeth Berg, Jane Smiley, and Anita Shreve in her ability to tell a good story about people you'd like to know.	2002-01-22

This novel, like all of hers, is compelling and interesting, keeping you on your toes throughout.  I liked THE OTHER EXTREME especially because I love the setting, Tango Key, an imaginary island in the Florida Keys created in some of her earlier books (written under the name Alison Drake).  This book is full of suspense and intrigue, but more than that, it's full of personality.  Kit Parrish and her son Ryan are easy to like people you would enjoy knowing in real life, something absolutely necessary in a good novel.  Even though this is a murder mystery, the mystery is solved almost immediately producing a unique twist to grab the reader's attention so that we must keep reading to find out if the real killer is discovered or if the innocent party ends up convicted and jailed.  The subplots are equally good and all the stories come together in the end like a well-made meal.  You will finish this book without being hungry for anything else than another T. J. MacGregor novel.  <br />MacGregor's use of astrology and past life experiences is done well and with obvious knowledge.  Many of her novels include this new age side to them which is now very popular, but MacGregor was ahead of her time, including it in her early novels nearly 20 years ago.  <br />This is a great book to take to read on the airplane, at the beach, while waiting for the dentist, during your lunch hour, heck, any time is a good time for THE OTHER EXTREME.	2002-01-17

Piper has been hurt by everyone who ever loved her with the exception of her brother Quinn and her best friend Becca, both of whom come back into her life as she comes closer to its end.  Read this book if you care about people's feelings.  Read this book if you love words which join together like the stitches of an afghan as they create a story which you're sure was written just for you.  If you haven't read anything else by T.

Eleanor, Freddie, and JoNell have seen their share of death and disappointment and are now at a turning point in each of their lives.  You'll love all three of them, as well as Minerva, the grandmother who raised them.  I am definitely a Michael Lee West fan after reading AMERICAN PIE and CRAZY LADIES.

I have read everything Sue Miller has written and have enjoyed some of her books more than others.  Her latest work is just okay.  It's written well.  It wasn't necessarily boring.  It just didn't have the punch that I want in a book.  I like stories that weave the past into the present as this does.  Other authors have been masterful using this style.  Again, Sue Miller did it all right, but it just wasn't great.  It was &quot;okay.&quot;  Throughout the book I searched for the plot, the true storyline.  Fifty-something Cath has returned to her grandparents' home in Vermont to see if she wants to live there as opposed to her home in San Francisco.  She discovers diaries written by Georgia, her grandmother, and unlocks some secrets about her grandparents and their life together.  <br />As a young girl Georgia contracted TB and was sent to a sanitarium to recover.  Although this is a big part of the story, it became grim and depressing to read about people coughing and vomiting and, in some cases, dying.  <br />I did enjoy Cath's daughters, Karen who is pregnant with her first child and spends the entire book in bed waiting for the baby to be born, and Fiona who might be the only spark of energy in the entire book.  But we only get a glimpse of these two young women.  <br />It's not a bad book, and I finished it without a fight, but if it stays on my bookshelf, it won't be read again.  She's done better.	2001-10-19

Although she has done the right thing, the moral thing, she begins to regret her actions as she watches the waves of change begin to affect everyone around her.  Perhaps we've all known a couple whose love seems to be almost ethereal, untouchable.  Jorie and Ethan Ford have a love like this.  Even after 13 years of marriage, they still worship one another.  But when he is arrested for a murder which took place in another state before they met, Jorie's view of life begins to evolve into a harsh reality where the past meets the present.  <br />Hoffman's use of nature to describe emotions continues to work for me.  She easily charms and entices us with her descriptions of food and nature to set the mood.  Sweet lemonade and chocolate cake and the sound of cicadas and the smell of mimosa.  I want to stop what I'm doing and go outside to see if I can experience these things first hand, to see if I can discover something in the darkness of the night that defines my life as easily as she defines the lives of Jorie and Ethan, of Charlotte and Barney, of Kat and Collie, of Rosarie.   <br />There is a certain degree of cynicism within me that wonders if people really would be as supportive of Ethan Ford and his past as those of Monroe, Massachusetts were.  But this is a story and it is New England and maybe the years I've spent working in a prison have made me all too realistic (or cynical).  <br />Having said that, I urge you to read BLUE DIARY if you enjoy Alice Hoffman or if you're looking for a new author to explore.  She continues to bring us stories of people we wish we knew if we don't already.	2001-09-04

This is more than a story about a smoke jumper, more than a story about love. This is a story about friendship, spirituality, and courage. It's about abandonment and individuality. It's about sadness and it's about hope. The author is a good storyteller and even though the course of the story is diverse and unusual, he never loses the reader as he goes from one person to the next, from one continent to another, painting pictures of their lives through his words. While Connor is off photographing pictures across the ocean, Julia and Ed are living a quiet, &quot;normal&quot; life in Montana. But each of them is creating a mosaic of his or her life with the pieces that were left scattered behind them as they moved along. Life is a series of events, some connected, some not. Evans tells about the events in the lives of Connor, Ed, &amp; Julia and pulls it all together into something that will stay with you for a long time.	2001-08-26

In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would like this book.  Was I going to read another book about southern women who were outspoken and cranky in public, drank too much bourbon in the moonlight, and were pious towards God, country, and men?  Nope.  Not this time.  The Moon women (their last name) are much more than some stereotype of the south.  As you read and come to know them, you see what has troubled them, what has made them happy, what has made them the women they are.  <br />This is not a funny novel.  Ruth Ann's 20 year old daughter Ashley comes home from drug rehab on the same day her 82 year old mother Marvella decides she's going to move in with Ruth Ann.  No one is more surprised than I am when the lives of these women and their men become more interesting than watching a baseball game.  <br />Marvella's memories are woven into the present-day story in a subtle manner which makes the reader become more and more curious about the ramblings and outbursts towards her family. <br />Give this novel a chance.  It has nothing to do with the Moon or astronauts.  It has to do with love and independence and time, the great healer.	2001-08-12

It was August, a hot, dry day.&quot;  And you continue reading as you head to the check out counter (or click your mouse to add it to your shopping cart).  THE LIGHT OF FALLING STARS is one of those books for me.  A first novel for J. Robert Lennon, I first read it three years ago, just before my first trip to Montana where this book just happens to take place.<br />The book carries you through the aftermath of the plane crash and its effects on the people in Marshall, Montana.  You come to know them on a level that is both intimate and real through Lennon's descriptive and easy-flowing prose and dialogue.<br />This is a book you'll be glad you found.	2001-08-11

The words languished on a computer disk until they finally disappeared, a slow and quiet death.  But I knew I had a novel inside of me.  Don't we all?  I wanted to write.  I wanted to get the words out, to get the story told, to finish what I started.  I wanted to be motivated and inspired. Anne Lamott's BIRD BY BIRD managed to do this for me.   I read the book and when I finished I started writing again and didn't stop until the book was finished.  I didn't read anything else during that time.  I just wrote and wrote, word by word, bird by bird.  <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who feels discouraged about what they are writing or for those who think they could write but just haven't tackled it yet.  Give it a shot!	2001-08-03

Although Ms. DeMarco is a screenwriter, a seasoned writer, I believe this is her first novel.  I like first novels because they seem to be written in a more carefree, heartfelt voice. They seem more personal.  This book does not deviate from my opinion of first novels. <br />Diana's life has taken a few bad turns and she's looking for an out.  Her boyfriend has run off with a younger girl and she's not real happy about that.  But when her entire family is killed in a car accident in South Jersey she knows she has more than she can handle in her life.  Diana escapes her well-meaning friends, aunt, and uncle in New York and drives her Volvo to the Pine Barrens of South Jersey where she meets Louisa when she hits Louisa's grandmother.  Diana is thrown into an uneasy and unsteady friendship with the brash and brainy Louisa over the course of a few days.  Both truths and untruths are revealed about their pasts.<br />This isn't a great book in the sense that I will always remember it, but it's a good book in the sense that I enjoyed reading it. I liked learning a little bit more about the mystical state of New Jersey.  Yes, I said, &quot;mystical.&quot;  DeMarco takes us into the wilds of New Jersey (yes, I said, &quot;wilds of New Jersey&quot; - aren't you listening?) creating an entirely different image for a state that most of us know only through watching The Sopranos or hurrying through it in an attempt to get to some place more exciting.<br />If this is made into a movie, as I understand it will be, I will go see it and will enjoy watching the tug of war between Diana and Louisa as well as discovering the beauty of New Jersey in  scenes I hope are filmed on location.<br />If you want something new and different, read CRANBERRY QUEEN.  It's berry good.  (Yes, I said, &quot;berry!)	2001-08-02

THE TIME GARDEN was always one of my favorites (oh, okay, I admit it - I like all of Edward Eager's books and can't really pick a favorite).  Roger, Ann, Eliza, and Jack encounter time traveling at its finest when they are exiled to spend the summer with old Mrs. Whiton.  An interesting note, their mothers were two of the children in HALF MAGIC and MAGIC BY THE LAKE also by Eager.  A bank of wild thyme in the garden opens doors to the past, present and future for these four delightful children.  If it's imagination you are looking for, look no further.  Edward Eager's books are witty and wild and funny.  There is a certain degree of sophistication in his style of writing that makes these stories interesting even for the mature reader.	2001-07-11

Now that my own &quot;kid&quot; is 21 and in college, I still love Edward Eager's books.  So does he!  It's been decades since I read HALF MAGIC for the first time and the story has stayed with me.  Four children find a magic talisman and go on wonderful adventures.  The concept is simple and the story captures you easily.  There is no wizardry, no scary characters.  Just real kids stumbling upon real magic and what happens to them.  And on that note I will recommend another Eager book SEVEN DAY MAGIC which is based on that very premise.  Please read these books.  They are timeless and lovely.	2001-07-11

The concept of the story is excellent.  Does adoption lessen the degree of importance in family ties?  Should an adopted sibling have fewer rights than a blood sibling/relative?  Where is King Solomon when we need him?  <br />The only problem is that the story tends to get lost in the explanation.  Too many characters who are not developed in a way that connects with the reader makes this a trying and not so enjoyable read.  I would read a name and have to stop and try to figure out who the person was (one of the attorneys?  the guardian ad litem? a relative?).  Or I would read a name and it was the wrong name due to poor editing.  Pages would go by where we were forced to follow the thought patterns of Georgia's brother Gordon.  These thoughts often stifled the flow of the story.  <br />There were moving moments in this book, but they were fragmented and misplaced.  Often I would expect things to pick up only to be let down again, like a car that won't start that suddenly catches, giving you hope before it dies again.  <br />I'm glad I read this book only because it will make me think twice before I read Mitchard's next book.	2001-07-04

The complexity of the story is told with simplicity making it all the more touching and real.  Myra has lived her life failing to recognize the amount of love she has spread to others through her nursing duties.  When she and Chip are &quot;reunited&quot; after he has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, she allows herself to feel a love that had been kept on a shelf for decades.  This is a complex story because of the walls Myra has built around her heart all of her life.  As Chip loses strength and moves towards his own passing, he leaves Myra with a gift by breaking down these walls, appropriately enough, &quot;chipping&quot; away at the veneer of her lonely life to allow her to see herself and, better yet, feel the love that has been there all along.  I loved the other patients, especially DeWitt and Grace and Mrs. Fisher.  And I loved what Chip does for Myra when they go to Boston.  I don't want to spoil that for you.  I'll just say it was a truly inspirational moment in the book for anyone who fails to realize how many lives you touch. Elizabeth Berg has taken death, a melancholy subject, and brought new depth to it.  Thank you, Ms. Berg, for another amazing story and for bringing Myra and her friends into our lives.	2001-06-24

It reads like the journals of the four women who come together to mend their lives before taking off again.  They are smart enough to know the right thing to do but end up making some choices which result in emotional chaos in their lives.  I am smitten with each of them--Phoebe in her wheelchair; Ness and her horse, Leroy; Beryl and her dark prison past; and Nance.  Nance who is probably the most like me.  You will relate to every one of these women and you won't want to leave them when the book ends.  This is a story of friendship, loyalty, and spirit.  A true testimony to what women everywhere long for, if only for a week, a month, or a year.  My first Jo-Ann Mapson novel but not my last.	2001-05-18

The story is told as a narrative in a way that you know how each person thinks and feels.  I found myself captured by the essence of the story, by the sadness as Molly is insidiously abandoned by her mother and her sister, by the joy that Gary brings back into her life.  I've never read any of Carolyn Leavitt's books before and might not have noticed this one had it not been for the cover.  At first, I thought it was one of those shallow stories about a woman who has a baby and gets sick and is then miraculously cured.  This book is anything but shallow.  It's very real and very good.  I was reminded of Alice Hoffman's style, the words wrapping around me like a friendly voice, Leavitt's phrases pleasing me like a warm cup of tea.  There were nights when I would wake up after midnight thinking of Molly and Gary and Otis.  I'd turn on the light and reach for COMING BACK TO ME to read a few pages before I'd fall back to sleep again.  <br />If you like Elizabeth Berg, Cathie Pelletier, Anita Shreve, or Alice Hoffman, you deserve to give yourself a gift by reading this book.	2001-04-15

This is a story about a family of women who live just outside the norm.  Miss Gussie is strong and practical but lives her entire life under a cloud of fear that a dark secret will one day be revealed.  Her daughters, Dorothy and Clancy Jane, are both interesting and quirky.  Whatever dark seed was planted in Dorothy continues to insinuate itself into her perceptions of life.  Clancy Jane makes mistakes but she knows about love and commitment and fighting her own demons.  Their daughters, Dorothy's Bitsy and Clancy's Violet, are both grappling with the realities of life and love, growing up with different expectations and ideas about their futures only to end up more similar than anyone could have imagined.  The sixties are woven into the story like threads of gold and silver in an intricate brocade with the use of authentic lyrics and events.  Michael Lee West tells us a story that moves easily along its way, taking us on a trip which makes us feel the sorrow and joy of these crazy women.	2001-04-07

This is my first novel by Shelby Hearon but not my last.  I loved the characters in ELLA IN BLOOM.  Ella is lovely.  A little lost but very real.  In her eyes she has gone through life in second place--the younger daughter falling in love with her older sister's cast-off boyfriend who gave her nothing but an interesting daughter, Birdie.  I like how the story works.  Hearon is successful at developing the sexual chemistry between Ella and her man (who I won't name here because I don't want to spoil it for you).  This novel won't disappoint you.	2001-02-25

I started the book and learned more about picking cotton than I'd ever wanted to know. I decided I never, in my life, want to pick cotton. Just when I thought I'd read enough about this topic, the book begins to move the way Grisham knows how to make a story flow. If you are sick of slick lawyers and profanity (and if The Brethern left you feeling slightly dismayed as it did me), you are going to love this book. My friend Jimmy, who likes a good read as much as you and I do, was a bit suspicious at what he'd heard about A PAINTED HOUSE. &quot;But does it make you want to keep reading? Is it a page turner?&quot; he asked me. A resounding &quot;YES!&quot; from this reader. I wanted to know what was going to happen between Tally and Cowboy, the Hill people's daughter and one of the Mexican pickers. I wanted to know how far Hank would go with his tendency to be not only mean but violent. What was going on at the Latcher's, I asked myself. What was Trot doing when everyone else was picking cotton? And would the crop get in or would there be a flood? This just might be my favorite Grisham novel. Seven year old Luke, the narrator, is an easy blend of sophistication and naivete and Grisham's love of baseball, which matches mine, makes for an enjoyable sideline to the reality of living in rural Arkansas in the early 1950s. When Grisham wrote this he was not only pitching a perfect game, he was batting clean-up as well. Get it today!	2001-02-24

I have read all of Jane Hamilton's books from the very beginning (even before Oprah told us to), but this one was a struggle for me.  The premise of the story is timely.  Henry Shaw discovers his mother is having an online relationship with a man she met in person at a family wedding.  As a teen-ager he is going through his own personal struggles with the world as he watches his mother change before his eyes.  He reads her e-mails to and from her lover by secretly accessing her internet account.  He and his younger sister, a lesbian in the making who lives her life as a Civil War soldier while fighting the inevitable (growing breasts and feminine beauty) actually travel with Beth Shaw to meet the lover.  I found the book interesting enough to continue to read but only after coming to terms with Henry's constant changes in his reference to his mother.  He calls her many names to mirror the many roles she plays--wife, daughter, mother, musician, adulterer.  <br />It is a story about feelings, confusion, deception, and even love.  Although I am a big fan of Jane Hamilton and will continue to look forward to her books, I liked her first three a lot better than this one.	2001-01-30

I just discovered this new and incredibly talented writer and am already looking forward to her next book.  BREATHING WATER takes us into the fractured world of Effie Greer who has come home to the family's camp by the lake to heal.  There's a magical quality to the story which Ms. Greenwood maintains throughout the book.  When I wasn't reading this book, when I was at work or driving to the store, I would think about the characters, wishing I could get home and read more.  I didn't want the story to end and yet I wanted Effie to discover peace and to leave behind the sadness that enveloped her.  Ms. Greenwood's second novel, NEARER THAN THE SKY, is equally compelling.  These are stories that will stay with you for a long time.	2001-01-22

It doesn't happen often.  Certainly not every monthand not even once a year.  I remember when I discovered CathiePelletier and read all of her novels, one after the other.  IfT. Greenwood had more than just NEARER THAN THE SKY and BREATHINGWATER, they'd be on my bookshelf or stacked next to my bed.  In NEARERTHAN THE SKY, not only does she handle a delicate subject in a waythat no one ever has, but she brings a sense of enlightenment to thoseof us who might not understand the behavior of Indie Brown's motherand sister.  Everyone hurts the ones they love, but most of us don'tdo it by attempting to smother them.  As Indie reveals her own fears,she is released from them at the same time.  This is a remarkable bookthat you won't be able to put down once you begin or forget once thelast word is read...	2001-01-14

Surely I'm not the only person in this particular region of Florida who enjoys a good read which takes place in Maine.  Strawberries in the Sea takes us into Jamie Sorensen's adult life as Rosa Fleming moves onto Bennett's Island after taking off with her ex-husband's lobster boat to set up traps of her own.  For those of you who know Joanna Bennett Sorensen, you recognize a woman who Joanna would find admirable and brave.  As Rosa runs away from the demons of her first marriage, she faces them at the same time, dealing with issues of her weight, her tendency to love too much, and her success at lobstering.  I love Bennett's Island and re-visit it often by reading these books again and again even when I have a new release by a current author sitting prettily on my bookcase.  Elisabeth Ogilvie brings us into the world of her characters and lets us know them as well as she does.  If you've never heard of the Bennetts and the Sorensens; if you've missed the early years of their lives and never imagined meeting Owen and Mark and Stevie Bennett or having a mug-up with one of them on a stormy afternoon, then it's time to change all that.	2000-10-25

This book has been on my shelf for quite some time, waiting for me to delve into it.  I never should have waited so long.  Hannah, elderly now, tells us about a summer long ago when she was just a girl and fell in love with Conary Crocker.  It was the summer her stepmother rented the old schoolhouse in Dundee, Maine, the schoolhouse which had been on the island where a murder had taken place 50 years before.  Artfully woven into a tapestry of intrigue, the stories become one as the tales unfold.  Although I am a constant reader, I seldom stay up past my bedtime to read, but this book was the exception.  Ms. Gutcheon has not only changed her style from previous novels, she has proven herself to be a master story teller.  I've always enjoyed her work, but this was the first time I finished one of her books, closed it carefully, and sat quietly to contemplate what I'd read.	2000-10-18

The guys aren't bad, but the women I read (Jane Hamilton, Beth Gutcheon, Anne Tyler, Ann Hood, Elinor Lipman, Carolyn Chute, Alice Hoffman, Connie May Fowler, Cathie Pelletier---well, I could go on and on but I only get 1,000 words) are just so much more in touch with feelings and the value of those feelings.  Sure, Samantha goes off the deep end when her husband leaves, going to Tiffany's and spending thousands of dollars on things she doesn't need.  But she soon realizes that this isn't the answer.  This is a woman who didn't know what made her happy because she thought her happiness resided inside her marriage.  We've read that hope floats, well so does the travesty of a marriage built on one-sided giving.  At least until reality sets in.  Elizabeth Berg's story ends in a way that leaves you feeling good.  A success instead of a failure.  Joy instead of sorrow.  Fulfillment instead of hope.  Bottom line:  I liked this story.  A lot.	2000-10-18

Seven Day Magic is a must-read for any child who has an  imagination (what child doesn't, is what I want to know!).  As you travel  through this story with Susan, John, Barnaby, Abbie, and Fredericka you  find yourself hoping the next book you check out from the library has the  same magical formula as the one they find.

When I read a book by Alice  Hoffman I am transported into the world of which she writes.  THE RIVER  KING was no exception.  I could smell the roses that grew on the grounds of  the Haddan School, feel the pain of Gus and Carlin, of Betsy and Abel, of  Helen Davis and her false love.  When you read an  Alice Hoffman novel you  are never left behind.  Her words invite you into the story and as you  settle comfortably into place you are amazed and dismayed when you realize  there are only a few pages left to read.  THE RIVER KING is magical in a  way only Alice Hoffman can create magic.  Her ability to spin a tale of  love and mystery and sadness and joy is unmatched.	2000-08-05
