While this book is not really a part of this series, it is kind of a spinoff. Nikki Day appeared along with her twin sister Belle, in some of the books from the series when their Mom married Squire Clay, the patriarch of the Double C. Nikki Day, who is pregnant by another man, but secretly in love with her former boss Alex, wakes up in a hospital only to find him there. When the Dr. confines her to bed rest, Alex takes on the job of taking care of her. The best part of the book was the couple of pages when the Clay clan showed up at Nikki's apartment. It was nice seeing all of them mentioned, but the rest of the book was just ok. Not at all one for the keeper shelf as most of her books usually are for me, especially the first 3 books she wrote. I would love to see this author do another ranch setting series. She is a pro at writing about brooding cowboys. This book was just not that special.	2005-09-15

Toni Blake's writing style is one that you will come back for time after time. She has the ability to create characters who live in your mind long after the last page is read. Jake is a tortured hero with a haunted past and Stephanie is a determined woman who comes to New Orleans to look for her younger sister. The storyline that weaves around these characters is breathtaking. The added bonus to the story with the addition of Shondra, a teenage runaway, was great. Also, the detailed description of New Orleans as well as Jake's Cajun accent made this book an awesome late summer read. I'll be waiting in line for this author's next book!	2005-08-30

First of all, I am a huge SEP fan and have most of her books on my keeper shelf and have read each one several times. However, I regret the hardcover price that I paid for this one. The storyline was ok, and had some amusing moments, but it was far from what I have come to expect from this talented author. One of the quotes that I read prior to this book coming out was that \\"this is her funniest book yet\\". I personally found that to be way off base. This book is not in the same laugh out loud funny league as most of her other books from the \\"Stars\\" series. I agree with another reviewer when they said at times the secondary characters seemed more interesting and should have been given more page time. I have to agree. While there was little acted upon sexual tension between the main characters, Annabelle and Heath, the situation between Portia and Bodie was scorching. Again, it was an ok read, but one I would have rather picked up in paperback.	2005-08-16

This was my first book by author Catherine Snodgrass, but it will not be my last! This book lacked nothing and has characters that will live on long after the last page is read. Grace Marshall and Jake Tanner come together when Jake comes to the Marshall farm to collect on a debt owed to the Tanner Brothers by Grace's Father. The debt? The price of one Milk Cow. The Marshalls are a poor family and can't pay for the cow, so the father and Jake agree that the oldest daugher, Grace would come to the Tanner farm for 1 year and work off the debt as the new housekeeper. Grace's mother will settle for no less than marriage for her plain, clumsy daughter. Jake reluctantly agrees, knowing that he and his brother A.J and all of their children, need a woman in the home. This is a wonderfully written story full of strong characters that come to life from page one and a must read for any fan of western historical fiction, or those who simply are looking for a memorable story that touches your heart!	2005-03-06

As someone who has read and enjoyed each book this Author has written, I must say that Toni Blake's transition from Catagory Romance to Single Title brings the talent that she has shown in previous writing to it's fullest potential. \\"The Red Diary\\" is wonderfully written, and combines all the best aspects of a truly good book. Nick has a stormy past and holds Lauren's Father responsible for it all. What starts off as a means of revenge turns into something that keeps you turning pages until the end. The story that weaves around these characters is one that will touch you deeply, and will definately earn a spot on the keeper shelf!	2004-10-12

Belle Day accepts a job as a live-in physical therapist to the daughter of Cage Buchanan. Cage suffered a loss in his past and has held a grudge against Belle's family for years. Having someone he considered the enemy under his roof bothered him..especially when where he really wanted her, was in his bedroom.....I was excited to hear that this was being released. Fans of the Men of the Double C series fell in love with the Clay family, which Belle became a member of when her mother married Squire Clay. This book was wonderfully written and was not lacking in any way. My biggest dissapointment is the only Clays mentioned by name, besides Squire, were Tristan and Sawyer. The best books written in this series were the stories of Jefferson, Matthew and Daniel, and not to see these characters mentioned by name was dissapointing. Although this book is not in the same league as \\"Stay\\", it is a worthy addition to this series and a must read.	2004-09-16

I personally don't see why this book is getting so many low reviews. It seems the biggest complaints are the lack of romance and too much &quot;fiction&quot;. This book had all of the elements of a good story, with several twist and raw scenes of the old west that make a western historical fiction so engaging. True, there was not tons of sappy romance, but the readers need to remember that these boys are marrying to gain a ranch, not for love, but I did not find it lacking in &quot;romance&quot;. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the situation with Angus and Concepcion. I love the fact that these two married after so many years, but the announcement that they were expecting a baby was a bit out there, given their age. (Angus is pushing 80).   Otherwise, the book is worth the read, and one that does not deserve the low ratings.	2004-06-28

I have been a long time fan of Palmer, and have many of her titles on my keeper shelf, but I honestly cannot believe that Harlequin printed this book. As always, we have the innocent virgin heroine who has a &quot;case&quot; on the arrogant rude hero who is always a &quot;dish&quot;. I overlooked these type references from books that were published in the 70's but, honestly, do people still talk like this? After reading Lawless, I was so encouraged because the writing style seemed new and refreshing. But something else that was very confusing after reading Lawless was the mention of Cash and Tippy. When we last saw Cash in Lawless, He and Tippy were just starting to seem interested in each other. In this book, Tippy has already lost Cash's baby and Cash saved her from being kidnapped. What?! Did I miss something? I'll sum this all up by saying that if you like all of Diana's stories with the same type of hero and heroine as always, with mention of Archeology, or going to see the new Mystery or Science Fiction movie, with language that is laughably outdateable, then by all means this is a must read. For the rest, if you have read one of her older titles, just imagine that story with these characters names.	2004-05-02

I have been a fan of Lorraine Heath's writing since reading her Texas series. I was reluctant to pay the high price for this hard to find book, but gave in and did. After reading it, I would have paid even more!! Rarely has a story touched me as much as this one did. Charles Lawson, a widower who loved his late wife very much, wanted to find a woman who would raise his children and love them as a Mother would. He found that in Maddie, when he rescued the desperate girl from giving herself to the highest bidder in a Texas brothel. He marries  Maddie and takes her home to the Inn that he shares with his 3 young children and his older brother Jesse, a retired Texas Ranger. From that point on, you get lost in this story full of secrets, suprises, and a dying man's gifts to his beloved family. This book had an unusual situation with having two heros, but was tastefully written and beautifully carried out. This story is a must read, and is sure to find it's way onto your keeper shelf and into your heart!	2004-04-17

If you are an avid reader and crave those books that are hard to put down, this one's for you. There was not one part of this book that was lacking. James Kagen, who lost the love of his life in a train wreck before they married, vowed that he would never love another. Elizabeth Beck is a young 17 year old girl who has lost each member of her family on a wagon trip from TN. They come together and James convinces her to marry him, and makes sure that she understands that love will never be involved. Both main and secondary characters in this book were well developed and a pleasure to read. The heroine has many insecurites, but in no way is she a weakling, and is actually the strongest character. Suprises and storytwist have you loving the hero one minute, and wanting to shake him the next. A most memorable book and definately one for the keeper shelf.	2004-04-04

While not having the laugh out loud parts that many of this author's books have, there still is the classic humor that lives in all of her books. This was an extremely satisfying read, and each and every character was so thouroughly developed, you felt as if you were right there with them. I won't go into the storyline details, as that has been taken care of in other reviews, but this truly is a story of strength, redemption, and a lesson that people are not always as they seem. Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of those gifted authors who can have you smiling on one page, and fighting back tears on the next. Well done! A must read!	2004-02-24

Kane Wright was definately the selling point of this book. His character alone made it worth the read. That's about it. Parts of the storyline were choppy, leaving this reader having to turn back a few pages to see if I missed something.The best parts of the book were when Kane would make up names for what A.J. stood for.

I found the story to move extremely slow and at times was just plain boring.

This book didn't do it for me, and was no where near worth $14.95.	2003-10-09

I admit I had second thoughts on pre-ordering and paying for the hardback version of this book after being dissapointed with \\"Desperado\\", but being an avid Palmer fan I bit the bullet and hoped for the best. I'm glad I did. This book's style is \\"classic Palmer\\" without being stale, and repeating sayings and scenes from previous books. The story of Judd and Chrissy is a page turner! The characters each stand on their own and even though the heroine is young and innocent, as most Palmer heroines are, she does not come across as a wimp. Judd is a character who is strong-willed, but completely loveable. Coupled with the wonderful love story, hint of a story with the secondary characters and a murder mystery thrown in, makes this a wonderful read. One of the best things about this book is that Palmer managed to keep her unique writing style while updating it at the same time. Awesome read!	2003-06-30

Like another reviewer said, both stories are great and packed with laughs, but I too enjoyed &quot;Mad About Mindy..and Mandy&quot;, a little more. Perhaps, that is because that any book written by Toni Blake is a must grab for me! Her stories never dissapoint, and always have characters who pull you in and keep you entertained to the last page. Mindy/Mandy and Benton's story is lighthearted, funny romance at it's best. If this is your first time reading Toni Blake, I highly recommend her Harlequin Temptation titles, &quot;Hotbed Honey&quot;, &quot;Something Wild&quot; and &quot;Seducing Summer&quot;.	2003-05-10

I absolutely love Catherine Anderson and although this will not be among my favorites of hers, it was still a good read, with strong characters. Tucker and Ellie Grant divorced after the death of their oldest son, whom each felt guilt and blame over the tragic accident that killed him. 3 years later, the two remaining sons, run away into the mountains refusing to come back until their parents get back together, forcing Tucker and Ellie to spend time together tracking the boys to the place where they used to camp as a family. All along the way, they fight their old feelings, and discover some unknown truths about each other and thier family.....This story has some highly emotional moments which is the strength of the book. Usually, I re-read all of Anderson's books at least once, but for some reason, this one didn't pack the punch for me that her other stories have in the past. Still a good read, and one that I would recommend.	2002-08-06

Let me start by saying that I am a devoted Diana Palmer fan, and truly enjoyed most of her older titles with the arrogant alpha hero, and the young vulnerable heroine. Diana seemed to make it work somehow. Now, it's just stale. \\"Desperado\\" is the long awaited story of Cord Romero. That's where the suspense ends. The storyline involved Cord and his Foster Sister Maggie, who worked with the Lassiter Agency (from previous books) to bring down a Child Labor Ring. Maggie had a secret from her past that tied in well with Child Exploitation, but the writing style prevented it from bringing the story to have the impact that it should have. The sex scenes in recent books, are all the same. It's more like sex education, and quite frankly, I feel that all of the romantic scenes in this book were cheesy. Also, too much details are given about things that are not important, leaving the reader feeling like they are reading from an encyclopedia and not a romance novel. Being critical of an author, who in the past, was a must buy for me is not easy, but it is dissapointing. Each new book is so similar to the last, you feel as if you are reading the same book with different names. Let's face it, The old Heroine and Hero are not blood related, but are still somehow almost brother and sister, she's never had sex, he's starts off as a alpha male but he's doesn't know how to be tender and when he does, it's hoaky, he's gonna call her \\"little one\\" she's gonna get hurt somehow, and there is going to be some mention of Science Fiction or National Geographic. Palmer fans are starting to wonder if past books are being copied with new covers. I gave this book 2 stars because it was a good storyline idea, but I couldn't get past the outdated and similar to other books writing style that continues to occur with new Palmer books. Sadly, my new Motto is, \\"Read one Palmer book, and you've read them all.\\"	2002-06-25

Once again Anderson weaves a fascinating story around characters that are so real and in the case of this hero, so loveable!! This book tells the story of Jake Coulter (his little sister is Bethany in &quot;Phantom Waltz&quot;) and Molly Sterling. Molly arrives at Jake's ranch with an abused horse and many secrets. Molly suffered major emotional abuse in her marriage, and held no self-esteem. She viewed herself as fat and ugly and was convinced that Jake was playing games with her when he paid her compliments. This story is a must read. Not only because you get to re-visit with old friends from previous books (Maggie and Rafe, &quot;Baby Love&quot; and Bethany and Ryan, &quot;Phantom Waltz&quot;), but it has everything a good book needs-awesome characters, mystery, witty humor, and a story that will touch your heart, and make you feel sexy no matter what you look like.	2002-01-05

Something about her draws the famous,  wealthy confirmed batchelor who has been linked with beautiful fashion  models.

Even though they have  never shared one kiss, Tristan decides to marry her to save her reputation.  Hope has a lot of work ahead of her to convince Tristan he is capable of  giving her more than his name.  This will probably always be one of my  favorite mini-series. However, I must admit I was a little  dissapointed,(hence the 4 stars) that it didn't have the same passion and  feeling of the other books. The first 3 books in the series were so full of  passion and other characters. They always referred back to brothers from  the previous story so you felt like their stories carried on. In this book,  the beloved Double C, is hardly mentioned and you barely here anything from  the other brothers. With all this said, I must admit that was all I found  lacking. The story, while not as captivating as the others, was still a  good read.  The last pages were beautifully written and did finally mention  the rest of the family and the ranch. As Squire Clay stands back and  surveys the family and the land around him, you can't help but feel you are  saying bye to an old friend.	2000-06-29

This is by far one of the better books I have read by Elizabeth Lowell. Logan Garrett wanted revenge against Mary Sue Sheridan, for leaving his beloved older brother for another man, and driving him to drink himself to  death. After winning the Sheridan Ranch in a poker game, he carries things  further by subjecting Mary Sue's daughter, Dawn, to his cruelty. Logan  slowly begins to realize that Dawn only looks like her Mother, but doesn't  act like her. It still doesn't stop him from ditrusting her, and he forces  her to become his mistress. Hoping that she can find a way to make Logan  stop living in the past, she throws away her pride for the Love she can't  help but feel and agrees to his demands. Lowell has taken passion a step  further in this book. The Love scenes that would start out almost violent  would end in a tenderness, that left you turning the pages quickly. Dawn is  a stronged willed person who took alot of abuse from a man she brought to  his knees in the end. Awesome Read!	1999-12-27

I feel a little guilty giving this book less than a five point rating, because it was a good book. However in keeping with the Men Of the Double C series, as a huge fan of this author and this awesome series I came away a  little disapointed with the story of Sawyer Clay. I found that it simply  lacked the since of family and also the passion that the other 3 books in  the series had. Yes it still mentions the other members of the family, but  it just didn't seem the same. However, it still had some great moments  which are characteristic of all Allison Leigh books. I can't wait to read  Tristan's story and as I have said in my reviews of the other books, I hate  to see this series come to an end.	1999-11-25

This book is the second in the series, &quot;Men of the Double C Ranch&quot;. I fell in love with the Clay brothers in the first book &quot;Stay&quot; where we meet each of the Clay men and learn to eagerly  await each one of their stories. This is Matthew's story. Put a hard-headed  rancher and a smart-mouth city girl together, and wait for the sparks to  fly. There is never a dull moment between Matthew and Jamie. He doesn't  think she has what it takes to survive life on a ranch, so he is constantly  putting up barriers, while Jamie proves him wrong at every turn. Allison  Leigh has a remarkable gift for bringing you inside her stories, and  holding you there until the last word is read. This is one series I'll hate  to see come to an end.	1999-09-29
