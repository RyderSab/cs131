BENEDICT is the classic text for monastic life.  Reading it will be interesting to most modern Protestants, much the way that trivia written on a Pringles potato chip is interesting.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if the modern Protestant reader makes a couple of simple substitutions (i.e. monastery = church life, abbot = pastor, etc.) the rule takes on a new life and makes an excellent devotional booklet.<br /><br />This short book is all about life within community, which is often an Achilles heel of Protestant churches.  Within the covers of this book are hard hitting comments about holding the tongue, silence, humility, submission, hospitality, living a life of prayer, decision making, etc.  With a few minor alterations these comments are as applicable to modern Protestants as to sixth century monastics.  Do not get hung up on the particulars, focus on the principles.  I don't know of many monks today that sleep in common bunk houses, but they still focus on the communal truths contained in the text.<br /><br />If you are a Protestant, do not shy away from this book.  It has the potential to deepen your understanding of the church.	2005-10-06

During one particularly intense passage she almost stopped reading it.  However, my nephew and other guys I talked to found this to be their favorite book of the series.  This action packed book certainly has a lot of adventure, swordplay, and suspense.<br /><br />This book also has more explicit Christian themes than some of the other tales from the Narnia series.  After centuries of absence the land of Narnia forgets Aslan and disbelieves the old legends.  In this book Aslan returns and sets things straight.  The themes in this work are so strong that many might forget the quality of the work and judge it merely on their personal like or dislike of Christianity.<br /><br />This book presents an interesting perspective.  In many tales of magic a character summons up a being or person from another time and place.  This story is told from the perspective of the beings who were summoned up!  Lewis' personal title for the book was something like \\"Drawn Back to Narnia\\", but this title was rejected.<br /><br />P.S. Don't jump ahead to the conclusion, but the last page sets up a change and new possible theme that will need to be fleshed out in a later book.	2005-09-28

Now, after many centuries, Western Christians are able to study the mysticism of the Eastern church!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Volume One is not difficult reading, but it is profound reading and is best tackled a little at a time, like any other devotional book.<br /><br />In this era when people are turning to mysticism of all sorts, the Philokalia offers a depth to match the deepest thirst in a totally Christian setting.<br /><br />This translation has excellent introductory notes, a valuable glossary, and a well put together index.<br /><br />As with other works of mysticism, the goal is not to enlighten the reader in Scriptural exegesis, but to help change the practioner into the image of God.  Other books might be more valuabe for building sound doctrine, but this stands head and shoulders above others for spiritual formation.<br /><br />I cannot praise this book highly enough.  In the short time I have been reading it, it has made a tremendous positive impact on my life.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />The material in this book is dated.  The reader must be aware that it is the product of another time and culture.  Much of what the book calls \\"demons\\" etc., might be called something else in our scientific age.<br /><br />The book is \\"monastic\\" in origin.  It came from a time when asceticism and monasticism ruled the waves of spiritual formation.  21st Century Americans are not governed by asceticism.  While many of the teachings will be palatible, many will not.  In this, each reader will need to decide for herself or himself how much to accept.<br /><br />SUMMATION:<br /><br />This is not a book that reveals some new form of secret knowledge that if followed with strictest obedience will transform readers into a \\"super saints\\".<br /><br />This book does contain a depth of wisdom that if carefully pondered will help Christians grow in godly maturity.<br /><br />If you are a Christian, it should be a part of your library, but should NEVER take the place of Scripture.ce of Scripture. <br />	2005-09-17

C.S. Lewis is a good storyteller, a deep thinker, and an influential theologian.  Some of his books are masterpieces because of their imagery.  Others are masterpieces because of their theology.  However, it is in this book, THE HORSE AND HIS BOY, that Lewis shines as a master author.  This book does not need theology or cloaked meanings to make it come alive.  This is simply a masterpiece of writing.  It will stand well against any other children's book sold.<br /><br />Suggestion:  Anyone who likes Harry Potter will probably enjoy this book.  It carries many of the same themes, with a slightly different worldview.	2005-08-24

This is such a book.<br /><br />With an argument that runs counter to the culture in which we live Dr. Schmidt argues that cremation is a pagan custom that was discarded by early Christians who believed in a literal resurrection of the body (in a new glorified form).  His argument is not about whether God is able to resurrect a cremated body, or whether the issue is a \\"heaven/hell\\" issue, but whether it presents a poor Christian witness.  He seems to feel that as Christianity loses influence cremation gains in popularity.<br /><br />After reading the book for my \\"Book of the Month Group\\" we had the privilege of inviting Dr. Schmidt to address our group and discuss his ideas.  Most of us went into the meeting prepared to debate.  My group is composed entirely of pastors and none of our denominations challenge the practice of cremation.  I was impressed with his grasp of the subject and extensive research.  We spent much of our time asking questions.<br /><br />I was interested to discover that he did not set out to write this book, but stumbled upon items that caught his attention while doing research for another of his books.  Once his interest was captured, he came back to work on this book.<br /><br />I have not read other books on this subject, so I do not have anything to compare it with.  However, it was a fun, easy read that left me thinking.	2005-08-24

My group is a small collection of community pastors from various backgrounds and traditions.<br /><br />We all liked the book and thought it was an \\"easy read\\".  The illustrations were varied enough to keep us interested.<br /><br />The book caused us to brainstorm on how to \\"tip\\" good causes in our community.<br /><br />It was encouraging to know that big things can be accomplished with few (but the right) people.<br /><br />The book also offered interesting advice on how to tackle social ills (such as underage smoking), though we were not sure the author had quite as much of a handle on how to stop epidemics.<br /><br />I think this book might have more of an appeal to those who are in positions to actually make a difference in their communities.  To uninvolved people it might become another large dose of unimportant, academic trivia.	2005-07-29

Though virtually unknown in Western Christianity, THE WAY OF A PILGRIM, is one of the most revered classics of Orthodox spirituality.  In the first portion of this book the unnamed pilgrim introduces the reader to hesychasm through use of the \\"Jesus Prayer\\" (Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner).  I found this journal of the pilgrim's travels tedious.  The second portion of the book is more of a theological question and answer session between the pilgrim and his companions.  I enjoyed this section more.  All in all, this is an important book for Protestants to read because it enlarges their awareness of the greater Christian world, but it probably will not make a profound impact by itself.<br /><br />The book's greatest strength is its usefulness as an introduction to the PHILOKALIA.  The PHILOKALIA is a five-part collection of writings on mysticism in the Christian Orthodox tradition.  It was written over a period of 11 centuries.  4 of the 5 volumes have been translated into English and are for sale through Amazon.com.	2005-06-29

The group, consisting of several active pastors of various denominations made the following observations:<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />The author offers a fascinating perspective, with enough support to be taken seriously.<br /><br />The author offers hope for the \\"Baby Boomers\\" that their greatest challenge and opportunity lies ahead.<br /><br />The author delivers an uncanny prediction of a 9-11 type of event years before it happened.<br /><br />The author ends with a sobering idea:<br /><br />(A child born in 1997 will anchor a memory span reaching from around the 1930s to the 2150s, a future remote beyond comprehension.)<br /><br />There is certainly enough fodder in this book to spark lengthy intellectual discussion among all but the proudest and<br /><br />dimmest among us.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Some of us thought it an easy read, while others thought it more difficult, but everyone agreed it was a lengthy book.<br /><br />The author begins time with the reformation 1517 and doesn't go much beyond Western history.<br /><br />The book did not convert anyone to its view.<br /><br />The author overlooks globalization.  This could prove his undoing.<br /><br />FINAL REMARKS<br /><br />The book is worth reading, but do not read it alone.  You will want to bounce these ideas off someone else and that someone else should be prepared for an interesting discussion.<br /><br />OTHER BOOKS OF THE MONTH<br /><br />\\"Process Theology: A Basic Introduction\\"<br /><br />by: C.

You now know MOST of what you need to know to decide whether to purchase this book.  My only addition is the suggestion that adult readers purchase THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA to read to children a chapter at a time.  I started doing this for my daughter's bedtime story.  Now she shuts the TV off at 9:00 and hunts me down to read her a chapter.  IF the thought of tackling 7 books seems daunting, begin with THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE.  It is easy to read and can easily stand alone.  Oh, by the way, we started this practice of a chapter a night when she was a child and we still do it now that she is in high school.  It certainly beats TV, and it sparks conversations that many parents only dream of.	2005-05-31

However, most of them tend to run along side predictable fads.  Someone will write a book and half a dozen others will write about a similar theme.

Those who've read my other reviews know that I often find controversial books more challenging.  Now, let me share some of the pros and cons of this book, as I see them.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />The authors examine homosexuality from the old paradigm of GID (Gender Identity Disorder).  They back up their data with studies, that as far as I can find in my research, are extremely at odds with today's political winds, but nevertheless are accurate.<br /><br />The authors treat the subject with clinical care (but certainly from the point of view that homosexuality is something to be avoided).<br /><br />With a point of view that is politically incorrect, but scientifically defendable, the authors lean toward homosexuality being caused by nurture rather than nature and give guidelines to help parents guard against their children becoming homosexuals.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />The book is written almost exclusively from the perspective of a family with an overly protective mother, disengaged father, and male son leaning toward homosexuality.  Out of 10 chapters only 1 chapter deals with lesbians.  That chapter leaves more unanswered questions than the others.<br /><br />SUGGESTIONS<br /><br />If you are an aggresive advocate of homosexuality this book will make you angry.<br /><br />If you are a lesbian or have a child with lesbian tendencies, this book will be almost useless to you.<br /><br />If you (like me) like to hear both sides of an issue, you will like this book.<br /><br />If you are politically and religiously conservative, this book will back up opinions you already hold.<br /><br />If you are gay, this book may confuse you and possibly even trouble you on many levels.<br /><br />If you are the parents of a male child with homosexual tendencies, you probably have already read enough from this review to know if you want to purchase this book.	2005-03-25

The target is too big.  Bock's book is not my favorite, but is near the top of the books I have read on this subject.<br /><br />THE BOOK'S STRONG POINTS<br /><br />Bock stays on target.  He actually addresses questions that are being asked and doesn't stray as far as others.<br /><br />Bock is from Dallas Theological Seminary.  His foreword was written by Francis J. Moloney from The Catholic University of America (not exactly bunk mates in the dormitory of theology).  This shows an attempt to speak from a broad perspective.  Although he doesn't exactly pull off the attempt as well as he could.<br /><br />The book is easy to read.<br /><br />THE BOOK'S WEAK POINT<br /><br />It isn't very exciting.  After reading the exciting \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" this is a little like sitting down for a lecture.<br /><br />A BETTER BOOK<br /><br />I think this is probably the best first book one can read on the subject.  IF one is intrigued enough to dig a little deeper I suggest \\"Cracking Da Vinci's Code\\" by James L. Garlow and Peter Jones.  But if you do, read it after this book.	2005-03-14

These authors know what they are writing about.  Between the two of them they hold degrees in theology and history from Asbury Theological Seminary, Drew University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, Harvard Divinity School, Princeton Theological Seminary, and the University of Wales.  Between the two of them, they have authored 14 books (not fictious novels).<br /><br />2. Previous reviews are sharply divided.  It has been my experience that some books are loved by everyone and some are hated by everyone, but the real thought-provoking books (such as The Da Vinci Code) also provoke great emotion and debate.<br /><br />3. In spite of the title this is not a book about Brown's novel, but about a rising challenge to traditional Christian theology behind the novel.  Many people remind us, \\"It's only a fictious novel!\\", but after seeing the newer editions, teaching cds, and books tied to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" the serious person must conclude that there is more.<br /><br />4. The book is designed for small group study.  At the end of the book is a personal study guide and addresses to three web pages for further information.<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />This book is blatantly evangelistic with its message.  This could prove distasteful and hard to overcome for many readers.  It begins each chapter with a short portion of a fictional story.  The authors must have thought they needed this, but I think they went over the top a bit and almost made themselve appear paranoid.  If you have the ability to get past this flaw, you will learn a lot from this book.	2005-03-14

In this slightly two dimensional autobiography the author paints himself with a shining brush that glosses through some of his more controversial moments leaving the critical reader thinking, \\"There is probably a little more to the story.\\"  There are aspects of the book that will probably cause most theologians to shy away from placing it on their book shelves.<br /><br />In spite of these drawbacks this book reveals the inner thoughts of a Charismatic mystic who has made an incredible impact on the world of Christian thought.  Within the pages of this book are some of the common sense themes that one might find in the autobiographies of any successful person coupled with some of the ideas usually found in the writings of medieval mystics.  This is mixed in with the traditional teachings of the charismatic renewal, especially those of the prosperity gospel.<br /><br />It's a shame that this book will probably be read by persons who already agree with every teaching presented and ignored by all others.  There are aspects of this book that could challenge all Christians.	2005-02-23

Books	5	27	33	N	N	Excellent Historical Introduction for Christians	Christianity started as a Jewish movement.  Jesus and all 12 of his disciples were Jews.  The central historic act of Christian worship, the Eucharist (or communion or Lord's Supper), was instituted during a Passover meal.  Jesus, himself, tied his death to this meal.  The New Testament ties Jesus' life, death, and resurrection to fulfillment of Hebrew Scriptures.  As more and more Christians search for their historic roots, books of this nature will continue to grow in popularity.<br /><br />This book does an excellent job of describing what early Christians and the rest of Christianity has accepted, \\"That Jesus is the Lamb of God, slain for the sins of the world.\\"  This book will strike an emotional chord in any Christian who reads it.<br /><br />That being said, it is unlikely that most Jews will see the connections as strongly as Christians.  This is a great book for Christians and possibly an interesting book for Jews.  But Christians should not be surprized if Jews react with anger at one of their most important holy days being \\"hijacked\\" by another religion.  How would Christians react if Muslims presumed to explain to them the true meaning of Christmas?	2005-02-09

A book such as this is badly needed today and I hope that every church examines these ideas carefully.  Those who are willing to view past evangelism trends introspectfully and critically know that Christian evangelism in the United States has not been widely successful.  Single contact point, aggressive evangelistic sales pitches bring a lot of people to the point of saying the \\"sinners' prayer\\", but they do not result in changed lives.  Hunter argues powerfully to hold off on \\"closing the deal\\" until a person actually believes the gospel and accepts Christianity for himself or herself.  This sort of evangelism requires more than reteroric.  Christians must live their faith.<br /><br />I wish I did not have to be critical of this book, but I believe there are a couple of weaknesses that could lessen its effectiveness.  First, this is not a \\"how to\\" book.  It is a lesson from history that requires the reader to think and decide how to apply its message in our present world.  My experience has been that too many Christians' eyes glaze over when asked to read history and too many would rather have clear steps (1.2.3. etc.) laid out for them.  The book's style may cause some people to stop reading after the first couple of chapters.<br /><br />Second, the first 6 chapters of this book are rather general and then the last chapter becomes specific on how these ideas might be worked out in our present culture.  When moving from the general to specific, I think the author went a little too far.  He spent most of the last chapter describing how the Celtic methods of evangelism could work with people caught by addictions.  I would like for this chapter to have been a bit broader.  Addictions are strong in our society, but new age religions and world religions are so strong that this book would have made a natural introduction to evangelism in a world of religious diversity.  That is where I think this book hits real treasure and the last chapter leans off on a tangent.<br /><br />Still, when all is said and done, this is a powerful book that should be used in every church across our land.in a world of religious diversity.

I have public domain copies, Wiccan copies, ecclectic copies, etc.  This translation comes the closest to John's ideas that I have yet to come across.  The translator does not try to water down the text with personal bias.<br /><br />But I also need to add that this is not easy to read.  No translation of this work is.	2004-12-05

I began to highlight my favorite ones.  Some of them I read to other people.  One or two made me laugh, several moved me emotionally.  When I was finished I felt richer for having made the effort.<br /><br />It is not hard to give these poems and sonnets 5 stars.<br /><br />HOWEVER I'm not sure you should purchase the book.  I found some dated used copies of \\"The Sonnets of William Shakespeare with the famous Temple Notes and an introduction by Robert O. Ballou\\" on Amazon.com for $ .14 each.  Yes, that's fourteen cents for small hardback copies in great shape.  Sure they're dated, but for me the contents are more important than the commentaries, so age doesn't matter much.	2004-11-06

I did not want to hear what others thought of Islam, but what Muslims, themselves, wrote.  Therefore I began to research various English translations of the Qur'an.  I finally decided upon this translation because of the exhaustive study helps.<br /><br />I realize that any English translation is not perfect and a more complete study could be done by comparing one translation against another, but I found this one to be easy to understand.<br /><br />From all of the research I've done, it probably is as accurate as any, probably more so.<br /><br />The study notes are longer than the Qur'an itself and make up a combination of commentary and apologetic.  Sometimes I thought it gave too much information (opinion).  Other times I was glad for the insights offered.<br /><br />The small introduction to each chapter helped to keep me from getting lost and I appreciated knowing the time period in which each portion was probably written.  This was my favorite part of this translation.<br /><br />The index was excellent.<br /><br />I am a free thinker and like to examine things for myself.  I understand that some of the reviewers disagree with the translator's views.  However, that is to be expected with a translation.  I've learned with most religious texts that the answer to understanding is more comlicated than simply learning the original language.  Even the languages I have messed around with forced me to make personal translations that were inferior to the worst ones on the market.  A better path is to purchase a variety of English translations, compare them, and read what scholars have to say about them.<br /><br />This version was a good choice for me.  It probably will be for others also.	2004-10-23

It has been translated more times than any other book in history, except the Bible.  There is a version or commentary for everyone, no matter how poor of a reader or how much of a purist you are.<br /><br />It is true that this little book is an easy reading paraphrase, but I enjoyed it immensely.  It makes a good primer.  It is easy to read, yet the reader will want to highlight many passages to meditate on later.  It introduces the tao in a way that may draw the reader into more difficult translations later.  It is inexpensive and easy to carry around.<br /><br />It might also be good for the experienced Taoist to read.  Different paraphrases cause the mind to see passages with new perspectives.  Remember, a wise man can learn from anything; a foolish man can't.<br /><br />I heartily recommend the book for someone just becoming interested in the Tao, or for anyone who enjoys good wisdom literature from whatever culture.	2004-09-20

It's philosophy runs counter enough to the Christianity upon which much of Western thought is built to cause a certain amount of dissonance if read carefully.  Or more likely, the Western reader will simply dismiss it as easily as a telemarketer.<br /><br />So the question rises, \\"How does one aquire enough of a taste to wrestle with the ideas presented in the work?\\"<br /><br />In the beginning the Hindu epics were adventure tales that caught public attention better than the Vedas and their Upanishads.  We might say they were the \\"comic book\\" versions of the great Hindu holy books.  Many translators make the epics too difficult.<br /><br />This small text takes the Gita back to its \\"user friendly\\" beginnings.  The translation may sacrifice some of the nuances of other translations, but it offers the novice an easy glimpse into the soul of Hindu thought.<br /><br />This inexpensive, easy to read, book is to be recommended for the casual reader who has little understanding, but a growing curiosity, about Hinduism.  Save the more complicated (and expensive) translations and commentaries for later.	2004-09-18

I use this text to teach my college class on World Religions (REL 101).  It is a nice little text.  As with all works it has some advantages and some disadvantages.<br /><br />ADVANTAGES:<br /><br />1. An Instructor's Manual With Tests is available.  I don't use most of the tests because I prefer class participation and lots of written papers, but the manual helps me keep on target and helps me design questions for class discussion time.<br /><br />2.

I like to use these to add accent to class times.<br /><br />3. The text itself is well written and time tested (This is the 9th edition).  It is easy for the student to read.  I usually expect them to read the chapters and be prepared for discussion.  My lectures bring additional material to the class.<br /><br />4. All in all these materials are easy to teach from.<br /><br />DISADVANTAGES:<br /><br />1. As one can read from previous reviews, the text has limited depth.  It must be assumed that the instructor will have the capability to bring additional material to the classroom.<br /><br />2. The book contains a huge gap in its lack of a chapter on \\"New Age\\" religions.  This needs to be corrected as any casual trip to a book store will affirm.  I usually add the following topics to those which the book covers:<br /><br />  a. Atheistic philosophies<br /><br />  b. The advent of the post modern mind<br /><br />  c.

It strips away the mystique and delivers a straight forward, helpful, guide to the contemplative journey.  You should find the series to both informing and reassuring.  I've listened to it twice and plan to review it on a regular basis.  James Finley is one of today's best living authors on the subject of contemplation.<br /><br />IF HOWEVER, you are a Christian just examining the contemplative life, this is not a good book for you.  It is not rooted well in Scripture.  It blurs Christian and Eastern meditation practices.  The author's delivery is monotone and quiet, most likely putting you to sleep.  The central texts come from the writings of Thomas Merton.  Important statements are delivered with a casual authority that are not backed up by science nor Scripture, leaving the reader to wonder if they are, indeed correct, or just the opinions of Merton and Finley.	2004-08-20

It was the highlight of my day.<br /><br />While theologians and critics might want to debate the simple straight forward answers given to difficult theological questions in this small book, I find it to be charming and useful.  It is small enough to read in one sitting, yet profound enough to spread out over several sessions and use for meditation.<br /><br />This is an excellent present for non Christian friends.  It is easy to read, contains much to think about, and is more complex than the simple folded tracts often given out.<br /><br />This is also an excellent tool for use in family devotions.  I have a jr. high aged daughter.  She is old enough to grasp these principles.  Each of the 11 chapters is short enough to read and discuss during our nightly devotion times.	2004-08-07

Christian leadership involves more than simply being a good person with noble intentions.  Many well-meaning pastors do not know how to lead.  If you struggle with knowing where you are headed or how to get there, this book will help you.<br /><br />CONS: Christian leadership also involves more than the ability to incorporate standard business practices.  Effective ministry must have a supernatural element.  Vision, power, and results must come from God.  It is in this area that the book fails.  The principles of this book play well in most college business classes, but they seem incomplete when applied to the church.<br /><br />RESULT:  The book promises more than it delivers.  The complete title is ADVANCED STRATEGIC PLANNING: A NEW MODEL FOR CHURCH AND MINISTRY LEADERS.  It is not advanced.  Nothing in the book was new to me, and it falls a little short when applied to the church.  It is a very good book on STRATEGIC PLANNING.  If this is your weak area, buy the book.  If you are good in this area, do not expect new insights.	2004-07-30

This book has a strong anti-Anglo bias from cover to cover.  As a history text it offers an extremely limited scope.  It is an historical account of how the racist Anglos persecuted all non-Anglos through American history.<br />That doesn't mean it shouldn't be read.  I never give out ***** without reason.<br />For non-Anglos this book should be read for the comfort it offers.  At last someone has found the courage to tell the story of those who came from the margins of society.  I am white.  My heritage traces predominantly from Native American (Cherokee) and Irish indentured servitude stock.  The book was informative concerning my heritage.<br />For Anglos this book should be read to help remove cultural blinders.  Such a book can be threatening, but it has the potential to expand our universes way beyond the scope of monocultural prejudice.  Books such as this help us to better understand where our brothers and sisters of other cultures are coming from.<br />FOR EVERYONE, this book should be read to understand the past, NOT keep alive prejudice for another generation.  My prayer is that a day will come when we have the ability to scale the walls of blindness and forgive the offenses of the past.  I would like to see a new world when we are neither ruled by bigotry or guilt.	2004-05-12

No, this book describes the self sacrifice, forgiveness, and difficulty of such an endeavour with great detail.<br />IS IT POSSIBLE?  Yes AND No.  The book ends happily ever after, but the true friendship between Spencer Perkins and Chris Rice did not.  Only a week before he died of heart failure at the age of 44 Perkins spoke of his difficulties in dealing with &quot;White Folks&quot; and the need to forgive.

I know that in many fairy tales the wicked witch or stepmother dies, but I feel this book devalues life to the point that I would feel uncomfortable letting my young daughter read it.

Each year, when he visited, a different icon was placed on the table of the room where he stayed.

Is this what the early church was like . . . people from all tribes and nations drawn together into one common church of God?  If so, no wonder several conflicts are recorded in Scripture!<br />Just when the church growth movement convinced pastors across the nation into believing that all growing churches must be homogeneous along comes Stephen Rhodes to ask whether this is really God's plan for the church.  His statements are bold, &quot;We are living in the last days of the idolatry of success, in which Christians bow before the false god of homogeneous church growth instead of throwing the church doors wide open to all God's children.&quot;  He backs up his statements with a wonderful case study, his own church of 32 nationalities on the outskirts of our nation's capitol.<br />If this book has a problem, it may come from the passion with which Rhodes presses his point.  He has all of the passion for multicultural ministry that a missionary might have for missions, or an urban pastor might have for ministry in the ghetto.  This could spark a reaction from those of us who have bought into the homogeneous principles of church growth or who do not have so many cultures represented in our parishes.<br />Still . . . the discussion valid and Rhodes is the perfect person to raise the question.

For instance, on page 35 the authors quote Alasdair MacIntyre, &quot;Dying for this state, . . . is like being asked to die for the telephone company&quot;<br />As you can tell from this quote, this book will be challenging to read, but you could sure get people made at you if you used the wrong quote at the wrong time!	2004-03-30
US	52586678	R3GA2Q30POOSUE	0891072330	329719457	A Christian Manifesto	Books	5	33	39	N	N	Prophetic	Francis Schaeffer had amazing insight into the world around him.  He looked around and made predictions that others thought impossible to ever come true.  He tied together causes that others disregarded.  He described a coming world view that others comsidered extreme and alarmist.<br />Now . . . it has come to pass.  Many today will read this book and have trouble believing that Schaeffer's world ever existed.  To others, Schaeffer's words will seem as if they were penned only yesterday.  Some will probably call him immoral.  Others will call him a prophet.  He is certainly politically incorrect.<br />And all of this change happened in the span of about 20 years.  This book was penned in 1981.  You owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this book and look around at the change that has happened to society.  It is sobering.<br />Schaeffer wrote his Christian Manifesto as an antithesis to the Communist Manifesto.  He imagined the logical progression of a world built upon a morality other than God.  Imagine if you will, what a world would be like if the government totally removed God as the basis for law and morality.  It might be like a snowball rolling down a long hill with nothing to stop it.  What would be the results way down the hill into the far future?  How could the snowball ever be stopped once it reached critical mass?  How long before it reached critical mass?  How should Christians react to this changing world?	2004-03-27

Foundational	What do I mean by dated . . . but . . . foundational?<br />DATED<br />Christ and Culture has been around for over half a century now.  When first penned it attempted to describe all the various ways in which Christians interact with culture, and make sense of it.  The book was profound, for its time period.  However, a lot of theology has been written since 1951 and culture has changed even more.  At first glance the reader might find himself or herself toying with several ideas that are more recent than Niebur's.<br />FOUNDATIONAL<br />This book made such a splash that some Christian colleges adopted similar classes.  This was the prevailing text.  Therefore, most of the ideas on this subject that churn in the modern Christian reader's mind were formed in reaction to this book, even if the reader is unaware of it.  Therefore, if the reader of today can grasp the concepts of this work, that reader will have a deeper understanding of his or her own beliefs.<br />RECOMMENDATION<br />This book is dated, but not outdated.  Read it and compare it with newer works for a broader grasp of the subject.  By the way, this is one of the most important subjects that today's Christian can wrestle with.  Too many of our Christians react to culture with limited understanding of what they are doing or why they are doing it.  We Protestants, of which I am one, are horribly weak in our understanding of what it means to be the Church of Jesus Christ in a fallen world.	2004-03-26

In this age of rampant conspiracy theories and films that excite the imagination the idea of a secret coverup by the church to defame these wonderful works makes a tempting plot.  And there is just enough truth to make it sound feasable.  But before you all tell me how closed minded I am, let me offer a few alternatives.<br />IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT GNOSTICISM:  Research it throughly from BOTH sides, and keep an open mind.  This was a major struggle in the early church.  A lot of scholarly work is available from different perspectives.  Gnosticism is alive and well today, as is orthodox Christianity.  Many good books are available on Amazon.<br />IF YOU REALLY WANY TO READ ONE OF THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS:<br />I suggest you choose the Gospel of Thomas.  It is easy to find and has a lot more meat.  The Gospel of Mary Magdalene has only 161 lines and about 175 pages of author added commentary and filler to stretch it out.  The Gospel of Magdalene is not a complete work.<br />IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DEBATE OVER MARY:<br />I suggest you purchase the video, &quot;Mary Magdalen: An Intimate Portrait&quot;  It is sold by Amazon.  I reviewed it and find it to be a balanced, serious attempt at honesty without dodging extreme views on any side of the debate.<br />IF YOU REALLY WANT TO STUDY THE &quot;LOST BOOKS OF THE BIBLE&quot;:<br />I suggest you begin with the &quot;Shepherd (Pastor) of Hermas&quot;  This book was so accepted in the early church that it can still be seen in our earliest known New Testament, Codex Sinaiticus, dating back to the 4th century.  Then, after inclusion, it was removed, because it flunked the test of &quot;Apostolic Authority&quot;.  Other major very early works include the Didache, and Apostolic Constitutions.  These will open plenty of scholarly debate.<br />IF SOMETHING INSIDE YOU STILL SAYS YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE THIS BOOK:<br />Then download it over the net.  The book isn't much longer than this review and it is in the public domain.longer than this review and it is in the public domain.	2004-03-24

Well written and historically as accurate as the author was able to create, this book is not only filled with all those things that make an excellent movie, it describes a growing chasim between the church and Europe.<br />For Protestants this book will afirm the importance of speaking out against corruption.<br />For Catholics, this book will remind the reader of a dark period of history when corruption fractured the church to the very core.<br />For both.  This is a history book.  It is easy to read.  It is not a book that attacks the Catholic church or lifts up Protestantism.  Catholics and Protestant agree that there have been both good and bad popes.  Both agree that these were among the worst.  Both agree that the reformation was partially caused by both sides.  This should not be viewed as a book that takes sides between churches.	2004-03-16

One day I arrived at work to find this book lying on my desk.  It was a gift from my secretary.  However, the book wasn't the gift, the concept inside was.  This was her way of telling me that we were a team and that she would always support me.  That day I felt truly blessed.<br />PROS:  This book describes a team relationship in which the team members are willing to lay down their own self interests for the leader.  The author equates those working for the pastor with Old Testament armor bearers to the kings.  Any leader would be humbled to be the recepient of such loyalty and faithfulness.<br />CONS:  These ideas do contain danger.  The leader must be an honorable person.  Power hungry leaders could take advantage of such support.  This book, written from the perspective of the support team, needs to be balanced with a similar book of godly leadership in which the leader copies Jesus and leads on his or her knees with a washbasin and a towel.	2004-03-14

Bishops, superintendents, seminaries, colleges, seminars, etc. held this book before clergy and warned them to take heed of the lessons learned lest their churches become statistics of decline.<br />And with good reason.  NCD (Natural Church Development) was based on research that included 1000 churches in 32 countries on all 5 continents.  A total of 4.2 million responses were analyzed.  The study identified a collection of 8 common sense characteristics that were common in EVERY growing church studied.  This paragraph alone should encourage any serious pastor to examine this study.<br />BUT, did it work?  That is a harder question.  Did the churches grow because they had these characteristics or did they have these characteristics because they were growing?  Can these characteristics be imported to your church?  It is easier to see the problems with a congregation and to read formulas for correction than to impliment those formulas.  Have the principles in this book been tried and found wanting or have they simply not been tried?  I do not know.  I've known several churches that gave NCD a good effort, but still did not grow.<br />This work is important enough for the pastor to understand.  But it is not a cure all for the problems of a congregation.	2004-03-12

YOU FOUND IT!  I don't know of a better small group resource.  I've been through this workbook several different times with several different groups, everything from teens to pastors.  I've always been pleased.<br />Two aspects of this study sticks out to me.<br />First, the wealth of companion material from Renovare.  You will not run out of ways to challenge the members of your small group.<br />Second, the respect that is shown for believers in different Christian traditions.  Renovare is distinctly and unashamedly Christian.  It is not popular philosophy dressed up in Christian language.  Yet, this book, as with other Renovare resources, value the distinctives that make up the different major themes in Christian thought.  This could cause discomfort for those who are locked into a very narrow version of the faith.	2004-03-09

POSITIVES<br />If I had the opportunity to put together a small list of &quot;must have&quot; books for the libraries of Christian Leaders across the nation, this book would be on that list.  It is wonderfully profound and simple at the same time.  It reminds the pastor what God has called the pastor to be, yet is valuable for laity to read also.<br />PROBLEMS<br />If I was forced to list one drawback with this book, it would be the writing style.  Peterson is a contemplative calling pastors to this wonderfully powerful unbusy, subversive, apocalyptic lifestyle.  However, many of our nation's pastors are not contemplative.  They are pragmatic.  If the author started the book with a mission statement, then offered several practical steps on how to arrive at the stated goal, thereby planting new churches or increasing the attendance, that would be a book that many pastors could understand.  Add to that mix a paradigm shift or logical discussion of impending theological struggle and you will had a best seller.  This book takes another set of skills.  The type of skills necessary to enjoy poetry.	2004-03-09

He offers much more, a pastoral theology.  In this particular volume he digs into several Old Teatament texts and encourages pastors to engage the work of Prayer-Directing, Story-Making, Pain-Sharing, Nay-Saying, and Community-Building.  These themes have the capability of reigniting that inner passion for ministry and restoring that God-given youthful vision to the pastor who has become worn down from trying to run the church as a business.  This book should be in the library of every pastor.	2004-03-09

The title is great.  The information is important.  I don't know any other book quite like it.  I am happy that Rubietta has the courage to expose the &quot;parsonage system&quot; as a system that actually causes long term damage to clergy.<br />Yet, for some reason it just didn't reach out and grab me.  Perhaps I have already thought over these issues and nothing new jumped out at me.  Anyway, now it just sits on my shelf gathering dust.<br />RECOMMENDATIONS:<br />CLERGY:  I suspect that you, like me, will not get a bang out of this book.<br />LAITY: This might be a good book for you.  It might spark an interest in knowing what exactly is going on inside the head of your pastor and you may wonder if your pastor really is as satisfied as he or she appears to be????	2004-03-09

This little book has now been out for a few years.  It's made it's millions of dollars and sold its millions of copies.  The sequels have also made their fortunes.  There are Prayer of Jabez calendars, journals, Bibles, inspirational guides, The Prayer of Jabez for Teens, and The Prayer of Jabez for Preschoolers.  I am surprized there are not Prayer of Jabez Pez despensers.  Personally I always wondered why preschoolers needed a Prayer of Jabez?  Couldn't they just ask their parents for permission to cross the street and thereby enlarge their territories?<br />Wilkinson has probably made millions off this little book, while at the same time damaged his reputation as a serious scholar.<br />This is unfortunate, because Wilkinson is a good author, and an inspiring speaker, and this little book has a valuable message for the Christian community.  I do not believe he intended Christians to jump on this book as a band wagon to revive the prosperity gospel.  I rather believe that he wanted to encourage Christians to be bold enough to dream great dreams for God and step out beyond themselves in faith.  But unless one has the opportunity to hear Wilkinson speak, this book could revive the old belief that godly people are blessed with health, wealth, and prosperity, while hurting people are the victims of their own lack of faith.<br />The book is small and doesn't cost much.  It is hard to believe that someone hasn't read it.  But, if you haven't, go ahead and purchase it, just to see what all the hype is about.  If it encourages you to throw caution to the wind and follow God's call into new arenas of ministry, that is what it is there for.  If you get the impression that God's blessing means you will greatly prosper, read another book to balance your thoughts.	2004-03-09

As a young ministry student I read this book for a class in pastoral theology.  I remember how I highlighted numerous passages.  I wrote little commentaries in the margins.  In some places I agreed with the author, but in the majority I took the author to task.  &quot;This is wrong!  This is short sighted!  This is unscriptural!  This is biased! etc.&quot;<br />As a middle-aged pastor I picked up my old copy and re-read it.  Once again, placing my little commentaries in the margins, &quot;He was right!  Boy, was I dumb! Amen!

I am borrowing a term from my youth and the Viet Nam conflct when people were labeled Hawks or Doves by their reaction to war.<br />Yoder makes a case that Jesus was VERY political.  He was not uninterested in world events around him.  He was involved, but not in the way that much of the religious right is today.  More likely, he made the footsteps that Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Mother Theresa later walked in.  This is a book on politics, power, and pacifism.  At least that is the way that Yoder sees it.<br />Many Christians do not agree with Yoder, but he is not easily dismissed.

I don't think John Ortberg is among the group of such authors who call themselves Renovare, but this book certainly fits the profile.<br />As such books go, this is one of the better ones.  Ortberg doesn't really say anything new, but he writes in a way that is easy to understand.  His association with Willow Creek Community Church gives him a credible voice.<br />This book has 13 chapters and includes a small group study guide.  A companion video series can be purchased, completing the set and thus providing a ready made Sunday School curriculum that is likely to attract a good many people.<br />I personally don't think it is quite as deep as the Renovare books that spawned the craze, but it is a good deal deeper than much of what is purchased over the counter in local Christian bookstores.	2004-02-29

The second time I read it, I began to glimpse that it spoke of something beyond me, but extremely important.  The third time I read it, it made my theology feel like that of a preschooler.  I finally went to stay in a monastery for a few days so I could be tutored in understanding this book.  The next time I read it, it began to make sense.  Though it is still over my head, today this is my all time favorite book, no matter who does the translation.<br />CONS - That being said, translation is very important to understanding this book.  John was distinctly Christian.  Any attempt to universalize his writings might yield something of value, but of far less value than John intended.  Mirabai Starr's translation minimizes Christian references intentionally.<br />VERDICT - I personally give this and all other translations 5 stars.  I am happy to have this translation in my library.  However, it lacks some of the punch of others I have studied.	2004-02-24

For each tradition (stream) Foster introduces us to Christians from Scripture, history, and modern times who serve as examples of that stream.<br />PROBLEMS:  There was nothing wrong with the examples Foster selected, but they didn't grab me as much as other Renovare books have.  Perhaps I'd rather read each person's own words than read about that person's life.  Also, the binding on my book broke.  I don't know if that is a problem or just happened to me.<br />POSITIVES:  For me, the joy of this book was in the appendix and extra material.  Foster gives us one appendix of critical turning points in church history and another of notable figures and significant movements in church history.  He begins each chapter with a chart from the time of Jesus to present that lists significant people, movements, and dates related to that tradition.<br />CONCLUSION:  The extra material is easily worth the cost of the book.  The chapters are just the added bonus on this one.  I've returned to these charts for reference time and time again.	2004-02-12

There are those who search for the historical Jesus.  This camp is too often made up of historians who come at the issue with a bias against traditional Christianity that was born of the enlightenment.  Hence, they discount stories of the miraculous because they don't believe in miracles.  A second camp is made up of conservative Christian scholars who approach the life of Jesus from a theological bias, born of centuries of Christian tradition.  They do believe in miracles, because they have faith. Surprise!  Both camps find the Jesus they set out to look for.  N.T. Wright is aware of both camps, but writes somewhere outside of either.  He approaches Scripture and the life of Jesus through the eyes of Second Temple Period Jewish Politics.  His version of the historical Jesus is VERY political.  He puts forth a rational case for his thesis, then examines the impact this new vision of Jesus should have on the church in this postmodern world.<br />AM I CONVINCED?  I'm not sure I would say he convinced me, intrigued would be a better word.  His case is too unusual to accept at first reading, but he certainly offers the reader a lot to think about, and delivers his message well.  I will keep my eyes open a little wider for future discussions of this nature.<br />RECOMMENDATION:  If you like to be challenged, you might like this book.  If you are too accepting, you might be tempted to accept his well written premise too easily.  If you tend to be a \\"Defender of the Faith\\" you might find this book threatening.	2004-02-10

It seems only proper to begin a review of this book with the warning given by the anonymous author in his/her prologue.  My paraphrase of that warning goes something like this, &quot;In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in the bond of love I beg you not to read, copy, or look at this book unless you are ready.  Furthermore I beg you not to copy it, loan it out, or give it to anyone else to read unless they, too,  are ready for this depth of spiritual growth, lest they misunderstand the things written herein and fall into error.&quot;<br />In this age of newly rediscovered Christian mysticism I agree  with the author.  This, almost zen-like book, can lead the novice into an empty, shallow, form of spirituality that misses the substance of our true faith.  Do not be misled by sensational experiences.  Most people experienced in meditation can put themselves into an &quot;alpha&quot; state almost at will.  Do not forget the old saying, &quot;Study without prayer is flat; prayer without study leads to error.&quot;<br />OK . . . NOW THAT I'VE GIVEN THE DISCLAIMER . . .<br />There is another old saying that is relevant here.<br />Let prayer lead to meditation.<br />In meditation allow God to grace you with contemplation.<br />Contemplation, in God's timing, leads to intuition.<br />Intution ushers in oneness with God.<br />This book reminds us that if we have the ability to conmprehend all there is to know about God, our God is too small.  When I first read this book, I wasn't ready.  It didn't make sense.  However one day, years later, while I was praying, all the pieces came together and the book made sense.<br />If you read this book years ago and didn't like it, read it again.  If you are a novice in the contemplative life begin with works by Nouwen and Thomas Merton.  Then, dig deeper into the writings of St. John of the Cross.  Hold on to The Cloud of Unknowing until you are ready for it.	2004-02-06

At the same time it has spawned a host of clones.<br />This book will introduce you to authors like: C.S. Lewis, Dallas Willard, Jonathan Edwards, Francis de Sales, John of the Cross (my personal favorite), Bernard of Clairvaux, Francois Fenelon, and St. Augustine.  And that is in just the first section!  Altogether you will be introduced to 52 of the greatest writers of Christian history, one for each week of the year.  Each section will introduce you to the author, offer an excerpt from that author, couple that excerpt with Scripture, reflection questions, and suggested exercises.  To cap it all off Foster will offer his own reflections on the passage.<br />There is nothing wrong with the latest 40 day or 12 week study to ___________ (you fill in the blank).  Those studies are useful and have their place, but jumping into this book could forever change your reading habits.	2004-02-05

PLOT:  Money, Sex, & Power, these are the three big temptations of church leadership.  The early monks battled these with vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.  Protestants today are more likely to use the tools of simplicity, fidelity, and servanthood.  Foster does an excellent job exploring these three dangerous areas.<br />POSITIVES: Foster draws from Scripture, other authors, and his own excellent understanding of theology.  This is a book I find myself coming back to again and again.<br />PROBLEMS:  Foster is given to strong statements.  I didn't agree with all of them.  I found myself highlighting certain passages and writing notes of praise.  I found myself highlighting other passages and disagreeing with them.  This is not a problem for me.  I often interact with the books I read and sometimes go back years later and interact with my own notes as I wrestle with myself.  But this could be a problem with some readers, who either feel they have a handle on theology or are threatened by ideas they disagree with.  Let the buyer beware.	2004-02-04

According to prevailing theory Wesley leaned heavily upon four paths to knowledge, Scripture, Tradition, Reason, and Experience.<br />The disagreements are many.  Did Scripture form the ultimate while the other three formed the support base?  Were all four of equal importance?  Since Wesley described himself as a man of one book, was Scripture alone his authority for knowledge?  Did Wesley really have 5 paths to knowledge? (The Church of England being the 5th.)<br />If these questions have made you itchy to write a comment of your own, this is a good book for you.	2004-01-23

However, as with many books, some chapters stand out to me more than others.  In chapters 7 &amp; 8 Wainwright deals with the old Latin phrase LEX ORANDI LEX CREDENDI (rule of prayer rule of belief).  Like the old chicken and egg question, but with greater importance, Wainwright discusses which comes first, prayer or belief.  That is, do we create our doctrines to match our worship or do we design our worship to reflect our beliefs?  Before you answer that question too quickly I need to add that this is of fundamental importance to the ongoing dialogue between Catholics and Protestants.	2004-01-22

Maddox is well qualified to take on the task.  One aspect I appreciate in this book is Maddox's input to a growing trend of Wesleyan scholars that see Wesley's theology as more of an attempt at synthesis (Protestant, Roman, Eastern) than blazing new ground.  This removes Wesley from the fringe of historic Christianity (much to the chagrine of reform theologians) and places him smack dab in the center.<br />Does Maddox accomplish his task?  You be the judge of that.<br />ONE WARNING:  As you can tell by my review, this is not light reading.  If you aren't prepared for it, this book may end up gathering dust on your shelf.	2004-01-18

Like Norris, I have been invited into the cloister.  Her account has the ring of authenticity.  By the time I finished the book I realized I was reading while listening to the CD of chants prepared at the monastery I most often visit.<br />WHO WILL LIKE THIS BOOK?  Norris is a poet.  This book is a collection of sketches from inside the monastery, from monastic history, from her own small town, from her vacations, and from the cities she has lived and worked in.  Some chapters are long, while others are short.  Her themes bounce from chapter to chapter.  If you like poetic imagery written in prose and are interested in this theme, you will like this book.<br />WHO WILL NOT LIKE THIS BOOK?  If you like to read technical manuals and books with finely structured outlines, you will probably not like this book.  You may feel that Norris rambles too much and doesn't stay with her main point.	2004-01-16

I never led another person to faith in Christ . . . until . . . someone gave me a copy of this book.  It was so simple, honest, and natural that it changed my life.  Now, years later, I have been present when several dozen persons have experienced a new birth of faith in Christ.<br />For years this book that helped me so much was out of print.

I am a Jules Verne fan and this is one of his best works.  It is full of danger, suspense, excitement, and passion.  I read this to my children as they were growing up and the story stayed with us all through the years.<br />PROBLEMS:  It is of course dated.  This book requires imagination.  It is long (44 short chapters).  I usually read a chapter each night to my kids on a book such as this.  If I couldn't finish the book in a month the children got restless.<br />PROPOSAL: Purchase an audio version.  This is one book that I'd rather hear read than read myself.	2004-01-02

Now . . . do we know ahyone like that?!?<br />PLAN: We must (starting with the leaders) grow in emotional maturity.  Here are the basic steps . . . 1)  We must look below the surface of our lives, 2) We must come to grips with the scars from our past, 3) We must learn to be honest about our brokenness and become vulnerable. (I have noticed that those Christians I most admire have the ability to be open and honest about their lives.), 4) We must learn how to say, &quot;No&quot; and follow God rather than be pushed around by others, 5) We must not run from the pain of life, but rather embrace it and learn to grow through pain, 6) We must take the lessons we have learned and step into incarnational ministry as Jesus did.<br />POSITIVES:  The author writes from personal experience.  After many years of seemingly successful ministry as a pastor with a rapidly growing church plant and invitations to speak in a growing number of seminars across the country he finds himself with a crumbling marriage and a major church split when one of his staff defects and starts a new rival ministry.  The pain of this experience woven through the pages of the book lend an air of credibility to the message.<br />PROBLEMS:  There aren't many.  The author's mix of counseling techniques and spiritual formation could cause the reader to raise his or her eyebrows, but I don't consider this much of a problem.  I like to be challenged by what I read.  The author waxes and wanes hot and cold in a place or two.  I liked some chapters better than others, but that's normal for me.  The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because I am not certain right now if the book will cause a change in my life.  I only give 5 stars to those works that change me.<br />PREDICTION:  This book will become an important work among pastors and in church leadership training.hurch leadership training.	2004-01-01

It spawned the WWJD (What Would Jesus Do) craze of bracelets, toys, binders, etc.  For these reasons alone it should make a person curious enough to read it.<br />PLOT:  As can be gleaned from other reviews the plot is simple.  A fancy church is confronted with a man from the streets who offers them a good chastening for being snobs and promptly dies, causing the church to rethink it's existence.  Several church members make a vow to ask the question, \\"What would Jesus do?\\" before every decision for the next year.  The books traces their lives during that year.<br />POSITIVES: The very plot alone is inspirational enough to make it a good read.  As I wrote before, this book has caused quite a stir (another reason to read it).<br />NEGATIVES:  This may cause some debate, but too often the question WWJD is answered assuming that Jesus is an evangelical Christian from the frontier stream of Americana.  Some of it holds water, some of it would be hard to defend using only Scripture.  The style of writing is OK, but a little contrived for the sake of delivering the message.  I found myself wondering why it has sold so many copies and later discovered that it was sort of like the great holiday movie classic, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, in that it was offered in the public domain.<br />RECOMMENDATION: I read it, was not overly moved, and when I was finished I thought to myself, \\"Hmmm, that's what the book was all about.\\"  I then went on to the next book.  If reading Christian classics inspires you, read the book.  It certainly is a classic.  If you want to be challenged in the depths of your soul on living the Christian life, read something by Dietrich Bonhoeffer.	2003-12-27

Peretti takes themes from his novel, THIS PRESENT DARKNESS, and expands them to new levels.  Anyone who liked the frist book will also like this second book.  I liked both of them.  However, I feel it necessary to point out a couple of things that are so simple everyone should understand, but don't seem to.<br />STRENGTHS:  This book is full of intrigue, suspense, and conflict.  It has all of the good ingredients of an interesting novel.  It might offend some who already have a bias toward fundamentalist Christianity, but that bias probably was there looking for an outlet anyway.<br />WEAKNESSES: This book is a work of fiction.  Like any good novel, it creates a believable imaginary world based on Scriptural principles, but the world is still imaginary.  It is fun to talk about, much like the movie, THE MATRIX, but one should not base doctrinal beliefs on one author's creation.<br />MY ADVICE:  My advice for this novel, just as for the first one, is: Read it for fun (I liked it a lot).  Discuss the ideas in it (I did), but if you really want something to sink your teeth in, stick to biographies of great Christians.  Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction and a whole lot more fascinating.	2003-12-26

Whether reviewers realize it or not, their ability to recognize a masterpiece is reflected in their comments on this particular work.<br />I am not saying that everyone must agree with everything in this book any more than everyone must agree with Christianity in general.  I am only saying that if anyone wants to understand the basics of orthodox Christianity, that person must contend with this work.  It is probably the broadest, simpliest, statement on Christian doctrine penned in the 20th century.  It is probably responsible for more people converting to the Christian faith than any other 20th century book.<br />If you are a Christian and have not wrestled with the concepts of this book, do not call yourself a scholar.  If you are not a Christian and are interested in the faith, this book is a great starting place.  If you think you are a Christian, but strongly disagree with the majority of this work, your theology is probably not within the bounds of historic, orthodox Christianity.<br />I realize my comments are likely to offend some.  I am not trying to make a judgement of whether this book is accurate or if any particular person is good or evil.  I am merely stating that this book has one of the best grasps of historic Christian theology you will come across.<br />If you want to study the Christian faith, get this book.	2003-12-18

Nouwen copies from John of the Cross when he insists that the value of a contemplative life is character transformation.<br />His first section on solitude is right on.  Too many of our church leaders are so action oriented they shy away from solitude.  The resulting religion is as cold and pragmatic as any profit driven corporation.  Your pastor needs to read this chapter.<br />Nouwen's second section on silence picks up where the discussion on solitude ends, and goes a bit deeper.  Here, he offers a call for measured speech.  All speech must have purpose and come from a quiet center.  This is a good section for any person who wishes to grow deeper in the Christian faith.  However, those who are too quick to act or ADD to accept it may lay the book aside about this time.<br />The final section deals with hesychasm.  Nouwen describes this as prayer of the heart (entire being) as opposed to usual prayer of the mind.  Prayer of the mind usually asks things of God, or tries to understand God.  These ways of praying are not bad, but limited.  Nouwen opts for a style of prayer that offers constant communion with God.<br />However, it is as this point that I feel the book breaks down.  Nouwen does a good job of stating the need for such prayer, and refers to it with illustrations and theology, but he doesn't quite teach the reader how to go about practicing this form of inner prayer.<br />Someone well versed in contemplative prayer may feel affirmed by this book and get a lot out of it.<br />Someone who wishes to break the yoke of busy, busy Christianity will find a seductive light of hope within the pages of these books.<br />But the novice who wishes to dig deep, must use the book as a springboard to other readings.  Fortunately there are many other good sources out there to continue feasting upon.	2003-12-15

Men were created for adventure and to change history, whether that means the history of a nation or of his own family.  This is a call for men everywhere to step up to the plate.<br />The book is not without problems.  Eldredge often overstates his point, carries it for too many chapters, and adds a touch too much &quot;macho&quot;.  At times these can become so thick that they hide the nuggets of gold within the book.  At other times they can become so inspiring that the reader wants to pick up the nearest sword and go slay a dragon.<br />If the man who reads this book loves adventure, he will like this book.<br />If the man who reads this book wrestles with some scars from childhood, this book may be healing.<br />If the man who reads this book refuses to step up to the plate and shoulder responsibility, this book will challenge him.<br />If the man who reads this book is comfortable with himself, has worked through his childhood pains, and is willing to roll up his sleaves and give of himself to others (and unlike the impression I get from Eldredge, I believe there are such men), he might think the book doesn't relate to him.<br />If a woman reads this book, she will be gifted with a glimpse of insight into the soul of a man.  But it might be a confusing glimpse full of mixed signals, because not every man will relate to every portion of the book.<br />All in all, the book would make an excellent gift and a good conversation starter.	2003-12-10

IF You are a died in the wool Merton fan this journal is a must read.  It (along with the other 6 volumes) helps the reader understand the person behind the books.  It took me a long time to read this book because I chewed on a few pages each day and tried to picture the last year of Merton's life in my mind as I compared it to my own struggles.  I loved the book!  Give it 5 stars.<br />IF you are looking for quick insights to the contemplative mind and think Merton is a good place to look, you are correct, but this is not the volume for you.  Remember this is a journal, not a book.  It is open with Merton's struggles and anxieties.  Often Merton quotes small portions of other works and sketchy notes that are important to him, but confusing to the reader.  You probably will not finish the volume.  Give it 1 star.<br />IF you are interested in the biographies of notable Christians, and I am, you will find this volume intriguing, inspiring, and at times troubling as you wrestle with the imperfections of a person that many put on a pedestal.  Give it 3 stars and prepare to wrestle.<br />IF you journal, and I do, you will feel an urge after each section to go to your own journal and fill in a few pages.  Give it 5 stars and sharpen your pencil.<br />That's as much as I can say about this book, but it should be enough for you to know if you want to add it to your library.	2003-11-24

It briefly offers simple explanations on the history and benefits of meditation.  Then it suggests several styles of meditation and ends with offering several selected meditations for specific life situations such as relaxation, health, stress reduction, etc.  It does not tie meditation with any particular religion, but offers a more clinical approach.<br />The book is a quick read.  It probably is more the type of book one might find lying on a coffee table than a book for serious study.  However, if you are interested in meditation, but worry that you may be sucked in to some religious slant, this book will give you the nuts and bolts without the religious slant.  It might even make you wonder if some of the deep religious experiences people profess are more natural than people would like to believe.	2003-11-23

Many people love Maxwell's work.  Almost as many people despise it.  Those who love it run the risk of becoming lopsided in ministry.  Those who despise it run the risk of ignoring his practical advice to their own peril.  Taken for what it is, this book is probably one of the best pragmatic books on organizational management available.<br />This book is NOT . . .<br />  spiritual.  Granted, good Christian leadership is more than mechanical.<br />  new.  Maxwell doesn't create new principles.  He rediscovers the tried and true.<br />  balanced.  Maxwell focuses his spotlight on pragmatic issues.<br />  the whole tool box.  Don't ignore it because it leaves a lot unsaid.<br />This book IS . . .<br />  effective.  Read it carefully and slowly.  It can help you become a better leader.<br />  easy to read.  Maxwell might not be the world's deepest theologian, but he is an excellent communicator.<br />  packaged well.  You can add workbooks and multimedia to create a great leadership training course.<br />  a wonderful tool.  I suggest it be coupled with someone who writes from another perspective . . . like Eugene Peterson.<br />Now for some great quotes from the book.<br />&quot;Leadership ability determines a person's level of effectiveness.&quot;<br />&quot;The true measure of leadership is influence--nothing more, nothing less.&quot;<br />&quot;Leadership develops daily, not in a day.&quot;<br />&quot;Anyone can steer the ship, but it takes a leader to chart the course.&quot;<br />&quot;When the real leader speaks, people listen.&quot;<br />&quot;Trust is the foundation of leadership.&quot;<br />&quot;People naturally follow leaders stronger than themselves.&quot;<br />&quot;Leaders evaluate everything with a leadership bias.&quot;<br />&quot;Who you are is who you attract.&quot;<br />&quot;Leaders touch a heart before they ask for a hand.&quot;<br />&quot;A leader's potential is determined by those closest to him.&quot;<br />&quot;Only secure leaders give power to others.&quot;<br />&quot;It takes a leader to raise up a leader.&quot;<br />&quot;People buy into the leader, then the vision.&quot;<br />&quot;Leaders find a way for the team to win.&quot;<br />&quot;Momentum is a leader's best friend.&quot;<br />&quot;Leaders understand that activity is not necessarily accomplishment.&quot;<br />&quot;A leader must give up to go up.&quot;<br />&quot;When to lead is as important as what to do and where to go.&quot;<br />&quot;To add growth, lead followers--to multiply, lead leaders.&quot;<br />&quot;A leader's lasting value is measured by succession.&quot;<br />Find any of these interesting?

New Christians often have never heard the principles listed.  Too many churches are too quiet on the subject of money.  This book will make an excellent teaching tool for confirmation classes, discipleship groups, and home Bible studies.<br />This book does not cost much, will help Christians grow, and could help strengthen the church.  The book is filled with pithy quotes like this one, \\"It's increasingly common for Christians to ask one another the tough questions: How is your marriage?  Have you been spending time in the Word?  How are you doing in terms of sexual purity?  Have you been sharing your faith?  but how often do we ask, 'How much are you giving to the Lord?' or 'have you been robbing God?' or 'Are you winning the battle against materialism?'\\" (p.81).<br />The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because it didn't present any information that was new to me.	2003-10-27
US	52586678	R3MFYFGHNIR91W	0913836583	566465397	The Orthodox Way	Books	5	5	7	N	N	A Wonderful Book	Bishop Kallistos Ware does an excellent job of offering the reader a modern Orthodox catechism.  The book presents theology in a way that is never stuffy and always enlightening.  Non Orthodox readers will be impressed by the similarities of the  basic trinitarian theology of the Orthodox church and other branches of Christianity whether it be Roman Catholic, Protestant, Anglican, etc.  However, readers from other traditions will be challenged by the depth of mysticism in Orthodoxy and the emphasis on a serious relationship with God this side of heaven.  Eastern Orthodoxy has a message for the rest of Christianity and this book delivers it well.	2003-10-27

It's hard to beat the classics and Pilgrim's Progress is one of the greatest Christian classics ever written.  I am glad it is now in modern English.  I read a few pages every night with my family.  It makes a great devotional book and sure beats all gathering around the television.  My children are age 17 and 12.  One might think they are too old for such a thing, but not so.  If you have young children at home, skip the little devotional books for a few weeks, shell out a few dollars, buy the book, and start a new tradition of introducing your family to the classics.  Go from this to The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe and you may break the TV habit for good!. . . Perhaps . . .	2003-10-11

So many books teach the novice how to go about sitting, breathing, visualizing, etc.  Merton cuts through the chase and offers a helpful guide to the Christian who really wants to grow through the cultivation of the inner life.  But why shouldn't he?  Merton's books were teaching generations truths about the contemplative life before the buzz words started to buzz.  This short, easy to read book is a joy to recommend.	2003-09-21

In the pattern of a growing number of Catholic contemplatives since the day of Thomas Merton, John Michael Talbot's book \\"Come to the Quiet\\" melded the Christian West, the Christian East, and non Christian sources.<br />I am not sure exactly how to fill out this review.  It is a book that I am not sure I'll pass out to my friends, yet a book I've returned to over and over.  It gives specific steps and exercises to help the novice grow in contemplative meditation, yet these exercises will be outgrown in time.  It is thoroughly Christian, yet contains enough non Christian philosophy to make some people nervous.  It does a better job than most at describing the practices of the contemplative life, yet does not go as far as Merton or John of the Cross into the mystery of the mystic.<br />The book helped me to grow.	2003-09-21

This book cuts across denominational lines.  It comes with a \\"postmodern Eucharist CD\\" which is energy laden and reverent.  The book contains worship ideas for many occasions.<br />If you work with youth, avail yourself of this resource and take your youth deeper than the customary parties, games, snacks, and discussions on dating.	2003-09-21

So many times one reads what &quot;We&quot; have to say about &quot;Them&quot; complete with advice on how to convert them.  This book is not like that.  Here the Catholic and Evangelical both speak in open dialogue.  At times the reader must stretch, as the authors did, to understand other points of view. At times one can feel the tension dripping through the pages of text, but both men stay on target as much as they are able.  This book took great discipline to produce and is a gift to both Catholics and Evangelicals.  One word of advice needs to be given to Catholic readers.  While the Catholic position can be offered with a certain amount of clarity, evangelical theology is not as easy to articulate.  Some evangelical denominations might lean more toward the Catholic point of view on certain issues (like eternal security).  All in all this was one of those books I just could not put down until it was finished.  It was better than TV.	2003-09-21

The book is interesting and reveals the history, meanings, and variations of practice of the various customs it covers.  I enjoyed the book and would gladly purchase it again.<br />However, the buyer should be aware that so many of our traditions are sectarian that the portions of the book most likely to be used are already being used.  This could limit the usefulness of the book, unless the church is very open to new ideas.<br />For instance, the typical Baptist Church will not look favorably upon a youth minister who teaches the youth to make the sign of the cross each morning.  I am NOT trying to suggest these signs are all Catholic.  They come from various backgrounds, but most churches are hesitant to borrow from other traditions.  Still, I liked the book.	2003-09-21

Law was an 18th century Anglican.  As he grew, his theology also grew.  Near the end of his life, his writings began to lean toward gnosticism.  &quot;Serious Call&quot; was penned while Law was in his prime.  It was on John Wesley's personal book shelf and greatly influenced the father of Methodism.  This book will challenge the reader.  It speaks as strongly to the 21st century reader as to the 18th century reader.	2003-06-23

As with many philosophers, this book is not an easy read.  He starts with a description of the spirit, mind, body, social, and soul aspects of humans.  This can become confusing and cause a casual reader to lose interest.  However, the reader who persists will strike gold.  Willard quickly challenges the simplistic two-dimensional view that is so prevelant in American Evangelical Christianity and replaces it with a depth that has the reader thirsting for a deeper understanding of God.  This is not the &quot;theological junk food&quot; that is so often found in Christian bookstores today.  This book can start the reader on a path to a transformed life.	2003-01-24
