At a time when everyone and their brother is coming out with a book about the failures of the modern church, Yancey's book is likely to get lost in the pile.  Which is unfortunate, because it's really nothing like the rest of those books.   <br /> <br />How about \\"Cloud of Witnesses?\\"  That's catchy, and much more relevant to what Yancey's doing here - introducing us to 13 people who have helped him to grow spiritually, to see Jesus and love him.    <br /> <br />I think when I'm fifty, I'll write a book like this.  (Perhaps just a pamphlet.)  I don't care if it gets published; simply the exercise of taking stock, seeing who has influenced me over the course of my life and why,  then introducing those people to a few other people, seems more than worthwhile.  I'm thankful for the friends my friend Mr. Yancey has introduced me to, and I'm excited to get to know them better.	2005-08-18
US	51001729	RUTKVYJY7ML45	0375507256	851412948	Cloud Atlas: A Novel	Books	4	10	15	N	N	story within a story within a story	The first chapter is the journal of a mapmaker in the South Seas, in the clutches of a quack doctor who invents a brain disease and feeds him narcotics.  That ends abruptly - mid-sentence - and we find (eventually) the journal was being read by a young, brash, penniless composer in Belgium in the early twentieth century.  But only about half the journal has survived; thus the sudden ending.  Now we are reading letters this composer is writing to a good friend in England, until we discover the letters are actually being read by an investigative journalist; the dead man who tipped her off was their recipient.  We follow her adventures to uncover the truth, until her car plunges off a bridge and we discover we are actually reading the first proofs of a novel, in the hands of a loony small-time publisher, who is himself running from creditors and manages to get himself incarcerated in a nursing home.  We laugh at his attempts to escape, until we realize we're actually watching a movie, sometime in the future, in the company of a liberated clone and an underground rebel.  We hear this clone's story of liberation, in question and answer format, and it's pretty clear we are listening in on an interview - the only question is who is listening with us.   Turns out it is a post-civilization Hawaiian, who saw the interview when an anthropologist of sorts brought the player with her from a slightly-more-civilized place.  He watched the first half incognito but was interrupted, but now on his deathbed, after telling the story of his life, he'd like to see the rest.  So we watch the rest.  And the clone, just before her execution, asks to finish the movie she was watching before she was on the lam.  And the small-time publisher, once he escapes the nursing home, finds the novel writer, reads the rest of the story, and publishes it.   And the investigative journalist, once her case is cracked, comes across the rest of the letters between her tip-off and his longtime friend, the composer.  Who finds the rest of the  maritime journal under a bed.   And we are back where we started.  Sort of.   <br /> <br />The effect is that, at least through the first half, you feel like you're reading a collection of short stories.   Probably Mitchell's greatest achievement is his ability to really inhabit the widely varying styles of different stories - each one feels completely different, not just in plot, place, time period, but in style, like a new author is taking over.    <br /> <br />There is a recurring bit about a comet-shaped birthmark and de ja v,  leaving you to draw your own conclusions about reincarnation/past lives etc,  though I don't know quite how this would work and the stories are varying levels of fiction and reality.   This theme seems superficial and extraneous to me, and I don't think the book would lose much if it lost it.   <br />  <br />The real theme running through the book is about power, oppression, and rebellion -  in every story, the main character, in one way or another, overcomes an oppressive system, be it a nursing home or a vast technocratic totalitarian government.  Mitchell indulges himself on the last page, allowing his character to wax philosophical and express his themes directly.   I was going to copy that passage out for this review, but the book was due back at the library.   So you'll have to read it for yourself.	2005-05-25

Otherwise, most of this ground is pretty covered.   That doesn't make this bad reading, far from it, because Campolo and McLaren cover their ground pretty well, summing up clearly what can be complex and confusing issues.   But if you've been keeping up at all with the ongoing debates in the church and culture surrounding the issues here (homosexuality, seminary, the environment, etc.)  don't expect to have your mind changed by this book.   <br /> <br />That said, there are a few chapters that stand out:   <br /> <br />--The one on the Bible, which offers alternative approaches to scripture (beyond analysis.)  I want to make copies of this and give it to everyone in my small group.   <br /> <br />--The second half of the chapter on worship, in which McLaren condemns chasing \\"the Feeling\\"  and leaving God behind.   <br /> <br />--The last chapter, on Postmodernism.   How refreshing to hear the pomo church guru himself admit that he's growing sick of the term and its myriad meanings and mis-usages.  (oy, what a thoroughly \\"modern\\" use of alliteration that was!)   <br /> <br />It's a pretty quick and light read, and might be one to keep on the bookshelf for the sake of lending to those who are just stepping out of the hyper-religious conservative mindset.   <br /> <br />PS - the title is a bit misleading.  The authors never actually deal with \\"how the culture\\" has done anything.  They just address where they think mainstream middle class churchianity has missed the point.	2005-05-20
US	51001729	R1WHNAYPW0NIUK	0385721676	264457638	Oryx and Crake	Books	3	5	8	N	N	hmm...	Seems like most of the interviews and reviews I'm reading about this book - not on this site, but elsewhere -- paint it as a dark prophetic vision, \\"speculative fiction,\\"  where we're going if we the people keep on the path we're on.  Well, yes, it's that, but it's not precisely that.  That's only the background; that's the world before the disaster, not after it.   And, after all, the disaster is not the logical result of mankind continuing along its present course, it's the result of a very smart, very cynical man deciding to bring it about. The end of civilization doesn't just happen, it's engineered.   This feels like a very important distinction to me.   We can't say, \\"O wise one, how do we keep from disaster? Of what do we need to repent?\\"    We live in a world - we have for some fifty years - in which the right man, with the right access, could bring about the end of civilization.  The tools are there.  They don't need to be invented in the near future. <br /> <br /> So I don't think \\"prophetic vision\\" is what this novel is all about.  I'm going to give the author more credit than that, despite some of the things on the book's website and that she's said in interviews.  Also because of some of them.    Like these: <br /> <br />\\"The driving force in the world today is the human heart - that is, human emotions. (Yeats, Blake - every poet, come to think of it - has always told us that.) Our tools have become very powerful. Hate, not bombs, destroys cities. Desire, not bricks, rebuilds them. Do we as a species have the emotional maturity and the wisdom to use our powerful tools well?  Hands up, all who think the answer is Yes.\\" <br /> <br />\\"It's not a question of our inventions - all human inventions are merely tools - but of what might be done with them; for no matter how high the tech, homo sapiens sapiens remains at heart what he's been for tens of thousands of years - the same emotions, the same preoccupations.\\" <br /> <br /> So maybe the central questions driving the book are how did we get here, and is it possible to start over and get somewhere else, or is this our inevitable end?    Crake believes that destruction is hard-wired into humanity, so in order to start over, he rewires humanity so as to avoid destruction.   (It would have been interesting to read a Frankenstein-like journal of this task.)   In essence, he is playing God and reinventing Adam and Eve.   Except this time around, without the bugs.  Will it work? The book's ambiguous about it.  The children of Crake are certainly able to live \\"at harmony with nature\\" at present, and so it's possible that they can propagate for millenia without destroying their environment.  Maybe.  But, despite Crake's best efforts, in a short while they have begun to create both art and religion -- all at once.   Will this lead them into destructive patterns?   Crake seems to think so:   <br />  <br />\\"Watch out for art, Crake used to say.  As soon as they start doing art, we're in trouble.  Symbolic thinking of any kind would signal downfall, in Crake's view.  Next they'd be inventing idols, and funerals, and grave goods, and the afterlife, and sin, and Linear B, and kings, and then slavery and war.\\" <br />    <br />But is a man a man without symbolic thinking, without religion and art?  If Crake were able to genetically de-program symbolic thought from mankind, would he have anything left but a talking ape?  Old white dudes (I don't remember who exactly - Rousseau? Locke?  Kant?)  postulated that rational thought was what separated us from the animals.  And if rational thought inevitably leads to sin, slavery and war, are we genetically programmed to destroy ourselves and our world?   <br />  <br />Maybe it's supposed to be a book that poses questions, if you're willing to dig for them,  more than it offers answers.  It certainly brings up lots of questions about human nature, man's relation to Nature, etc.   It feels kind of sloppy to me - a good read, certainly, but I'mtying myself in knots trying to figure parts of it out - the significance of Snowman's apparently routine trip to the compound, the reason for bringing people back in at the end, etc.  Either I'm not smart enough to see the reasons, or there were no grand reasons.  In which case, it's a good book, but falls short of being literature.	2005-03-25

Whatever his peace was, it was not the peace of an amiable indifference.\\" <br />--Dorothy Sayers <br /> <br /> <br />\\"You can't conceive, my child, nor can I or anyone, the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God.\\" - Graham Greene <br /> <br /> <br />Brian McLaren sets out to redefine Christianity as a story instead of a philosophy/theology, and I respect that.   The only problem is, he tells a completely BORING story - in five chapters, all starting with C.  There is no drama.  No tension.  No heroes, no great feats, no intricate twists or surprise turns.  Basically, it's the story of a nice God and mean people, and all of the nice things this nice God does for the mean people, and all of the mean things these mean people do to this nice God.  Yawn.   <br /> <br />I hate being called \\"nice.\\"  It's such a sterile, safe, powerless, harmless adjective.  Nice is what your parents want you to be.  Nice is who your parents want you to marry.  I'd rather be called just about anything else.  I'd imagine God feels the same way.   <br /> <br />For example - McLaren finally, after dancing around it, deals with hell towards the end of the book.  Except his hell - the hell of a nice God - is more like a cancer ward or a hospice <br />than anything (ironic, as much of the book takes place in a cancer ward.)  God doesn't \\"condemn\\" people to hell per se - He's just unable to save them.   Like a doctor to a cancer patient he says something like, \\"I'm sorry, but there's not much I can do for you.  If you'd have come to me sooner...\\"    So it really has to do with nice God's inability to save everyone - the limits ofhis power. (Don't mistake me here - I'm not a fan of the eternal damnation, implements of torture, Dante-esque and Southern Baptist version of hell.  I don't know what hell is, or what it will be like.  The Bible doesn't speak of it much.  But I do suspect it will have more to do with justice than with God's incompetence.)    <br /> <br />Why do we always do this?  WHY do we always feel like we've got to dress God up in a new suit, clean Him up, straighten his collar, wipe that smudge off his cheek?  \\"I want you to meet some of my friends - so behave.  Be a nice God.\\"   We skip over or deliberately fuzz out the UN-nice parts of the story -- God stuffing the ungrateful Israelites with quail until they puke, or giving David three choices of decimation, or Jesus calling his best friend bad names.   Come on, God.  Be nice.   Nice doggie.   <br /> <br />And in doing so, we lose the best parts of the story.  The heroes.  The battles.  Incredible risk, incredible cost.  The danger, the thrill, the mystery: the utter STRANGENESS of mercy and redemption, of blood sacrifice and blessed suffering.   This is a wonderful, intoxicating, story, if we'll remember to tell it right.   <br /> <br />Be honest - do you really want a nice God?  Does anybody?	2005-03-21

But reading this one helped me clarify what I want out of a mystery  novel.   I want all the necessary and relevant facts presented to me to solve the mystery, and I want the detective to be so brilliant that she  sees what I can't and solves the mystery in such a way that I go, \\"Of  course!  It was right in front of me all the time, I just couldn't see it!\\"  That's fun reading.   <br />  <br />Maybe that's rare, I don't really know.  This book doesn't have it.  When the mystery  is solved, the culprit turns out to be a minor character, and the conclusive bit of evidence was gathered by Wimsey outside of the story.  It's really  more police work than detective work, and it ultimately feels anticlimactic to me.   <br /> <br />What Sayers does do well is explore her protagonist's psyche and her complex relationship with Lord Peter.  Rarely have I read a better account of grown-ups trying to figure out a relationship; this is not flowers and romance love, but it is love, and I enjoyed the complexity, subtlety, and seriousness of it. In the end, Sayers (in this book, anyway) is really more like Jane Austen than  Agatha Christie, and I guess I just wish I'd known that going in.	2005-01-14
US	51001729	RQO1TTK5X1RIU	0830819908	325644369	A Peculiar People: The Church as Culture in a Post-Christian Society	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Excellent	Clapp begins by showing how the church, since the time of Constantine, has functioned as a subordinate, a \\"chaplain\\" to the dominant culture.   This is not a new idea (see Luther) but if it is new to you, this book does a good job expositing it.  What Clapp does add to the discussion is a sharp analysis of where the church stands today -- as modern society decides it doesn't have much use for a chaplain anymore, what is the church's response?   He shows how conservatives who want to put \\"God back in government\\" and liberals who want to take the gospel out of church functions (weddings, funerals, etc.)  are essentially twins separated at birth -- both are simply trying to reclaim the church's traditional place in society.   <br />Defining the problem is the strong suit of this book; offering an answer is weaker.  Clapp makes it clear that there is another road that the church ought to take, and spends a long time trying to lay it out, but in the end I have less than a clear picture of what it ought to be.   In his defense, I don't think this is his fault.  Ultimately I think that the role the church needs to and decides to play in a post-Christian society is as yet undetermined -- it is something we need to explore, experiment with, and figure out as we go.  If Clapp had offered a clear, easy step-by-step guide to how to succeed in the 21st century, I probably would've been dissatisfied with it (my postmodern roots are showing, aren't they?)   As it is, I respect him for his analysis of the past, for taking stabs at possible solutions or directions, and for saying a lot of things that need to be said.   This is a valuable book and one I highly recommend to church leaders and those interested in the shaping of the church.	2004-06-23
US	51001729	R1SZ2BCZ0TA318	0452282829	872593606	We Were the Mulvaneys (Oprah's Book Club)	Books	2	12	14	N	N	Noble concept poorly executed.	Shortly after I finished reading this book, I heard an interview of the author that improved my opinion of the book.   Wait, how's that?  Am I reviewing the book or the author?  Good question.  What I should say is that the interview with the author made me respect what the author was attempting to do in the book.  It's a noble venture.  And don't tell me that outside information, including other's opinions, doesn't affect your own opinion about a book.  That's what book clubs are about, after all, and incidentally, this is one of Oprah's pick.  All hail Oprah, patron saintess of new authors.  JC Oates isn't a new author, though. <br />What was I saying.  Oh yes.  The author's intentions were noble.  To hear her talk about the book surely makes one want to read it.  It's the story of a father who loves his daughter so much he disowns her, and then lets his love for her destroy his marriage, career, and life.  It's a story of a tragedy that affects the victim less than it affects those around her.  (am I spelling \\"affect\\" right?  should it be \\"effect?\\")  It's a story of how, for one character, botched revenge brings more relief than perfect revenge.  Doesn't that sound compelling?<br />The problem is, it's not all that compelling.  I got tired of the characters: all of them, starting with the sunny sweet mother, then the overly analytical Patrick, than the overly aggressive, angry head in the sand father, and finally the oh-so-innocent.  Basically in the order the focus shifts, I grow tired.  And more than the characters, I grew frustrated with the author's techniques.  It drove me crazy that sometimes Judd told the story and sometimes Judd was a character in the story (Judd did this, said that, instead of I did this, did that.)  And it drove me doubly crazy that every time the characters neared a turning point, the author pulled away from them.  Patrick gets his revenge, and something changes inside him.  What?  How?  I don't know.  The author doesn't say.  All we know is he quits school and only sends random postcards to his family.  And Maryanne, after running away for so long, finally allows herself to be loved.  How?  I don't know.  We cut from \\"the cat's not the only one that loves you\\" to married with children.  I begin to feel that Oates is afraid of these, the most challenging moments in the stories of her characters, afraid of being trite and pedantic and heavy-handed, so she shies away from them.  It's true, those are all dangers, but those are the great challenges of writing a good book.  By not living up to those challenges, the heart of this story is left out.  What we get, basically, is a sketch of a family that can't solve its problems, until somehow, vaguely, it does, and then there's a picnic happy ending.  <br />This could have been a great book.  It almost is a great book.  It's a great concept.  But the execution falls short.	2004-06-21

I just don't get it, Annie.   <br />You've got two trains of thought going here, in opposite directions.   Eventually they should clash spectacularly, and after the wreck we would know what's what.  But it never happens.  <br />First train: eternity.  The way you write about this is breathtaking.  Beautiful even as it's unsettling,  you make us realize how small we are, how many of us there have been, how insignificant our lives are.  We are like sand, so numerous, and like clouds, so fleeting.  No one tries to remember the clouds or get to know the sand.  Why should we be any different?<br />Second train: Calamity.  Birth defects.  All of the ugly and tragic things that have happened, are happening, will happen.    A tidal wave kills 108,000.  Bird-headed dwarves.  Baal Shem Tov, the exile of Teilhard.   Who can cope with all of this suffering?  <br />Do you see how they must clash?  <br />Yet you come away with some strange conclusions.  That God must have his hands tied, cannot be omnipotent and good simultaneously.  Annie, don't you see that this conclusion is riding on that second train?   You carry suffering back onto that first train and wave it around like a weapon..  <br />We could go insane thinking like this.  Insane like Mao, distancing himself  from the individual and focusing on the eternal.  That's how he could say things like &quot;I'm willing to lose 600 million.&quot;  What, after all, in the face of eternity, is 600 million deaths?  But the other insanity is even worse -- the one that comes from focussing on the suffering and forgetting the eternal.  For in this case, you may save the suffering individual, but you murder God.  And without God, there is no healing for the suffering.  <br />Once you've been on that first train, how can you walk away with any confidence in your own ability to reason and understand the big things?  Things like eternity, the Absolute the Reasons?  How can I attempt to know the mind of God?    Where He begins and ends?I cannot even get my mind around the beginnings and endings of beetles.  <br />When the two trains clash, what must emerge is a profound humility.  Yes, there is profound suffering in the world.  But it is an incomprehensibly vast world.  Suffering is not what defines this universe.   Defining the universe in terms of suffering -- letting that be the data from which you draw your conclusions about God and Evil and the Point of Things -- is like defining the universe based on beetles.  There are so many other things out there!  <br />And maybe, Annie, maybe that's the leap you're unwilling to make.  If this life, in its terrible shortness and insignificance, is our only shot at things, if pain can define us and death can end us, then the conclusions we would have to draw would be quite frustrating.    If the physical world is our only chance at understanding God, we have no chance.   We are doomed to make bad guesses.  <br />Death comes often and unpredictably.  A hundred thousand die of the plague, a holy man is tortured and killed at the hands of the Romans.  And if that's the end of the story, it's a horrible story and I want no more of it.  But what if it isn't?  What if that's just chapter one? What if there are a thousand other pages of life, and justice, and joy?  What if the Reason doesn't come till the End?  Will you still give up in chapter one?  <br />Annie, hang on.  You can outlast this life, this terribly limited perspective and tiny brain.  You can outlive the tragedy of the bird-headed dwarves to see the beauty and glory of the bird-headed dwarves.  Don't come to any final conclusions yet; the votes aren't all in. <br />  I am more and more convinced that one day we will look back on our years in this meatbag in much the same way we look back on puberty.  With a laugh.  Aware that it was formative,  amazed we didn't kill or permanently scar ourselves.  Heck, we didn't even know which things were important and which didn't matter.  Most of the big questions don't get answered; most of the big issues never get addressed.  You just realize, eventually, that they're not that big.  Actually, they're pretty stupid and embarassing.  The product of a small mind working too hard.  <br />Will it be this way in eternity?  I think so.  I strive today for understanding of God and His ways.  I make progress one hard-earned step at a time.  It is right that I should do this.  I am like an adolescent trying to grow up.  But there will come a time when all the progress I have made in a lifetime will be surpassed in a few seconds, if seconds exist in eternity.  I will look on the face of God, and will understand.  <br />So who is God?  Why is there so much suffering? WHAT'S WITH THE BIRD-HEADED DWARVES?  I don't know.  I am as yet miles away from God.  How can I know His mind?  My very best, most intelligent guesses fall short.  How can I put any stock in them?  But I have learned this -- I don't have to put any stock in them.  It's ok that they're wrong.  I don't want them to stay wrong, but I'm confident that they won't, and in the mean time, all I have to do is keep them from killing me.  Just hang on.  There is no test, there will be no test on how many of my ideas about God and the Universe are right.  I will be held accountable for the lives of my fellow human beings, and I will be judged on whether or not I spent my little life crawling towards God or away from Him.  That's all, I think, but it's plenty enough to keep me busy for these seventy or eighty years.    And it's small enough that I can get my little brain around it.	2004-06-09
US	51001729	R256RT1NA2ZIAG	0451525000	499001932	Bread and Wine (Signet Classics)	Books	4	20	25	N	N	Subtle and masterful	The first time I tried to read this book, I didn't get it.   Perhaps I was too distracted or reading it too quicky or sporadically, but I kept waiting for something important to happen or somebody to say something worth underlining and quoting, and got impatient when nothing happened and nobody said anything.  It has sat abandoned on my bookshelf for a couple of years.<br />This time around, I had a little more time to read and a little more space to think.  It made all the difference.   I enjoyed the subtlety of Silone's characterization.  He delights in small, subtle humor, in symbolism that doesn't scream itself aloud -- like the drunk peasant who falls off his donkey and then beats the donkey.   It slips by you if you're not attuned to it.  <br />There are probably other valid interpretations, but to me, Pietro (or Don Paolo) really isn't the main character here.  He is simply a placeholder for the reader, so that I can see and hear and experience rural Italy.   Perhaps because I can so easily identify with him. (I, too, am an idealist, a revolutionary with romantic ideas about the poor and romantic hatred for Institution.  I may not be an exile on the run, but I live in a more tolerant time and place.  A demonstration in Italy in the 30's might have been viewed by the authorities as criminal activity; in 21st century America, it's considered entertainment.  I don't know which is more frustrating.)  I have experienced Pietro's (and Silone's) frustration with those he is trying to help -- that ironic feeling that you could do a lot of good for the poor, if the poor would just cooperate.  <br />The peasants of Italy, and the universal poor by extension, are the heroes of this book -- those people that most revolutionaries strive and die to empower and free from oppression, yet few revolutionaries actually take the time to understand and love.  The gold in this book is Silone's gentle, compassionate, humorous rendering of these people -- what they care about, don'tcare about, how they make decisions, what they fear, what they think about and hope for.  It is an exposition of a collective mind; a dangerous undertaking, bound to slip into stereotype at times, and one that Silone undertakes with great reverence.  <br />As I go among the poor in my own day and age, I remember Silone, and find that what he has to say rings true.  Much too often, attempts to help, to organize, and to \\"empower\\" are ultimately patronizing and arrogant.  It is much better simply to break bread with them, and learn to know and love them.  After all, this is what Jesus did, the greatest and best riend of the poor, and the ultimate Saviour of all mankind.  I would rather follow his model than Marx's.	2004-01-21

Like those books, it is a children's story that adults will find great satisfaction in reading.  <br />Like Tolkien, Watership Down is entrancing in its believability.   A detailed and natural sense of geography embodies both -- Tolkien invented his; Adams wrote about a real place, an actual Down in the hills of England.  Also like Tolkien, Adams has endowed his story with an in-place mythology -- the rabbits have their own age-old stories about gods and heroes and adventures.  It's amazing how much the stories of a people show us the character of that people.  Some of my favorite chapters of the book are when the rabbits stop to tell a story about the great El-Ahrairah and his clever adventures.  <br />Also like the Lord of the Rings, this is a novel that stops just short of allegory, and thankfully so.  The limitations of allegory is that the tighter they are, the more they are limited to the time and place they are written for.  Try to read Jonathan Swift's novels these days.  Aside from Gulliver's Travels (which is much more universal in its parallels,) without extensive knowledge of English/Irish history, you are lost.  Tale of a Tub, though brilliant and highly praised (and hated) at its time, now is hardly readable.    Instead, Adams, like Tolkien, writes of universal themes.  Universal enough that the crossover from rabbit to  human is effortless, and the crossover from his time period to ours or any other isn't very much harder.  The warren the rabbits leave dies because it refuses to change.  Is this the England Adams knew?  Perhaps.  It also applies to a lot of churches and businesses.   The second warren they visit has traded freedom and vitality for comfort and decadence.  Is this America, as Adams sees it?  Perhaps.  It could also be Rome.  Or suburbia.  <br />But these themes are not all that make this book readable.  A lot of authors have written horribly clunky books with universal themes.  Adams is a deft storyteller; his characters are well-drawn and different from each other, heroic and limited; one of the things I appreciated most in the reading was the peculiar limitations and abilities of rabbits.  Unlike most, Adams has not written a novel about men and called them rabbits; they are markedly different.  They don't understand bridges and boats and trains; they run fast but wear out easily, they are easily frightened, and can panic and be paralyzed.   In addition, Adams  has a great sense of suspense: he knows when to change perspective to keep the tension running, and when withhold information from the reader-- and parcel it out, bit by bit -- to keep us wondering, and reading.  The novel is paced well, and the problems the rabbits face feel legitimate, even inevitable.<br />A great book.  A classic, on its own peculiar shelf.	2003-12-30

Not an original idea, but certainly one we can stand to be reminded of often, and one I'd love to see more books devoted to that.  <br />Eugene Peterson finds in the Songs of Ascent (Psalms 120-134), a cycle of songs sung by Jewish pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem to worship, a wonderful parallel to the modern (and timeless) Christian pilgrimage.   Each chapter is a meditation on one of the songs, and Peterson draws out the ways each of them show us an aspect of the Christian faith (Repentance, Providence, Worship) and how they relate to each other.  (It is natural that the journey begins with repentance and ends with blessing; the rest of the sequence is just as intuitive.)  <br />Eugene Peterson has a poet's heart and a theologian's training, but the former prevails.  Others may be perturbed that he does not explain exactly why suffering exists in the world; I am grateful that instead he chooses to meditate upon the way that suffering is a central ingredient of human experience....&quot;in suffering we enter the depths; we are at the heart of things, we are near to where Christ was on the cross.&quot;(134)  <br />I enjoyed and appreciated this book not because it taught me a lot of new things, but because it caused me to slow down and reflect; to remember things I had learned, and see them with new eyes.  Like the songs sung on the journey, it is not so much intended to impart new information, but to bring back into mind (and spirit) the old things, the ancient things -- the things that have the power to redeem us and heal us.	2003-12-27

US	51001729	R2VAO39MIV8KLE	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	1	110	190	N	N	(this is not going to be a popular review)	I have read hundreds of books.  I have started, but not finished, thousands.  Almost always it's because I lose interest in the book for one reason or another.   This is the first book ever that I have thrown down in disgust and refused to read any more.  <br />It wasn't because it's a &quot;woman's book.&quot;  Most of my favorite authors are women.  I can see the value in the repeated awe-filled descriptions of birth and menstruation.  I can see how these are mystic experiences, though by the third or fourth or fifth birth, I admit I grew a little weary of the repetition.  It did perturb me a bit that, while the women were colorful, complex, well-rendered characters, the men were cardboard brutes.  But men have written women in the same manner for centuries, so even if it's an intentional feminist choice instead of the author's weakness, it's understandable, forgiveable.  No, that's not why I quit reading. <br />It wasn't the Biblical inaccuracies.  Though they are so plentiful and obvious it seems like it would have just been simpler for Ms. Diamant to change her characters' names and written about a contemporary of Dinah, Leah and Rachel.  I don't know enough to judge the accuracy of Ms. Diamant's  rendering of the time period, but it is convincing and captivating.  Eventually, I stopped thinking, &quot;wait a minute...that's not the way it happened,&quot;  and just let the author tell her story her way.  Actually, I'm kind of glad she did as she did; the people in Genesis are mean and nasty to each other, and wouldn't be much fun to read about.  With a few changes, Ms. Diamant takes Rachel and Leah and their horrible rivalry and changes it into something respectable, even admirable.  <br />It wasn't the worshipful adoration of paganism, though it's true that bugged me almost to the point of quitting.  I know it's true that Rachel and Leah et al probably worshipped gods other than the God of Jacob.  But while Ms. Diamant may have the freedom to change the details of the Genesis account to fit her story, but surely she owes some thematic debt to the original telling - whether you consider it simple literature or a sacred text. If there's one major theme you take away from the history of the people of Israel that's called the Bible, it's that pagan gods are their bane, their major weakness.  When they get rid of them, they prosper.  When they bring them back, they suffer.  To treat this bane with such reverence, awe, and admiration is to mock the original work itself.  But while this irked me, I lived with it; perhaps she worships pagan gods herself, and desires to rewrite their role in the history of her people (From the titles of her nonfiction books, I'm pretty sure she's Jewish.)  OK, understandable.  I'll disagree, but I'll keep reading.  <br />No, what caused me to throw the book down in disgust was this line in particular: <br />&quot;...'You serve the God of Jacob' was one of the worst insults one man could hurl at another for many generations.&quot;  <br />After making Jacob into a weak, violent coward, after (through her narrator) cursing him and all his children and all their children, after taking every major interaction Jacob has with his God and making it ugly and base, she makes the name of God a vile curse in the mouth of the people of the land.<br />What if I were to sit down and write a fictional account of Gandhi and make him a murderer, a liar, a coward, make all his actions not motivated by a higher ideal, but by lust, or greed?  Would it matter that this book was fiction and didn't claim to be anything else, or would it still be offensive?  Would it even be worth reading, or would you write it off as propaganda and reactionism?  I have no illusions about Jacob or his sons -- even the Biblical account of them is far from flattering, and they are not my heroes -- but through this telling, Ms. Diamant has managed not only to spit on their names, but also on the name of the God of Jacob whom they serve.  <BR>     <BR>I, too, serve the God of Jacob.  And, Ms. Diamant, if you were intending to insult me and my people with this book, you have done so.  <br />I'm just astounded so few have noticed.	2003-12-20

It was fascinating to see how my expectations for it shifted.<br />What is the difference between fiction and nonfiction?  Clearly, it extends past fact and fantasy.  If this were fiction, it would feel sloppy; characters' storylines don't draw together like they're supposed to, there's no exciting twist near the end, and we don't ever find out what \\"really happened\\" that fateful night.<br />As nonfiction, all the characters don't have to come together by<br />the end. Lady Chablis and Joe Odom, two of the three primary characters in the first half of the book, don't have to have anything to do with each other or the third main character, Jim Williams, and his four murder trials.  The four murder trials don't have to be markedly different; they are spectacular enough in that they actually happened at all.<br />Another difference. Early on in the book, the narrator introduces an intriguing enigma: Williams possesses a Nazi flag and several german pistols. If this were fiction, that would eventually, even inevitably, lead to some revelation of dark and bizaare Nazi history.  As nonfiction, it simply stays enigma, and that's okay: the world is weird, and little things don't always lead to big things.<br />People like to say that truth is stranger than fiction, and I would imagine that some would cite the bizaare story in this book as evidence.  However, what I'm learning is that we have very different expectationsof truth and fiction -- what makes a wonderful nonfiction account of truly bizaare people and events would, in all honesty, make pretty tepid and sloppy fiction.	2003-12-15

He encourages us to enlist in an advanced course on Life and the Living Of It taught by the Son of God himself.  <br />How simple is that?  <br />The middle of the book is an excellent exposition of the Sermon on the Mount (here called the Discourse on the Hill) with that goal in mind.  Some of it I don't buy, but most of it is truly profound, well thought-out and presented. <br />The end of this book is a treatise on discipleship.  It divides the gospel -- and in such, the ends of discipleship, into two parts: 1. Believe that God is good, loving, and not messing up your life, and 2. Give up your old habits and learn some new ones.   Basically, though he never says so, an exposition of &quot;Repent and believe, for the Kingdom of God is near.&quot;  <br />Who should read this book? <BR>1. Those tired of religious fluff and warmed over sermons put in writing and published.  (Willard is so much meatier.  The bibliography alone is a treasure chest.)<br />2. Those who are studying, have studied, or want to study the Sermon on the Mount.  I was leading a summer study on that passage as I was reading this, and it was immensely helpful. <br />3. Those who are thinking about discipling others in one form or another, but aren't sure how to go about it.  The last third, while not terribly practical, lays down excellent guidelines for discipleship that will give you direction and purpose.  <br />One more note: Willard seems to translate the Bible himself for use in his scriptural examples.  The results are fantastic, strong and direct quotes.  I know nothing about greek or translation, so I can't comment on their reliability, but they certainly make me wish Mr. Willard would take on a full translation.  It would be fantastic.	2003-10-08

And the funny thing is, the same elements I loved about Owen Meaney are the reasons I barely finished Hotel.  <br />I get tired of the constant narrative foreshadowing - \\"it wasn't the last time Lilly would save us all,\\" etc.  Maybe it worked in Owen Meaney because there was a greater theme of fate/destiny, a terrible sense that we were moving toward the inevitable conclusion whether we want to or not.  That theme is utterly missing in Hotel, and as a result, the foreshadowing is just annoying.  <br />I have a lot harder time buying some of the ridiculous elements in this story.  I'm learning that making the ridiculous believable is a trademark of Irving's style, but, well, if I didn't believe it, then he didn't.  A woman in a bear suit that people actually think is a bear?  Have you ever seen a woman in a bear suit?  It doesn't look anything like a bear.    <br />I get utterly sick of the heavy-handed \\"Sorrow floats\\" attempt at symbolism.  It doesn't work for me at all.  At all. <br />And it seems like every time the narrative movement starts to slow down, the author kills someone off.  How many people die in the course of 400 pages?  The body count is in double-digits.  At what point am I allowed to stop caring - or start expecting another death?   This is an amateur author trick, one I won't let my students get away with.<br />John Irving is a strong, talented writer, and I will keep reading his books, hoping to find more like Owen Meaney and less like this.   He has a great gift for storytelling, if he can just keep it under control, and I think his forte is micro-scenes and logical folly.  He writes good, lovable, warm characters (though he could stand to make them a bit more complex.)  He flails around with symbolism and mysticism like a rookie writer in this book, but I am hoping that as he continues to write, he will wield that tool more deftly.	2003-09-19

It's such a fine balance between tragedy and comedy, it's easy to sway one way or the other, either laughing at them and not caring about them or caring about them too much to laugh at them.  <br />Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead is the same type of play, but much easier on the reader.  There are truly funny, funny scenes in this play, many of them, scenes worthy of Abbott &amp; Costello.  Perhaps as a result, it is easier to care about the characters, even as you're laughing at their haplessness, and to echo their philosophic cries into the darkness.  <br />So I think this play outdoes the play it copies.  I would rather watch it, or read it, anyway.  <br />A word about the Shakespeare -- sure, it adds to the play to know something about Hamlet, but it's probably not necessary. And I don't really think this &quot;logically follows&quot; after Hamlet, like some kind of sequel.  They are very, very different plays.  The jumping off point is simply that in Hamlet, &quot;R &amp; G&quot; die deaths that don't really make any sense -- and no one really cares.  Perfect philosopical place to start an absurdist play.	2003-08-28

Of the 43 stories, I read 30.  I was looking for something in particular in the stories and some I knew within a page or two were not it.  Still, 30 of 43.  That's enough to know what's here.<br /> What's here is a lot of really memorable stories - the kind that when you finish, tempt you just to turn back to their title page and read it again.  What's here is a large number of really top-notch talent - Raymond Carver, Mona Simpson, Joyce Carol Oates, John Irving - the people you talk about when you talk about modern literature.  It's encouraging to know they were published once upon a time in small presses.  Success wasn't handed to them on a platter.<br /> I get so tired of anthologies with agendas.  Throughout school, we read stories that were important, but few of them were very good.  These days, seems the agenda is to cover as many minority groups as possible - \\"alternative voices.\\"  That's fine, but again, that means we're essentially choosing stories based on something other than their inherent quality.  This anthology feels like it's just good stories - nothing's there for politic's sake, and nothing's holding is customary place because it's an \\"important\\" author or story.  It should be a lesson to the overly-PC that an anthology put together based solely on the merit of the stories happens to include many, many stories by women and minorities.<br />  Some of my favorites stories were Andre Dubus' \\"Fat Girl,  Charles Baxter's \\"Harmony of the World,\\"  David Jauss' \\"Glossolalia\\" (though I have no idea what that means),  Liza Weiland's \\"Columbus School for Girls,\\" \\"Edward P. Jones' \\"Marie,\\" Mona Simpson's \\"Lawns,\\" and Steven Millhauser's \\"Paradise Park.\\"  So many good stories, really, truly good, satisfying stories, it's hard to narrow it down to a few.<br /> Ones I wasn't so fond of: \\"Camo, Dope &amp; Videotape,\\"  \\"As Kingfishers Catch Fire,\\"  \\"Graveyard Day\\", and \\"Hiding\\".<br />And then there are the 13 I never didn't read.  Maybe later.'t read.  Maybe later.	2003-08-15

Terrible Destiny.  <br /> I would define tragedy as the destruction of potential -- something that could be so good or could do good or someone who could be so great falling, dying, being destroyed.  It's not just failure, it's failure on a grand and bohemoth scale.  It's a grand fall from spectacular heights.   In that case, I would call A Prayer for Owen Meaney a modern day tragedy.    <BR> Owen's life parallels the life of Christ -- not just in the immaculate conception (which seemed kind of hokey to me) or the sacrificial death, but in the way that from very young he is a leader, the center and mover of everything.  It says at one point that special light always shone on him.  He is the Voice -- the voice of the people.  He grows up struggling against the authority of the headmaster, and it is a struggle he wins by losing.   He is loved by everyone but even those to whom he is closest do not understand his calling, his destiny.   And I guess the end result is what would've happened to Christ's followers had there been no resurrection: severe scarring and bitterness, a wound they cannot overcome.  Hester turns her wound into \\"success\\" through angry music, John basically does nothing but let his pain eat him alive.<BR> My biggest complaint with the novel is about the personality of John.  Or, more accurately, the lack of it.   He is sidekick to the extreme -- a spectator to Owen's story, to the point where you have to wonder how this bland milktoast could be the best friend of someone as provocative and exciting as Owen Meaney.  Yet the author seems to go to great effort to make him a nothing, a nobody -- from the symbolic \\"Joseph\\" role in the nativity to complete sexual failure as a teenager to his suspected status as a \\"nonpracticing homosexual\\" as an adult. He says at the funeral \\"something inside me was missing, and that something was Owen.\\"    So this isn't just a weakness in the writing -- poor characterization -- it's intentional, a choice made by the author to make the narrator a nobody.  Why?  I don't know why.  It could be a quick fix -- write a 500 page book then have an editor or reader tell you that the narrator needs more personality, and it's much much easier to go back and insert here and there hints that he's not supposed to have any personality than it is to go back and do the massive rewrite that would be necessary to develop his character.   So is it Irving being lazy?  Or is it there some reason he's a nobody, some reason I just don't see?    <BR> I think the biggest challenge in taking on a novel like this -- or at least like the second half -- is the tension tha t has to be maintained to keep the reader reading.   You know what's going to happen, it's just a matter of how; it's just the mechanics of it. The author has to play the delay just right -- if it happens too fast, you lose the magnitude of the ending, you lose the tragic sense.   And if the author dawdles and hesitates too much, the reader loses patience and skips to the end.  I think that Irving plays this balance fairly well, but not perfectly -- there were points when I was tempted to skip to the end.  The novel may be about fifty pages too long.<BR> I was intrigued enough by the historical setting of the novel to research the Vietnam War on my own.  I borrowed a bazillion-hour-long documentary on Vietnam from the library and am working my way through it.  <BR> I don't know what to make of the religion here.  You certainly can't deny that it's there and a major theme through the novel, but it doesn't take on familiar forms.  Doubt and faith are the central issues.  Owen says \\"faith\\" a lot, and it seems mostly to mean believing that nothing happens by accident.   Not exactly a conventional understanding; not exactly \\"belief in things hoped for; being certain of what is unseen.\\"   The pastor says that \\"doubt is the essence of faith\\" which I don't agree with(I'm more comfortable with a variant a la Kathleen Norris: the opposite of faith is not doubt but fear.)  And while he is an admirable character through most of the novel, by the end he seems weak, destroyed by his doubt.  Narrator says something about this.   The narrator (Johnny) believes in God only after Owen's \\"prophecies\\" about himself comes true.  So the existence of God is proven because things happen for a reason, as Owen always believed.  It doesn't matter that the proving incident is tragic; this is refreshing as we don't get that old \\"I can't believe in a God who...\\" line that essentially sets us up as judges over God, the punishment we dole out being our own lack of belief.  As if existence has anything to do with belief, or conduct.  Instead, God exists and does what He wants for His own reasons.  The problem being that it doesn't seem to matter that God exists, no seeking after Him or letting his existence affect the way life is lived.  There is no following, there is only acknowledging. Unless you're chosen like Owen Meaney, God exists but is unknowable and basically has nothing to do with your or anyone's life.   Problematic; if God has nothing to do with life down here then why would he bother to choose and use Owen, or Jesus? (Owen says that Jesus was \\"used\\".) But that's an unanswerable question, at least on the terms of the book -- because God does things for his own reasons, which are unfathomable to us.   <BR> The politics are memorable and resound with me; that could be just my anti-Americanism resounding with the narrator's.  Two voices do not truth make.  Yet I do believe that Americans have little sense of history, which amounts to little corporate memory.   Also that we have a screwed up sense of morality, especially public morality, if we have any sense of that at all.  Things two -- history and morality -- could be and probably are connected.   I especially like what Owen says about Marilyn Monroe being like America and about televangelists being the future politicians.	2002-07-10

A full-on Bohemian in her twenties, she wrote for Socialist papers, joined strikes and picket lines, and spent her share of time in jail for protests.  She was an activist­s activist.  <BR> And then she met Jesus.  Actually the Call of the Spirit had been upon her, or inside her, since early childhood, but it wasn­t until the birth of her child that she finally acknowledged fully and became a member of the Catholic church.  <BR> I can easily identify with her problems and issues with the church -- it always seems to be on the side of the Established, the Rich and Powerful, caring not and giving not to the poor and needy, the oppressed and voiceless.   Dorothy found, as too few of us  have, that God heart cries out for the poor, Jesus identified himself with the oppressed and voiceless, and, as James said, true religion that God honors is looking after the widowed and the orphans in their distress.<BR>   And so, with the help, mentorship and inspiration of her friend Peter Maurin, Dorothy continued her activist ways, in the name of Christ.  She started the Catholic Worker newspaper, which championed the causes of the poor and working-class.  She and her friends started hospitality houses, taking in and feeding any who needed it.  <BR> Like Mother Teresa­s, Dorothy Day­s story is really very simple -- she saw what there was to do, she took her Master­s words to heart, and she started doing it.  Without advanced programs, grants, visioning sessions, without much of a plan at all really, she just started doing it.  And she has changed the world in important ways, giving glory to God all along the way.  She is a hero of the faith to me, and I hope that God will use me as He chose to use her.  <br />Dorothy Day trained herself as a journalist, a writer, and made her living as such all of her life.  This training is evident in her writing -- the book is compact, imagistic, and quick to read.  The first half is fairly chronological, as she relates her life up until the point of her conversion and move to New York.  After that -- basically after she meets Peter -- it becomes more topical, and the timeline more of a blur.  Which was probably true of her life, so much happening and unfolding that it­s hard to tell what started when and where the endings are, if there are any.  <br />I enjoyed this book, and I learned from it -- most notably that the work of activism, of giving voice to the voiceless, is long and hard, with many defeats.  But many defeats add up to slow victory, as we make progress over decades at a time.  Things are better than they were in Dorothy­s heyday, and we owe much of it to her and her contemporaries.  We also owe a great debt to her for the life she has modeled for us -- a modern day picture of Christ among the poor, the hope of many.	2002-05-31

I'd rather people give up caring about their own self interest altogether.  But if I'm truly concerned about human rights, and dedicated to working for change, perhaps it has to be any port in a storm.  If torture, rape, starvation and abuse are stemmed by the voice and demands of millions of people motivated by the wrong reasons, they are stemmed nonetheless.  Right?  <br />I think William F. Schulz would agree with me, and I venture a guess that such an argument convinced him to write this book.  It is a well-researched and clearly written exposition of the ways that it truly is in our own best interest to care about human rights.  He shows that political \\"realists\\" who believe that a country cannot afford to make human rights a priority when forming and implementing foreign policy are, despite their hard-nosed and pragmatic appearance, naive to believe that human rights don't matter.  <br />For instance.  Working democracies very, very rarely go to war with other working democracies.  Thus it is in the best interest of the US to promote democracy across the world, and thus make stable allies.  Of course, the definition of \\"working democracy\\" has to do with human rights -- democracy in itself is fundamentally based on a respect for each individual's voice and decision-making power, and where this is not respected (as in Milosevich's Yugoslavia) the stability does not exist.  <br />For instance.  As globalization races across the planet, political stability in a country is a vital element in a solid investment choice.  The 3 basic factors that enhance political stability -- lack of corruption in government, rule of law, and feedback loops (freedom of press, independent investigation, etc.) are all intimately tied to human rights issues.  Countries that abuse human rights are notoriously unstable.  And instability scares away investors.<br />For instance.  Crowded and unsanitary prison conditions are breeding grounds for disease.  And in a world that gets ever smaller due to the ease of intercontinental travel, a super-strain of tuberculosis developed in a prison cell in China can easily have reached the other end of the world -- that's us in America -- in no time at all.  <br />For instance.  Torture not only provides unreliable information, it hardens whole communities againt their oppressors.  To torture one terrorist may provide you with the names of five others, but likely motivates fifty others to become terrorists.  And in a world as interconnected as ours is, where they will strike out has become wildly unpredictable.  <br />And the instances continue.  Schulz makes an incredibly convincing argument that we can no longer \\"let well enough alone\\".  There are no isolated places, no isolated incidences in the world anymore, and it is indeed naive to think that such destructive forces as human rights abuses will have no effect on us.  James the brother of Jesus tells us that if we know what good we ought to do and do not do it, we sin.  And if that is not motivation enough, it is in our own best interest.	2002-05-11

Mother Teresa is such a dynamic and profound personality, indeed so much a reflection of her Savior, that just meeting her has inspired much reflection, conviction, and devotion in the mind and heart of Malcolm Muggeridge.   She is that rare persona who somehow ascends past celebrity status.  Celebrities, in the end, are entertainment.  Mother Teresa's presence and personality are much more than entertainment: with hardly a word she challenges and changes people.  The best parts of this book have more to do with Muggeridge's inner searching than with Teresa's life and work. <br />I'm sure that she would shy away from all this praise.  Yet truly she is a reflection of her Savior, which is her heart's desire.  This strange and unearthly power she has to affect lives with nothing more than her presence perhaps can help us understand how an illiterate carpenter from the backwaters of the world managed to split history in half and utterly turn the world upside down.  When you draw near to God, even just a reflection of Him, you cannot help but be changed.  <br />What I love most about Mother Teresa, what inspires and challenges me the most, is her ability, maybe even insistence, in seeing Christ in the poor and destitute that she cared for.  He said `whatsoever you do unto the least of these, you do unto me' and she takes it seriously -- and the result is beautiful beyond comparison.  It makes my heart leap.  <br />Thank you, Lord, for sending us a woman like your servant Teresa to remind us of your face, your call, and your love.  We are eternally grateful.	2002-05-11

Annie Proulx's voice lands somewhere between the savagely humorous stories of Flannery O'Connor and the sparse and romantic beauty of Raymond Carver -- which, I suppose, is geographically appropriate.  <BR>I am a resident of Wyoming.  I am not from here and I do not plan to stay here.  I have little love for the barren landscape or the tough people of this land -- I would rather be in a cafe in San Francisco or a coffee shop in Greenwich Village.  But I have seen enough of this place to validate the authenticity of Proulx's vision of this land, to a point anyway.  Like anyplace, there are more people who watch too much TV and eat too many Oreos than there are who lead these lives of clenched teeth and fists.  <br />For being about Wyoming, which they fully are, these stories cover a lot of ground.  From the Blood Bay, a wonderfully humorous rewrite of a familiar ranch legend, to a story about a bullrider to anti-beef radical activists to a tractor who makes love to an overweight and lonely girl to the crowning story about two tough cowboys and their unusual love for each other, Annie Proulx's imagination almost makes up for the lack of imagination of everyone else in this state.  <br />I will buy this book as a memoir of my year in this barren state.  I will recommend this book as an excellent collection of stories from a remarkable writer about a tough land.	2002-05-11

It is the plight of these orphans that inspired so much of Charles Dickens' writing during the same period.  Orphanages were of a vastly different nature than we are used to thinking.  Unless a child was an orphan of a rich or well-established family, there were few options for them.  Some orphanages accepted children according to recommendations; ie, if the child or some advocate could gather enough signatures affirming his character, behavior, etc., then they would accept this child.  If an orphaned child had the strength and presence of mind to collect such signatures.  But mostly, poor children had no option but homelessness and a rough street-life. <BR> Muller set about to do something about that: he resolved to open and run Christian orphanages that accepted children simply on the basis of need.  Indeed, he turned away any child who could be accepted at one of the more traditional orphanages.  <BR> In addition, Muller set out, through the direction of the orphanages, to prove the existence and good faithfulness of God in a way that I can only compare to Elijah on Mt Carmel.  He decided to rely solely and completely on God to provide the means and funds needed to run this orphanage.  He did no fundraising whatsoever; moreover, he would not even make his financial needs known even to those who inquired and wished to help.  He was steadfast in his determination to rely solely on God to supply His needs, and would not taint such a testimony to a doubtful world with any kind of profession of need or request for help -- not even from his own congregation in Bristol.  <BR> And God came through.  Again and again, God answered George Muller's prayers, and never once was the orphanage in need.  More than that, Muller was able to expand his efforts at anamazing rate: it wasn't long before four major houses were built for orphanages, housing, educating, feeding, and job-training as many as 10,000 orphans at a time.  In addition, there were scripture training schools, a publishing house sending out Bibles and scriptural tracts at a very high volume (for little or no money) and heavy financial support of missionaries in other countries.  All of this, all of it, without ever letting a single person know of the financial needs of all the work.  All told, nearly 1,500,000 pounds were received during George Muller's lifetime from the hands of God.  <BR> There were certainly trying days.  The book chronicles time and again, at times for months on end, when the orphanages ran on a shoestring budget, at times receiving the money needed to but lunch only at breakfast time.  Nonetheless, there was never a single incident when they did not have what they needed. <BR> Muller spent his latter days traveling the world, preaching in as diverse places as Israel, Russia and California(in the 1800's, still a remote corner of the earth.) Instead of boasting of the deeds he had accomplished, the expounded scripture, called on people to recognize the goodness and faithfulness of God, and to rely on Him to supply for them.  He insisted that his faith, which was so renowned and talked about, was no extraordinary thing; it was simply the result of years of experiencing God's ability and willingness to meet His needs.  <BR> I do not think that Muller had any kind of doctrinal belief that fundraising was a bad thing, and so it would be a twisting of his testimony to use it against missionaries and organizations that fundraise.  He simply desired to show that God is faithful and able to meet our needs -- and He did so.  It was intended, by this ordinary man, to strengthen the faith of people around the world.  I know that reading it has strengthened my faith, while both convicting me and giving me confidence to trust God with my needs.  George Muller is an example to me, and a hero of the faith.  I would encourage anyone to read more about his life and work -- and the work God did through him and for him.   <BR> That said, I must say a word about the shortcomings of this particular biography.  It is incredibly tedious at times in its attention to detail.  In the times of near-shortage in the orphanages, it does paint the picture well to see how sixpence came in at this hour and two pounds the next day, then three months of relative abundance, then a week in which only eight pence came in and then the day before money was needed to repair the furnace so-and-so wrote a letter including ten pounds.  To some extent this is indeed helpful.  But when George and wife are touring the country, I don't feel like I need to know about every train and every hotel and house and congregation they preached to.  The attention to detail, though it certainly honors Muller's spirit (who was gifted with incredible attention to detail, which doubtless helped him run the houses as he did) is very tedious to read.  Some sections are definitely best simply skimmed...	2002-04-15

Forster uses his characters and their relationships and a launching pad for more philosophical and sociological ruminations.  And not in a contrived way, but in the almost intuitive way our own interactions with the people we meet stimulate us, provoke us, and stretch us.  <BR>   And as far as I know, this book is one of a kind in that it treats people with no imagination with dignity and respect.  Most of us are aware there is some kind of division in the world between artists and businessmen, and the division has shown up often enough in literature sure enough.  But as all producers of fiction are by necessity on the artist side of the division, businessmen are usually the villains, evil at worst and stupid at best, and artists, are, quite naturally, the heroes.  Forster is uniquely wise enough to peer into the enemy camp and see beauty and value.  <BR> My feel is that Forster's characterization at times surpasses his writing ability.  This is more praise than criticism; his vivid imagination is able to conjure and follow characters that his pen finds difficult to put on the page. They move and live and act in ways he is unable to fully explain or account for. And when was the last time you were able to truly capture all the complexities, intricacies and contradictions of a real person with the rudimentary elements of pen paper and alphabet?  That Forster's characters defy characterization may be a contradiction, but in my book it is high praise.    <BR> And the way Forster often philosophizes might annoy others, but I do enjoy it.  There is a passage early in the book about Beethoven's Fifth Symphony that is thinly costumed to make it fit within the frames of the book, I love it for what it is -- a brilliant exposition on a distinct piece of music.  --...<br />Some quotes I enjoyed: <br />\\"It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand timesmore wonderful than one square mile, and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven.  That is not imagination.  No, it kills it.\\"  (23)<br />\\"What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?...Haven't we all to struggle against life's daily greyness, against pettiness, against mechanical cheerfulness, against suspicion?  I struggle by remembering my friends; others I have known by remembering some place--some beloved place or tree--we thought you were one of these.\\" (112)<br />\\"England was alive, throbbing through all her estuaries, crying for joy through the mouths of all her gulls, and the north wind, with contrary motion, blew stronger against her rising seas.  What did it mean?  For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast?  Does she belong to those who have molded her and made her feared by other lands, or to those who added nothing to her power, but have somehow seen her, seen the whole island at once, lying as a jewel in a silver sea, sailing as a ship of souls, with all the brave world's fleet accompanying her towards eternity?\\"  (138)<br />\\"The business man who assumes that this life is everything, and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing, fail, on this side and on that, to hit the truth.  \\"Yes, I see, dear; it's about halfway between,\\"  Aunt Juley hazarded in earlier years.  No; truth, being alive, was not halfway between anything.  It was only to be found by continuous excursion into either realm, and though proportion is the final secret, to espouse it at the outset is to insure sterility.\\"  (153)<br />\\"Love and Truth-- their warfare seems eternal.  Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it, and if they were one, life itself, like the spirits when Prospero was reconciled to his brother, might vanish into air, into thin air.\\"  (181)<br />\\"But man is an odd, sad creature as yet, intent on pilfering the earth, and heedless of the growths within himself.  He cannot be bored about psychology.  He leaves it to the specialist, which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a steam-engine.  He cannot be bothered to digest his own soul.\\"  (219)<br />\\"She could not assess her trespass by any moral code; it was everything or nothing.  Morality can tell us that murder is worse than stealing, and group most sins in an order all must approve, but it cannot group Helen.  The surer its pronouncements on this point, the surer may we be that morality is not speaking.  Christ was evasive when they questioned Him.  It is those that cannot connect who hasten to cast the first stone.\\" (246)	2002-04-02

Shakespeare, naturally, did a masterful job, crafting not only a comedy with plenty of belly laughs in it (literally), but also a play about women in power for the ultimate woman in power.<br />I saw this play performed recently and it brought home to me how much it really is about the character of Mrs. Hood.  She is written to be a sexually powerful, or powerfully sexual, character.  Powerful enough to justify her husband's jealousy despite her trustworthiness -- for if we are to receive him as one of the \\"good guys\\", we must be able to sympathize with him.  Powerful enough to justify Falstaff's return again and again.  He is a fool, but a lovable fool, so again we need to be able to sympathize.  <BR> This is not Britney Spears sexuality.  This is Mae West/Marilyn Monroe sexuality.  The kind where she could be doing the most vulgar thing -- eating a cheeseburger, for instance -- and the men around her are still aroused.  And she is in full control of it, even as it causes chaos in the men around her.  If an actress can bring this to the role, this play sings, it swings, it sparkles and flies.  If this is missing, if she is simply a normal woman, the counterpart of Mrs. Whatever, the jokes are strained, the pacing slow and the whole thing feels a bit washed up.	2002-03-23

In their voices is a superiority, a sense of  \\"I'm the only one who can see what's going on while the rest of you are duped.\\"  Rather a silly notion, since this is such a well-read book and so many other folks are saying the same thing.  Furthermore,  I am not yet convinced the world is going to hell; in fact, I'm not all that convinced it's any worse than it was a thousand years ago.  Naturally I'm crippled in this judgement by the fact that I wasn't around a thousand years ago.  Yet much of what Shakespeare wrote is hardly less vulgar, shocking, sensational than what's in the theaters today (especially in the context of his culture) and the same can be said of Greek literature (ever read Lysistrata?)<br />And so I find the accuracy of his future predictions entertaining, amusing, but not exactly haunting or frightening. It's fun when he's right, it's even more fun to join him and proclaim our society \\"hurtling towards\\" the predictions that have time yet to come true.  But the greatest effect the similarity between his Fordian future and our own society has is to help us relate to the universal, timeless issues that make this book interesting and almost a classic.  Stability versus passion (remember Achilles choice?)  Happiness vs knowledge (Adam and Eve...at least in literature), society vs individual, nobility vs indulgence.  It's a little heavy-handed as it deals with these things, it lacks subtlety and complexity and eloquence, but that's probably why so many of us have read it in high school english classes.

Tim Allen is witty; his books aren't classics.   The plot, too, is rather ho-hum.   What makes this work a classic is the interaction between subtle characters, and what makes it a great play also makes it difficult to relate to on the page.  <br />An explanation. In my opinion, the best stage plays often don't make very good reads.  They leave a lot of room for an actor or actresses' interpretation, and respect that a few words said(acted) properly on a stage are more effective than lots of words.  None of us talk like the characters in a novel, yet they must talk like that for us to understand them: all we have are their words.  <br />Thus I think it is with this play.  Especially in the final act, which seems to be the most important (and what raises this above the level of, say, the Princess Diaries)  I have a hard time following the movement of the characters and the dialogue.   Not a hard time making sense of it, not anything that straightforward, but a hard time following it intuitively, understanding the progression and movement of Eliza and Henry from one page to the next.  As a sometime-actor, this intrigues me.  As a reader, it leaves me unsatisfied, wanting to see it done: see how it flows and makes sense.   <br />The part that reads best is Eliza's father: he's a delightful embodiment of Nietzchian ethics and speeches more than he talks.  He's fun and pretty quotable.  <br />Just a note: I don't think this is exactly based upon the Greek legend of Pygmalion and Galatea.  It seems more likely to me that Shaw had the idea, wrote the play, looked for a title, and found it in mythology.   <br />I hope to see it performed someday.	2002-03-08

Rather counterintuitively, it begins with the latest book, Advice to a Prophet, and works its way backwards, so that if you read it front to back, you get a sort of anti-development of the young poet.<br />I would say that there are about fifteen good poems here, and two or three really great poems.  Wilbur works with form meter and rhyme, which seems exceedingly rare in more modern poets, and when he does it well, it is a thing of beauty.  &quot;Love Calls us to the Things of This World&quot; -- a poem about waking, angels, and laundry-- is wonderful, as is a naturalistic farewell letter to a dead friend, &quot;The Mill&quot;.  But too often he is clever with form -- too clever for his own good.  He can say a thing beautifully, but you still wonder if it was worth saying.<br />A personal theory: Regardless of style, form, content, agenda or tone, a poet's singular task to develop a unique and distinct voice.  Anyone worth listening to (poet, musician, philosopher, artist) has a distinct way of seeing the world, and the point of the art is to communicate that to the rest of us in some manner.  Enough theory; enough to say that what seems to be lacking most in this collection of Wilbur's poetry is this quality of voice.  I cannot tell you what type of poet Wilbur is, short of a formalist, and that's not the point.  The point is there is no point.  And that's the problem.<br />To come back down to earth.  This poetry is accessible (sometimes at the cost of being profound) and is a good study in form.  It is average with a leaning towards above-average -- the middle book &quot;Things of this World&quot;, won the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award, because it more often ascends above the average.  It's not bad poetry, but maybe there's a good reason these individual books have gone out of print and are unlikely to return.  Not entirely unforgettable.print and are unlikely to return.

I wanted a book that would give me an English Colonialist view of India.  It is a rather hard thing to find: few English Victorian writers of any consequence wrote about India.  It wasn't until later, ie, Orwell and Forster, that it became a popular topic, and they wrote with a vastly different attitude.  I just wanted to know what an Englishman thought of the \\"jewel in the English colonial crown\\".     What I found is exactly what I wanted: so exactly that it caught me off guard.  Kipling offers no politics, neither \\"problems of England in India\\" or \\"The White Man's Burden\\".  Kim is, quite simply, a vision of India.  Exuberant, complex, vibrant, full of energy and life and change.  This is Kipling's India.  It is a beautiful, mysterious, dangerous, amazing place.

But perhaps this isn't either.  Such was the claim of critic after critic.  But anyway.)  Yet in reality it is only a device -- an excuse for Kipling to take his boy on adventures and to immerse us more fully in the pungent waters of Indian culture -- or cultures.      As far as the English/Colonialism question goes, perhaps the real reason Kipling drew so much flak is because he deals his English critics the most cruel insult -- worse than calling them evil, or stupid, or wrong, he implies that they just don't matter that much.  Kipling's India is a diverse place, with a plethora of people groups in it, divided by caste, religion, ethnicity, whatever.  And the English, the \\"Sahibs\\"?  Another people group.  That's all.  They don't dominate or corrupt or really change anything in any profound way; they just sort of become part of the broiling swirl of cultures and peoples that is India.      --	2002-02-08

It is funny-- genuinely funny, without being naughty or &quot;sophisticated&quot; or cynical, without being overly goofy, without being sad at the same time, or profound, or stupid.  It is light without making you wish it was deeper or think maybe it is and you missed it somehow. <br />I was forced to read a fair number of comedies throughout English lit classes, and my clearest memory was that most jokes, though alive on stage, are dead on the page.  Even in Shakespeare, often.  Here, though, I really was laughing, enjoying the wordiness and wit.  Makes me really wish and hope to see it performed someday. <BR>  <BR>The word that comes to mind is pure.  Like if there really are Platonic forms, essences of things, this is the platonic form of comedy.  Or at least approaches it more closely than anything else I've ever read.  <br />It's simple.  It's short.  It's beautiful -- in that it is fully formed within itself, wanting nothing, leaving nothing.  It's a classic.	2002-02-04

It's not about good vs. evil -- not really.  It's a tale of social repression and liberty.  <br />Dr. Jekyll discovers a duality within himself -- he states that he is \\"inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen...\\"  but also that he has an \\"...impatient gaiety of disposition\\" that runs contrary to his desire to be esteemed and respected amongst his fellowmen.  <br />And so in truth it is not a dichotomy of Good and Evil -- not in a universal, philosophical sense of those words.  Rather it is a dichotomy of Respect and Passion.   The duality Jekyll finds within himself is of this nature: he truly loves the respect of those around him, but that necessarily means sacrificing \\"undignified\\" behavior.  On the other hand, he truly loves to be undignified, free and unfettered, but that means sacrificing the respect of those he esteems.  <br />Stop right there.  And so what leads him to what he later describes as \\"shameful acts\\" is not so much a desire to do evil, or even a love for vices, but a simple passionate nature.  This speaks of the Victorian set of virtues -- reserved, under control, calm, wise, respected, anything but passionate and impetuous -- more than a more true virtuous nature -- full of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness.  And so Jekyll is condemned by his society to see his more passionate nature as shameful.<br />Jekyll's endeavour is to disconnect these two halves of himself -- this, in itself, could be a worthy experiment, but the danger comes because it is one that his performed upon (and curiously connected to) his own psyche, and there is a grave conflict within his psyche.  In endeavoring to disconnect these two personalities, he is recognizing that neither one is morally superior to the other -- one is simply accepted by society while the other is rejected.  A passionate and undignified man is notby nature more sinful or wicked than a reserved and dignified man.  I would say he believes this on paper, but not in his heart.  Deep down, he is a product of his society, and believes, along with those he esteems, and dignity and reservation are virtues, while passion and recklessness are vices.  <br />Yet perhaps this book is a tale that conforms to, instead of reacts to, Victorian morality.  Edward Hyde turns out to be uncontrollably wicked, murderous, and evil.  Perhaps the point is  that there is no liberty, lack of dignity, \\"gaiety of disposition\\" without wickedness, and virtue lies in reservation and bridling the beast within.  That Jekyll unleashes a monster because he refuses to recognize it as a monster, believing what I wrote above -- that if one could disconnect the two halves, both could live their lives well.  <br />If that's the case, then the book is based on a lie, and one of the lies I hate the most -- that passion is ugly and deformed and should be killed before it can kill.   <br />I remember another story- one of a man who lived in the desert, dressed in camel's hair and ate locusts.  A man who was passionate about doing good -- he was called the best of all men.  And of others around him, pious reserved men who kept the law and were respected in everyone's eyes.  They were called white-washed tombs.<br />want to discuss? ...	2002-01-22

Like \\"The Little Prince\\", it speaks quietly and simply of things that are so true we tend to overlook or forget them.  Unlike the mentioned book, this one brings in harsher elements, such as poverty and abuse -- and shows how the simple wisdom of a child can overcome them.  MacDonald's imagination is wonderful, and some of the dreams and fairy tales in the book almost outshine the \\"real\\" story.  I love the children who dig for stars.  This is one I enjoyed because it is so different, so simple and beautiful, and one I look forward to sharing with my children, should I ever have any. <br />PS - My sister read an edited, abridged version of this book, one rewritten to make it easier for children, and it was awful.  It skipped whole chapters and left out some of the very best parts.  I think kids can handle this book, just the way it was written.

And that sense of upsidedownness is probaby in its finest form in Clowning in Rome  -- hence the title.  In his quiet yet confident voice, Nouwen speaks of profound paradoxes -- how solitude is the foundation of community, celibacy the key element of a good marriage (or any intimate relation), and silence the basis of conversing with God.  <BR>I am learning how to read Nouwen's books as well, and it is something like the prayer life he talks about.   I have been frustrating by the somewhat repetitive content of them in the past, but in some way, it is good and true that he sings the same tune repeatedly, with different variations.  Somewhat in the same way of the Gospels -- it is good that there are four, though the story is basically the same.  I am learning to quiet myself when I read Nouwen's books, not to read them quickly or intellectually or academically or even necessarily for content.  It is amazing to me how often the Spirit speaks to me while reading these books: sometimes directly related to the content, sometimes not related at all.   I am thankful for Nouwen's willingness to be a vessel for the Spirit through his writing, and for the environment these books help create within my spirit -- one in which I am especially attentive to the Spirit's whisperings.<br />I strongly wish that more people would read brother Nouwen's books, and hope that others find the same gold in them that I do.  I strongly, firmly believe that it is Christianity of this sort -- this quiet, irrelevant, powerless spirituality -- that has the power to profoundly affect the world: indeed, that it is this kind of Christianity that has changed the world in past centuries.  <BR> (...)	2001-12-12

It is easy to see why teachers love it so much: the symbolism and thematic sense are simple and easily accessible.  Like Of Mice and Men and To Kill a Mockingbird, it is an easy introduction into digging more out of a book than just a good story.  And, also like those books, the story is good enough to keep kids -- and adults-- reading.<br />So does it hold any appeal for an adult, used to digging around in Joyce or Faulkner?  Well, to be honest, To Kill a Mockingbird is still one of my favorite books, and sometimes it's nice when you don't have to try too hard.  In this book, an experienced eye can pretty much see what's going to happen from the very beginning, and then what is left is to sit back and enjoy the ride.  And it is a pretty good ride, a pretty ripping little bloody story.<br />I have some issues with the basic thematic material, wondering how and why (or even if) Golding really believes that grownups or law and society or really anything else really do tame the savage beast that is allowed reign on the island.  When the soldier shows up at the end, is it really over?  If I had the time, talent, and permission, it would be intriguing to write a sequel -- in which Jack and Ralph go the same boarding school and must deal with what happened on the island -- and, in the end, find that there is as much savagery living within the structures of civilization as there ever was on the island.<br />I actually listened to this book, on tape, rather than reading it.  I was fortunate enough to find a copy read by the author himself, with a short commentary by Mr. Golding at the end of every chapter.  Very fun, and recommended. (...)	2001-11-20

Mary Shelley added the supernatural, haunting yet human Frankenstein.  Bronte's Jane Eyre pulls elements from all of these works and ends up... something entirely, refreshingly different.<br />What's really great about this book is that it is so rich.  The plot moves and moves well, making it an enjoyable and propelling read.  While it is mostly romantic-love interest based, it is not as sappy or predictable as, say, Pride and Prejudice.  Jane's journey to marital bliss is a bit more pock-marked -- and even drawn into question -- than in most romantic comedies.  I enjoyed the fact that, indeed, she questions whether she even wants to marry or should marry -- and refuses to marry, not once but twice, because doing so would compromise who she is.<br />Which brings me to the real reason I like this book and consider it a cut above most.  Jane herself is so interesting.  She is a very complex character, and the author has clearly taken much time and energy to draw in fine detail the map of her psychosis. This book is re-readable because there is so much to contemplate and reflect on within this finely drawn character.  Is she afraid of happiness?  Tied to duty? Was it right, or misguided, to leave Mr. Rochester?  If it was right, were here intentions right?  Was it right to return to him? What changes that allows her to refuse St. John, and return to Rochester?<br />I think Ms. Bronte did us a great favor with this book.  She took familiar ground and tweaked it -- taking the romantic comedy formula, so mastered by Austen and Thackeray, in which the tension entirely surrounds marriage, the meeting and mating of two people, and the point of the novel is resolved when the marriage(s) occur.  Working within that framework, Bronte brings us a character novel -- in which the tension is only resolved once the character has found a way to be fully who she is, and thus happy and fulfilled.  Surely this work broke ground for some of my very favorite works, in which plot becomes a somewhat secondary consideration and the eccentricities of character, the stuff of humans, becomes the focus and point of the novel.

The first time I read this book, a few years ago, I loved it and I worshipped Ray Bradbury.

I consider this one of the top 3 Dystopian works, along with Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and Huxley's Brave New World. But I think this is the most philosophical - and the most grim - of the three.  All the ingredients are here -- we get the grim, joyless, totalitarian nation that is such a nightmare to the Western ideas of individuality and basic rights. Like in Fahrenheit, we get an obsessive control over language - though here it goes much farther, to the destruction of words. Like BNW, we get government controlled social structure and recreation time, even sexuality. Seems the main point of all of them is how shallow life can become if one obeys the authorities.  What's different here - and I hope I'm not giving too much away-is that the rebel doesn't win. That seriously disturbed me at first, but the more I think about it, the more I feel it makes this work stand above the others as a Dystopian picture and a call to fight Power in government and protect individualism and free thought. For if the rebel can beat the Man, then the Man's power is limited, and we need not worry too much about the Man - the rebel can always win, if he wants. But if Big Brother can become powerful enough that no rebel can survive, as is the case in 1984, then we must truly fear and fight the Man-now, before He has that kind of power.<br />In the end, I think I find this Dystopian work more well thought out, more complete, and scarier than Brave New World of Fahrenheit 451. Yet it still remains incredibly readable, and a disturbingly good time.	2001-06-30

I love Raymond Carver, but I would say don't read this one until you've read Cathedral and What We Talk About When We Talk about Love. Simply because this is his first collection, and it's a little rough. <br />There are good stories here, and definitely hints and flashes of what Carver will become. His talent for small-talk dialoge is apparent and the shining moments in this book come when couples get together and talk. But he has not perfected that bright, clean, no-nonsense tone that became his trademark. There is a feeling of a lot of borrowing tones, writing like other writers, and playing around. Which is all fine. But the stories here lack the vision and power of those in the later books. <br />So read those first. Then, when you're hooked like I am, come read these.	2001-06-30

I'm not a huge fan of any kind of self-help or how-to book anyway, and I'm just learning how to interact with books of this type.  My first reaction to Becky and her evangelism advice is to cry out \\"It's not that easy!  It's NEVER that easy!  I wish it was that easy!\\"  Becky sits down on a bus and asks a little question and KABLAM someone's pouring their heart out and becoming a Christian.  <br />But on second consideration, I realize that this is probably just the way the how-to genre works - whether it's teaching evangelism or cooking a souffle on \\"frugal gourmet\\",  they always seem to make it look easier than it is.  Maybe that's so us naive ones at home will be encouraged and at least give hard things (like sharing our faith with others) a shot.  Or maybe it's because if you're going to write a book about something, that means you're really good at it, and if you're really good at it, that probably means it comes easy to you.  So it is that easy for Becky and Bob Vila and the Frugal Gourmet (whatever his name is).  And for the rest of us, well, we gotta try and fail and scrape through and learn what we can from them.   I can't cook a souffle for the life of me, but my omelettes aren't too bad.   <br />I've been cooking on evangelism for a while.  Coincidentally, I currently lead an evangelism team for InterVarsity on a campus where Becky used to work-WAY before my time.   Becky's got all the basic stuff here in this book, presented well, accessible, all that.  Probably the strength of this book is that all of it is here.  She emphasizes building authentic relationships with people instead of \\"project-building\\".   She hits the importance of learning to ask good questions and be an active listener.  She also points out the importance and usefulness of having a basic knowledge of apologetics, and an ability to converse about the more philosophical side of the faith, engaging tough questions people have.   And she confesses that the Holy Spirit does all the real work, not solid debate or amazing listening skills.  This is a good, full, big picture of evangelism.  <br />Her stories are incredible, almost unbelievable, though I trust her not to embellish.  Miracles tend to be rather unbelievable, don't they?   <br />All said, I'd rather read Henri Nouwen, Kathleen Norris, or Augustine, because I love the sense of mystery and profundity there.  But Becky is helpfully practical, beautifully basic, and solid.  Definitely solid.  So far, it's the best \\"how-to evangelize\\" book I've read.  But I'm holding out hope there's a shining one out there I just haven't found yet.  Like looking for gold, when you find silver you don't treat it like trash.  But you keep looking.	2001-05-10

I think I might have found a new favorite writer.  Annie Dillard, I still love you, but Kathleen Norris' little pieces are just as imagistic, inspiring, and profound, as serious and intent about exploring God with a poet's sensibility and a writer's eyes, yet she unsettles and disturbs me less.  Here I find a voice not only expressing, but helping me to work out my own faith.<br />In \\"Amazing Grace\\", Norris seeks to wrestle with and around tough, often scary words within the religios lexicon.  Her efforts are not to define per se, not in any linear way, but to own and understand the faith and tradition that these words belong to; where they come from, where they're going.  In the process, she lays down some of the basics of her own faith and belief - in a sense this book is something of one poet's religious manifesto.<br />This appeals to me so much more than a theology text, though it does basically the same thing!  By simply being willing to wrestle with the words, to acknowledge their scariness, abuse, mystery, usefulness, by searching out the concepts behind the words (every word has a meaning, but also a reason) this is a beautiful exploration of faith and God.	2001-04-13

Mr. Coleman's study of the strategy of Jesus in building up disciples is solid, and feels like the missing piece in the foundation of the modern church.  I truly wish more people would consider this plan for discipleship, as demonstrated by Jesus and exposited by Coleman.  <br />But I hesitate to lend this book to anyone, as much as I want to spread the good ideas, because the writing is absolutely horrendous.  At times his style feels like doctoral dissertation, at times just paranoid and defensive.   His language is sexist (\\"Men were his method\\"), combative (Jesus' plan for \\"the conquest of the world\\") and sometimes downright forbidding.  I know many people who have gotten so caught up in the language, the valuable teaching gets entirely lost.  <br />So.  Read it for the ideas, and ignore the language, if you can.  I don't think any of Coleman's offensive habits are ideological problems, just careless and sloppy writing.  It's one thing to have a good idea; it's another to put it on paper in a way that will reach a million people of varied demographics.  The first is here; the second isn't.

The town is in danger of extinction from the evil mines, yet this is a side issue.  Her sister is in danger, living with revolutionaries in Nicaragua, but this is not the focus of the work.   The focus is upon the growth and healing of the central character Codi, as these things go on around her.  She learns to let down her defenses, believe in herself and the power of people around her, and step out of the protective shell she has built for herself into a world of laughter and tears.  <br />Kingsolver definitely has a talent for this kind of subtle writing.  Codi feels very real, and it amazes me that through all of these clearly transforming events, she does not bow down to the ever-tempting Moment of Epiphany.  Codi has no epiphanies; she simply slowly moves forward toward healing and growth.  To me, this feels more true to life, and yet incredibly hard to write.  I appreciate the smoothness and honesty of this character development.  <br />So the strength of this book is also its weakness - it's pretty forgettable, as most lives and learning are, honestly, pretty forgettable.

Hurt people hurt people.  Shylock seems evil - \\"the devil incarnate\\", one of the characters calls him, yet one of the most powerful moments in the play is his \\"Hath a Jew not eyes?\\" speech.  He is badly, deeply wounded.  All of the hate and bitterness and desire for death that he carries is a result of the way he has been slandered, abused, and injured by the people around him.  Much of this abuse goes on during the play, though little of it by Antonio.  Antonio clearly despises Shylock's way of making money - usury - and it's possible that his harsh words have nothing to do with Shylock's religion, only with his profession.  (though historians say it is nearly impossible to separate the two - Jews were usurers and usurers were Jews.  There wasn't much else the government allowed them to do.)<br />A forgivness/mercy reading places at the center of the play both Shylock's speech, and Portia's beautiful speech on the quality of mercy at the trial.  The decisions by the Duke and Antonio to have mercy upon Shylock when the tables turn.  Perhaps, as some critics have said, Antonio's condition that Shylock become a Christian is not an attempt to rob him of his identity, but to make him like the rest of them, and thus welcome him in.  Doubtful that it works - it's hard to see Shylock leave, nearly ill at the end, and know that there is really no justice for him.  His wounds are real.<br />The romantic comedy element of the play really isn't that great --  especially the ring manipulation at the end.  Not only is it tiresome, it's absolutely clunky to have Graziano and Nerissa mirroring their masters.<br />There are some interesting things swirling around the chests.  When the right chest turns out to be \\"Who chooseth me must give and hazard a much all he hath,\\"  this seems to reinforce the theme of mercy and forgiveness taking place in the foreground.

Kadare masterfully tells this from Gjorg's viewpoint in a dark, terse but poetic style that feels as desperate as his character.   Then the irony kicks in, as he introduces a writer and his new wife, who are from the city, who is fascinated with Northern Albanian culture.  Bessian is wrapped up in the terrible romance of the blood feud, and a conscious reader must identify him/herself in this curious character, wanting to watch, both fascinated and horrified, as people destroy each other for the sake of tradition.     And the to turn the screw one notch further, we briefly meet the Blood Mark, the government officer responsible for tracking the blood killings and receiving the blood tax.  A look inside his almost-normal mind is eerily frightening, as death becomes life and life becomes death.     I'm afraid I'm too un-Albanian in thought-patterns, however, to grasp the climactic motion of the novel.  I don't want to give away the end of the novel, but I must say it seems to build and build towards a particular event... and then just narrowly miss that event.  It is difficult to identify the climax of the novel, and difficult to be satisfied with the progression.  Maybe this is simply because my mind is quite Western, and my sense of things is different.  But I'm not totally unexperienced at reading non-Western works... <br />Anyway.  A wonderful, if dark and intense, novel.  An education, as well.	2001-02-25

This book is a transcription of a speech Father Henri gave on Christian Leadership in the 21st century several years ago.   He encourages leaders to flee from desire for relevance into contemplative prayer; to flee from personal heroics into confession and forgiveness; and to flee from possible power into the mind of Christ.  <br />While it is a solid pamphlet that many will benefit from reading, it lacks the profundity and depth of some of Nouwen's other books, most likely simply because it was written as a speech, not a book.  <br />Father Nouwen is still my favorite Christian writer, and I envy those who were able to hear this talk, but I like some of his other books better.<br />discuss?  williekrischke@hotmail.com.	2001-02-23

Reading Capon's little book is like riding a merry-go-round for a little too long.  I had fun, I think it was a good thing, but my head's spinning and I feel weird down in the plumbing.  Woah.  <br />He's a crazy man writing crazy things and whirling metaphors around like colorful ribbons.  And he just might be right, and true, and more &quot;enlightening&quot; then all those dudes at Dallas Theological Seminary who probably either hate or fear him or both.  <br />There's a lot of things I will remember and hang on to from this book.  One is the understanding that God didn't create long ago (at least not exlusively) but IS creating, moment by moment.  I exist right now, as do you and the duck behind you, because God wills it.  There is no other why for our existence.  Don't understand?  Read the book.  <br />And the very act of creation is more akin to making love than to anything else.  Can you dig it?<br />And the other rememberable (is that a word?  if it is, maybe is shouldn't be)  thing is the snowstorm analogy -- which basically captures the thesis (if there is one) of the book.  Stuck in a snowstorm, God is not the kind of God who comes and rescues us.  He is the kind of God who comes and makes out with us and the snowstorm, as we die together.  Then he raises us.  Maybe.  <br />I have a friend who calls him &quot;Father&quot; Capon, but I can't go that far.  Mostly because he plays fast and loose with scripture, both using it for um, weird things and deciding on his own which parts are from God and which parts are the writer's indigestion or prejudices.  (that irks me.  Capon knows the voice and character of God better than Paul of Tarsus?  please.)   But I'll definitely read him and discuss his ideas and, when fitting, happily adopt them into my own conception of the Big Guy.  <br />It was memorable.  I'll read it again.  Not Nouwen (Father Nouwen?  I'm way more comfortable with that) but way, way better than most of what you find in Christian supply.   ---talk to me.  williekrischke@hotmail.com	2001-02-16

This strange communication, influence perhaps, we have upon the sovereign, almighty King of the Universe.  Intrigued, I decide to try and learn as much about it as I can.  I'm reading lots of things -- Andrew Murray, Henri Nouwen, as well as more moderns, like Dutch Sheets and whoever wrote &quot;too busy not to pray&quot;.  <br />Hunter's point in writing this book is a little different than what I was looking for.  I'm trying to understand this profound mystery of prayer; he's setting out to show how prayer is a piece of a harmonized spiritual life.  The book reads mostly like a handbook on Christian living - with chapters devoted to the holiness of God, the sovereignty of God, forgiving each other, obeying God, even church discipline.  He has a good point -- that no part of the christian life is disconnected, and all of these will affect one's prayer life, ability to hear God, and God's answers to prayer.  <br />I believe that he is a seminary professor or pastor of a large and largely successful church, and he writes like one.  Everything's very pragmatic and classroomish; there's no mystery or wonder involved.  And he writes like a speaker (note to speakers: writing out your speeches is not the same as writing a book.)  funny or interesting story, weak and obvious tie to relevant material, then fully jump into the teaching points and forget the corny story altogether. <br />So basically, I got pretty bored with it.  It's not bad, he has good points, he's not wrong, some people would probably benefit from reading it, maybe I did even, but it did not capture me, or change me.  Ultimately, a forgettable book.  Like so many others.  <br />Does this feel harsh to you?  Can you believe a christian would say this about another christian's work?  do you agree with me and can't believe someone else would write that way?  do you want to meet this strange guy?  are you bored?  e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.  i'd love to chat.	2001-02-16

I found it powerful and provocative: as it focused mostly upon Ben's mother and how she dealt with her strange son, it delved deep into questions of love and duty, otherness, and societal bonds.  Ben, the savage child, was a catalyst, a mirror held up to our own modern selves, in which we see the savage ways we treat what we fear and do not understand.  <br />Sadly, Ben in the World is a great disappointment to me.  Lessing decides here to follow Ben and see who he is, what he wants, and how he hurts.  I think this is a mistake; what made the Fifth Child work was Ben as a mirror, a reflection of society.  Here, that is so deeply diminished it's hardly worth mentioning.  And it's hard to come to any kind of powerful discovery of who Ben is -- a yeti, a throwback, whatever, ultimately another lonely person in a lonely world.  <br />The premise is flawed, the plot is weak and wandering -- there's no real reason why anything happens to Ben -- and in the end, it degrades to a hardly believable B-movie plotline (reminded me of that movie with Matthew Broderick and the monkey.  Project X?) <br />Seems like I've heard a lot of people saying Ben is a parallel to Frankenstein.  Hardly, unless you mean the monosyllabic Frankenstein of the movies.  Shelley's monster was articulate, passionate, opinionated, and driven.  He showed us ourselves at our worst.  Ben is simply primal.  At best, he shows us ourselves at our simplest.   <br />It took some discipline to finish this book.  I won't pick it up again, and I don't recommend it.	2001-01-28

Covenant's reluctance gets a little old, especially since it takes energy to relate to it.  But Donaldson seems to know this, and adds another character from &quot;our&quot; world, Hile Troy, who will lead the Land's armies into battle.  He is much easier to like and to cheer for.<br />Wise move or copout?  You have to decide.  Maybe both.  It's hard to sustain a story around a character who'd rather not be in the story.  Covenant is still there, but a secondary plot this time, fairly similar to the one in Lord Foul's Bane, with a romantic twist.  <br />Here's a curveball.  I started reading Covenant's plight as an allegory for Christianity and the Kingdom of God.  His rigid self-protection makes good sense in the &quot;real&quot; world -- Donaldson gives us a few chapters of real world to remind us of that.  But in the Land (or the Kingdom,) where love and trust are freely given and received, it is foreign, harsh, and painful.  It keeps Covenant from enjoying the gifts around him, and it renders him powerless, even when his power is desperately needed.  I have heard it said that &quot;hurt people hurt people&quot;, and Covenant is the poster boy of that proverb.  <br />well, a decent escape fantasy anyway.  i'll read the next one on a bus ride sometime.  <br />if you'd like to discuss this review, recommend a book, or just chat, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.	2001-01-22

His style, though often copied or imitated, is that of a master -- never duplicated.  I almost believe he could write about the most mundane of things and it would be prose more worth reading than a good 75% of the books published.<br />Here is a story about love and war.  Old subjects, and thank God the writer knows that, and treats them as such.  Back the the prose thing again.<br />To dig just a bit deeper, Hemingway gives us a harsh and ugly world full of beautiful people.  The war is senseless and awful, to be escaped, it seems the entire nature of the universe is to break and kill beautiful things.  But inside of that, there are good people.  Everywhere our hero goes, he finds decent, honest, giving, selfless people worth knowing, maybe even worth dying for.  Maybe this is called existentialism.  Personally, I disagree -- I see a beautiful, inherently good world full of selfish and broken people -- but Hemingway's worldview is, to say the least, poetic.<br />There are a lot of different reasons to read books.  One legit one is to escape -- but few, if any, would read, say, Dostoyevsky to escape.  I usually read fantasy or sci-fi to escape.  But I found this book, mostly because of Hemingway's enchanting prose (I just can't shut up about it) as an incredible mechanism to escape.<br />A sample of that amazing prose:<br />&quot;I could remember Catherine but I knew I would get crazy if I thought about her when I was not sure yet I would see her, so I would not think about her, only about her a little, only about her with the car going slowly and clickingly, and some light through the canvas and my lying with Catherine on the floor of the car.  Hard as the floor of the car to lie not thinking only feeling, having been away too long, the clothes wet and the floor moving only a little each time and lonesome inside and alone with wet clothing and hard floor for a wife.&quot	2001-01-08

(Doesn't it strike you as AWFULLY STRANGE that we can TALK to the God of the universe?

Maybe that's because I've seen most of the prose in other books in slightly different forms.  So Much Water So Close to Home is one of my favorite Carver stories, but I like it better in What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.  <br />Anyway, the poetry shines here, which is good because they take up the majority of the book.  The essays are nice as well, showing a slightly different side of the author.  They may be more valuable to a Carver enthusiast like myself than to someone picking him up for the first time.  The stories are okay, but I'd rather read &quot;Cathedral&quot; or &quot;What we Talk About&quot; for the stories.  There is something precious about a final edition, the edition the author decided he wanted you to see when he wrote the piece.  Most of these stories are earlier editions.  <br />So.  A good book for a Carver enthusiast.  It has turned me on to his poetry, and I'll have to check more of it out now.  Not the first Carver book you should read, though. That would be Cathedral, I think.	2000-12-19

As a religious writer, he lands somewhere between the religion department and the pulpit.  he takes a lot of freedom in attempting to determine what Jesus really was talking about and why, and i keep expecting him to slip into the academish/nonsense talk of religion professors (in my experience) and yet he always works his way out of that.<br />his perpective is fresh, well thought-out, and deeply rooted in the original language of the biblical text, as well, as much scholarship.  i have no doubt that he knows the bible well.  <br />Capon starts to write about the &quot;left-handedness&quot; of God's use of power -- backdoorish, subtle and tricky, doing things like dying to show his power, instead of direct authoritative, thunderboltish use.  and i would like to read and know more about this, but he gets away from it, in order to talk about the first set of parables - parables of the kingdom.  <br />his thesis about the nature of the kingdom revolves around its catholicity, mystery, actuality, and hostility.  i follow this far, and some of his arguements to back up this thesis are good.  <br />at times, though, i stare in disbelief at his tinkerings.  like when he takes the treasure hidden in the field, adds a barn or two to the field, calls it a farm, then says that &quot;buying the farm&quot; is an adage for death, so the parable really is about death.   yikes!   <br />all in all, more good than bad here.  he is refreshing, challenging, and i've come to recognize that when an author makes me uncomfortable, that's a good thing.  this book is not as profound as I want it to be, but has offered some nice twists on old interpretations of the parables.  <br />a passage: <br />&quot;Oh dear.  I hear two objections.  Let me interrupt myself to deal with them.  The first is:  &quot;But hold on.  Doesn't Scripture say that there will be some (or even many) who will reject the reconciliation?&quot;  Of course it does.  But the very hell ofhell lies precisely in the fact that its inhabitants will be insisting on a perpetual rejection of an equally perpetual gift.  It will be an eternal struggle to escape from the grip of a love that will never let them go.  And for that everlasting stand-off, I think, there is not a word in Scripture that is too strong: not the &quot;fire that is not quenched,&quot;  not the &quot;worm that dieth not,&quot;  not the &quot;outer darkness,&quot;  not the &quot;bottomless pit.&quot;  not the &quot;weeping and gnashing of teeth&quot; -- and certainly not the utterly fruitless &quot;second death&quot;.  <br />if you'd like to discuss this book with me, or anything else really, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.	2000-12-19

What a simple message, deeply explored and wonderfully exposited.  <br />Henri Nouwen is a master of reflection, study, self-knowledge, and of writing beautiful, profound books.  This book is amazing, perhaps life-changing.  It has spoken to me in profound and deep ways, and I am deeply thankful for it.  <br />Nouwen's main message, I think, is the unconditional, unfailing, all-surpassing love of the Father, this love that meets all needs easily.  He puts himself in the place of the younger son, the older son, and the father, and considers this love - and the things that keep us from fully experiencing it - in all of these places, places that ring universal. <br />The media of realization here is the parable of course, but also Rembrandt's painting, Return of the Prodigal Son.  It is profoundly helpful, fun, and provoking to consider this representation of the story and let it work spiritually in us, as it has in Father Henri.  This book has more than opened my heart to the love of my Father, it has given me a new love for art, and a side education on Rembrandt and one of his most famous paintings.  <br />In short, this is another truly rare, truly wonderful book from a modern mystic.  Nouwen will be remembered, I hope, alongside Augustine, Lewis, and others I have yet to discover but now believe exist.  <br />A sample:<br />&quot;Home is the center of my being where I can hear the voice that says: &quot;You are my Beloved, on you my favor rests&quot;-the same voice that gave life to the first Adam and spoke to Jesus, the second Adam; the same voice that speaks to all children of God and sets them free to live in the midst of a dark world while remaining in the light.  I have heard that voice.  It has spoken to me in the past and continues to speak to me now.  It is the never-interrupted voice of love speaking from eternity and giving life and love whenever it is heard.  When I hear that voice, I know that I am home with God and have nothing to fear.  As the Beloved of my heavenly Father, &quot;I can walk in the valley of darkness: no evil would I fear.&quot;  As the Beloved, I can confront, console, admonish, and encourage without fear of rejection or need for affirmation.  As the Beloved, I can be tortured and killed without ever having to doubt that the love that is given to me is stronger than death.  As the Beloved, I am free to live and give life, free also to die while giving life.&quot;<br />If you'd like to discuss this book with me, or recommend others, or just chat, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.

The first thing I think I should say is that I don't think I fully understand this book.<br />The second thing I think I should say is that I like it anyway. <br />Way back at Tinker Creek, Annie Dillard decided to open her eyes and see what she could see.  Pilgrim is a vibrant and enthusiastic book, Annie reacting exuberantly to the things she sees, even the puzzling and disturbing ones.  <br />Nowadays, she's been &quot;seeing&quot; awhile, and I don't think she really likes what she sees.  In Teaching a Stone to Talk, there's a deep feeling of unsettledness, of discomfort.  Annie sees a world that is silent, beautiful and ugly at the same time, a world that is complex and unyielding to any attempts to make it make sense without closing your eyes.   <br />There's brilliance here I think...of an unsettling sort.  Some of her revelations float right over my head.  But often she connects, and beautifully.  &quot;An Expedition to the Pole&quot;  brilliantly and powerfully compares the titled subject to religion and the search for God.  &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; and &quot;God in the Doorway&quot; are other favorites, along with &quot;Living Like Weasels&quot; - probably one of her best essays ever, and the only one in this book that actually feels like Pilgrim.   <br />Read an excerpt. there's a link under &quot;book info.&quot;  See if you like it.

I think Lewis does it better because it's clearer (and more profound?) what he's doing with it.  L'Engle's moral/universal battle is a bit vague, at least at this point in the series -- something to do with individuality, love, and sacrifice.  The 3 ladies quote scripture occasionally -- how does it all fit?<br />The story itself moves along nicely, though seems awfully quick at the end -- Meg saves her brother with what feels like should be the deepest revelation of the book, then is whisked home and happy, all in just a few pages.

Here, Ms Norris, a hesitant believer, makes the convent seem appealing, beautiful and full of wisdom.  <br />Once you get past the gimmick - a modern poet finding centering in a monastery - there is still much to like about this book.  It is a combination of a lot of things - a painfully personal journal, a catalog of discoveries and musings, a polished essay on laundry that was published in the New Yorker, and several brilliant pieces that stand as academic writing, ready for a feminist publication or academic journal.  <br />I think the latter were my favorite.  It is informative and enjoyable to find Ms. Norris taking on the virgin martyrs, looking at catholic history and practice with a modern feminist eye, and finding much to like, and much to weep over.  Another similar essay comparing the role of biblical prophets and modern day poets (both dwellers on the \\"margin\\" of society, yet deeply necessary to that society) is also excellent.<br />Norris' respect for the Word is wonderful, as well.  She writes much and often about the poetry of the Bible - psalms, Jeremiah - and how they fit and fill her life.  She brings new life to what, for many of us, have been wrongly dead words.  <br />Her reflections on the monastery are good.  She gives monks and nuns an earthy reality, talking about their quirks, their sense of humor, their doubts and struggles as well as their achievements, discipline, and success.  She spends a fair amount of time digging into the heritage and history of monasticism and christianity - apparently she is reading Christian classics as she is living at the monastery - and I learned much about ancient monks, martyrs, and saints.  <br />There is much wisdom in this book, and I appreciate Kathleen Norris' awareness and poet's sensibility.  It reveals a richness in the Christian tradition that I gladly and happily claim as a follower of Jesus.  It'snot all WWJD bracelets and \\"Left Behind\\" novels.  <br />A passage: <br />\\"Not long ago I accompanied a Trappist abbot as he unlocked a door to the cloister and led me down a long corridor into a stone-walled room, the chapter house of the monastery, where some twenty monks were waiting for me to give a reading.  Poetry does lead a person into some strange places.  This wonderfully silent, hidden-away place was not as alien to me as it might have been, however as I'd been living on the grounds of a Benedictine monastery for most of the last three years.  Trappists are more silent than the Benedictines, far less likely to have works that draws them into the world outside the monastery.  But the cumulative effect of the Liturgy of the Hours - at a bare minimum, morning, noon, and evening prayer, as well as the Eucharist - on one's psyche, the sense it gives a person of being immersed in the language of scripture, is much the same in any monastery.  What has surprised me, in my time among monastic people, is how much their liturgy feeds my poetry; and also how much correspondence I've found between monastic practice and the discipline of writing.\\"<br />if you'd like to discuss this book, this review, or anything else with me, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.  i'd love to chat. :)	2000-11-12

I recently read that, despite Carver's protestations, many of the stories here were cut mercilessly.  Some of this shows through later in his fiction -- &quot;The Bath&quot; is clearly a cut-back edition of &quot;A Small, Good Thing&quot;, published in Cathedral, and a longer version of &quot;So Much Water So Close to Home&quot; can be found in &quot;Where I'm Coming From.&quot;<br />Enough.  You want to know about this book, not mumbo-jumbo about Carver and his other books.  Carver is in fine form here, and his ability to portray pain, suffering, desperation, humor and hysteria in just a few pages is powerful.  <br />Carver writes the blue collar, alcoholic, separated or divorced character so much and so well you begin to assume these things about this characters, his stories.  Here is the working man's writer, and the writer's working man.  <br />My favorites in this book are &quot;Why Don't You Dance?&quot;, &quot;Gazebo&quot;, &quot;Everything Stuck to Him&quot;, and, of course, the title piece.   <br />His writing is so well-executed it changes my patterns of thinking -- I wander with a Carver-esque grimness, loneliness.  He doesn't just write about love and desperation, he writes them directly -- a distinction I can't really explain.   <br />All that to say here is wonderful writing.  <br />An example: <br />&quot;My friend Mel McGinnis was talking.

Her clenched fists are our clenched hearts, holding tightly to things worthless and unwilling to let the loving touch of the father heal us.  <br />Through the rest of the book Nouwen explores how choosing to live with open hands -- to unclench and let God in to our deepest and most intimate places -- affects our lives.  Open hands lead us to self-discovery, acceptance, hope, compassion, and revolution.  <br />The way to unclench one's hands is in prayer, and so this is a book about prayer.  But it is about prayer as a lifestyle of openness -- living with open hands.  <br />The format of the book is a little strange: &quot;chapters&quot; are written in 1-4 paragraph chunks, as in a devotional, or reflection.  But they clearly follow upon one another, and could be written together.  I'm not particularly fond of the format the book is written in; It's not exactly a series of reflections.  <br />a passage: <br />&quot;And yet you are Christian only so long as you look forward to a new world, so long as you constantly pose critical questions to the society you live in, so long as you emphasize the need of conversion both for yourself and for the world, so long as you in no way let yourself become established in a situation of seeming calm, so long as you stay unsatisfied with the status quo and keep saying that a new world is yet to come.  You are Christian only when you believe that you have a role to play in the realization of this new kingdom, and when you urge everyone you meet with a holy unrest to make haste so that the promise might soon be fulfilled.  So long as you live as a Christian, you keep looking for a new order, anew structure, a new life.&quot; --<br />If you'd like to discuss this book with me, or give me your thoughts on prayer (I'm interested!)

In about half the poems in this book, he joyously celebrates the frivolous -- fleeting beauty, the unnecessary (but is it really?) the joy of delicacy and frailty.  His style fits his subject well -- at times it feels light enough to simply float off the page, wisp away into nothingness.  This book is beautifully lyrical, sweet and light poetry.  Favorites are &quot;White Kimono&quot;, &quot;Lilies in New York&quot;, and, especially,  &quot;Messiah(Christmas Portions&quot;.<br />With that in mind, I think my favorite poems in the book come towards the end, when he settles down a bit.  Maybe this is just more my style and sensibility.  Either way, Doty shows hints of a great range and ability.  <br />His form stays pretty constant -- short lines, grouped in threes, building 2-3 page poems that have both of the sense of being long and of flying by.  <br />Here is a poet who loves language, and flaunts it -- and I mean that in the best way imaginable.  While his work may not be incredibly important, thank God that not all good poetry has to be incredibly important.  Here are poems of joyride and dance.  Enjoy. <br />A sample poem: <br />CONCERNING SOME RECENT CRITICISM OF HIS WORK <br />--Glaze and shimmer, <br />luster and gleam,<br />can't he think of anything<br />but all that sheen?<br />--No such thing, <br />the queen said,<br />as too many sequins.<br />--<br />if you'd like to discuss these poems, or poetry, books, anything else with me, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.	2000-10-31

Though I am so far away from the Russian culture and time of this play, the themes of place, tradition, and inevitable change resonated inside of me, and I am grateful to Chekhov for the way he has handled them.  <br />The Cherry Orchard is a play about change, and the symbolism is pretty easy to recognize.  What makes it stand apart, I think, from a thousand other plays on the same theme is its wonderful sense of comedy, of smiling sadness.  Chekhov all his life insisted it was a comedy.  As the Cherry Orchard slips away from the Ranevskys, they seem to smile at its going.  As they are unable to change their habits -- still lending money they don't have, still spending extravagantly -- they quietly laugh at their own foolishness.  The change comes, and they leave, heartbroken -- but embracing the change at the same time, only feebling struggling against it.  One feels saddest, in the end, for Lopakhin, the new owner of the Cherry Orchard. He seems to believe he has bought happiness and friends, but is quickly discovering the emptiness of money and possessions, as no one wants to borrow from him, and no one seems to pay him much heed at all.  <br />Chekhov paints with a fine brush, and I appreciate that.  There is no thunderstorming, no ranting and raving in this work.  There is a fine and subtle, sad and comedic portrayal of a family and a place encountering change.  It is a heartbreak with a smile.  <br />The translation, though the only one I've read, seems good.  It is easy to follow and rich in simple feeling.  <br />if you'd like to discuss this play with me, or recommend something i might enjoy, or just chat, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.	2000-10-31

This book is one of those that gives me fits when I ask for it in a bookstore.  The cashier says, &quot;what section would it be in?&quot; and I answer &quot;well, nonfiction maybe... um, literature. Personal essay, is that a section?  It could be under religion or spirituality... or autobiography?&quot;  The cashier just looks at me and tries not to laugh.  <br />Lamott writes about herself and all around her. The first third of the book, my favorite part, is a journey of faith from California hippie agnosticism/mysticism to strict atheism to christianity.  She writes about her son, about her friends, alive and dying, about her journies and discoveries.  She is very real, very tough, very high-strung emotionally and quite honest, I think.  She reminded me of Ani Difranco -- if Ani Difranco was a bit older, had a son, was christian, and lived in California.<br />This book could be a cool drink of water to many sick and tired of &quot;mainstream&quot; christianity.  Anne Lamott isn't mainstream, but she is definitely christian.  She writes, &quot;My friends like to tell each other that I am not really a born-again Christian.  They think of me more along the lines of that old Jonathan Miller routine, where he said, &quot;I'm not really a Jew -- I'm Jew-ish.&quot;  They think I am Christian-ish.  But I'm not.  I'm just a bad Christian.  A bad born-again Christian.  And certainly, like the apostle Peter, I am capable of denying it, of presenting myself as a sort of leftist liberation-theology enthusiast and maybe sort of a vaguely Jesusy bon vivant.  But it's not true...I could go to a gathering of foot-wash Baptists and, except for my dreadlocks, fit right in.  I would wash their feet; I would let them wash mine.&quot;<br />Anne Lamott describes herself as &quot;slightly more anxious than the average hypochondriac&quot;, and maybe it's well-earned.  There is a lot of disease and dying in this book -- often used to paint a wonderfully painfully important lesson about faith, God, and people.  I can't quite decide if reading this while being close to a serious illness would be incredibly good or disastrously bad.  <br />All, in all, her writing is pretty good.  At the end of some chunks, I was a little lost about how we got to this conclusion, or even what conclusion we came to.  But the book is quite enjoyable, and potentially powerful.  It's a quick, easy read, with pieces to savour.  <br />A sample: <br />&quot;Nothing happened.  No burning bush, no cereal flakes dropping from heaven, forming letters of instruction in the snow.  It's just that God began to act like Sam-I-Am from Green Eggs and Ham.  Everywhere I turned were helpful household hints on loving one's enemies, on turning the other cheek, and on how doing that makes you look in a whole new direction.  There were admonitions about the self-destructiveness of not forgiving people, and reminders that his usually doesn't hurt other people, so much as it hurts you.  In fact, not forgiving is like drinking rat poison and then waiting for the rat to die. Fortune cookies, postcards, bumper stickers, everything but skywriting -- yet I kept feeling that I could not, would not forgive her in a box, could not would not forgive her with a fox, not on a train, not in the rain.&quot;...	2000-10-14

But at the middle of it all are two women with frustratingly similar names: Helena and Hermia.  Hermia loves Lysander but is engaged (by a controlling father) to Demetrius.  Helena loves Demetrius, who can think of no one but Hermia.  Until a fairy god and an impish spirit step in and sprinkle some love-juice around: suddenly it's all a mess, everyone switches partners like at a square dance.  But, naturally, it all works out in the end, and two pairs of lovers emerge to live happily ever after.<br />Two subplots add to the silliness of love: Titania, the fairy queen, under a spell sent by her husband, falls in love with a man with an donkey's head.  (read: there is no objectivity in love, no &quot;ideal lover&quot;.)  Then, a bunch of fools perform a hilaroiusly awful play for the king, a play about tragically separated and suicidal lovers...something like Romeo and Juliet. (read: tragedy and love together are hilariously overdramatic.)<br />A enjoyable, funny, light, fairly fast play to read and perform.  You gotta love Puck.  The only real difficulty I had was keeping Helena and Hermia straight -- now, who loves who?<br />And really, in the end, it doesn't matter who loves who, just that all are loved.<br />Make sure you don't read one of those nasty prose or abridged versions here.  Half the fun is the meter, and it's definitely short and sweet enough not to need abridgement.<br />a passage from the play:<br />PUCK: If we shadows have offended,<br />Think but this, (and all is mended)<br />That you have but slumbered here,<br />While these visions did appear.<br />And this weak and idle theme,<br />No more yielding but a dream,<br />Gentles, do not reprehend;<br />If you pardon, we will mend.<br />And, as I am an honest Puck,<br />If we have unearned luck,<br />Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,<br />We will make amends, ere long:<br />Else the Puck a liar call.<br />So, good night unto you all.<br />Give me your hands, if we be friends,<br />And Robin will restore amends.&quot;/>If you pardon, we will mend.<br />And, as I am an honest Puck,<br />If we have unearned luck,<br />Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,<br />We will make amends, ere long:<br />Else the Puck a liar call.<br />So, good night unto you all.<br />Give me your hands, if we be friends,<br />And Robin will restore amends.&quot;	2000-10-11

Bold and brave men, stubborn men, dead men, and one notoriously beautiful woman.<br />It's called the greatest war story of all time.  I can't really argue with that, because I haven't read many war stories.  But the nature of war does capture what is good and bad -- or hard -- about the Iliad.<br />The high emotions lead to high drama which is good reading.  Epic porportions make you wish to live in a grand age and commit grand deeds.  The characters are larger than life, demi-gods in themselves, and it is easy to exult in their achievements and lament their shortcomings.  The story provokes me to think about such notions as honor, fate, freedom, love, loyalty, and hatred.  It's no wonder college professors and high school teachers love this book so much -- there's no shortage of things to write essays about.<br />On the other hand, it is often tediously gory.  Pages and pages, especially through the middle, of gouging out eyes, spears through shoulder blades, guts spilling on the floor, and the like.  Unless you're thirteen and like to wear camo, this isn't much fun.  It takes some serious perseverance to push through it and find the \\"good stuff\\".<br /> I picked up a different translation, a novelization, and I must strongly recommend reading the Iliad in verse.  It adds something vital -- maybe reading about war and death and gore in verse makes it feel a little more poetic.<br />I'm not sorry I read it, but I don't plan on ever reading it again.<br />If you'd like to discuss the Iliad with me, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.  but be nice.	2000-10-09

Of course, this wins him  acclaim from strangers and scorn from those who know him. <br />My name is Asher Lev is a painfully real look at the development of a great artist, one who is also an observant Hasidic Jew, belonging to a prominent family.   There are no huge events here, no  tragedies or shocking revelations; there is simply the real and sometimes dark portrayal of a development, a battle between two worlds.  His talent, perhaps even his need, to draw, to paint, to portray -- conflicts on a deep and serious level with his heritage, and his father's expectations.<br />This is not another \\"rebel without a cause\\" book.  Asher does his best not to rebel -- and when he does, if he does, it is compelling, complex, and painful to him most of all.<br />Potok writes calmly and seriously with no sense of high drama.   His ability to keep the events realistic and still let them speak with their own peculiar power is an excellent, is slightly unsettling, talent.  His ability to simply paint complex characters is brilliant.  This book is quietly disturbing, calmly passionate.  Definitely worth reading.<br />A page from the novel:<br />&quot;Inside my room, I lay on my bed with my eyes closed and thought about the man from Russia.  I saw his face clearly: the nervous eyes, the beaked nose, the pinched features.  That face had lived eleven yars in a land of ice and darkness.  I could not imagine what it was like to live in ice and darkness.  I put my hands over my eyes.  There was his face, very clearly; not truly his face, but the way I felt about his face.  I drew his face inside my head.  I went to my desk and on a piece of blank white paper drew how I felt about his face.  I drew the kaskett.  I did  not use any colors.  The face stared up at me from the paper.  I went back to the bed and lay on it with my eyes closed.Now there was ice and darkness inside me.  I could feel the cold darkness moving slowly inside me.  I could feel our darkness.  It seemed to me then that we were brothers, he and I, that we both knew lands of ice and darkness.  His had been in the past; mine was in the present.  His had been outside himself; mine was within me.  Yes, we were brothers, he and I, and I felt closer to him at that moment than to any other human being in all the world.&quot;<br />If you'd like to discuss this book with me, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.  but be nice.	2000-10-09
US	51001729	R1VOSTFOB5UGOQ	0451525264	996904481	Les Miserables	Books	5	60	84	N	N	Truly a great novel, but read the abridged version.	It's pretty common knowledge that this is one of the best novels ever written, and I totally agree.  Hugo has a keen eye, a passion for the human situation.  But what sets Hugo and Les Mis apart is his ability to manage so much so well.  This novel is massive, and I'm not talking about the number of pages.  It envelopes life, and death, heaven and earth, love and hate, good and evil, and all else under the sun.  Les Miserables is truly epic, which is truly remarkable.  The plot is absolutely compelling, from beginning to end.  The story of Jean Valjean is a universal story, and his transformation should resonate with every spirit.  The characters swirling around him are deeply poignant, passionate, and complete.  Like Dickens (and few others), Hugo knows how to pull characters' plights together in a huge and complex world without pushing the envelope of believability.  When Thenardier seeks to blackmail a rich man, you want it to be Valjean.  And when Marius goes for the police to capture Thenardier, you know he will meet Javert.  And as each character's thread spins out toward its end, the endings are complete and satisfying, perhaps inevitable.  Funny how life is like that.  Having said that, I would recommend an abridged version of the novel to any but a devoted French historian.  Hugo is in love with France, and carries an encyclopedia in his brain.  For this (fairly well-read) layman, many of his 30-70 page long tangents into such topics as the details of current events of 1817, battle strategy at Waterloo, the history of the Parisian sewer, and the street language of Paris, are all but indecipherable.  I'm definitely not a fan of abridged editions of anything, but in this case, I have to make an exception.  I hope that there is a good one out there that cuts none of the plot and description, but declares, \\"Death to the Tangent!\\"  That would be beautiful.<br />A sample of Hugo's writing:<br />\\"Algebra applies to the clouds; the radiance of the star benefits therose; no thinker would dare to say that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations.  Who could ever calculate the path of a molecule?  How do we know that the creations of worlds are not determined by falling grains of sand?  Who can understand the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great an the infinitely small, the echoing of causes in the abyss of being and the avalanches of creation?  A mite has value; the small is great, the great is small, all is balanced in necessity; frightening vision for the mind.  There are marvelous relations between beings and things; in this inexhaustible whole, from sun to grub, there is no scorn; each needs the other.\\"  If you would like to discuss this book with me, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.

Why are gems like this so rare?<br />Calvin Miller's poetry is beautiful,  often subtle, solidly powerful.  He blends a free verse style with a  fantasy-esque feel to weave a new form of allegory/theo-writing.  Not  nearly as clunky as Pilgrim's Progress type stuff, not as intense or  involved as Paradise Lost, smoother and more mythic than Chronicles of  Narnia, yet borrowing elements of all three.<br />Symphony in Sand is a  loosely woven tale of Mary (re-named Trouvere), Joseph (Artisan), Nicodemus  (Imperius), and  a king (Melek) waiting to see the Child.  It is dreamlike  and beautiful, powerful and touching.  Miller weaves in deep truth with  human emotion, the grandeur of God with the frailty of man.  <br />Words  escape me as I attempt to review this.  All I can think to write is  \\"beautiful\\".  How I wish there were more books like this!  Miller's pen is  inspired, effortless.  He writes in a way that gives dignity to the written  word... and points to the Word himself.<br />A sample:  Trouvere's  song<br />&quot;Send soon the gentle rain and kiss<br />The parched philosophies  of earth.<br />And wash my shabby rags of trust<br />And clothe me with a new  cleansed worth.<br />&quot;Immaculate in nature come<br />Swab dying from my dead  hereafter.<br />Cut healing into stabbing woe<br />And bind my pain with  laughter.<br />&quot;Send soon the gentle rain.

That's part of the  beauty of it, and maybe is inherent in the title.  This is a celebration of  old things, a rediscovering of what is ancient and classic, not a load of  new ideas and pop culture catch-phrases.  There are twelve steps here, but  this is no twelve-step program. <br />Richard Foster has done his homework.   Seems like he's read just about every classic Christian writer, every  saint, every mystic, and many others besides.  He has found some common  themes, and he presents them here in a simple form for us less well-read  folk.  I, for one, am grateful.  <br />Foster addresses twelve  oft-misunderstood disciplines: meditation, prayer, fasting, study,  simplicity, solitude, submission, service, confession, worship, guidance,  and celebration.  He works hard to present why these are valuable  disciplines, what the reward will be for pursuing them, and what it looks  like to pursue them.   At the end of most chapters, he offers practical  suggestions for incorporating these seemingly ancient disciplines into a  21st century lifestyle.  <br />The call that runs through all of the  disciplines is a cry to listen, listen, LISTEN to an everpresent and  persistently speaking God.  Foster repeatedly praises the simple life, time  in solitude and silence, and rest.  In a society that is constantly  distracted, this is a valuable and needed cry. <br />A Quaker, sometimes he  goes a little overboard.  I'm not as fond of silence and direct speech as  he is, and I found his chapters on worship and celebration a touch on the  weak side.  But overall, this is a truly incredible book.  I believe Foster  to be one of the few Christian mystics of our time, to rank with Lewis,  Bonhoeffer, and Schaeffer.  Read this book slowly, and with much prayer.   <br />A sample: <br />\\"Every Discipline has its corresponding freedom.  If I have  schooled myself in the art of rhetoric, I am free to deliver a moving  speech when theoccasion requires it.  Demosthenes was free to be an orator  only because he had gone through the discipline of speaking above the ocean  roar with pebbles in his mouth.  The purpose of the Disciplines is freedom.   Our aim is the freedom, not the Discipline.  The moment we make the  Discipline our central focus, we turn it into law and lose the  corresponding freedom.\\"<br />-- if you'd like to discuss Celebration of  Discipline with me, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.

However, he shows this strength of his is  almost a weakness here, as he seeks to find a final resolution to the Ender  series.  <br />This one feels a little too metaphysical.  This idea about the  aiuas has taken over a good series.   Most of the first half of the novel  is Val and Peter struggling with being half-people; struggling to find  their identity, if they have one.  Then it all becomes lovesick mush; is  this a romance novel?  Ender loves Novinha, Wang-mu loves Peter but will  she be enough?  Miro loves Val and Jane, but doesn't know if he can love  them as one person.  Yeesh.  <br />The final resolution is okay, but not quite  satisfying, and though Xenocide was plenty long, this idea doesn't feel  like it justified a whole book.   Card feels like he's filling space a lot  of the time.  And trying to figure out how to end a series of strong books.   It's a tough challenge; he almost rises to it.<br />His afterword -- an essay  about the function of literature within culture -- is worth reading and  thinking about.<br />And I have to say it again -- who came up with these book  covers?  They have nothing to do with the book and look terrible.  What is  that thing?<br />A sample passage:<br />\\"But the point is to go on, isn't it?  To  connect with the future?\\"<br />\\"That's one part, yes,\\" said Olhado.  \\"But part  of the purpose of it is now, is the moment.  And part of it is the web of  connections.  Links from soul to soul.  If the purpose of life was just to  continue into the future, then none of it would have meaning, because it  would be all anticipation and preparation.  There's fruition, Grego.   There's the happiness we've already had.  The happiness of each moment.

Yet  this one has something to offer, even to me.<br />These boys go about their  research with serious intellectual integrity -- willing to let the evidence  destroy their hypotheses and starting over with new ideas -- they come upon  some deep and important truths about leadership.  For example:   Preserve the core philosophy, hold all else loosely.             Look for  ways to replace \\"either or\\" with \\"yes AND\\"             Be a clockbuilder,  not a timeteller.<br />Among other ideas.  I don't know if what is here is  profound in the business world, as I don't exist in the business world.    But it is often the simplest of simple truths -- the kind we tend to  overlook.  <br />I read this as part of a staff of a campus ministry, and  found it definitely helpful.  I think any leader of ANYthing will find it  helpful.  If I ever go into business, I'll come back to it.  There are no  \\"quick steps to success\\" or get-rich plans, there is simple a strong  philosophy of business clearly expressed.<br />As I said, the boys have done  their research, and are eager to show it.

Instead of searching the sky, singing song after song, or going to church  services (or maybe as well as these things), Annie Dillard looks for God in  what is around her.  Her book is an attempt to figure out where she is --  and what that means.<br />  She is constantly asking why.  Why all this  beauty?  What's the point?  Why all this variation -- really, a thousand  species of moth?  Is that necessary?  Why all this intricacy?  Why not just  make things -- why makes things out of things made out of things, down  through the smallest of inifinities?<br />      Also, she asks the harder  questions -- why fecundity?  The utter race from life into death, the push  to procreate...  And all this death?  Animals eat others, eat themselves,  eat their mothers or their children.  It's like 9,000 trains on a track  that will only hold 3.   Why is everything blemished somehow?  Is nothing  perfect?  Why?   Why why why?<br /> If this book were only made up of the  whys, it would be overwhelming and perhaps unreadable.  But couched in and  alongside incredibly powerful bits of prose describing and interacting with  what is around her, it is bearable -- no, not just bearable, but  wonderful.<br />   Her prose is powerful.  She is a poet writing  sentences.  Here is a gifted writer who has read widely, remembered much,  asked lots of right and wrong questions, and who spills onto the page with  power and verve.  This book shocks, inspires, infuriates, and tickles the  reader.  I love it and will read it again and again.<br />A sample of her  prose:<br />\\"I am a frayed and nibbled survivor in a fallen world, and I am  getting along.  I am aging and eaten and have done my share of eating too.   I am not washed and beautiful, in control of a shining world in which  everything fits, but instead am wandering awed about on a splintered wreck  I've come to care for, whose gnawed trees breathe a delicate air, whoe  bloodied and scarred creatures are my dearest companions, and whose beauty  beats and shines not in its imperfections but overwhelmingly in spite of  them, under the wind-rent clouds, upstream and down.  Simone Weil says  simply, `Let us love country of here below.  It is real; it offers  resistance to love.'\\"<br />If you'd like to dicuss argue, or rant about this  book with me, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com.  But be nice.	2000-08-13

I agree with him that he has succeeded in doing this, and praise him for it.  Prayer and the art of Volkswagen Maintenance is a  rarity.  It is a truly well-written Christian book.  I was very happily  surprised.<br />It is a novelized journal of a pilgrimage-trip, and Miller  does an excellent job of moving back and forth between plot narrative and  inner reflection.  Sometimes, the close attention to detail is tedious, but  it's livable. Touches of Annie Dillard, Ernest Hemingway, CS Lewis and John  Steinbeck can all be found here.  Miller has a gift for dialogue and many  passages are really funny, maybe because they feel real.  <br />A nice  blending of fun, troubles, and thought and reflection like we all know is  possible, but have a hard time capturing.  Bravo.<br />A  passage:<br />&quot;Pretty big church, is it?&quot;<br />&quot;Yeah, it is.   We've got about 200 people there.&quot;<br />A smile comes to my face as  Paul's definition of large collides with mine.  &quot;Two hundred people  would make for a good Sunday school class in Texas.  I hate to break it to  you, but unless a church has a gym and a bowling alley, they're really not  fulfilling the work of the Lord.  A church has to have a gym and a bowling  alley because people play basketball and bowl and if they do it at church  they are more likely to accept Christ.  Widows and orphans especially, they  play basketball a great deal.&quot;<br />&quot;Is that  right?&quot;<br />&quot;Sure it is.&quot;	2000-08-02

The third of a truly great series, Xenocide is a good deal more talky than the first two books. Maybe it's inevitable: Ender's Game is a novel about gifted youngsters, Speaker for the Dead is about a messed up family and a bizaare alien race; Xenocide is about the nature of existence. <br />  There's not a lot of a plot, there are just a lot of problems to solve. I didn't miss the twisting-turning plot all that much. The story is still pretty strong, and the answers to the problems aren't easily guessable. You learn a lot about Card's philosophy/metaphysics, or at least a philosophy he's made up, even if he doesn't believe in it. Lots of science, a hint or two of mormonism (preexistence and attainable godhood) and some miracles. But all of this is well-woven into the story, so it's handleable-- though difficult at times to get through. If you're a fan of \\"hard\\" sci-fi, you'll love it. But if you're like me -- not really a sci-fi fan so much as a Card fan -- it might be better to speedread these passages. You'll miss an interesting way of looking at the nature of the soul, but you can follow the story just fine. <br /> Characterization remains Card's greatest strength, and continues to make me wish he'd write books about the \\"real\\" world. His characters are multi-dimensioned, people I can care about, and I appreciate his ability to give them different worldviews and still maintain their integrity here. Unlike in Speaker for the Dead, in this book it's possible to be Catholic--or Taoist-- and not a moron. On top of that, I admire his willingness to make risky moves, like killing off key characters. There are some truly painful scenes in this book, and they are some of the most powerful, best-written pieces. Some of his risks don't quite work (why take away Novinha?) but they're all worthwhile. <br /> There is a subplot about a brilliant race of Taoists afflicted with a form of Obssessive-Compulsive Disorder that is really wonderful. It is some of my favorite pages inthe book, and often feels fresh when it feels like Card is tired of his Lusitania characters. It is beautiful, poignant, and well-written. Though it's not all that crucial and never truly ties into the main plot in a significant way, I'm glad it's there. <br />A passage from the book:<br />\\"Jakt gave her his impatient look. \\"I thought we were coming to Lusitania to help in the struggle against Starways Congress. what does any of this have to do with the real world?\\"<br /> \\"Maybe nothing,\\" said Valentine. \\"Maybe everything.\\"<br />  Jakt buried his face in this hands for a moment, then looked back up at her with a smile that wasn't really a smile. \\"I haven't heard you say anything so transcendental since your brother left Trondheim.\\"<br /> That stung her, particularly because she knew it was meant to. After all these years, was Jakt still jealous of her connection with Ender? Did he still resent the fact that she could care about things that meant nothing to him? \\"When he went,\\" said Valentine, \\"I stayed.\\" She was really saying, I passed the only test that mattered. Why should you doubt me now? <br /> Jakt was abashed. It was one of the best things about him, that when he realized he was wrong he backed down at once. \\"And when you went,\\" said Jakt, \\"I came with you.\\" Which she took to mean, I'm with you, I'm really not jealous of Ender anymore, and I'm sorry for sniping at you. Later, when they were alone, they'd say these things again openly. it would not do to reach Lusitania with suspicions and jealousy on either's part.\\"<br />....	2000-07-10
US	51001729	RI67VAMXF2LIE	0812550757	241285325	Speaker for the Dead (The Ender Quintet)	Books	5	99	114	N	N	A landmark of sci-fi and humanism	As he tells us in the introduction (which is, by the way, the best introduction I've ever read), this is the book Card intended to write when he began the ever-popular Ender series.  Ender's Game was simply a prologue  -- originally a short story.  <br />There are so many good things about this  book.  Card has a talent for writing deep, real characters that I've never  seen in sci-fi and seldom in any modern literature.  He is a master  storyteller, and this book is wonderfully paced -- you will continually be  twisting your brain trying to uncover what is up with the pequeninos before  the scientists do.<br />But most of all, this book is a eloquent manifesto of  humanism.  As Speaker for the Dead, it is our hero Ender's lifelong task to  understand people and tell the truth about them -- a truth that will reveal  their good, bad, and ugly, but most importantly, their inherent worth and  um, goodness.   This truth-seeking carries from the individual to the  entire races, as Card (and Ender) examine how we relate to those we don't  understand, even those we can't understand.  <br />So what is it?  It's a  page-turner, crazy idea-filled(as all sci-fi should be) thrilling,  thoughtful, powerful, funny, poignant novel.  It is an excellent piece of  writing that I would love to see taught in high school classrooms.  <br />My  only problems with it are that terrible cover(who designed these covers?   They have nothing to do with the story -- not even the tone of the story)  and the sometimes indecipherable use of portuguese.  But those are both  minor.<br />An excerpt:<br />&quot;We know you now.  That makes all the  difference, doesn't it?  Even Quim doesn't hate you now.  When you really  know somebody, you can't hate them.&quot;  &quot;Or maybe it's just that  you can't really know them until you stop hating them.&quot;   &quot;Is  that a circular paradox?  Dom Cristao says that most truth can be only  expressed in circular paradoxes.&quot;    &quot;I don't think ithas  anything to do with truth, Olhado.  It's just cause and effect.  We can  never sort them out.  Science refuses to admit any cause except first  cause-- knock down one domino, the one next to it also falls.  But when it  comes to human beings, the only type of cause that matters is final cause,  the purpose.  What a person had in mind.  Once you understand what people  really want, you can't hate them anymore.  You can fear them, but you can't  hate them, because you can always find the same desires in your own  heart.&quot;<br />If you'd like to discuss this novel, e-mail me at  krischwe@whitman.edu	2000-07-01

He preaches a joyfully dirty Christianity, where the true servants of Christ are not  afraid to get their hands dirty, to give with no thought for tomorrow, to  be broken and needy and open and loving. This is not your grandmother's  religion.   He rejoices, he fumes, he laughs and he cries.   The chapters  are staccato short, and you'll probably read half the book in one night.   Each section is anecdotal, ground in examples from his own experience.  Out  of these experiences, he raises much needed questions about our   relationship to the poor, the ways we give, our relationship to Christ, and  the difference between Americanism and Christianity.   Like his Lord,  Lupton has learned how to say &quot;You have heard it said...but I tell you  instead...&quot;  these pieces are powerful, gentle, disturbing and  encouraging.   I have just returned from leading an urban missions project,  where we read this book alongside working in the inner city.  Not only does  it paint a wonderfully accurate picture -- so much more complex than the  standard view of the inner city -- but it puts into words things that need  to be said.  I feel indebted to Mr. Lupton, not only for teaching me much  but for speaking for me.   A great book.	2000-06-04

Though Berry's faith is evident, it is far from oppressive, and simply adds to the peace and quiet of the  poems.<br />Peace and quiet describe them best.  Called \\"Sabbath Poems\\", they  are often the result of a restful walk through the woods, a time of  reflection and enjoyment of \\"the given world\\".    Themes through the book  are love of nature (and God through nature), a growing disgust with the  modern world, the presence and comfort of death and life, and his love for  his wife.  <br />Metrically, Berry's poetry is marked by the strength of his  individual lines.  Sometimes he rhymes; almost always there is an internal,  even organic rhythm.  <br />As this book spans 1979 -- 1997, it is also  interesting to trace the progression of his poetry.  His lines grow  stronger as his poems grow simpler.  And he is less afraid to venture out a  bit -- while most of his poems are 15-20 lines unrhymed with internal  rhythm, he tries on rhyming patterns, writes one or two line works, and  even writes a 13 page praise of the pastoral life.  <br />215 pages long is a  good deal longer than most books of poetry that aren't  &quot;collections&quot;.  My favorite poems are towards the end, if you're  only going to read a few, read the ones from 1992 on.  <br />Poems to quite  your soul and spirit. Highly recommended.<br />A sample poem:<br />I go among the  trees and sit still.<br />All my stirring becomes quiet<br />around me like  circles on water.<br />My tasks lie in their places where I left them, asleep  like cattle.<br />Then what is afraid of me comes<br />and lives a while in my  sight.<br />What it fears in me leaves me,<br />and the fear of me leaves  it.<br />It sings, and I hear its song.<br />Then what I am afraid of comes.<br />I  live for a while in its sight.<br />What I fear in it leaves it,<br />And the  fear of it leaves me.<br />It sings and I hearits song.<br />After days of  labor,<br />mute in my costernations,<br />I hear my song at last,<br />and I sing  it. As we sing,<br />The day turns, the trees move.<br />(if you'd like to  discuss Berry's poetry, to disagree or agree with me, to recommend a poet I  might enjoy, my e-mail is krischwe@whitman.edu)	2000-06-04
US	51001729	R1PCCUOWRO4G30	0679736328	584990790	Suttree	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Powerfully written	First, the prose of this book.  It is something uniquely its own, yet standing on the shoulders of soÏmany wonderfulworks of art:perhaps the 20th century heir of past epic verse poetry works.  Indeed, this book could be the great great grandchild of the Odyssey, and the second cousin of James Joyce's Ulysses, which I hated.  Perhaps McCarthy learned something from Joyce's mistakes and wrote a stream of consciousness novel that is actually readable.  (Ah!  Ack! English professors everywhere are putting out a contract on my life right now!  I not only said I hated Joyce, I said he made mistakes!)<br />Still, this is definitely literature, in the way that most people would use \\"literature\\" as a bad word.  There 's no real clear moving plot, no suspense or climax, no hero (not really) and no villain.  Nothing is at stake here, no wars or court cases or people's lives.  Of course, in that way it is much more like real life, but hey, a lot of people have enough of that and don't want to read about it too.  \\"Give us heroes,\\" they cry.  \\"Give us glorious battles and terrible defeats, worlds in the balance, loves and lives and the future of all mankind at stake.  Give us DRAMA!\\"  This is not the book for them.<br />In fact, McCarthy seems to want to avoid drama, mostly.  Even the premise of the book-- a richÏyoung man who gives up all he has to be a bum along the shores of the Tennessee River--is way too dramatic, and is downplayed as much as possible.  It hardly appears in the book at all, and then indirectly.  This is a book about life, plain old life, if you can call bumming it along the river plain life.  <br />Yes, this is a romance of the poor and beggardly, the drunk and skunkenly, the unpleasant yet beautiful, colorful and dirty folks of the underworld, the forgottens of Knoxville in all their glory.  And I, for one, love it.  It makes me want to leave my life, my nice little life, my forty hours a week life, and fish on the river, get drunk and suffer, live, die,and rise.  Straight up, I've gotta say the hero reminds me of my man Jesus, cheesy or weird as that may sound to you.  But the way he walks among the unpleasants, lives with grace, love, and no hint of judgement...it's amazing, it's beautiful, and I love it.  <br />Yes, I love it.  I love this book.  It took me six months to read it because I loved it so much I had to take it slow and savor it.  And the day I finished it, I almost turned right around and started at the front again.  That's the joy of a (basically) plotless book: it's somewhat seamless, a circle in upon itself.  This is the second time I've read it (the first time was for a class, and way too fast and with too much pressure and stress attached) and chances are, I'll read it again.  McCarthy's other books are already on my reading list, though one of them was made into a Matt Damon movie and I can't imagine McCarthy and Matt Damon existing in the same universe.  But I guess I'll have to read it to find out.                                                                            <BR>A small smackering of that beautiful, truly beautiful writing:<br />\\"He woke with the undersides of his eyelids inflamed by the high sun's hammering, looked up to a bland and chinablue sky traversed by lightwires. A big lemoncolored cat watched him from the top of a woodstove. He turned his head to see it better and it elongated itself like hot taffy down the side of the stove and vanished headfirst in the earth without a sound. Suttree lay with his hands palm up at his sides in an attitude of frailty beheld and the stink that fouled the air was he himself. He closed his eyes and moaned. A hot breeze was coming across the barren waste of burnt weeds and rubble like a whiff of battlesmoke. Some starling had alighted on a wire overhaed in perfect progression like a peice of knotted string fallen slantwise. Crooning, hooked wings. Foul yellow mutes came squeezing from under their fanned tails. He sat up slowly, putting a hand over his eyes. The birds flew. His clothes cracked with a thin dry sound and shreds of baked vomit fell from him. He struggled to his knees, staring down at the packe balck earth between his palms with its bedded cinders and bits of crockery. Sweat rolled down his skull and dripped from his jaw. Oh God, he said. He lifted his swollen eyes to the desolation in which he knelt, the ironcolored nettles and sedge in the reeking fields like mock weeds made from wire, a raw landscape where half familiar shapes reared from the slagheaps of trash. Where backlots choked with weeds and glass and the old chalky turds of passing dogs tended away toward a dim shore of stonegray shacks and gutted auto hulks. He looked down at himself, caked in filth, his pockets turned out. He tried to swallow but his throat constricted in agony. tottering to his feet he stood reeling in that apocalyptic waste like some biblical relict in a world no one would have.\\" (pg80-81)	2000-05-17

Her daughter is Mrs. Fainall, who had an affair with  Mirabell that resulted in her marrying Fainall (she thought  she was  pregnant) who she doesn't love and who is having an affair with Marwood,  who is secretly in love with Mirabell and would do anything to keep him  from marrying Millamant, who, by the way, loves him and hates him at the  same time.  <br />And that's all before the play even starts.  This play,  often heralded as &quot;the best of the Restoration plays&quot; (ironic,  since it was a commercial failure for Congreve) is witty, complex, and very  hard to keep up with.  The plot revolves around who will get Lady  Wishfort's inheritance and how, and some of the things they try are quite  ridiculous.   It has funny moments -- mostly provided by Mirabell's wit and  the tomfoolery of Witwoud and Petulant, the comic relief.

There he discovers his lost  love, and something about the nature of bondage.  <br />An compelling look at  the nature of bondage, slavery, the human condition, European customs, love  and passion, and honor.  Especially intriguin because it was written in the  17th century, when slavery wasn't even a disputed practice.  <br />The author  is of note as well; Aphra Behn was the first woman to make a living as a  writer.

Unlike most poets and most poetry, she quite often writes in the third person, narrating events of the past, touching quiet legends or legendizing every  day events.  There is a sense of vision here that makes me wistful, longing  to know more, to enter into an old scene. However, there are still some  poems that fail to capture, places where I am unable to enter in, where the  details simply remain details.    <br />Her beauty is quiet and sparse, like  the snowy scene on the cover of the book.  (Most fitting book cover I've  ever seen -- it actually captures the style of the poetry.)

A grand opera of a novel, the plot moves and sweeps and even swoops sometimes.  Stendhal at times gets so caught up in his characters that I think what they do surprise even him. It surprises  me-- and that may be most difficult part of this work; it's hard to  understand why the characters do what they do.  But underneath there is a  subtle, sometimes humorous look at why we -- for Julien is surely one of  &quot;us&quot; -- do crazy things.<br />There is a great deal of social and  political commentary on 19th century France; this can be confusing and  frustrating, since we don't live in 19th century France, and most of us  don't know much about it.  So skip those parts if you need to. You can  enjoy the novel without them (though, naturally not as much as with  them.)<br />3 stars: worth reading if you have a good chunk of time, some  pistachios, and a quiet place to think about what Stendhal is trying to  say.  Not a good planeride read.  And not a feel-good book, unless you like  laughing at the absurdity of humanity.	2000-03-07

It's been heralded again and again as one of the best books of the century.  But as literature, I find it problematic.<br />Historically, it is a landmark.  It is a woman writing clearly, honestly, and powerfully about women's identity in a time when  that wasn't only NOT the fad it's become, but it just wasn't done. So it  gets major kudos for that, for being a fresh voice a hundred years ago and  still having some relevance today.  Few books can do that.<br />But as  literature, it's problematic.  The spirituality of Edna's awakening is  often way heavy-handed.  The journey of discovery she takes is simple --  maybe oversimple(Her husband and children conveniently go away at just the  appropriate moment for her continued growth.) And philosophically, it  throws grand hints at things without ever coming down on anything.  The  ending, besides being just plain too fast, is either poignant or  disappointing.  I felt unsatisfied.<br />If you want a historical landmark,  read this.  If you want a more honest female journey novel, read Zora Neal  Hurston's &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;  if you want better  philosophy/literature, read Camus.<br />Two stars for bravery and boldness.  There are a lot worse books out there.	2000-03-07

This is really a fun book.  The structure of it is original and ingenious; 85 poets print one of their poems, and then write a short essay about the process of writing the poem.  More than any book I've ever read about  &quot;the poet's journey&quot; or &quot;the process of writing poetry&quot;  or anything else, this offers insight into the process of writing and the  evolution of a work.  And it offers 85 different perspectives.  I love this  book.	1999-12-22

Milton sets out to 'justify the ways of God to man' - could there be a bigger task?  And comes darn close.  The story of God  and Satan, Adam and Eve, Paradise Lost is the epic of mankind.  Written in  blank verse, it is thick and a bit tough to get through at first -- but as  with all things, perseverance pays off and soon you'll be loving the verse.<br />Don't just read it once, though.  This is one of those books that is  better studied than read -- and there are lots of things you'll get the  second, third, fourth time through that you won't the first.<br />Everyone  should read this.  That'd be a step toward Utopia.<br />And yes, I am  Generation X.	1999-12-10

Yes, everyone.  A couple of times.  It has been one of the most influential books I've ever read.  Nouwen pulls no punches, is not afraid to say anything.  His message  is hardcore and thought-provoking and if it was listened to honestly, would  change the world.  Read this book.	1999-10-08

Yeah, all that stuff those other people above me said is (mostly) true.  But the thing that sets this book apart is that it is a mirror of Dante's inferno.  remember reading that in high school?  Linden Hills in Naylor's  hell.  It's all here...wandering poet led by an inhabitant of  hell...different levels of sin and punishment...and a devil at the bottom.   This may be the closest thing to epic that comes out of the 20th century.   nuf said.	1999-10-05

Shakespeare does a lot of really strange things  here - not Midsummer Night's strange, but strange all the same.  A sexy  nun?  A virgin politician?  A seventy-year-old prostitute?  The heroes are  villainous, the villains are heroic, and the whole thing is a big wonderful  mess.  A bold move, even for Big Willie.	1999-01-29

Few books even draw close.  This is Milton's tribute to the English language - the English epic poem that draws near  then surpasses Homer's Oddyssey (greek) and Dante's Divine Comedy (italian)   The story of Satan's fall, creation, Adam and Eve, and the Fall of Man.  I  have read it three times in the last eight weeks and there are still new  twists and tangles in it I am uncovering.  It is simply, truly amazing.  It  is an experience.  It is a revelation.  I am not exaggerating.  Ask C.S.  Lewis.   PS - I am not an intellectual.  I am a 21 year old student who has  found gold.	1998-12-04
