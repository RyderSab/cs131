The maps are convenient, easy to use, and marvelously clear.  Furthermore, the organization of the guide is wonderfully helpful in assisting the traveler (or resident, as the case may be) in finding cultural destinations, culinary spots, that may have otherwise been missed.  <br />This guide is, like most all of the Dorling-Kindersley series, geared toward helping the traveler ascertain what things might be of particular sightworthiness.  Unlike the Michelin guides, this isn't particularly into the business of rating destinations, and it certainly isn't going to provide the standard domestic AAA guide service of pointing the traveler toward &quot;hot&quot; restaurants.  For a diverse, wonderfully cosmopolitan city, this guide provides a marvelous introduction, and though it neglects a few potential interests in outlying regions, does an admirable job of hitting all the highlights, and even including pictures of most.  <br />The material was current as of late spring 2003.	2003-11-18

Thirty pages in, I was well-ready to heave it out into the atmosphere, somewhere over the Sierra Nevadas.  While Dirk Pitt novels ought never be called &quot;literature&quot;, this hits a new low: within the first ten pages, Cussler manages to use the word &quot;hard&quot; three times in one sentence, to brutalize several nominal alliterations, and generally clobbers the English language into oblivion.  The plot is meandering at best, and in typical Dirk Pitt fashion serves mostly as a vehicle to convey the ever-intrepid hero from situation to situation where he can save numbers of people/bag a girl/stop a bad guy (or some combination thereof).  This is a tired book, with a tired plot and a tired hero.  Perhaps it's time for Dirk to sail away to Valhalla.<br />This actually makes Teen People or TV Guide look like quality reading.  My advice?  Stick with something else--this one's so bad, it's not even soporific.  If you need that Cussler fix, try something earlier--if you need a bit of reading for the plane, try just about anything else.	2003-03-27

Perhaps it is because it is so eloquently understated; it is certainly not due to any deficiencies upon the part of the work.  <br />I first read this book almost half a lifetime ago (this realisation causes me to feel quite the antique, though it in my case implies only eleven years :)).  What immediately struck me was the beauty and elegance of Mr. Potok's prose; I have been impacted significantly in subsequent readings by the simple elegance encompassed herein: both in the nature of the story, and in the inherent qualities of the narrative.<br />&quot;My Name is Asher Lev&quot; tells the story of an Observant Jewish boy (the &quot;Asher Lev&quot; mentioned in the title), who discovers himself to have a gift for art.  As he matures, he comes to find his art at odds with his family's (explicitly his father's) beliefs, thus leading to a climax that is perhaps one of the most poignant in literature, in which Asher must decide upon that which he desires to pursue.  For sheer stylistic beauty, this book stands for me almost unmatched---the story is, as previously expressed, also involving and deeply compelling: Potok is not ever satisfied with the telling of a simple &quot;coming-of-age&quot; story; this resonates as perhaps his finest.  Very highly recommended.	2001-12-05

While that isn't necessarily the greatest of feats, this final Ludlum piece (the last manuscript finished entirely, prior to his death--&quot;The Cassandra Compact&quot; being a joint effort) proves an entertaining diversionary read---essentially the literary equivalent for me of a James Bond film, and a half-decent spy novel/suspense.<br />While Ludlum does makes certain prominent errors vis-a-vis his locations, this effort is written at his ideal thrill-a-minute pace (this same thing cannot be said of all his novels: very many of which become turgid and bogged-down---lousy qualities in what should be an amusing diversion).  If you're looking for great literature, it's perhaps best to pass this one by--- on the other hand, if what you are after is a diversionary piece that is riveting, yet not of the &quot;stay awake all night and irritate the spouse beyond belief&quot; nature, this one certainly fits the bill.  Good, harmless fun.	2001-12-05

Spanning almost his entire career, this represents a broad variety of stylistic and narrative approaches employed.<br />As an introduction to Greene, though, this may be relatively less ideal.  Perhaps better might be one of his novels, or for something lighter, one of his entertainments.  Though the breadth and depth of variation apparent in Greene's work is well-represented here, a better feel for the true character of his writing might be found more readily in others of his works: simply put, I really don't think the medium of a short story allows the unfamiliar reader to sufficiently develop the rich relationship with the material that I find myself desiring.  <br />Regardless of that, this an outstanding collection of stories, the title story (&quot;The Last Word&quot;) being one that I find particularly poignant.  This volume is a very fine assemblage of material, and possesses a sense of overarching thematic unity which renders it both comparatively cohesive (in terms of short-story collections) and a joy to read.  Highly recommended.	2001-11-30

Scott Appleby's work is a deeply intriguing in-depth study of the role that religious actors presently play in international politics, exploring both positive functions filled and negative.

While the &quot;Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; (recommended to me, as it appears it was to many others of the reviewers, as a great thriller) is not Buchan's best work, neither is it poor.  The plot does lack development in areas; at times it also seems as though Buchan is endeavouring to rush the action along at expense if character development, whereas at other times the action drags, and an excessive characterisation (the entire work consumes some 108 pages) is provided.  Despite shortcomings, it is nonetheless an enjoyable, quick read.  Recommended.	2001-05-31

I admit that that &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was the first Bond (Fleming-authored or not) that I have read.  Susbsequent to reading it, though, I have plans for the reading of many more.  I presume that as you are looking at this book, you have probably seen the 1964 film of the same.  As with the majority of filmic adaptations, the book differs somewhat...and, again as with most things, I am convinced that the book is probably better.<br />I also admit to having been on a quest to find my idea of the quintessential piece of summer reading.  This might well be it: it's paced well, the characterisation is non-existent, but then this book is clearly the literary doppelgänger of the popcorn movie...absence of character development should be taken in stride...and Mr. Fleming's prose is both slightly ornate and, er, quirky.  If you're looking for a book to expand your mind, pass on this...if you're looking for something escapist, this certainly should serve you very nicely.  Great fun.  Recommended.	2001-05-28

Peretz's writing on the refugee dynamic continues to be quite relevant to the conflict.  He traces the development of the refugee problem, and explores myriad instituitions conceived of and implemented to deal with the refugees.

A professor at Eastern Mennonnite University, he also has extensive field experience. In &quot;Building Peace&quot;, he focuses upon the necessity of constructing relationships across multiple social levels, de-emphasizing the role of political elites, and instead focusing both upon mid-level elites (bureaucrats, intellectuals, &quot;influential&quot; persons) and grassroots-level activism.  He also stresses the need to develop long-range objectives, to delink expectations of short-term results from questions of involvement, and the need for implementation of training programmes to create what might be termed a &quot;culture of peace&quot; within the society: trained mediators indigenous to the society.  In doing this, the hope is that the &quot;parachute&quot; problem of credibility (the idea that mediators are dropped from the above---IGO/foreign gouvernment, etc---and have no particular attachment to the conflict) may be reduced, and transformation of the conflict may be initiated.<br />Lederach's work is exceptionally lucid, and he draws upon a smorgasbord of substantive examples.

Very simply, his thesis is that, in spite of the numerous logistical obstacles to disbursement that arose, as well as the disturbing frequency of graft and nepotistic practices in the disbursement, these investment funds served a positive function.<br />Under the terms of the Declaration of Principles, signed in 1993, a body of funds was established, into which the donor nations made payment.  The funds were then to be distributed to deserving projects in the Palestinian Territories (West Bank and Gaza Strip) with the said purpose of ameliorating living conditions there, and endeavouring to produce some sense of a tangible benefit resulting from the peace process (co-optation, also, of spoilers)...hence the term &quot;peace dividend&quot;.  Though this dividend did not materialise, and has not materialised, due to a myriad of reasons, these investment funds nonetheless aided in creating a marginally more stable environment in which the Palestinian Authority could function.  <br />This is a lucid, insightful scholarly analysis, and a deserving resource for all students of Near Eastern Affairs and for all readers taking an interest in the region.  Highly recommended.	2001-04-26

What emerges out of this unlikely collaboration, though, is an incredibly lucid, exceptionally concise...well, pithy, even...expatiation of the continuing general security aims of both the Israeli state and those of the Arab world-at-large.  <br />Shai Feldman provides a deeply rational historiographic explanation for Israeli defense policy, looking at the origins of the &quot;self-help&quot; policy, and clearly identifying major security aims.  Abdullah Toukan provides an equally lucid accounting of the origins and nature of Arab security concerns.  The individual analyses of the respective frameworks are perhaps the clearest available.  <br />Where this work is perhaps lacking, though, is in the collaborative fourth chapter, dealing with the construction of a collective security framework for the region.  This is more a collection of ideas upon possible avenues than the firm laying-out of a security architecture.  The authors open by reiterating the respective Arab and Israeli security concerns, and then segue into an analysis where the primary recommendations consist wholly of the need to sustain and enhance discussions (i.e. demonstrate tangible progress) upon arms control and regional security.<br />Ultimately, the architecture that is developed is somewhat dated, particularly in terms of specifics (book written in 1996-7), but the analysis of security concerns is so even-handed and concise as to make this book an undeniably worthwhile and valuable resource for persons interested in better understanding the uneasy nature of the security dynamic in the Arab-Israeli disputes.	2001-04-24

I read this work only after having read much of Greene's other work.  Unlike many of his pieces (&quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;, &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;, 'The Heart of the Matter&quot;), this particular work does not focus particularly upon the moral nature of the actions.  If you come to this expecting something of the depth of one of the aforementioned pieces, you shall likely emerge disappointed.<br />On the other hand, this is an intensely suspenseful, quick, and pleasant read.  The story lends itself perfectly to a rainy afternoon: set upon the Orient Express, this is the no-frills (as is typical of Greene's style) telling of the interactions between Myatt, the Jewish businessman, Coral Musker, the incredibly naive chorus girl, and the Doctor, an exiled revolutionary.  While lacking the moral resonance of Greene's later work, this is still a fun and deserving piece.	2001-04-24

Where some reviewers have found this a particularly compelling work because of the absence of analysis provided, I find it instead lacking: leaving the audience to draw their own conclusions, instead of endeavouring to provide both an account as well as an interpretation, and giving us a sense of the account's relation to broader affairs, is for me sub-optimal.  Also, in the absence of analysis, it almost seems as though the author has chosen to relate specific accounts for their sheer goriness, intending to shock his audience...into what, I don't know.  <br />While there are numerous books providing anecdotes of the Yugoslav civil wars, and numerous books analysing the origins and manifestations of Yugoslav civil conflict, there is a real dearth of work blending the two...this is unfortunately no exception.	2001-04-24

In it, Greene offers up perhaps his most incisive and insightful political commentary, treating the danger of allowing people guided solely by ideology and schools of academic thought to be responsible for intelligence fieldwork.  Pyle, a graduate of Harvard, goes into Indochina, believing intensely in the necessity of enabling a &quot;third column&quot;, General The's men, and employing them as an American proxy force.  <br />Whether or not Pyle himself sees the implicit incompatibility of this abstract idea and reality is never quite clear: certainly Pyle plays witness to the destruction that his attempts to mobilise a third column bring about.  He is not subject, though, to the gross revulsion at the wanton destruction of life that Fowler is.  Equally certainly, Pyle's political views cost him his life: open to question, still, is whether or not Pyle himself was ever conscious of his fallacies, or if he remains blinded throughout.  Rather than being a novel of a man's moral revelations, or telling of his relationship with the Divine, &quot;The Quiet American&quot; is far more a parable.<br />Greene's structure, his combined simplicity and complexity, and the thematic relevance of this novel, render it a deserving read.  Additionally, the chronologies and commentaries upon foreign involvement in Indochina/Vietnam are both valuable and blessedly concise, and the collected reviews and critcal commentaries upon the novel serve as valuable tool for understanding.	2001-04-17

Schaeffer traces the concept from its philosophical forebears into the present, and treats prominent empirical examples of partition (all failed, failing, or dubiously sustainable).  <br />An interesting account it certainly is, but analysis of the cases is lacking: the reader is presented with histories, and nothing but.  Some ideas as to why partition is inclined to fail are mentioned, but are never tied coherently together in the form of a unitary theory.

After sending his wife to South Africa on holiday (an expensive proposition that causes him to need to borrow a sum of money from the local-Syrian-moneylender/black marketeer, Yusef), he finds himself driven perversely to commit adultery.<br />Yusef and Scobie's relationship, as a subtext, provides a deeply interesting foil to the four-cornered relationship between Scobie, his wife, Helen (the adulteress), and Wilson (who professes to love Scobie's wife...behavimg much in the fashion of a dog).  Through the interplay of Yusef and Scobie, Greene provides the reader insight into the fundamental shallowness and duplicity of human relationships...professed friendship and blackmail dominate.  The heart of the matter, as expressed here, is that human relationships are implicitly inferior to the relationship that we may choose to experience with the divine.<br />As for Scobie, he ... himself by taking sacrament (communion bread) without first confessing himself.  Immediately subsequent, he is stricken by angina, leading him inexorably to his end.  This is a deeply tragic, engrossing, and ultimately profoundly moving, read.  Highly recommended.	2001-04-13

I was given this book as a gift, by a friend who heard an interview with the author.  <br />If &quot;Rogue State&quot; was in the possession of new intriguing information, that was being brought together in new, radical forms, its sordid, soap-box (a perhaps odd-seeming combination, I know) tone might then be justified.  As it is doing neither of these things (all the laundry list of incidents, variables, and events that are listed with such sordid glee are bits of knowledge/history made perfectly available to my undergraduate Intro to International Politics class), the tone becomes rather frustrating.<br />Ultimately, the significant criticism becomes more that this is a case of attempted sordid reporting, where the only reporting being done is upon matters of comparatively common knowledge: to say the least, not what was advertised...this is no expose of new, intriguing tidbits of knowledge...it's a rehash of fifty years worth of newspapers.	2001-04-13

Brigach? Furtwangen?), to the Black Sea is alternatingly scintillating and impenetrably dense.  It is fully possible that many of the stylistic difficulties that occur hear arise out of the translation process.<br />Despite the occasional obfuscation, this is a deeply intriguing book.  I picked it up, thinking that it may perhaps successfully do for the Donau (Danube) what Rebecca West's monumental &quot;Black lamb and Grey Falcon&quot; did for Yugoslavia, namely to serve as a marvelous compilation of historical narratives and anecdotes, sort of a &quot;reference point for the ages&quot;.  In this, &quot;Danube&quot; does not disappoint.  There may be thousands of more readable books, but this one is rare, in that it blends so wonderfully narrative, history, and anecdote.  Ultimately even the denseness of the prose may be a virtue...it reduces the reader's speed, allowing us to better digest and reflect upon its contents.  I recommend it.	2001-04-05

To my mind, this is perhaps the finest piece Mr. Lewis ever produced: an allegorical re-telling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche.  It is neither bogged down by excessive detail and fatuous elements that go seemingly nowhere, nor does it seem too spare...in a word, this flows...and does it beautifully...almost mirroring Alan Paton in terms of sheer smoothness and comfort of read.  While spare, the prose does not seem to lack for anything...Lewis constructs his story well, patiently, building us slowly to climax.<br />This is, as mentioned earlier, a re-telling of a myth.  It is also an exploration of love, false love, attachment, jealousy, envy, pride, limitation of human understanding, and, above all, the power of grace to redeem even the least lovely and least desirable among us.  This is a lovely piece, giving a marvelous message of both hope and comfort.  I recommend it most highly.	2001-04-05

Certainly this might not necessarily be the best work with which to begin one's odyssey through Turgenev, but this very effectively pulls together all the familiar elements of his writing.  Turgenev is not known for his plot development, and this is again the case here: very little actually occurs.  The absence of plot and of action, however, is not to say that this dry, boring drivel.  Rather, Turgenev's material, this work in particular, becomes a pleasant marriage of the classic novel with the novel of ideas.  <br />His commentary, both political and human, is both trapped in the amber of history and universally relevant (a lovely dichotomy) to the human condition.  &quot;Virgin Soil&quot; is a very fine story, and the translation is flowing and literate (having no Russian, I cannot speak to how accurately this might reflect the original).	2001-03-14

Of particular note and value is her focus upon mechanisms of function, rather than upon units of function.  As organisations tend to redefine their roles upon a fairly frequent basis, Peck focuses instead upon what specific means of intervention seem to produce the greatest success.  The only questionable aspect of this work is a marked tendency to view organizational interventions (by fairly large, significant actors: OSCE, OAU, OAS, UNDPKO) as really the only means by which conflict should be addressed, and peace built.  <br />That aside, Peck's work provides a remarkable catalogue of the role that organisations have been able to fill, and offers insightful analysis into how more peaceful future outcomes may be provided for.	2001-03-14

Instead of conceiving of conflict as an abnormal state that needs be abolished, he instead considers that it is a normative state of affairs between parties.  The key is not to 'resolve' or precipitate an end to conflicts, but is rather to transform the conflict from a destructive (negative-sum or zero-sum) to a constructive (positive-sum) framework.  Toward this end, he offers an impressive catalogue of methods that might be considered for application, and examines a myriad of factors that play a role in constructing the framework of conflict.<br />His is a particularly broad-minded approach, as Kriesberg even refuses to dismiss all armed, violent conflicts as implicitly destructive, rather arguing that there may be tangible positives that arise (though these are, for Kriesberg, primarily oriented toward inducing both parties to recognise the need to broker a settlement).  Through this book, Kriesberg looks to alter the manner in which the scholarly and diplomatic worlds consider conflict and its resolution (transformation).  This is nothing short of a seminal work.	2001-03-14

Believing that her lover, Maurice Bendrix, was killed in a bombing raid, she drops to her knees and prays that if God spares his life, she shall forsake Bendrix.  Bendrix is spared, and Sarah then is forced to confront her end of the bargain, which she finds to be an unbearable weight, and thereby breaks it.  Though the choices are portrayed in the starkest of terms, Greene nonetheless imparts a beautiful sensitivity to his novel.  Sarah, Maurice, and Sarah's husband are all strikingly human, all forced into a series of dilemmas by their prior decisions made generally upon only rash impulse.  <br />In this work, Greene again seeks to write almost for cinematic adaptation; the development he achieves upon multiple levels with a comparative economy of words is striking.  In sum, this is both a literarily pleasing book and a deeply affecting story...a moral parable even.	2001-03-13

He does not engage in fatuous comfort, nor is any illusion created that life is intended to be simple.  He does not indulge in the (far too common, to my mind) practice of lamenting his own humanity.  Instead, in both the tradition of the Stoicists and Kierkegaard, he embraces it, and looks for the faith and the courage to utilise his capacities to their fullest extent.<br />This is also a work of universal relevance: there is truly much in here worth sharing.  This is the one book that stays by my bed.  The faith, simplicity, care and stoicism are deeply touching.  This I find to be a wonderful book...largely for helping us to reconcile the world as it is, with the world as it needs to be, for reminding us to take joy in our burdens, and not to lament our transitory nature.  As near as I have ever found, Hammarskjöld's thoughts encapsulate what I believe it is to be human.	2001-03-13

This collection of writings, primarily dealing with the emergence of a Palestinian self-consciousness, was authored of the course of nearly thirty years.  Not only does it provide a uniquely valuable historical catalogue of Said's thoughts upon Palestinian issues, it traces well the Palestinian self-view.  Edward Said is, to my mind, one of the most truly complete thinkers alive today...his thoughts, be they upon literary criticism, culturalism, politics, or ethnography, scintillate...this collection is no different.  For those wanting a, albeit ocassionally caustic, tracing of the Palestinian self-view and world-view of them, this stands as a superior resource.	2001-03-05

Particularly compelling is the notion that modernisation and western values are not as inextricably linked as the US &amp; EU wish to think.  Out of this, we have emergent the basic idea that modernisation does not satisfy all incumbent needs of any given population, and thatsomething must then necessarily arise to fill the void.  This something is, for Huntington, culture, which he opts to view in a civilisational, rather than a local context.<BR><BR>While I believe him to be correct in identifying cultural tendencies as those most likely to be grasped by any culture (civilisation, community...to use Benedict Anderson's terminology) in search of 'new meaning' or in a quest to cope with altering conditions, I fail to find the innate maliciousness that he does therein.  From his valid assessment that modernisation is implicitly lacking, Huntington devolves.  First he engages himself in an effort to define what he believes to be his major civilisations...at this he fails, himself admitting that he's fundamentally unsure of the existence of Orthodox civilisation, African civilisation...his inability to achieve a successful working definition of &quot;civilisation&quot; (the one that he finally seizes upon smells oddly like &quot;culture&quot;) is a major handicap to the validity of this work.  After this definitional snafu, he becomes progressively encumbered by an almost pathological fear of Islam.  While this is reflective of a personal bias, for which he cannot be faulted, he undermines the validity of his thesis by persistently hammering at the idea that we need all fear some monolithic Islamic fundamentalism.  Going unsupported as it does, this conclusion of his ends up smelling far more of paranoia than of scholarship. <BR><BR>Reiterating past criticisms from critics with far superior credentials than I, this too deeply reflects Huntington's desire to find a new enemyagainst which to focus the Western World's energy (early criticism pointedly suggested that Huntington himself might well be partially responsible for the rise of a militant Islamic precense, should one transpire). <BR><BR>  His scholarship, as always, scintillates, but his conclusions are dubious, and based more in a desire to find enemies and justify paranoid world-views.  This particular work is rather what one might expect from the marriage of a cultural primordialist (who sees culture as incontrovertible, unchanging) and a Hobbesian (Thomas Hobbes...life is nasty, brutish, and short) thinker.  If you're looking for an introduction to Huntington's work, this is certainly as fine a place to begin as any...&quot;The Clash of Civilisations&quot; is an undeniably influential text with regard to modern policy planning...and, as previously stated, it is (like all works of his) displaying of great thought and effort.  It is very much worth reading, perhaps primarily because so many disagree so intensely with him.  Think of Huntington's Clash as perhaps another Kauffman Thesis (Chaim Kauffman, partition is the best way to resolve ethnic strife).  Controversial, disliked, even lambasted, yes...but valuable.	2001-02-02

Particularly for those who are looking for an obtainable English-language ethnography of the Palestinain people, this book is an invaluable resource.  Shahab paints a most sympathetic picture of his people; though flavoured heavily by nostalgia (as one ought expect, given the background of this work), this account nonetheless meshes ever-so-neatly with the dry, scholarly analyses more broadly available to the American audience.<BR><BR>In addition to its value as an ethnographic supplement (if you are interested in ethnographies, &quot;Before the Mountains Disappear&quot;---Bevor die Berge Verschwinden--- by Ali Qleibo is invaluable...), what of the recipes I have tried are outstanding.  The one provided for muhallabia, a sweetened scalded-milk dessert...delightful, I find...imagine almost a hybrid between yoghurt and gulab jamun, the Indian dessert...is particularly excellent.  This is a remarkable book...many cookbooks I have come acroos purport to deal with the culture from which the recipes are derived...&quot;A Taste of Palestine&quot; truly does...	2001-01-31

Unlike many things, though, this was a true deprivation.  I first read this several summers ago; though Paton's novel is specifically relevant to an era that is now receding into the past, his prose remains haunting.  So deceptively simple is his language, yet flowing, this is almost a book best savoured aloud (well-worth the reading of to a friend).<br /><br />Though apartheid has now blessedly slipped the scene, leaving South Africa with its aftermath to struggle through, Paton's story of the Reverend Kumalo's search for redemption is enduring.  Perhaps most significant though, is the very simple idea at the core...reconciliation...of father with lost son, lost daughter...of murderer with the victim's kin...and...in Paton's time, and still so in our own...of each of us with our fellow humans.<br /><br />This is a book that moves me deeply every time I read it, and loses nothing in a rereading.  Of the thousands of books I have read, encompassing a myriad of styles, of academic fields...this is still the one book that I recommend without hesitation, without prejudice, to any and to every.  This is a truly beautiful work.	2001-01-29

Rilke is that poet that you, if you are tormented by memories of high-school poetry lessons past (dactylic metre sound vaguely familiar?), ought try.  His imagery is accessible, his meaning clear...and he manages simultaneously a beautiful degree of both spiritual and metaphorical richness. <BR><BR> Snow's translations of Rilke's poetry are superb; he consistently preserves the metric structure and is also conscious of the need to employ every word and consider every nuance of meaning, rather than simply settling for glossing it (a surprisingly common problem in poetry translation).  In the challenging world of finding faithful poetry translation, Snow's work is outstanding...and the original material to my sense of literary aesthetics unsurpassed...little of Rilke's beauty is sacrificed in the execution of this translation.  Rilke's simultaneous spareness, sensitivity, and richness endure here; rather than imposing himself upon the reader, Snow succeeds admirably at the translator's task, and brings Rilke to the English-speaking audience.	2001-01-29
