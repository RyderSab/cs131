It is the gift of obedience which means that she would have to obey any command, even if it was a command to kill herself. With the help of her friends, Prince Char and Mandy, her nurse and cook (and something else), she struggles through a quest to find Lucinda to make her take her 'gift' away. She also has to tolerate her mean stepsisters Hattie and Olivia and their mother Dame Olga. But when her curse gets in the way of her love for Char, she has to find a way to break the curse all on her own.<br />This book was wonderfully written! All the characters has such a nice and interesting personalities that you can't help but love every one of them, even Hattie and Olive, the stepsisters. The romance between Char and Ella is very cute, as my friend says. The story is very intriguing and you just have to finish reading it.<br />Another book I like written by Gail Carson Levine is \\"The Two Princess of Bamarre,\\" which has a bit of a darker tone, but is still very interesting.	2003-11-18

I got \\"The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Box Set\\" for my birthday, and wow, have I really enjoyed it! All my best friends except for one have read the whole set and I felt rather left out when they spoke about it with themselves. So, naturally, I was really looking forward to reading these books and I honestly can say that these books are DEFINENTLY my favorites! The songs in it were very interesting and the plot and everything was really good!<br />***The Hobbit***<br />A really 'enchanting prelude to Lord of the Rings' about the respectable hobbit Bilbo Baggins and how he is hired by Gandalf and a band of dwarves to become a burglar...to recover treasure which the evil dragon Smaug stole years ago from the dwarves' ancestors of Lonely Mountain.<br />In other words, he, the dwarves, and Gandalf has an exciting adventure which includes huge spiders, a dark creature named Golumn(here's where Bilbo finds the Ring of Power!), orcs, goblins, Wargs, many other worse unknown dangers, and finally, the confrontation of the dragon Smaug. My favorite character is Beorn the skin-changer, who helps the adventurers pretty much at Mirkwood Forest.<br />I think this book is something you have to read before Lord of the Rings. It would make the Trilogy even more fun and easier to understand.<br />***The Fellowship of the Rings***<br />Bilbo is now 111 years old and the Ring is beginning to have its first effects on him. \\"I feel all thin, sort of stretched...\\" \\"I won't give my precious away, I tell you...\\" (Bilbo is about to leave his home and go for a long journey and to visit and stay with the Elves, but he doesn't want to leave his Ring behind, despite what Gandalf urges him to.) Gandalf, alarmed at this, makes him leave the Ring.<br />The accursed Ring of Power which, if the evil Dark Lord finds it, would destroy all that was good in Middle-Earth, is now Frodo's and he now has a heavy burden: To go to Mordor, the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom, with a Fellowship of Nine and to throw the accursed Ring into Mount Doom. With dark, fearsome Ringwraiths, orcs, goblins, and other evil things following them, what would happen?<br />***The Two Towers***<br />The Fellowship is now scattered. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are trying to recue Merry and Pippen who were taken by orcs, and were also fighting against the evil wizard Saruman. Only Frodo and Sam are left with the orginal task of throwing the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, where it can only be unmade. Their guide was Golumn, but can they trust him?<br />My favorite book in the Trilogy and it's very exciting.<br />***The Return of the King***<br />Frodo and Sam are nearing the end of their journey, but each step makes Frodo's burden heavier and heavier, until Frodo begins to lose hope in everything. Can the task be finished or will the Dark Lord Sauron capture the Ring and destroy Middle-Earth?<br />Gondor is being attacked by overwhelming evil forces and evil could prevail. Unless Aragorn son of Arathorn returns from the Paths of Dead to help them혖c<br />This book was also exciting and has a good ending, too! I loved reading the LOTR Trilogy and also The Hobbit.

Nothing could be more perfect than life on the farm with her family, her favorite horses, and her best friend, Mona. Ashleigh loves helping with the horses-and dreaming of become a jockey some day...\\"<br />Ashleigh Griffen is thrilled when she hears that she and her family are going to see the wealthy Danworths...and also one of Ashleigh's favorite stallions, Alladin! But, as she watches Aladdin racing and working out, she sees that he has a 'moose-like' way of racing which causes him to lose nearly all races. Ashleigh just knows that she can find out why Aladdin is like that if she can ride him, but she can't because she had terrible math grades and her parents forbid her to ride any ANY horses until she get her grades up.<br />But if she don't help Aladdin, Peter Danworth would no longer love or even care for Aladdin anymore. Ashleigh gets news that if Aladdin loses his next race, the Danworths will retire him to stud at Edgardale...but as she accidentally discovers the secret of how to run him to win, will she tell Peter about it or keep it to herself so that Aladdin would come to Edgardale?<br />I thought that this book wasn't the BEST in the Ashleigh series I've read so far. It was still fun and interesting to read though, and I recommend it to kids and maybe teenagers too. Though I kind of think teenagers would find it a bit easy to read.	2003-04-03

I always loved Redwall books and have read pretty much of them, so I've got to admit that they are getting a tiny bit boring for me. I was thinking of putting this book for four stars since this book was a little bit like \\"Martin the Warrior\\" (which is about slaves who escape an island ruled by vermin and promises to return to free the others), but the action, excitment, humor, and poems made me think, \\"Oh well, I loved this book anyway!\\"<br />Here's the Story:<br />Triss is a young brave squirrel who is enslaved with many other slaves on the island of Riftgard, which is ruled by the evil King Agarnu and his son and daughter Prince Bladd and the sadistic Princess Kurda. Triss and her otter and hedgehog friend Shogg and Welfo are determined to leave the terrible island and to return to free the other wretched slaves...and to slay the Pure Ferrets to end the evil for once and for all!<br />Meanwhile, two Dibbuns from Redwall Abbey have wandered off and gone missing in the Mossflower Woods. As they are found about a day later during a storm by Skipper of Otters and Log-a-Log the Chieftain of Shrews, the Dibbuns tell the elders that they had found an oak tree which provided them shelter. The oak tree had a cunningly hidden door, they said and the older Abbey creatures realize that the babies had found the mysterious Brockhall! They decide to find the place. (here's where most of the poems, songs, and RIDDLES comes out!) But some evil beast (or beasts?) are living there and they are determined to defend their home...<br />At the great moutain of Salamandastron, the stronghold of badgers and hares, the young badger Sagax and his gluttonous hare friend Scarum have runaway from endless chores and from the stern paw of their parents. Meeting their otter friend Kroova, they both sail out into the sea, planning to go to Redwall where food and safety was. (Scarum is pretty happy about the food!)<br /><br />All paths and purposes of the three main runaways are different, but of course, they all cross at the famous Redwall Abbey!<br />I thought that this book had all that a book needed: Excitement, suspense, humor, and lots of action! All 402 pages of it would keep you intrigued, although around the middle part it gets a bit slow. I thought that bantering with the Freebooters and Princess Kurda was in a way kind of funny! Scarum is, like all hares, totally exasperating and has that usual 'British accent, wot wot?' I'm sure anyone would enjoy reading \\"Triss\\"! My other favorite Redwall books I recommend are:<br />\\"Lord Brocktree\\"<br />\\"Taggerung\\"<br />\\"Martin the Warrior\\"<br />Of course, other Redwall books are cool too, but these are my favorites!rse, they all cross at the famous Redwall Abbey!<br />I thought that this book had all that a book needed: Excitement, suspense, humor, and lots of action!

The Hiding Place is a really great book! The setting is in Holland where Corrie Ten Boom and her family makes a 'hiding place' for the persecuted Jews when Holland is being occupied by the Nazi. One day, the family is betrayed and Corrie and her sister Betsie are seperated from their friends, father, and their house as they are brought to the dreaded concentration camps. But they do not ever give up hope or stop praying and believing that God would help them, even though they are treated very cruelly. They pray for their enemies like Jesus said in Matthew 5:44.<br />It's a very inspiring book! God's miracles that are written in this book is really wonderful and this book is a true story. Like in one part, when Corrie's sister Betsey is really sick in the camp and for the medicine, all they have is just a small tiny Davitamon bottle. And everyday, for some reason, the medicine keeps on coming, even though the bottle SHOULD be empty! I was really amazed at this part. I'm sure you would enjoy reading this book!	2003-03-01

All of those are the 'ingredients'(I don't know the word.)for a Redwall book and this book is one of the best!<br />The story is about how the Juskarath, led by the ruthless ferret named Sawney Rath and his vixen seer Grissoul, searches for a Taggerung for their tribe. A Taggerung is a special warrior and the Juska clan considers it a honor to have such a creature in any of their tribes. Grissoul the seer sees that a Taggerung would come to their tribe and Sawney and his vermin looks desperately around Mossflower. They finally find the Taggerung at...where else but Redwall! He is a baby otter, just born and one of Sawney's group kills Rillflagg(his father) as he takes Deyna(the otterbabe's name) to the river for an otter cermony.<br />Years pass, and Taggerung/Deyna is a tough, dangerous, and ferocious otter, living up to his title. But, much to Sawney's dissapointment, he refuses to kill; he does not even try to kill one beast in the tribe who has vowed to kill him, Gruven the son of Antigra the stoat, who wanted her son to become the Taggerung. One dark day, Sawney loses his temper as the Taggerung refuses to kill a runaway. Sawney tries to kill Deyna, but the young otter leaves the tribe. The vermin is very scared of the Taggerung, having seen his ferocious strength and skill in fighting, and does not try to kill or stop him. Only Sawney tries to track down the otter, only to be treacherously killed by the stoat Antigra. (I sort of felt shocked to think that Sawney got killed so quickly, but the story continues on in a very interesting manner.)<br />Meanwhile, at the Abbey, Deyna's mother Filorn and sister Mhera discover that Rillflagg had been killed and the whole Abbey is affected by the shock and grief. Suddenly, they all find a puzzling riddle that tells who the much-needed Abbess or Abbot would be. The puzzle is a bit like the one in \\"Pearls of Lutra\\", but still very much different!<br />Grissoul the Seer then decides to make sure the Juskarath clan would stay together and Antigra urges her to make Grissoul the chief since Sawney had been 'killed by Taggerung'. She presses Grissoul, then, to make her son the Taggerung as well, but Grissoul firmly tells her that Gruven must prove himself first...by killing Tagg! So, with a group of skilled and evil vermin, Gruven sets out with murderous plans about Taggerung, eager to have revenge on Taggerung for taking that title.<br />Tagg, meanwhile, had been meeting new friends and realizing that he would never be one of the tribe. He decides to go the Redwall Abbey, the place of his dreams, when he finds out that there is such a place.

Anyway, Tansy and a group of her friends(Martin the Warrior included!) starts finding the pearls by solving the difficult riddles Fermal had wrote. Soon, the group of corsairs Ublaz had sent reaches Redwall Abbey and kidnaps Abbot Durral and Viola the prissy bankvole as hostages for the pearls.<br />Will they escape?

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this great classic. It was very interesting and had me hooked onto it through the whole story. This story is about how the beggar named Tom Candy and Prince Edward meet and discover that they were both completely identical, except for their clothes. They switch their clothes and change places. Then, each of the two boys have to live through a terrible life of each other. The Prince is beaten, called names, starved, and has to live the life of a beggar. Tom or the Pauper has to go through laws, diplomacy, languages, and royalty. Both of them are considered mad as they try to tell the truth to everyone. Suddenly, the little tiny thing of switching places turns out to be a humongous problem as Prince Edward's father, Henry VIII dies. Tom, who is thought as the Prince, is naturally supposed to be the next king. Both boys has to find each other or else the Pauper would become the wrong king of the nation.<br />This book is very interestingly written. I started reading this once, but I had a better book(or I thought it was a better book) to read so I stopped. Then, I decided to just finish reading &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; and thought that it was just a great and interesting book!

I've said that in my review in \\"Redwall\\", but I hadn't read \\"Martin the Warrior\\" at that time. This book has everything a book needs: action, humor, riddles, and more! This book is a must-read! The story goes like this:<br />Martin the Warrior was a young mouse taken captive when he was just a child. His father's sword was taken from him from the evil stoat named Badrang the Tyrant. He was made a slave with many other peaceful creatures who were captured, in a dreadful castle named Marshank. When he is tied to a post on the top of Marshank to be killed, he sees that 2 creatures were living outside Marshank, a mousemaid called Rose and a mole named Grumm. They were searching for a young mouse named Brome who is Rose's younger brother and Grumm's friend. They discovered that Brome was a slave in Marshank and was trying to figure out how to rescue him. They save Martin from being killed, but Martin was partly saved by the appearance of a sea-faring stoat named Captain Clogg. Badrang and Clogg were enemies. So, Badrang had let Martin down from getting killed and concentrated on the task ahead. Martin, Brome, and another brave and rebelling squirrel name Felldoh(He is my favorite character in this book) escapes with the help of Grumm and Rose.<br />Meanwhile, the pitiful band of slaves in Marshank had formed a plan. They knew that Martin would be back with an army and would save them. They knew that Martin would be back to retrieve his father's sword. So, they decide to be prepared. Stealing food and stealing weapons, they get ready for a rescue.<br />Martin, Brome, Felldoh, Rose, and Grumm are separated at the sea. Martin, Rose, and Grumm, seeing that there was no point in waiting for the others since they didn't know where they were, set out to Noonvale where Rose's home was. There, Martin plans to raise an army and attack Marshank. They are captured by pigmy shrews but are freed when Martin saves the queen of the Squidjees's son.(Squidjees is the name they call themselves) The band of friends don't know where Noonvale is, but gets \\"help\\" from an old molemaid named Polleekin. Polleekin give them a rather hard riddle and they gradually solves it and reaches Noonvale safely.<br />Meanwhile, Felldoh and Brome meets a band of travelers: a hare named Ballaw, a squirrel named Celadine, a badger named Rowanoek, and a few otters and moles. They were preformers. Felldoh boldly proposes to secretly free the slaves only with the band of travelers, Brome, and himself. The Rambling Rosehip Players(the name of the band of traveling creatures) preform a decoy play for the evil animals of Marshank while Felldoh and Brome freed the slaves. Only half of the slaves got out, the other half were recaptured.<br />Martin the Warrior and his friends had not been able to raise an army in the peaceful Noonvale. Boldred, an owl they had made friends with, began to search the land to raise a horde.<br />Brome had planned to free the other half by himself. He dressed himself up like a rat and entered the slave place. Telling the other evil creatures of Marshank that he was bringing them to Badrang, he led them to the secret tunnel he and his friends had used to escape. The slaves were freed, but the Rambling Rosehip Players, Felldoh, Brome, and the freed slaves were now in great trouble. Now the vermin were mad. They charged them and began to attack.<br />What will happen to the Rambling Rosehip Players and the others? When will Martin and his friends arrive with his army?<br />This book was just so great!

As I said in the title place, the first and second book of the Dragon King Trilogy was better; they both had excitement and action. The third was good too, but didn't have much action in it. I like books with adventure in it so that might be the reason I didn't give this book 5 stars. But I still enjoyed it. To enjoy this book properly, I think it is better to read, &quot;In the Hall of the Dragon King&quot; and &quot;Warlords of Nin&quot; first.<br />Quentin is now the Dragon King. He has 3 kids,two girls and a boy. His wife Bria is now the Queen. Mesandor had enjoyed peace for a long time. With his legendary sword, Shaligkeer the Shining Sword (I forgot to tell about it in my &quot;Warlords of Nin&quot; review. &quot;Warlords of Nin&quot; is the second book.), which was made from the precious stone called lathrinil.<br />Quentin soon faces a severe test as his son is kidnapped, his most trusted couselor, Duwin the Holy Hermit, is killed, and when he hears that his archenemy Nimrood the Necromancer had returned. (I was so shocked at the part where Durwin died!)Quentin is filled with grief and frustration that he does not know what he is doing. He murdurs one of the kidnappers mercilessly and loses his great sword, the Shaligkeer. King Quentin loses, as it seems to him, everything he holds dear and plunges into despair. It does not help that one of his lords, Lord Ameronis was full of ambition and leaped at the chance to become King. Soon Mesander fights with one of his lords and the whole land is thrown into turmoil as the common people and also the knights, lords, and nobles of the King, hears rumores that Quentin had lost his sword and that it was because he followed the Most High God that he was punished by other gods.<br />What will happen to King Quentin? What did it mean that Nimrood the Necromancer, assumed dead, came back?<br />Quentin learns a valuable lesson in this book, that when it seems that God was not with you, it was because you had drawn away from Him. Not because He had left you.<br />This book was interesting and at the same time, some parts were exciting. Especially the part where Quentin's son is kidnapped and the last part. I can't tell you how the last part is or it'll be telling the whole story. :) I suggest that you would read this because it would finish the Dragon King Trilogy and also because this book is a good book.m Him.

A whole village is scared for some reason and the Wolf Star was growing bigger and bigger every day. But Quentin and Toli trusts in the Most High and returns to Askelon where they meet their good friend Durwin, the hermit and also meet King Eskevar. Quentin quickly knows that something was wrong with the King, the King had grown pale and his face was gaunt. In other words, the King was deathly ill. He knew that someting was amiss in Mesandor.<br />Meanwhile, Theido and Ronsard, the two brave knights, (Ronsard is my favorite character!) had been sent out from King Eskevar to sort of scout the land. They realize that something was wrong, just like the King had said. Whole villages had been burnt, there was nothing but a enormous black spot on the ground. As they travel on, they see a nearly dead person in one of the burnt villages. They learn little from him, but he tells them that the enemy's name was Nin the Destroyer before he dies. Theido and Ronsard then returns to Askelon.<br />Quentin and Toli had been also searching for any signs of the enemy. They meet Esme, a rather fierce girl who was secretly a princess. On their way back to Askelon, they see the village called Illem burning. They quickly ride to Illem and meet the villagers running in terror. They are quickly surrounded by many soldiers of one of the warlords of Nin. Toli and Esme escapes but Quentin is captured.<br />Will Quentin escape?

The knight tells him to go to a hermit named Durwin and to give the message without stopping. So, mounted on Ronsard's horse Balder, Quentin rides to Durwin's house. He meets Durwin and also Durwin's friend, Theido. Theido and Quentin rides to Askelon where the Queen was, but they are caught by the crafty coward, Prince Jaspin. The Prince is the King's brother and he wants to have the crown. Quentin escapes and goes to the Queen. The message he gave was that King Eskevar had been captured by the evil necromancer, Nimrood. Then, the Queen, Durwin, and Quentin meets Theido. He had escaped and together they ride to save the King. Quentin learns of a new God, the Most High and he turns away from Ariel and the other gods to worship the true one God. Durwin teaches him more about God on the way.<br />Can they rescue the King from Nimrood? Can they win the battle with Prince Jaspin's 100,000 men with their 10,000?<br /><br />This is a wonderful Christian fantasy. The next one, \\"The Warlords of Nin\\" is my favorite in the Dragon King Trilogy.	2002-03-09

Saddle up for great riding-with the girls of Pine Hollow! This book is just great and once you read this book, you'll want to read the other books in the Saddle Club series!<br />12-year-olds Carole Hanson and Stevie Lake have been the best of friends ever since they met at Pine Hollow Stables where they and other girls take riding classes. Carole Hanson is a girl who had been raised in the Marine Corps and she just loves horses! Stevie Lake comes from a wealthy family but is not in the least spoiled. She just loves practical jokes and of course, she loves horses too! So when snobby-looking, straight-A student, Lisa Atwood comes to Pine Hollow in fancy riding gear, they aren't really sure that Lisa will fit in. Lisa is not really spoilt but her worrying mother always tries to make her into a 'young lady'. Mrs. Atwood thinks that every 'young lady' needs to know how to ride, but Lisa isn't really crazy about riding and horses.....yet.And things don't get any better when Stevie plays a rather mean joke on Lisa, calling it as 'one of the traditions' of Pine Hollow. Lisa, in return, plays an equally rather mean joke on Stevie and they become more like enemies instead of friends.<br />Lisa soon shows herself to be a quick learner and she finds out that she actually likes horses and riding. But she is still friendless..until Carole invites her to come to her favorite ice cream shop. Soon, Stevie, Carole, and Lisa becomes fast friends.<br />They start making plans for the MTO, the long-awaited Mountain Trail Overnight campout for the students of Pine Hollow. But, things aren't looking good when Stevie's parents tells her that unless she improves her grades, they won't pay for it. And Lisa doesn't really think that her mother will let her go. Stevie gets this idea to make money for her own, her parents told her that THEY won't pay for it. Lisa has no solution but she decides to just wait and see what happens.

This book has the same pattern like the other Redwall series: A hero is found out from Salamandastron or Redwall, they go on a quest with riddles, some enemy turns up to capture Salamandastron or Redwall, ... and there's the last battle where things look hopeless ... . Still, this book was really fun,and in my opinion, it's the best book in the Redwall series I have read so far! My favorite animals are always the hares and the otters. They are so funny and so....heroic. The hares' way of speaking are really funny, it's an old English way of speaking. Otters are always referring some things with water and ships.  Somehow, mice just don't make good heroes. I think otters and badgers are much better heroes than mice.<br />I strongly recommend you to read it. Happy Reading!	2002-01-25

The evil ferret, Swartt Sixclaw has made a lifelong enemy, the legendary badger, Sunflash the Mace. Swartt had treated the young badger so bad that Sunflash and Swartt had become sworn enemies against each other when Sunflash had escaped with the help of the noble and wise kestrel, Skarlath. Swartt goes to the south to meet the fat warlord, Bowel. There, Swartt cleverly poisons Bowel, taking over the horde of the true Warlord. Swartt goes,then, to kill Sunflash.<br />Meanwhile, Sunflash had made lots of friends by doing justice to those who were tormented by bigger animals. His fame spread across the land as animals were freed from the evil vermin. Skarlath scouted the land, telling Sunglash of Swartt's moves. Sunflash goes to Salamandastron to claim his rightful identity: he was the son of Boar the Fighter and Bella of Brockhall.<br />Swartt's wife gives birth to a son but dies doing so. Swartt, showing no emotions for his dead wife , gives the son to an old nursemaid. During a battle with the inhabitants of Redwall, he leaves the son on the ground, leaving him for dead. The kind animals of Redwall takes him in, naming him Veil. Veil grows up to become bad and is cast out after he had committed an unforgivable crime: trying to poison the Friar.<br />Sunflash had returned to his home. He launches many attacks on Swartt's horde and wins again and again,but does not make any huge dent on the six-clawed ferret's enormous horde of vermins.<br />And the battle goes on as Swartt nearly kills Sunflash.<br />What would happen to Sunflash and Swartt? Would Veil chose to join his father's side to kill the people of Redwall and Salamandastron? Read this book to find out, though I must warn you that you just MIGHT be dissappointed.<br />The reason I put 4 stars was because the title did not match the book's story at all! Only the last part had talked about Veil, so the title shouldn't have really been &quot;Te Outcast of Redwall&quot;.

This book was many short stories in it; most of the stories are about Mowgli and a few of them are about other animals and their adventures. My favorite one was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.<br />Since this book is mostly about Mowgli, I should say something about it. Mowgli is a boy who was adopted by wolves and grew up to live with them all his life. He can speak their language and they love him. But Mowgli has one enemy, a lame tiger named Shere Kan. The Mother wolf had saved Mowgli from the evil tiger so Shere Kan hates him. Of course, there's a battle at the end. It is a pretty interesting story or, more like, pretty interesting stories.<br />My favorite story, like I said before, was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. Rikki, the mongoose who is washed out by a heavy rain and is found by a human boy named Teddy.  Rikki is cared for and soon becomes healthy and fit again. One day, Rikki goes out to the large and rather uncultivated garden when he hears two birds chirping sadly. Rikki asks what had happened and one of the birds, named Darzee, tells him that one of their eggs had fallen out and was eaten by the black cobra Nag. At that moment, Nag comes out and tries to kill Rikki by making him pay attention to him while Nag혖fs wife, Nagaina, creeps up on Rikki. At the last moment, Rikki notices that Nagaina is behind him and he runs away.<br />After that incident, Rikki vows to kill the two evil cobras. One day, Rikki overhears Nag and Nagaina discussing on how to kill him. They plan to break into the house, kill the humans with their deadly bite, and then, kill Rikki. Rikki quickly runs back to the house and waits till nightfall. Soon, he hears a drainpipe rattling and sees Nag혖fs hooded head creeping towards him with Nagaina right behind him. Rikki hides and waits till Nag comes out. When Nag turns his head towards the beds, Rikki pounces and bites Nag혖fs head. Rikki is nearly killed then, but the master of the house, Teddy혖fs father, wakes up from all the noise and shoots Nag.<br />Nagaina, seeing all this, slinks back to her nest. While Rikki regains his strength, he finds out that Nagaina has eggs in her nest and starts searching for her with the aid of Darzee혖fs wife. When Rikki finds her, Darzee혖fs wife pretends that her wing is broken and hops around Nagaina. Nagaina moves to kill Darzee혖fs wife when Rikki runs from behind and takes one of the eggs away. Nagaina turns and tries to strike out at Rikki but Rikki breaks all of the eggs but keeps only one egg unbroken. Rikki threatens Nagaina to get away and Nagaina obeys him. As soon as Nagaina moved away, Rikki breaks the last of the eggs. Rikki and Nagaina battle, both finally falling into Nag and Nagaina혖fs hole.<br />Will Rikki win? Will he survive Nagaina's terrible strenght? If Nagaina wins and is still alive, would she marry again with another black cobra and lay eggs? You'll have to read the book to find out.....<br />This story was sooo fun and exciting. That is mainly my reason for liking this story better than the others.

This time, Katy is not staying at her beloved home in the countryside like she does while staying sick in the first book, &quot;What Katy Did&quot;, but instead, she goes to a boarding school in East Coast with her sister Clover. This happens when Cousin Olivia (or Mrs. Page. She is Katy's cousin) says that Katy is solemn and does not &quot;bubble over&quot; like Cousin Olivia's daughter, Lilly, and she tells Katy's father about this untrue judgement. Her father, worried, sends Katy and Clover away to a boarding school on the East Coast.<br />Dr. Carr (Katy's father) and the two very sad sisters, go off together to the train which would take them to Hillsover, the name of the boarding school. At the train, Katy, Clover, and Dr. Carr meets Mr. and Mrs. Page and the &quot;bubbly&quot; Lilly. Lilly is very snobbish and spoiled but the two Carr sisters listens to Lilly's opinion about Hillsover, and they decide that they half like and half dislike it.<br />After some time of traveling, Katy, Clover, Lilly, and Dr. Carr reach Hillsover. Katy and Clover are allowed to spend one night with Dr. Carr in another Hotel and after they meet a very strange but interesting girl called Rosy Red, they start thinking that Hillsover will be pretty interesting after all. But they are horrified that they have to share a washroom with other girls and Dr. Carr, noting this, buys a washroom for them, very much relieving the sisters' terror. They meet all the girls and starts getting used to the flow of Hillsover. All the girls dislike Miss Jane, a missionary's apprentice, who has a verry sharp tongue and makes many strict rules, and another teacher, Miss Nipson, who does not have a good judgement over the girls. But the students are very respectful and rather afraid of another teacher, named Miss Florence.<br />As the days go by, Katy decides to make a society called S.S.U.C., which stands for &quot;Society for the Suppresion of Unladylike Conduct&quot; because the girls are flirting around with the boys in another house. The girls who joins has to be determined to be ladylike but Lilly does not join the society,<br />calling it &quot;stupid&quot;. This society makes a fun game called WORD AND QUESTION. You have to write down a word and a question and the leader, who is Katy, puts it in a basket, shakes it, and the other players take out a paper. The players has to write a poem answering the question and using a word. This is a very fun part to read.<br />After a year, Katy and Clover goes back to their home but has to endure the slowness of the canal. They come back, happy and safe, and they find that their room had been decorated beautifully. It's a very delightful part.<br />This book is very interesting. Though I still like this book, I wonder what happened to Clarence, a boyfriend of Clover's. Clover made friends with him at Mr. and Mrs. Page's house during Autumn Vacation, but the book doesn't say much about after the Vacation, except a letter from him.

Cousin Helen makes Katy into a new person after this conversation and Katy becomes pretty, ladylike, helpful, happy,very responsible, and patient. But one day, Aunt Izzie dies from a sudden fever and Katy almost goes back to her former being but remembers Cousin Helen's teaching and asks if she can become a housekeeper for Aunt Izzie.

She tells her family about this and when the day comes, her family prepares a suprise: Cousin Helen!

I got this book for my birthday and when I read the first page, I knew that this book was going to be one of my favorites. It's so fun,exciting,and has non-stop action!!! It's about a badgermaid called Mara and she's tired of being cooped up in Salamandastron(Salamandastron is a mountain). She was adopted by Lord Urthstripe,the badger who rules Salamandastron. Mara and her hare friend, Pikkle Ffolger runs away from the mountain. Then, an evil weasel assasin named Ferahgo attacks the mountain because (of course) he wants it and the badger treasure he heard of. He's so EVIL!! This is a book you'll just HAVE to read!! You'll really love it! It's just perfect!	2001-08-28
