US	22127727	R1N2T3Y8JM6EMA	0886777992	359194039	This Alien Shore	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Enjoyable sci-fi	I hadn't realized I'd read anything by Friedman before, until I glanced inside the cover and saw Black Sun Rising. This led me to anticipate a good read, an expectation that was not disappointed. The science is explained in layman's terms, including the computer hacking that is central to the book's plot of a major virus infecting (and killing) the Guild Pilots who provide the only means of transport between the far flung human worlds and space stations. While I was not all that fond of the lead female character (Jamisia), she was not annoyingly perfect and jarring like many female-written female leads are. However, I found the male characters (particularly Masada and Phoenix) to be a bit more interesting. The ending is fitting, and not quite what I expected. The only real quibble I had with the novel is that it ends rather abruptly, without really showing Jamisia except as an afterthought mentioned by another character. After the intensity of her climatic scene, it was a bit of a disappointment for her to just disappear off-camera and her fate be really told in passing in another character's final scene.	2005-08-24

It's science fantasy and was very slow going, as the first section seems as much \\"information dump\\" as actual story. The heroine, a pre-teen girl, isn't terribly likable in the first section either, which made me not want to finish the book. However, I shouldered onward and it improved greatly in the second section. Definately a good book for young boys, if they can manage to tolerate part one.<br />Ironically, in defense of the book, I handed it to my 9-year-old the morning after I finished it. When I got home from work that night, he was halfway into part two! So obviously from a little boy's perspective, part one wasn't so bad (or maybe it was tedious enough that he skimmed it to get to the good parts?).<br />From my reading aspect, I don't mind info dumps if they're blended with a bit of action - or some character development. This book just didn't seem to cut it on either point with me. Worth the read for a borrowed library book - but not a book I will pay for to add to my boys' growing library.	2004-06-03

The book blurb says that two of the fairy tales are retellings and two are \\"new\\", but I found all of them to feel like retellings of stories I'd already heard. I didn't care for the book, but the kidlet loved it. He just likes McKinley, I think.	2004-04-15

He'll enjoy the mixture of horses and King Arthur, I think. Probably the only McCaffrey I ever intend to voluntarily give him. If he finds the rest of those books, he'll do it of his own accord.

She eventually meets a young actor, has the usual disastrous romance, then leaves to start her own shop in another town.

The tale of a fictional woman living at the French Court during the 17th century reign of Henry II. It is a very slow read at first, but then the pace picks up. Many real historical figures make an appearance, either in person or in gossip. A nice historical romance thus far, with plenty of detailed court intrigues. While the main character (and her mother) are fictional, the rest of the characters are not (including the Prince of Cleves himself, who never married in real life).  Keeping in mind the period this was written, it's quite good.  But the constant referring to characters by titles/surnames rather than given names got very old, and I found Madame de Cleves too hypocritical to like the character.	2004-04-15

I liked the story, even if I had figured out the \\"whodunit\\" of the lightweight mystery that supplies the subplot of the book (the main plot, of course, is still Merry getting pregnant). I can't complain, since Merry's remaining rather attached to my two favorite males in her little harem, although from the looks of the conclusion, book 3 will only get more complicated on the interpersonal dynamics between Merry and the men. Enjoyable dark fantasy-erotica. I've read most of the Anita Blake series. I've burned out on \\"Super Anita\\", so Merry is a bit of a change. At least she's honest about her harem, rather than swearing up and down she's \\"Saint Anita\\" and changing her mind midway to become \\"Courtesan Anita\\". I like Merry - she's fun and irreverant.	2004-04-15

The Expendables series (of which Hunted is midway in the series) is absolutely joyful to read, with a delicious sense of humor embedded in every chapter.<br />The main character (Edward) is not your typical hero, and the insect-like aliens don't seem unlikely.  I certainly enjoyed Edward's open minded attitude and even affection towards his adopted race, even though he doesn't feel he is &quot;smart&quot; enough to look after them.  <br />This was a delightful surprise to find and read.  You do not have to worry about Garner slapping you with too much technology and not enough characterization and plot.	2004-04-15

But it actually was a bit interesting, probably because I liked the deeper look into lycanthrope psychology and sociology. I was rather suprised with the Richard/Jean-Claude angst-fest to go forth and enjoy the ending as well, with Anita's crisis of faith.	2004-04-15

It was a rather good read, with a few too many subplots at times. The heroine still seems believable, getting herself in over her head and having to use her wits and pure luck to get herself back out of it. This book of the series concentrates on the first true fae seen (a pair of fairy siblings and a nursery boggle) as well as vampires and a few murders outside of St. Louis instead of the city itself. It also starts to emphasize that Anita isn't truly a cop, although she works for the Regional Preternatural Investigation Team as a consultant. I think BB is setting up a bit more of the future books than some of its predecessors have done.	2004-04-15

It's a good tale, with Jubal probably the most well-rounded character of the huge cast. I love his ramblings on religion, especially when he declares that he figures he'll get to the end and figure out that Mumbo Jumbo of the Congo was the correct deity after all. Mild male chauvanism just fits the nature of the tale (and the time period it was written).	2004-04-15

The story is detailed and intense, in true Bishop fashion, and I am itching to lay hands on the next two books. As usual, she presents the reader with a varied cast of characters, each with their own set of flaws and quirks, and makes you feel for each one. The Fae in the story are as arrogant as most tales paint them, although not all of them fit the stereotype. The Witches (wiccanfae) and their secrets are well thought out and very believable. Then there's the villain, of course. What story with witches can be without the Witch's Hammer and his Inquisitors? I enjoyed how the author gave her lead villain a very detailed background, with plenty of fuel for his vendettas, so that he is very realistic. A part of me *almost* wanted to sympathize with him, and wondered if he might find redemption at some point. I have quite fallen for Morag, Death's Mistress, so I wonder if I should worry about my favorite character having such a dour outlook? Perhaps I just like finding the heroine of a story isn't the obvious choice... Around here, Bishop's books aren't in any of the libraries, which is sad. This series is an excellent addition to her bibliography, with a lighter feel than her Dark Jewels books. I'd rate this book for 10 stars out of 5 if I could.	2004-04-15

However, while overall I was pleased with the story, it had too many plot holes, and a villain with no redeeming qualities. By the time I was done, I almost felt I was reading a fairy tale along the lines of The Princess Bride or similar. The female lead characters (two of them) are strong and well-written, continuing well from their dominant parts in the previous books. However, the two male lead characters are just around to grunt and fling themselves in front of all female characters so they aren't harmed. That was very disappointing, since the last book was not so off-balance. I felt like Patterson was trying to meet a certain page count and nothing more, so the plot generally felt unfinished, as if there should have been at least another hundred pages to fill everything out. As much as I *wanted* to like this book (I read it in 3 hours), I have to flunk it.	2004-04-15

A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville.	2004-04-15

Four women (a homicide detective, a medical examiner, a reporter, and an assistant district attorney) form the Women's Murder club to pool resources to try to stop a serial killer who targets brides and grooms. The murder portion of story is good, typical Patterson, with one too many twists at the end for my taste. However, he should be soundly beaten for some of the &quot;characterizations&quot; he does of the female characters. I don't normally get annoyed by gender stereotypes, but if those women don't quit slobbering all over each other, I don't know if I'll be able to stomach the second book of the series.	2004-04-15

The real disappointment of the book was the novella bit in it, &quot;If This Goes On---&quot;. It had terrific buildup, a good protagonists, then fell flat on its face with a mundane and boring ending.

However, the &quot;stories&quot; that Lazarus Long was telling about his past life were quite interesting. My favorite is probably the original &quot;Dora&quot; tale of the homesteading life.

Without giving away too much, the love triangle between Anita, Jean-Claude, and her werewolf boyfriend Richard comes to a head in this novel in more ways than one. Needless to say, don't expect the triangle to die out easily. This one seemed to enjoy the gore a little TOO much, and shows a lot of character flaws in Anita, in my opinion. The woman is starting to annoy me as a lead character, but I'm reading onwards because I like the rest of the cast thus far.	2004-04-15

As much as I like seeing more of lycantropes *other* than werewolves, the fact that Anita is the shining hero for them too just annoyed me to no end. 5 stars of 5 for all characters except Anita, 3 stars of 5 for having to put up with the Superwoman Lead Character. <br />As much as I like the series, Anita Blake is the most annoying, superwoman, I can outdo everyone around me, hypocritical, hyper-feminist character I've ever had the displeasure to read. I was starting to root for the bad guys to take her out. However, I kept reading because I really like Jean-Claude, Edward, Larry, Dolph, Jason, Stephen, and other supporting characters, and wonder about what happens to them, even if they don't have enough sense to tip Anita in the nearest tar pit and move on with their lives. If the series gets any more Anita-Worshipping, I may have to periodically gag in between chapters. The friend who got me started warns me that it does, and that after the next two novels, I should give up rather than continue to read the author's worship of Anita. <br />As you can tell, there are NO strong female characters allowed in these books, other than Anita herself. Any female who seems to be a dominant character soon meets an unfortunate demise or fate worse than death, usually at Anita's hands because of course, she's the Ultimate Evil of the novel. The only recurring female supporting character is Ronni, Anita's best friend. Despite initial promise in the early books, Ronnie is little more than a puppet for her so-called best friend to dangle about when she needs to have girl-talks. And the men all seem to be joining Anita's harem, which is annoying, since she's a rather hypocritical wench when it comes to the bedroom. <br />*bah* If my friend hadn't promised me that the book after the next is an Edward centered novel, I'd give up on this serieswhile I was ahead. Edward, for those who haven't read it, is a sociopathic assassin. Scary that he's more truly heroic as a character than Anita Blake, isn't it? ;-)	2004-04-15

The story is very slow to open, with the Crusade portions almost enough to make me abandon the book entirely. Once Hugh got back to France, things rolled a little easier storywise. Unfortunately, it has more of a fairy tale feel than historical fiction/thriller, and some of the subplots were completely beyond your normal &quot;suspension of belief&quot;. If you're a stickler for accuracy in historicals, this one will probably grate on your nerves. Logic is tossed out the window if it serves the authors' purposes. It's not the worst book I've read this year, but it isn't the best either.	2004-04-15

However, I slogged through and found that Part Two was much lovelier and worth the wait. Part Three was good, but not the rousing conclusion that Part Three merited.

Hamilton, although she was indicating the vampire series, not the Shakespeare one. However, in reading a bio on the author, I discovered she now lives in my hometown, so figured I'd give her Arkansas based series a try first. The heroine, Lily, shows some signs of potential &quot;Kick Arse Heroine Whom No One Can Defeat&quot; syndrome, which I hope is only my wariness from the hugely disappointing Anita Blake books. However, Lily does frequently fall flat on her face, and perhaps the indications of gathering a harem will be banished in other books. As for the story, it is a nice little murder mystery, if a little too-pat and a bit unsatisfactory on the actual Whodunit. I will try the next to see if she irons out the kinks (one of which is a major geographic goof!).	2004-04-15
