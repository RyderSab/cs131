However the 4-day workshop is excellent. Taking the course in 1981 forever changed my life. Before my introduction to the Silva Method I was skeptical if I could not see, feel, taste or touch something. I saw only the physical world and thought the way to understand and harness it was through science and technology.<br />The experiences of a fellow therapist and a psychologist I worked with, who I respected, closed my tiny materialistic window and opened a vast door to the invisible world of energy and spirit.  They said they had each learned to diagnose and heal three people knowing only their names, age and location. Steeped in the medical model for healing I suspected my friends had been duped and thought about taking the course to expose the charlatans. Especially since the Silva training had a money back guarantee.<br />When I heard a 4-day Silva course was being offered locally, I signed up. The introductory lecture was about Jose Silva, the founder, and outlined the almost four decades of research and development of The Silva Mind Control Method.<br />The instructor said the five senses-touch, taste, smell, hearing and sight are only a part of the senses we are born with. He said the exercises would help us learn to use more of our minds and use it in a special way to prevent illness, improve our health, solve everyday problems, learn more easily, strengthen our imagination, deepen our spiritual awareness and tap into Higher Intelligence. He said that meditation takes place when we are in the Alpha Brain State and that an electroencephalograph (EEG) can measure it.  The brain rhythms of the Alpha Brain State are about seven to fourteen cycles per second (CPS) and we are in this energy state when we first go to sleep and when we dream. Meditation is going into Alpha Brain State without losing awareness.<br />To become more relaxed and meditative we were told to \\"Project ourselves mentally to our ideal place of relaxation.\\" I become more peaceful as I pictured my favorite bubbly mountain steam in North Georgia. We did two countdowns to control the depth of our meditation/relaxation and one to return to consciousness.<br />While in our meditative states we practiced positive affirmations and the power of visualization. For example we visualized an apple on a large movie screen about six feet in front of us. We studied the details of the apple-the color, smell, touch, and taste. At first I had difficulty as my mind wandered but the instructor reassured us that our concentration would improve as we trained our minds to focus.<br />We were also instructed to practice projecting ourselves in and around different forms from the inanimate, plant, animal and human kingdoms. We would look at the texture, form, light, odor, color, temperature, solidity and abnormalities.<br />Each day I found myself going to deeper levels of relaxation while fully conscious.  My visualizations became so real on the third day I had a moment when I was unable to tell if the leaf I was viewing belonged to the external or my internal world. It was both scary and a profound moment of grace.<br />The meditation and continuous visualization culminated in our creating an internal healing laboratory with two spiritual assistants to help diagnose and heal the subjects with physical or emotional problems. When the subject's name, age and location was mentioned we were told an image would miraculously appear on our inner visual screen and their ailments would make themselves known via visual, auditory and kinesthetic means.  I was skeptical.<br />I felt sure my partner would not be able to tell what was wrong with my girlfriend and two relatives. I was even more certain I would not be able to diagnose the three people my partner knew. I was wrong; we all did. And I learned that there is another reality, and that we have capabilities not taught in our schools. It was both alarming and ecstatic.<br />Needless tosay I did not ask for my money back after the Silva workshop. In fact I took the course again twelve months later. I was delighted to learn that Silva graduates pay a minimal tuition fee or do not pay again.<br />The Silva course improved my self-esteem, made me more optimistic and gave me confidence in my intuitive abilities.

I chose Don Dinkmeyer and Gary McKay's three-day workshop called Systematic Training for Effective Parenting (STEP). Since I had not been a parent but I had been a child I wondered what else there was besides punishment, reward, spanking, lectures and threats.<br />I was surprised to learn that giving a choice such as a natural or a logical consequence is more effective than reward and punishment. That punishment invites resistance and prevents the child from learning to make decisions, makes the parent responsible for their child's behavior and suggests that acceptable behavior is expected only around authority figures.<br />A memory from my childhood made me think using choices made sense. When my mother took me to the dentist when I was seven I cried and refused to open my mouth. The dentist said sternly, \\"Niki, you have a choice-if you cooperate your mother can stay otherwise she'll have to wait outside.\\" I immediately stopped crying and opened my mouth.<br />Other STEP recommendations include:<br />Provide a logical consequence. For example if the child's shoes are soiling the couch give them a choice between sitting on the couch properly or sitting on the floor.<br />Provide a natural consequence. For example allow the child to go hungry if they do not eat.<br />Allow the child to learn from their mistake and be responsible for their actions. This helps the parent avoid the \\"bad guy\\" role.<br />Encourage the child to take responsibility for choices instead of pitying, shaming or overprotecting.<br />Ask the child what they think is fair. A consequence is more effective if the child sees it as logical and it fits the crime.<br />Talk less and act more when using natural or logical consequences.<br />A logical consequence implies no moral judgment. Punishment tells the child they are bad and ignores their natural goodness, desire to cooperate, inherent curiosity and the need to feel a part of the family.<br />Treat the child with dignity by separating the deed from the doer.<br />Instead of using praise where the child's worth depends on their ability to perform use encouragement as it focuses on effort not results.<br />Set realistic standards and focus on strengths instead of demanding perfection.<br />Stop criticism and encourage positive attempts. Use your feelings and reactions about a child's behavior to point to the purpose of the child's behavior.<br />Ignore attention-seeking behavior, withdraw from power conflicts, avoid retaliation, and hurt.<br />Learn to listen to the child's thoughts and feelings. When the child is \\"heard\\" they can change how they feel and act. Use \\"I-messages\\" not \\"you-messages\\" as they express feelings without blame.<br />When I used STEP's positive approach in individual, family and group counseling the families parenting skills and self esteem improved. The parents were surprised at their children's insight and wisdom. I found that STEP's principles really do provide information and techniques to help parents become more knowledgeable, confident and successful. As Dinkmeyer points out living respectfully with others is more effective than gaining control via a pecking order.<br />The STEP course not only made me a better therapist but it introduced me to a more positive and respectful way to relate to all people.and the need to feel a part of the family.<br />Treat the child with dignity by separating the deed from the doer.<br />Instead of using praise where the child's worth depends on their ability to perform use encouragement as it focuses on effort not results.<br />Set realistic standards and focus on strengths instead of demanding perfection.<br />Stop criticism and encourage positive attempts.

As a child mental health counselor for 20 years and an unwanted child myself I am particularly interested in what Brook has to say. Some mothers have difficulty recognizing they have a problem and never recover from their negative feelings and depression. They blame the child. A mother who rejects and is overly critical of one or more of her children (who has the \\"Bad Mummy Syndrome\\") is a lot more prevalent in our culture than people admit. It also happens in animals. Apart from PPD at first, there is no mental health diagnosis or specific treatment for a mother who continues to reject her child. I applaud Brooke for bringing awareness to a problem that so many mothers have been afraid to discuss.	2005-05-27

Her heartbreaking life story shows that forgiveness is not a single act but a life work that has many layers and many seasons.<br />In sharing her recovery Richards offers a healing blueprint for physical and emotional abuse, a mother's lifelong rejection, and being viewed as an enemy by siblings. She shows how to move from her personal betrayal to the larger collective betrayal we all face.<br />She illustrates how forced forgiveness and forgiveness in order to heal is shallow and does not last. We need to heal first in order to forgive. Forgiveness without healing is from a position of weakness. She says forgiveness is not a choice but a process that results from healing. Only when we work towards healing does forgiveness become a realistic goal.<br />Richards chose to stop seeing her mother and take care of herself when her mother continued to heap contempt on her and be oblivious to her feelings.  She said the act of not forgiving her mother liberated her from her abuse and set her free to forgive. She stated, \\"I never would have been able to forgive my mother if I still had a relationship with her.\\"<br />Her story shows how healing comes with self-preservation and self-compassion when we feel safe to acknowledge and talk about our injuries and begin to deal with the trauma. Richards said, \\"Each time I thought I had finished mourning, another wave of heart breaking losses emerged. However as I peeled away each layer of pain, I grew stronger.\\"	2005-05-27

Each character reminded me of aspects of myself and helped me understand others and myself better.<br /><br />From Heather, the nurse, I learned we sometimes see the light and take great care of others but not ourselves.<br /><br />From Stephen I learned we can touch the hearts and minds of others in spite of being imprisoned in a helpless body and unable to speak.<br /><br />From Heather and Stephen's love for each other I learned the importance of being true to ourselves, that secrets can make us sick and the importance of seeking people who are honest with themselves.<br /><br />From Mrs. Grochowski I learned the power of being aware and how when we value looking good and working hard at being nice things don't work out so nicely.<br /><br />From Lieutenant Petri I learned that ambition can make us or break us and that there is power in the simplicity that is born out of complexity.<br /><br />From Georgia I learned we can blame our children or hold them responsible for our problems and that being \\"abnormal\\" can be healthy.<br /><br />From Rachel I learned that people who are hate filled tend to become hateful. She shows us the dark side of ourselves and forces us to confront what constitutes evil.<br /><br />From Dr. Kolnietz, the psychiatrist, I learned the virtue of being patient with ambiguity, how being emotionally unconscious can hurt us and how difficult it is to let go of hate as it energizes us and feeds on itself.<br /><br />Reading this book made me feel richer and wiser and in awe of life's paradoxes and the great mystery behind the material world.	2005-03-31

His delightful witty book stimulates curiosity and enthusiasm about the Earth's history via geology, chemistry, paleontology, astronomy,  and particle physics. It is fascinating to learn how and when the universe and earth was formed, the composition of the universe, the reasons the Earth is suitable for life, about the miracle we call life and the results of the Earth's five major extinction periods.<br /><br />Bryson's book was not only informative but helped me see the Earth and humankind's history in a new way. Some of the highlights include:<br /><br />Life on Earth has been around 3.8 billion years. Of the billions of species that have existed before humankind 99.9% are extinct. The average species lasted 4 million years.<br /><br />Yellowstone is America's restless supervolcano and it is due for another eruption. The power of a supervolcano is 1,000 times greater than an \\"ordinary\\" volcano as it explodes in a single mighty rupture. The explosion would be beyond the scale of anything known to humans.<br /><br />Iridium deposits show that something cataclysmic happened sixty-five million years ago. Most geologists now agree that the deep crater under Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula was the impact site of the meteor that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and effected the climate for 10,000 years.<br /><br />If the dinosaurs had not been wiped out, \\"you might well be six inches long, with whiskers and a tail, and reading this (book) in a burrow.\\"<br /><br />The moon was created 4.5 billion years ago when an objet slammed into the Earth.<br /><br />Because antibiotics don't generate wealth like other medications the Pharmaceutical Industry has not given us an entirely new antibiotic since the 1970s.<br /><br />There was no summer worldwide in 1815 when the Tambara volcano in Indonesia exploded.

The obliteration of the sacred feminine resulted in a \\"life out of balance\\" and disrespect for Mother Earth. Based on the Coptic and Dead Sea Scrolls the Bible is a product of men with a political agenda. The Holy Grail is an ancient symbol for the sacred feminine and represents a woman. And that Jesus was a mortal prophet who married Mary Magdalene and had children.<br /><br />Although the suspense is a page-turner Brown's remarkable research would have been better served by a slower paced novel with more developed characters.

Although the Gnostic Gospels were compiled in 140 A.D., scholars say their traditions may be older than the gospels in the New Testament.<br /><br />It was interesting to read the manuscript with 118 sayings of Christ gathered by St. Thomas known as the Gospel of St. Thomas. Although many of Christ's sayings are already in the New Testament there is one big difference: Jesus emphasizes salvation through self-knowledge and faith. Salvation through self-knowledge and faith makes more sense to me as salvation without self-knowledge would make us vulnerable to manipulation while salvation without faith could lead grandiosity and isolation.<br /><br /> \\"The Gnostic Gospels\\" invites the reader to deal with the old controversy-was the Bible divinely inspired or did it evolve at the hands of churchmen with various political, social and religious purposes? Why is the Gospel of St. Thomas not included, what constitutes being \\"divinely inspired\\" and is the Bible the only book God has written through humankind?<br /><br />Solomon Schepps wrote in \\"The Lost Books of the Bible\\" that the official Biblical text was completed by two major counsels, in North Africa in Hippo (Augustine Bishopric) in 393, and in Carthage in 397. He said that there had been great difficulty in choosing the Gospels and after much debate, only four were chosen. The Gospel of St. Thomas was rejected as it opened by saying the he who understands the words of Jesus will be saved which is in direct contradiction to the chosen Gospels and Paul's Epistles, which says he who believes will be saved.  Schepps said all texts not adhering to the official viewpoint of the churchmen were denounced as heretical and destroyed.<br /><br />Pagels' and Schepps' books show what we identify as Christain tradition actually represents a small selection of sources. Thanks to them for the first time we can look at other early Christian writing and determine their value for ourselves.<br /><br />Also of interest is how the Gospel of St. Thomas elaborates on Jesus teachings in the Bible. For example, Jesus said in Luke, \\"For behold, the kingdom of God is within you,\\" indicating to me that heaven is not a place but a state of being. In the Gospel of St. Thomas Jesus goes further and says, \\"See, if the Kingdom is in heaven, then the birds of heaven will be there before you.\\" Also, \\"But the Kingdom is within you and it is outside you. The kingdom of the father is spread over the earth and men do not see it.\\"<br /><br />Jesus' teachings in the Gnostic Gospels and the Bible are similar concerning how we treat our fellow man: Love your neighbor as yourself, judge not, love your enemies, bless them that curse you and turn the other cheek.<br /><br />The Gnostic Gospels makes us question even more how Jesus' message of love and forgiveness has been used to rationalize wars, witch-hunts, murders, and exploitation.we can look at other early Christian writing and determine their value for ourselves.  <br />Also of interest is how the Gospel of St. Thomas elaborates on Jesus teachings in the Bible.

Carnes says sexaholism transcend personality, gender, and socio-economic status. He defines sexual addiction as having a pathological relationship with sex and using it as a mood-altering drug. His descriptions of the symptoms, the three levels of addictions, and the progression through the four-part cycle of preoccupation, ritualization, compulsive sexual behavior and despair are excellent.<br /><br />Carnes also deals with the sex addicts underlying dynamics such as a faulty self-image, and believing that sex is their most important need. Carnes describes how some addicts appear grandiose and full of exaggerated self-importance to create a front of \\"normalcy,\\" and hide their addiction and poor self-esteem. He says the addict's family and friends often become angry and frustrated with the addict's \\"egocentricity\\" and insensitivity to others. Since guilt and remorse cannot be expressed the addict may become progressively more isolated and unreachable as they close off their vulnerability.<br /><br />Carnes states that since the addict feels unloved and unlovable they have little confidence in the love of others and become calculating, manipulative and ruthless. They are purposely unclear about their intentions in relationship and are seductive in their behavior. Addicts also have a high need to control all situations in an effort to guarantee their sexual supply and ensure all possible sexual opportunities.<br /><br />To get help Carnes recommends SA's 12 Step Program. He says the Program helps the addict to, \\"separate themselves as individuals from their addiction which, as a powerful illness, is destroying their lives.  By admitting the addictions power, hope emerges from connecting with others and Higher Power.  The fellowship of the Program surrounds participants with people who have suffered in the same way.  They no longer feel unique.  They trust and are trusted with personal secrets.\\"<br /><br />Carnes says the Program teaches the addict that they do not need the addiction to survive, but will need the Program because of the addictions power.  When the addict recognizes how powerless and unmanageable they are over their addiction, they start to live a life which focuses on human relationships as opposed to sex.<br /><br />Carnes points out how members of the Program continue to learn about the process through teaching others.  He says sex addicts can become responsive and responsible members of the human community./>Carnes says the Program teaches the addict that they do not need the addiction to survive, but will need the Program because of the addictions power.

About what we have faced to build what we have, what we have drawn upon and risked to do, what we have felt, thought, feared and discovered through the events of our lives.\\" And about where the love that has sustained us comes from.<br /><br />Remen shows through her own story living with Crohn's disease how suffering and helplessness helped her to connect more deeply with others and live with an open heart. Her illness included being in a coma after a massive bleed in her mid teens, having her large intestine surgically removed and having to wear an ileostomy, and years of intensive therapy with toxic drugs. She says her experience taught her that at the heart of intimacy is vulnerability. When we see a matching vulnerability in another we know we will not be judged. That we are all more than we know and that wholeness is never lost, it is only forgotten.<br /><br />Her inspiring stories illustrate that the purpose in life is to grow in wisdom and love. How perfection is a booby prize. What is needed is simply to be human. How we sometimes trade wholeness for approval from others. How the way we see another may easily become the way in which we see ourselves. How \\"broken\\" is only a stage in a process. How the healing of suffering is compassion not expertise. How the healing of our woundedness lies in reclaiming our capacity to heal others through touch, forgiveness and acceptance. That anger only becomes a problem when we become wedded to it. How fear of losing things we possess end up possessing us. How the worth of a lifetime is measured more in kindness than in competency. How inner silence reveals insight and truth.

Their agenda is to silence the Bush critics, concoct inflammatory stories, then repeat and embellish them to serve their political goal.<br /><br />Rupert Murdock a billionaire who created a right-wing empire owns Fox News Channel the number one most watched news channel on television. Forbes Magazine ranked him the fourth most powerful man in the world as he owns the largest group of television stations in the U. S. and 130 English speaking newspapers including the London Times and the New York Post. He also owns 20th C Fox, Harper-Collins Publishing, The TV Guide and the Los Angles Dodges. The August Columbia Review wrote in 2002 that Murdock \\"wields his media as an instrument of influence with politics.\\"<br /><br />Another sneaky technique used by the right to spreads lies about an opponent in \\"Push Polling.\\" Lee Atwater, Bush Sr.'s political guru, invented Push Polling. Senator John McCaine may have been defeated through the use of Push Polling in 2000 when unsuspecting voters called and asked if they would vote for him if they knew that he was a cheat and a liar and a fraud, and that he fathered a illegitimate black child.

He entertains a major national audience-over 20 million people a week, whose frustration and anger he mines to share his bigoted and biased positions.<br /><br />Limbaugh is such a joke among the \\"liberals\\" that Franken wrote another amusing satire titled \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\" about American politics and the conservative right including Bush.<br /><br />Limbaugh is in his mid 50s and is a known racist, sexist and hypocrite. He preaches \\"family values\\" although he was married three times, he is big on wars although he avoided the draft and preaches against government handouts although he collected unemployment. He scoffed at drug addicts before going in for detoxification three times for a drug addiction to painkillers. He is being investigated for being a part of an illegal drug ring in Florida. Limbaugh failed to register to vote until he was thirty-five and until recently he was so overweight he needed two airline coach seats.<br /><br />Limbaugh champions unmitigated business development and dismisses efforts to protect the earth. He ridicules and takes outrageous umbrage at imagined groups: environmentalists, drug addicts, liberals, African Americans, American Indians, feminists, the media, people on welfare...the list goes on. He is also known to misstate facts with alarming frequency like claiming that Styrofoam is biodegradable and paper is not. He believes that the planet does not have pollution problems (there is no damage to the ozone layer or global warming or deforestation or overpopulation) and thinks it is a liberal conspiracy to end free enterprise.

Her message was simple-\\"This is the way of peace: Overcome evil with good, falsehood with truth, and hatred with love.\\" Her 28-year pilgrimage started in 1953. She would not tell you her real name this silver-haired lady with penetrating blue eyes \\"Peace Pilgrim\\" is the only name she wished to carry. And she would not tell you the years that she had spent in this world although a friend said she was probably around 80 when she died in a car accident in Indiana in 1981 on her way to a speaking engagement. After walking 25,000 miles, which took her until 1964, she stopped counting the miles. Although she mostly slept under the stars without a sleeping bag she never had another headache or pain or cold once she started her pilgrimage. Carrying in her tunic pockets her only worldly possessions: a comb, a folding toothbrush, a ball point pen, her current correspondence she vowed, \\"I shall remain a wanderer until mankind has learned the way of peace, walking until given shelter and fasting until given food.\\" She talked with people on dusty roads and city streets, in churches, colleges, to civic groups, on TV and radio discussing peace within and without.<br />Her pilgrimage covered the entire peace picture: peace among nations, groups, individuals, and inner peace-because that is where peace begins. She believed that world peace would come when enough people attain inner peace.<br />Since many of us are in deep despair about the human cost of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan the life and teachings of Peace Pilgrim are particularly compelling right now. The press continues to report the grim tally of American soldiers killed in action in Iraq-922 killed and 5,457 wounded. But there are figures neither the Pentagon nor the press talks about-the more than 11,000 American soldiers that came home disabled injured and sick in what the Pentagon considers non-combat circumstances. Nor do we know the number of Iraqi and Afghanistan soldiers and civilians deaths and wounded.<br />Peace said, \\"All present wars must cease-we need to find a way to lay down our arms together. We need to set up a mechanism to avoid physical violence in the world.\\" We people of the world need to learn to put the welfare of the whole family above the welfare of any group. The means determines the end-only a good means can really attain a good end. Real peace is more than the absence of war: it is the absence of the cause of the war. Have as your objective the resolving of conflict not the gaining of advantage and live to give instead of get.<br />Peace said the cause of all difficulties is immaturity. If we were mature, war would not be possible and peace would be assured. In our immaturity we do not know the laws of the universe, and we think evil can be overcome by more evil. One symptom of our immaturity is greed, making it difficult for us to learn the simple lesson of sharing. Then there are symptoms of symptoms like access to pure food, water and air. You don't have to be very good at arithmetic to figure out that if the nations of the world would stop manufacturing implements of destruction, the conditions for a good life could be provided for all people. Immaturity leads to a negative mind for example, a military mind set usually has only military answers. The animal nature thinks in terms of using `the jungle law of tooth and claw' to eliminate all opposition. But this law solves no problems for humans; it can only postpone the solution, and in the long run it worsens things. All war is bad and self-defeating.<br />Peace suggests America established a Peace Department in our government. It would research peaceful ways to resolve conflicts, war prevention measures and economic adjustments to peace since America's economy seems to work more smoothly in a war or war preparation period. It would ask other nations to establishsimilar departments and come and work with us for peace. Communications among Peace Departments would be a step towards peace in our world. She said the military forces could clean up the air, the oceans and rivers or take on drainage projects to prevent disastrous floods and other such benefits for humankind.<br />Many people from other countries told Peace that they considered America the biggest menace to peace in the world because it is the only nation that used the nuclear bomb to kill people and there is no evidence that America will not do it again. Other countries do not always see our kind heart when they look across the sea.<br />Peace recommends a four-part Community Action Group in every town. The first meeting would teach and focus on inner peace, the second on harmony among individuals, the third on harmony among groups and the fourth on harmony among nations. The sequence would be repeated.<br />Concerning war Peace consoles \\"Remember that the darkest hour is just before the dawn.\\" She explains, \\"There is within the hearts of people a deep desire for peace on earth. It is the job of the peacemaker to inspire out-of-harmony people from apathy, ignorance and fear.\\" Knowing that all things contrary to God's laws are transient we must continue to pray, speak, and act for peace in whatever way we can; to inspire others we must continue to think of peace and know that peace is possible. As Peace said in her book, \\"One little person, giving all of her time to peace, makes news.

The Power of Losing Control by Joe Caruso is a book about how the true power of losing control lies in knowing the difference between what you can control, what you can effect, and what you need to accept. When you realize the only person you can change is yourself and stop wasting energy trying to change others you will have more peace and personal satisfaction. Caruso's book gives you an opportunity to experiment with yourself, learn new truths and become more aware of how you can enhance the meaning of your life. He points out how you are the stories you tell yourself and how rewriting your personal driving myths can reshape how you live your life. His book has helpful insights such as the real story of who you are isn't about what happens to you as much as it is about how you interpret it and define what happens. Also the more you repeat the story to yourself the more powerful it becomes and the more you allow the story to determine your behavior and behave as if it were true. My early life illustrates his point. I felt abandoned as a child so I believed I would be abandoned as an adult and I was until I wised up. He says the key to fulfillment is to keep asking, \\"Is the story I am telling myself serving me?\\" Caruso's book is packed with other powerful insights and advice: the difference between responding and reacting and a commitment and a decision. Also the 10 ideas and attitudes you need to let go of and the five stages of wisdom. If you use what you read in this book and apply it to the five stages of wisdom it could change your life.	2004-03-06

Books	5	1	2	N	N	Master Your Money	Household debt has doubled since 1990 and nearly 1-7 American families are filing for bankruptcy. Considering how many people are going broke, financial literacy should be taught in our schools and books like \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" should become mandatory reading. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the book, gives great advice, tools and wisdom on how to survive and thrive in most any economy. Kiyosaki teaches by contrasting his two fathers, a rich one and a poor one and their relationship with money. Both had successful careers, worked hard all their lives and earned substantial incomes. Yet one struggled financially and the other became rich. Kiyosaki breaks all the myths about money. He says, \\"The most dangerous advice you can give your child today is, \\"Go to school, get a good grades and look for a safe job.\\" The lives of his two fathers illustrate his point. His poor Dad had a Ph.D. and died owing bills. His rich Dad never finished the 8th grade and died leaving millions. His poor Dad said, \\"I can't afford it\\" and put his brain to sleep, whereas his rich Dad said, \\"How can I afford it? And exercised his brain. His poor Dad said study hard and find a good company to work for. His rich Dad said study hard so you can find a good company to buy. Kiyosaki points out that schools are designed to produce good employees instead of employers. His poor Dad knew how to work for money whereas his rich Dad learned to have money work for him. He also knew how to invent money and it is not how much money you make but how much money you keep that is important. He was very clear that you pay yourself first, that you buy assets and not liabilities and that there is power in using a corporation as a tax shelter. He changed the focus from borrowing money to creating money to get the things he wanted. His poor Dad lived in fear while his rich Dad harnessed the power of letting go of fear by confronting his own neediness, weaknesses and greed. He knew the way out was through his mind by choosing what he thought rather than reacting to his emotions. Kiyosaki recommends we work more for what we can learn than what we can earn and above all that we understand the power of money and how it works.hoosing what he thought rather than reacting to his emotions.

Books	5	6	8	N	N	If you want your country back�read this book and get to work	Who is really responsible for the September 11 attack? Why has Osama bin Laden not been captured? Michael Moore in his book, \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\" offers compelling evidence that Saudi Arabia is as deeply implicated in the 9/11 attack as Osama bin Laden. Why have all attempts to dig deeper into the connections been blocked by President Bush? Moore documents how the Bush family has a special relationship with the Saudi royal family. The Saudis spent more than $170 billion on armaments in the 90s and a good chunk went through Bush Sr.'s business, the Carlyle Group. The Saudis are the number-one suppliers of oil to the US and a large portion of the American economy is built on Saudi money. They have a trillion dollars invested in the stock market and another trillion dollars in our banks. Moving it would cause an economic crisis in the U.S.<br />The bin Laden family also has been doing business with the Bush family off and on for the past 25 years. The bin Laden family invested $2 million in Bush Sr.'s Company the Carlyle Group. Bush Sr. only returned the bin Laden's money after scrutiny and pressure two months after the attacks in New York. President Bush allowed a private jet to fly around the U.S. in the days after September 11 to pick up twenty-four members of the bin Laden family (relatives of the biggest mass murderer in U.S. history) and the Saudi Royals and then fly them to Paris without a proper investigation by the FBI.<br />Moore questions the degree of Osama bin Laden's involvement in 9/11 for the following reasons: Bin Laden is on dialysis for kidney disease and his arrest and trail in the U.S. would be embarrassing as he still gets money from sympathetic members of the ruling Saudi elite's and his family. Fifteen of the nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia, which is on the brink of civil war. President Bush censored out twenty-eight pages dealing with the Saudis role in the U.S. attack of Congresses' investigation. This may be another reason why Bush quickly went to war on Saddam Hussein and Iraq before finishing his war on Afghanistan and has for the most part ignored Osama bin Laden.<br />Moore's book is packed with other interesting facts such as Bush's pledged of $43 million to the Taliban in May 2001 when they agreed to ban all poppy cultivation and join America's \\"War on Drugs.\\" Moore said that made the price of stockpiled heroine go up and the Taliban became richer.<br />Bush's 2002 tax cut excluded families making $26,000 a year or less including one million military families with children.<br />How 13,000 families (.01 percent) in the U.S. control the equivalent wealth of the poorest twenty million.

If you are a child of a toxic parent you will find Susan Forward's book both validating and empowering. Forward says that healing is most effective when you proceed down the double track of changing self-defeating behaviors and disconnecting from traumas from the past.<br />The goal of the book is to reverse the balance of power in your relationship with your toxic parents.<br />Forward says all parents are deficient at times but Toxic Parents have consistently harmful effects. Focusing on their own problems Toxic Parents expect kids to take care of them, turning their children into mini-adults. Unable to control their own deep-seated rage, they blame their children. They control their children via guilt and manipulation. They are extraordinarily insensitive to both the pain they inflict and the lasting damage they do. They overtly or subtly abuse their children with constant put-downs and rob them of self-confidence. They may abuse alcohol or drugs and are mired in denial.<br />Forward says Toxic Parents cope with problems such as communication by pretending \\"nothing is wrong\\" (denial), blaming the child (projection), enlisting and ally (triangling), making the family a private club (keeping secrets), or rescuing or care-taking (sabotage).<br />Forward gives specific techniques and behavioral strategies to change your self-defeating beliefs, feelings and behaviors that keep you enmeshed with your family and prevent you from being independent. She shows how to stop feeling responsible for your parent's toxic behavior and how to respond to their negativity. She recommends that forgiveness come at the conclusion-not at the beginning of your emotional housecleaning.<br />Forward says the most healing act is the confrontation of your toxic parents via constructive criticism in person, in a letter or symbolically and shows how.<br />Forward says the healing comes not from your parents reactions (which is usually negative) but because it works. It works as you are facing your deepest fears, which is enough to begin to change the balance of power between you and your parents. She says what you don't hand back you pass on. If you don't deal with your fear, your guilt, and your anger at your parents, you're going to take it out on your partner or your children. The alternative to confrontation is to live with these fears, to reinforce your feelings of helplessness and inadequacy and undermine your self-respect.<br />Forward says, \\"There's no such thing as a bad confrontation...no matter what happens during or after any confrontation, you come out a winner because you had the courage to do it...the fear that kept you trapped in your old role with them can no longer control you.\\"deepest fears, which is enough to begin to change the balance of power between you and your parents.

Fitzgerald's book \\"One Hundred Cranes: Praying with the Chorus of Creation\\" helped me understand my role in the Great Mystery and honor every living thing as teacher. As he says, we only have to be awake and aware. I was particularly touched by Fitzgerald's story of a special encounter at sunset where he and a friend saw a large snail, three deer among the yellow poppies, a falcon \\"posing\\" for a still picture, and a gray whale spouting effortlessly at Point Reyes near San Francisco.<br />Sadly, two months later his friend was killed in an automobile accident. Fitzgerald<br />said, \\"As I look back now on that special day we shared at the ocean, I see it as a grace filled moment. I realized that the creatures we met graced us by awakening us.\\"<br />Fitzgerald story reminded me of a similar experience that happened to me. A friend and I were celebrating her doctor's declaration that she was in remission from an aggressive form of breast cancer. Her doctor was shocked as he had not expected her to live because her mother had died at the same age from this cancer. While we picnicked on a grassy knoll in the sun I found a deer antler and gave it to her. She was thrilled. Sadly, she died 10 years later. However, during those 10 years she reminded me every year how much she appreciated and enjoyed the deer antler.<br /><br />It is impossible for me to read Fitzgerald's \\"Prayer of the Geese's Flight\\" without weeping.<br /> \\"...Like the wild geese, who break a path for each other, may I find companions for the journey, who form the symmetry of communal care, of friendship, not holding back or keeping me in line but helping me on.<br />Like the wild geese, who know when to take flight, may I know the time of my seasons,<br />sensitive to each proper passage way, the springtime of each day's new beginning.<br />Like the wild geese, who take turns at the point of the \\"V\\", may I be willing to take my turn, being wise enough to know when to follow and to learn, and ready at the right moment to lead and move ahead.<br />...Like two wild geese falling out to companion a wounded fellow, may I console and be consoled, nurture and be nurtured, rather than rescue or be rescued.<br />...Like the wild geese, who write \\"V\\" in the sky, not in triumph over creatures, but as a signal of spring, may I break out of icy, rigid bonds that confine the spirit....\\"<br />\\"One Hundred Cranes\\" is a gem that made me feel a sense of being more alive in a wondrous world.ht moment to lead and move ahead. <BR>...Like two wild geese falling out to companion a wounded fellow, may I console and be consoled, nurture and be nurtured, rather than rescue or be rescued.<BR>...Like the wild geese, who write \\"V\\" in the sky, not in triumph over creatures, but as a signal of spring, may I break out of icy, rigid bonds that confine the spirit....\\" <BR>\\"One Hundred Cranes\\" is a gem that made me feel a sense of being more alive in a wondrous world.	2003-06-29

I first bought Sarno's book titled \\"Healing Back Pain\\" for my mother in South Africa and learned that stress, tension and psychological factors can cause back pain and migraines. Since I have chronic migraines I bought his later book \\"The MindBody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain.\\" His thinking is of course outside mainstream medicine. Sarno found that strong emotions generated in the unconscious mind, particularly rage, cause the mind to create a more socially acceptable physical distraction. The brain does this by reducing the blood flow and thus the proper amount of oxygen to the tissues involved. He says the change in the muscles, nerves and tendons account for 90% of the pain. He calls it TMS-Tension Myositis Syndrome as it is a physical disorder caused by tension in muscles, nerves, tendons and ligaments. The pain from the TMS takes our attention away from the emotional trauma and instead of dealing with our repressed feelings we focus on our body.<br />Treatment involves looking at what was going on in our life when the pain started and identifying repressed feelings from the past.<br />An experience I had makes me think what Sarno says is true. When my half sister and her husband, from South Africa, lived with me for five months they bought a car that had engine problems that only got seven miles to the gallon to tour America. I was concerned about their car purchase but did not say anything. I developed severe neck and back pain and could not turn my head for a week. I shared my concern about their car at a Co-Dependency group meeting and to my surprise I became very tearful. As I spoke the ache in my neck evaporated like vapor. I later joked with them and said, \\"You're a pain in the neck!\\"<br />I fit perfectly with the personality characteristics common in people with TMS-conscientious, responsible, perfectionistic with a strong need to please and to be helpful and good. And as Sarno says these tendencies have lead to tension and anxiety and physical problems.<br />When I looked for repressed anger when the migraines started I discovered that I felt extremely rejected, betrayed and used by my sister and brother-in-law at that time. Once I identified the repressed anger and sadness I started to grieve. It was like going through a divorce. Now I see we had different expectations for our relationship back then. I thought of us as a family. They wanted to immigrate to America and saw me as their ticket to get established.<br />When my stepfather heard I was angry he said, \\"Why don't you float your negative feelings in a paper boat down your creek? I thought I had! Now I see that Sarno's views are more helpful. Sarno says, \\"We are frail beings with brains strongly influenced by childish, illogical, reactions and dependency needs. Most of us carry feelings of inadequacy, helplessness, humiliation, shame and anger at ourselves for not living up to our own expectations and rage at others for perceived hurt and betrayals. The brain-mind is a conglomeration of thoughts and feelings that are often at odds with each other. It is not the neat, well organized, logical organ we would like it to be.\\" Thanks to Sarno I've decided it's all right to be illogical and childish. It's part of being human and it is universal and if it means getting rid of my migraines and rage and becoming a better person in the end, then so much the better.<br />To help people recognize that their mind, rather than a physical abnormality is the source their pain Sarno's treatment program involves lectures, group meeting and psychotherapy, if necessary. Patients are encouraged to discontinue all physical therapy, resume all physical activity, and review the 10 daily reminders: I have no structural abnormality only mild oxygen deprivation;-I have a harmless condition caused by repressed emotion (mostly anger);-TMS exists to distract me from emotions;-I have nothing to fear;-my physical aching is not dangerous;-I will not be concerned or intimidated by pain;-I will shift my attention from pain to emotional issues;-I intend to be in control-not my subconscious mind;-I must think psychological, not physical.<br />Sarno has treated more than 11,000 patients with chronic pain-many of whom have suffered for years. He estimates he's cured more than 90% of them and has helped thousands of patients overcome pain without drugs or surgery.<br />I've been studying the principles in Sarno's book for two months now and, unfortunately, still have the migraines. If the migraines are caused by TMS I may be among the 5% Sarno talks about who will need to actually experience my grief and rage with a therapist to get relief. However, Sarno's book has been invaluable as I feel happier and more at peace. He has helped me realize that I need to spend more time with people that leave me feeling loved, empowered, and inspired....ions;-I have nothing to fear;-my physical aching is not dangerous;-I will not be concerned or intimidated by pain;-I will shift my attention from pain to emotional issues;-I intend to be in control-not my subconscious mind;-I must think psychological, not physical. <BR>Sarno has treated more than 11,000 patients with chronic pain-many of whom have suffered for years.

Barbara Kingsolver, a biology graduate and author, ends her first story in \\"Small Wonder\\" by writing, \\"I'd like to speak of small wonders and the possibility of taking heart.\\"<br /> Instead of having a dangerous nationalistic attitude by saying, \\"Hey, America's the best!\\" she shows her patriotism for her country by celebrating the good and shining light on the bad so that we as a country might heal.<br /> With great insight and compassion Kingsolver gently helps us become more knowledgeable about our country's challenges and eloquently puts into words what many of us think and feel.<br /> About conservation she says the U.S. citizen's compromise 5% of the world's people and uses a quarter of its fuel. The U.S. belongs to the 20% of the world's population that generates 75% of its pollution. Although we are the world's biggest contributors to global warming we walked away from ratifying the Kyoto agreement with the 178 other nations in 2001. Instead of eating local produce the average American's food travels 5 million miles by land, sea and air. Yet our country possesses the resources to bring solar technology, energy independence and sustainable living to our planet.<br /> About the Government she says we live in the only rich country in the world that still tolerates poverty. In Japan, some European countries and Canada the state assumes the duty of providing all its citizens with good education, good health and shelter. These nations believe that homelessness simply isn't an option. The citizens pay higher taxes than the U.S. and so they have smaller homes, smaller cars, and appetites for consumer goods. They realize true peace is not the absence of tension but the presence of justice.<br /> About wars she says, \\"The losers of all wars are largely the innocent.\\" Seventy thousand people died in one minute when we bombed Japan in World War II. Then twice that many died slowly from the inside. \\"Vengeance does not subtract any numbers from the equation of murder, it only adds them.\\" In the last 30 years our government has helped finance air assaults in Afghanistan, Chile, El Salvador, Grenada, Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Nicaragua, Panama, the Sudan, Vietnam and Yugoslavia. Most wars and campaigns are to maintain our fossil-fuel dependency and our wasteful consumption of unnecessary things. We need to stop being a nation who solves problems by killing people and to \\"aspire to waste not and want less.\\"<br /> About global commerce she says we have a history of overtaking the autonomy and economy of small countries with our large corporations. For example, U.S. corporations and the World Trade Organization are placing pressure on farmers of other countries to buy genetically altered seeds that kill their own embryos. This means the farmers will always have to buy new seeds and pesticides from these companies. The pesticides and insecticides not only kill the unwanted bugs but also the beneficial insects and microbes that sustain, pollinate or cull different species.

Sickness in our culture is seen as an enemy to be fought and defeated. These war images cast chronically ill people as victims, and it's sometimes seen as a character defect if we experience suffering, grief or fear. Instead of battling the illness we can accept it as something we live with that is our normal state of being. The realization that we can be happy and sick is a major lesson.<br />Our culture expects a person's disability to be a test of character or an opportunity for heroism. People effected with illness should not have to prove their value to others. We are not better or worse, no more heroic or cowardly, strong or weak than healthy people. We are people first not a disease.<br />Other hurdles for the chronically ill include: loss of autonomy, (self-reliance and being financially self-supporting carries the imprint of virtue). For the chronically ill not pulling your weight is compounded by the fear of becoming indigent and feeling different. Unemployment not only involves economic loss but the loss of identity, productivity, self worth and a sense of meaning. Register says it is important to separate our economic and identity issues from the quest of human worth. When we accept our illness we can stop looking for a cause to blame or a miracle cure.<br />Chronic Illness challenges our relationships. Adversity can bring couples closer but with chronic illness the adversity comes and goes on a regular basis. The crisis may even become the core of the relationship. Illness highlights and compounds the gender differences. Females are trained to show emotion and males to hide them. It is easier for women to \\"be there\\" for intimacy and shared vulnerability. Women often want simple consolation from their husbands, what they get instead is a rational solution. Seeing their mate sick leaves many men feeling powerless. When a relationship requires sustained expression of thoughts and feelings it may become burdensome for the mate.<br />Register illuminates patience as a way of life for the chronically ill. Acceptance means taking realistic control over how we live and being ready for chaos. The \\"one day at a time approach\\" helps. When pain grows intense it demands complete attention. It also helps to focus on the recovery instead of the traumas.<br />Most doctors are more comfortable caring for acute illness. When medications do not work the patient rather than the medication is often blamed. Few doctors are honest about the limits of medical knowledge and trust patients enough to be partners in care.<br />Register acknowledges that anger, fear and grief are healthy responses to physical suffering. The value of catharsis allows us to face the emotions head-on rather than avoid or dismiss them. It is reassuring to hear that having suicidal fantasies are a normal consequence of chronic illness and not evidence of losing hold. Since most people do not act on their suicidal thoughts, considering death as a way out of the pain often diffuses the suffering. Also, when we confront the suicidal fantasy head-on it looses its power. Register even came to regard her own suicidal fantasies as a treasured choice. Knowing that suicidal thoughts are a feature of the illness is empowering.<br />Instead of asking \\"why me?\\" the chronically ill are better served by the question \\"what now?\\" And for people of faith we might ask, \\"what do you want from me God?\\" which implies not penance but fulfillment of a mission. Instead of seeing chronic illness as a punishment for sin, an endurance test, a divine plan geared to your natural capacity or a random event Register recommends we see chronic illness and suffering as central to the human condition. It is our own share of life's condition - a way of life not an aberration. Register says, to live with passion allows us to live with the dynamics of contradiction in joy and sorrow, caring and indifference, in courage and fear, in friendship and alienation. Passion is a fully human and divine spark that burns with life.<br />To answer the question \\"what should I do?\\" Register says, \\"Just live your life, pain and all with attention and purpose.\\" Lived fully, the experience of illness can free us from the curse of perfection. For people of faith learning to feel God's pain makes us more attuned to God's pleasure. Life is a beautiful tapestry being woven with our lives, it's pattern visible only to God.<br />Register redefines the disabled hero as one who demonstrates a capacity to come through multiple ordeals with their will intact. Instead of winners and losers, survivors have moments of courage, moments of cowardice, moments of determination and moments of despair, moments of glory and moments of humiliation. That many of us survive these ups and downs is a miracle that happens many times a day.<br />Register describes the ingredients of survival for the chronically ill: a sense of humor, tenacity, a will to live, discipline, inner strength, trusting ourselves, inner peace, acceptance, a support system, faith, skepticism, and a belief in a Higher Power and Purpose. Instead of saying, \\"There but for the grace of God go I\\" we might say, \\"Here, with the grace of God, I am.\\" Our bodies are, after all, our medium for experiencing creation.ness as a punishment for sin, an endurance test, a divine plan geared to your natural capacity or a random event Register recommends we see chronic illness and suffering as central to the human condition.

The African landscape and the people in \\"The Flame Trees of Thika\\" became so real to me that I grieved when the book ended. Six-year-old Elspeth Huxley's parents and friends became my parents and friends. Elspeth said of Tilly, her perfectionist mother, \\"it was the details others might not notice that destroyed her, the pleasure of achievement.\\" However Robin, Elspeth's idealistic father, \\"as a rule, had his mind on distant greater matters always much more promising and congenial than those closer at hand.\\"<br />Other notable characters included Elspeth's neighbors the beautiful, Lattice and her formal husband, Hereward, the kindly Ian, their house guest, who was in love with Lattice; Juma, their Swahili cook, Sammy their Masai/Kikuyu headman and Njombo, the Kikuju laborer's spokesman.<br />Huxley has the rare ability to understand and convey the culture and viewpoint of both the European colonial settlers and the Kikuyu and Masai people. The materialistic Europeans were critical of the nomadic Kikuyus who do not aspire to change, tame, possess or improve the countryside. The Kikuya, in turn, were mystified at the white man's sense of property ownership and the concept of theft. For the Kikuyu helping yourself to the possessions of the white man \\"was no more robbing than to take the honey from wild bees.\\"<br />At the heart of the story is the beauty and the challenge of life in Africa in the early 20th Century.	2002-08-18

I felt like I was traveling with him and I'm now more knowledgeable about Australia's people, politics, geography and history. Bryson's books are also wonderfully funny. And he doesn't mind making fun of himself. I loved his description of what happens when he falls asleep. \\"I'm not a discreet and fetching sleeper...I sleep as if injected with a powerful experimental muscle relaxant...My head tips forward to empty drool onto my lap, then falls back to begin loading again. And I snore, hugely and helplessly with rubber lips flapping and prolonged steam-valve exhalations.\\" Another of my favorite stories involved Bryson and a friend having too much to drink at a bar. The following morning Bryson asked his friend, \\"Did I disgrace myself?\\" His friend replied, \\"You're doing a house swap next summer with a family from Korea.\\" Bill responds, \\"I pursed my lips thoughtfully. \\"North or South?\\" I asked. When his friend said he did not know Bryson accused him of making the story up.  Bryson said his friend \\"reached over and deftly plucked from my shirt pocket a business card, which he presented to me. It said, \\"Park Ho Lee, Meat Wholesaler\\" or something and gave and address in Pusan. Underneath it, in my own handwriting, it said, \\"June 10-August 27. No worries.\\" I placed the card, folded once, in the ashtray.\\"<br />I also appreciate Bryson's willingness to be a human rights advocate (he brings attention to the plight of the Aboriginal people) and he's a powerful voice for the preservation and conservation of our planet.	2002-08-11

Synthetic chemicals are now linked to reproductive problems: a low sperm count (the male sperm count has plummeted by 50% since 1940 worldwide), infertility, genital and urethra abnormalities, the feminization of males, the masculization of females and hormonally triggered human diseases such as breast and prostrate cancer. Other symptoms include neurological and developmental disorders in children, the abnormal functioning of the thyroid, endocrine and immune system and mental and emotional development.<br />The danger we face in being exposed to industrial chemical contaminates is not simply disease and death. Something more sinister than straightforward poisoning may be occurring-the actual destruction of our human potential and our ability to reproduce.<br />Carcinogens are poisons that kill cells or attack DNA, other man-made chemicals target hormones. These synthetic hormones mimic the effects of natural hormones, usually the female hormone estrogen, by altering the natural synthesis of hormones or altering hormone receptor levels. The effects most often appear in the offspring, not the exposed parent. Many mothers are unknowingly passing their chemical legacy on to their babies through their womb and through their breast milk.<br />Eighty thousand chemicals have been registered with the Environmental Protection Agency in the last 60 years. Twenty new chemicals enter the market a week. Few are properly tested. These chemicals include pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, industrial detergents, and household cleaners. They are found everywhere in our water, air, soil, and food. They may even lurk in unexpected places such as the nonylphenols and the alkylphenols found in plastics and personal care items.<br />The chemicals may be low in the environment but they resist breakdown and accumulate in the body fat of humans over time. Because of food contamination the concentrations are higher in the bodies of animals up the food chain and in humans. This chronic synthetic hormone exposure is unprecedented in our evolutionary experience. However, most research money for investigating the effects of environment contamination of health goes to cancer studies. Also, because industrial chemicals have become a major sector of the global economy, any evidence linking them to serious human and ecological health problems is met with opposition.<br />Colburn, Myers and Dumanoski chillingly warn, \\"There is no clean, uncontaminated place, nor any human being who hasn't acquired a considerable load of persistent hormone-disrupting chemicals ... we are altering the fundamental systems that support life.\\"<br />What can we do?

All types of cancers rose 49.3% between 1950 and 1991. In 1950 an American woman faced a 1 in 20 lifetime risk of breast cancer; today that risk has more than doubled to 1in 8. The incidence of cancer in 1982 was 90 out of 100,000 people. In 1990 it was 112 out of 100,000. There is a 26% increase in brain cancer in children and testicular cancer in teenage boys has doubled. Bladder cancer increased by 10% between 1973 and 1991. According to Sandra Steingraber the author of  \\"Living Downstream\\" there are reasons why the nations leading cancer organizations make no mention of cancer prevention. There are reasons why they won't talk about the connection between pollution and cancer.<br />Steingraber uses her own story as an example. \\"Cancer runs in my family,\\" she says. \\"I have an aunt who died of the same kind of bladder cancer I had, my mother had metastatic breast cancer, I have many uncles who had colon cancer.\\" She pauses. \\"But I'm adopted. So cancer runs in my family, it doesn't run in my genes. That leads us to ask, what else do families have in common? We drink the same water, we breathe the same air, we have the same dietary habits, we often work in the same places.\\" She states that only 10% of cancers involve inherited mutations and that studies see more correlates with adoptive families not biological ones.<br />Steingraber says blaming the cause of cancer on our genetics, life style and behavior rather than the exposure to disease causing agents obscures cancer's many environmental roots.<br />Steingraber's research supports the connection between pollution and cancer:<br />In 1996 scientists isolated the carcinogenic agent in tobacco smoke that causes cancer.<br />In 1978, when the Israeli government banned pesticides-benzene hexachloride, DDT and lindane, breast cancer rates dropped by nearly 8% in all age groups by 1986.<br />Industrial countries have disproportionately more cancers than countries with little or no industry.<br />Families exposed to a dioxin suffused cloud from a pesticide manufacturing plant in Seveso, Italy in July 1976 have three times the rates of liver cancer and increased incidence of leukemia, multiple myeloma and soft tissue sarcoma.<br />In Finland there was an increase in non-Hodgkins lymphoma where the waterways were contaminated by chlorphenols from local sawmills.<br />Urban lung cancer rates are two to three times higher than the surrounding countryside.<br />People in cities with chemical plants, pulp and paper mills and petroleum industries show elevated rates of lung cancer.<br />People living near hazardous-waste sites have an increased risk of cancer.<br />Women employed in the chemical and plastic industry have higher rates of breast cancer.<br />Bladder cancer increased by 10% between 1973-1991 for workers in pharmaceutical plants and in the dye industry. Workers in the dry clean business have two times the rate of esophageal and bladder cancer.<br />Why has The World Health Organization recently attributed 80% of cancer to environmental influence?<br />Eighty thousand chemicals have been registered with the Environmental Protection Agency in the last 60 years. Twenty new chemicals enter the market a week. Few are properly tested. In 2000 The Center for Disease Control measured 27 industrial chemicals in most Americans and admits that there is very little data to prove that the majority of the chemicals are safe-especially with children.<br />Chemical companies are placing hundreds of new synthetic chemicals in the market each year-far faster than toxicologists and regulatory agencies can test them.<br />Yet the leading cancer organization make no mention of environmental causes of cancer. Why? The answer is simple-money. Industrial chemical have become a major sector of the global economy; any evidence linking them to serious human and ecological health problems is met with opposition.<br />As Steingraber says, \\"It's impossible to live safely ina toxic world.

Behind Patch Adams clown nose and jokes lies a social revolutionary who has devoted his life to transforming the health care system. In his book \\"Gesundheit\\" he shares a vision of a free holistic medical practice based on faith, friendship and fun. Adams life and work even inspired the producers of Universal Studios to make a movie titled \\"Patch Adams\\" staring Robin Williams.<br />Patch Adams is the founder of Gesundheit, a holistic home-based medical practice that managed to see more than 15,000 people without bills, malpractice insurance, formal facilities and paper work. Adams' vision is a wake-up call for all of us.<br />Like Adams I became discouraged when the art of counseling and medicine was replaced by the science of business and technology. During my 20 years of working as a children's counselor at a Mental Health Center I witnessed how mental health and medicine, the nations number one industries today, shifted from the community to the corporate level. When the loving human interchange between a client and counselor became more a business transaction, and the paperwork not the people became the bulk of our services due to fear of litigation, I decided it was time to retire.<br />In \\"Gesundheit\\" Adams discourages health care professionals from carrying malpractice insurance. When fear is the baseline from which to practice healing it encourages caregivers to prescribe \\"cookbook\\" treatments even when they believe them to be inadequate or potentially harmful. Fear and distrust makes physicians reluctant to explore alternate therapy and leads them to put patients through procedures and tests that are unnecessary and defensive.  When professionals see patients as passive recipients of wisdom there is no room for humility or mistakes. A malpractice climate denies physicians the right to be imperfect.<br />Third-party reimbursement is also a problem. It has diverted medicine from a service to a business and become a circus act with many hoops to jump through. Doctors tend to over-order tests and overdo procedures when patients are insured. It's easier to order tests than provide care or comfort. Hospital supply companies, medical technology and pharmaceutical firms have become multimillion dollar moguls of medicine.<br />Another problem is that the professional distance ethic often leads to aloofness and arrogance. Many patients are described as diseases, lab values, or treatments. When people are called the names of their diseases other facets of the patient's life are neglected such as family, friends, faith, fun, work, nutrition and exercise. Life itself is bigger than illness, diagnosis, treatment and disease.<br />When touching is taboo and getting close to clients is forbidden we loose the magic of vulnerability and trust in a relationship. Healing happens in the relationship between the healer and the patient. A healer cannot offset the pain and suffering of a client without intimacy. Healers need the freedom to cry with and hug their patients. Transference is inevitable. Every human being has some kind of impact on another. A solid relationship creates a loving, human, creative, cooperative and open environment.<br />Privacy or confidentiality rules make intimacy difficult. Public disclosure strengthens relationships and helps develop a greater sense of support and understanding. Like 12-step programs the surrendering of privacy is the cornerstone of friendship and an antidote to loneliness. Our stories are important and listening to each other's stories provides the magic for healing. We are a tribal people and we need community. We need to move from the insurance of cash to the insurance of clan.<br />Progress has become synonymous with \\"advances in technology.\\"  Although modern medicine has made great strides in knowledge and technology, health care professionals are rarely vibrant with the joy of human service. Many doctors feel naked without their instruments and machines. Even though comfort, empathy, and reassurance-so vital to a medical practice requires no technology. Our magic as healers is not in our tools but in ourselves.<br />We also need to integrate humor and nature in healing work. Humor is a powerful antidote to pain and nature tops the list of potent stress reducers. An individual's health cannot be separated from their natural and human environment and wellness needs to include prevention of ecological disasters.<br />Adams' book \\"Gesundheid\\" is an excellent summary of how today's high-tech medicine has become too costly, dehumanized, mistrustful and grim and gives us a vision of what good health care could be. We not only need a better health care system but a healthier one. Profit, paperwork, medication, and medical procedures cannot be a substitute for time spent talking to and observing patients.<br />Mother Teresa's Mission of Charity has provided free services to the poor in over 52 continents since 1952. They accept donations from individuals not companies and have not only survived but thrived.

LEE'S BOOK IS A GODSEND	In eight years I became \\"hot natured,\\" gained 20 pounds, began to search for words and for the most part walked around in a fog. Chores I once accomplished with ease required great effort and I became impatient when I could not find things. Even more disabling-my occasional headaches increased to up to thirteen a month and became migraines.  Since I'd just turned 51 a friend suggested it might be hormones and recommended I get a hormone saliva test. While I was waiting for the test results another friend gave me some progesterone cream. The results were almost immediate. The frequency and intensity of the migraines decreased, my mental fog lifted, I felt more relaxed and I had more energy. In short-I was my old self again.  My hormone saliva test confirmed my suspicions-my estrogen and testosterone levels were normal but my progesterone level was near zero. That's when I found Dr. John R. Lee's book \\"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You about Menopause.\\"  I was shocked to learn that most menopausal women of western industrial countries have estrogen dominance (they've become deficient in progesterone) because they've been exposed to more estrogen substances in their meat, detergents, pesticides, herbicides, auto pollution and plastic household utensils. The combination of environmental pollutants, lack of exercise, cultural attitude and a diet rich in animal fat, sugar, refined starches and processed food leads to Western women's estrogen levels to be twice as high as women in the Far East and in third-world-countries whose passage through menopause is mostly symptom free.  To correct the progesterone deficiency Dr. Lee recommends natural progesterone made from Mexican wild yams or soy products as they can easily be used and eliminated by the body and have no known side effects. He said synthetic hormones like progestin are not the equivalent to natural hormones and put women at risk of endometrial and breast cancer, autoimmune disorders, osteoporosis and other symptoms.  I was surprised to learn that since the 1800s natural substances such as progesterone cannot be patented. Since man-made hormones are more profitable for the pharmaceutical companies (who delineate the protocols for research) they have a huge impact on science. Because of advertising many people, including physicians, think that progestin, a synthetic product, is actually progesterone. For example, estrogen alone is credited for a decrease in heart attacks and an increase of bone mass in post menopausal women but the confounding effect of progestins has never been studied. Dr. Lee's own research shows reversals of osteoporosis without the use of estrogen supplements. Best of all natural progesterone cream may help reduce or prevent migraines as it counteracts blood vessel dilation, restores normal vascular tone, and helps with blood sugar control.  Since I've read Dr. Lee's book and started the natural progesterone I've heard many \\"miracle\\" stories about the cream from others and I'm delighted to ad my own.and other symptoms.

For Helen Martin's it was also her life, her work and her Mecca. In the play &quot;The Road to Mecca&quot; Athol Fugard explores the question: Should we leave our Mecca, our spiritual fountainhead, when we can no longer take care of ourselves? The conflict between the three strong willed characters Helen, Elsa and Pastor Marius explores the question in the light of different religions, cultures, genders, ages and environments. Fugard said the play was suggested by the life and work of Helen Martins of New Bathesda, South Africa. The real Helen from age 50 to 75 transformed her house into a personal universe that enters the realm of archetype, symbol and metaphor. The house, furniture, windows and walls became a kaleidoscope of colored glass. In her garden she constructed over 200 figures: owls, Biblical figures, Buddhas, and ancient gods and goddesses. One South African scholar described her work as one of the most stirring experiences of his life and another called her one of South Africa's artistic geniuses. Fugard in his play shows Helen's creations as a glorious, makeshift oasis of creativity and life force and Elsa, his character, sees Helen as an example of freedom and transcendence. One powerful scene is when Helen, seated in her Mecca with dozens of candles playing off glittered walls and mirrors, tells Pastor Marius &quot;I can't reduce my world to a few ornaments in a small room in an old-age home.&quot; The effect is stunning. The play is thought provoking and gives few answers. Helen is alive when it ends. Sadly, in 1975, the real Helen committed suicide. She drank caustic soda and died after three days I solitary agony. Her will included complex instructions listing in detail the ritual disposal of each of her sculptures. But today her home, known as &quot;The Owl House&quot; has been proclaimed a national monument and is a mecca for artists and tourists.	2001-04-03

First the book is educational. We accompany Dr. Peck and his wife Lily on a three-week trip through the countryside of Wales, England and Scotland in search of the ancient megalith stones erected by prehistoric people between 4,000 and 1,500 BC. But their obsession with stones also acts as a catalyst for Dr. Pecks exploration of topics such as religion, romance, despair, addiction and peace.  We learn about George Fox the 17thC Englishman who founded \\"The Religious Society of Friends\\" known today as the Quakers. Fox not only inspired thousands to \\"see the light of Christ\\" in each other but also to match his bravery in the face of imprisonment, beatings, illness and hardship. Their silent group meetings could only be broken by anyone who was \\"moved\\" to speak by their Inner Light.  Secondly the book is autobiographical. We learn about Dr. Peck's fears and shortcomings. Although I was saddened to learn about his sexual infidelities, regular recreational use of marijuana, nicotine addiction and about a \\"strong habituation to alcohol\\" I also appreciated his honesty. It took courage to shatter his public image of saintly self-control. In revealing the pain and shame of his own inner space Dr. Peck gives us permission to explore our own unconscious mind.  Thirdly, the book is thought provoking and inspirational. Dr. Peck discusses the three prevailing beliefs about good and evil: the denial of evil, the denial of goodness, and the acceptance of good and evil. He endorses the latter and believes that evil was defeated when Jesus died on the cross. Redemption is the simple mop-up operation of what remains. Although I believe evil is another mask of God to teach us unconditional love I appreciate his sharing his thoughts, thereby giving us an opportunity to discover where we stand. Dr. Peck believes integrity is more important than inner peace; apathy, not hate, is the opposite of love; life is full of paradox and that salvation is an ongoing process.ull of paradox and that salvation is an ongoing process.	2001-02-07

Perhaps more importantly, we gain value and worthwhile memories?a measure of our lives. ?Journey of a Southern Man? is Jackie Cooper?s testament to his life and journey. With a sense of humor, he tells about himself, his family and his friends, while at the same time helps us see truths about our own lives. In frankly facing his own fear of illness, aging, loss and death, and through the power of his insight, we are challenged to do the same.  Each story is a delicious slice of life and reads with the fluid simplicity of a Hemingway novel. An accomplished teller of tales, Jackie?s stories charmingly blend the traditional (see chapters Gimme That Old Time Religion, Golden Rule Should Apply at Theaters and Laughing Helps People Cope) and the unconventional (see chapters Survival Tips for Snow?Lay in the Munchies, Thinner Isn?t a Curse, A Former Smoker Confesses?He Loved Every Puff)  Jackie?s book has a keen sense of the passage of time and the existential irony that change is the universe?s only constant.  ?Journey of a Southern Man? inspires the reader to not settle for the ordinary and helps us remember the important things in life?love, relationship and gratitude.	2001-01-08

Barbara  descriptions of life in Kilanga, Congo 40 years ago is astounding and  brought back fond memories of my travels in villages in Mozambique,  Zululand and the Transkei. The serene-looking faces, quick laughter and  bare chested elegance of the village people fascinated me more than the  tensed-faced, harried, self-conscious city folk I knew. Barbara's exquisite  writing made me feel, see and sense Africa all over again.  Each of  the Price family members represented parts of me and helped me to  understand myself better. Nathan's religious fanaticism, Orleanna's  loyalty, Ruth Mae's innocence, Rachael's self-centeredness and the  thoughtful keen-eyed observations of Adah and Leah, the twins. They were  the true seekers of wisdom and truth.  Barbara's comment about the USA  and Western Europe's involvement in the bloodshed and devastation of Africa  is shocking. The possible link between the CIA and Patrice Lumumba's death;  the United States support of Joseph Mobutu's dictatorship and abuse of  funds; Mobutu spending $20 million to bring two American boxers to Zaire so  quote \\"all the world will respect the name Zaire\\" when his people were  dying of starvation and disease; the Export-Import Bank loaning the Congo  more than a billion dollars for a bogus power line so they can be assured a  permanent debt and be repaid in cobalt and diamonds. I had not idea and  feel outraged.  Through the characters of the Fowles, Anatole, Leah,  Adah and Orleanna, the author shows how the people who get off the  treadmill of further, faster and more to return to nature and simplicity  seem not only to survive but thrive.	2000-08-17

Like the Transpersonal Psychologists Gary Zurkov, in his book \\"Seat of the Soul,\\" challenges psychology to  include the language of the spirit. Psychology and spirituality are  integrated in Transpersonal Psychology but the American Psychological  Association, APA, does not recognize Transpersonal Psychology because the  \\"soul\\" cannot be verified scientifically. However, many of Gary's  descriptions of the human psyche ring true for me. That we are evolving  from a five-sensory to multi-sensory beings; that we have non-physical  teachers; that our purpose in life is to align the personality with the  soul; that mental illness is a shattered spirit; that we are reincarnated;  that our choices result in positive or negative karma; that evil is an  absence of light and that the universe is alive, intelligent and  compassionate.  It's sad when a physicist presents a more comprehensive  theory of personality than a psychologist. But I'm also glad that \\"Seat of  the Soul\\" had touched and helped so many people.	2000-07-25
