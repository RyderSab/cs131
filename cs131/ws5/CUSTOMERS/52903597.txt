Well, you'll be surprised as Damien Cox (one of the few T,O,-based writers who &quot;gets it&quot; and is not madly in love with the Laffs) with help from the Stellickian one put out possibly the finest analysis of the failure of the post-expansion Leafs.<br />Kudos for Cox focusing in on the true heroes of '67--Pappin, Stemkowski, Pulford, Pronovost and Hillman.  Also, brilliant analysis of how the Leafs' scouting was not to blame but more their anti-union/anti-WHA stance of management for the failures of the team post-'67.<br />The book is written in a way that focuses on the games of each series in the '67 playoffs without getting bogged down in game stories. The game stories are very brief and act almost as jumping-off points for further discussions on other topics.<br />For example, who knew GM Punch Imlach kept better players down on the farm in Rochester because he had money invested in the franchise? Who knew disgraced player agent Alan Eagleson had ZERO WHA player clients? That should have been the first sign he was in with the NHL owners despite being an NHLPA executive.<br />Definitely a must-read for any of us well West of the so-called &quot;Centre of the Universe&quot; who were inflicted with the Laffs on TV every friggin' Saturday night during the '80s. This is sweet revenge for all those nights stuck with Dan Daoust, Pat Boutette and Claire &quot;the Milkman&quot; Alexander skating (and I use that term loosely) across our screens.	2005-08-26

The actual game stories were boring as, let's face facts, no-hitters are boring. Dramatic they may be but NOTHING happens at all offensively for one team. We're talking about basically the failure of hitters on the other side of this coin. As my lifelong Cub fan friend has said to me in the past, &quot;I would never want to see a no-hitter as it'd be sooooooo boring.&quot; Then again she's a Cub fan.<br />I also thought it was a HUGE stretch to link the perfect games to whatever was happening in MLB as a whole (i.e., labor strife, gambling scandals, etc.). It was fascinating stuff but does it belong in a book like this?<br />It's definitely readable but don't read too much into it.	2005-08-23

Plus it's not just these international connections, there's no mention of the fact the WHA reintroduced overtime (10 minutes) to regular season hockey or that they even tried out the shootout in 1972 exhibition games.<br /><br />Somehow he completely left out talking about Jim Harrison who had a modern major hockey record 10-point game. Another guy to get nary a mention was goalie Don \\"Smokey\\" McLeod who was known for his curved stick, a record 43 assists in his WHA career and stopping two penalty shots in a single period not once...but in two different games!<br /><br />I understand you can't touch on everyone but I often felt too much text was given to the brawlers (who are highly entertaining and funny) but not enough to some of the more remarkable offensive feats.<br /><br />Also, who approved the pictures? The front cover is of Bobby Hull (as it should be) but it's of him being shoved by what looks like Brad Selwood. Come on! You gotta have Hull flying in on goal shooting the puck as your cover ...and put the Wayner on the back cover.<br /><br />The appendix is totally lame just listing teams year by year. They had enough room so why not put the standings and maybe playoff results in that space?<br /><br />Plus inside we get a pic of Derek Sanderson in his Blazers' jersey but it sure looks like he's wearing an AHL Boston Braves (huh?) jersey. Also, the pic of Ulf Nilsson, Anders Hedberg and Bobby Hull is not even in their Jets' jerseys. It looks like Nilsson is wearing a New York Rangers #18 Andre Dore jersey. What is up with that? The caption also says they are \\"celebrating a goal\\" but if they are, why are all three wearing different jerseys while Hull is not wearing any hockey gloves, has no stick and is clutching another jersey in his hands?<br /><br />Enough of the negative as the positive does outweigh the negative here. His call for the \\"Hockey\\" (not NHL!) Hall of Fame to recognize Nilsson, Hedberg and Mark Howe is a point well taken. I also dug the whole birth of the WHA and how it all came together. Plus he is able to articulate how the NHL Oilers of the '80s based their freewheeling style on the WHA Jets of the Hull-Hedberg-Nilsson era.<br /><br />He also gave the best description of what actually happened in the Rick Jodzio attack on Marc Tardif incident which was probably the WHA's low point.<br /><br />The stories about Gordie Howe and his two sons were endlessly fascinating and worthy of a book on their own, too.<br /><br />Willes' style is breezy and you can read this in one sitting but given the goldmine of material, I wanted about 200 more pages.all three wearing different jerseys while Hull is not wearing any hockey gloves, has no stick and is clutching another jersey in his hands?

I mean, how about some of the more post-'60s players like Furuta, Akiyama, Fukudome, Kuwata, Kiyohara...even Ishige, Nakahata, etc.  Even the Japanese MLBers like Nomo, Ichiro et al takes on J-ball would be great to throw in there.<br /><br />Sure these are all interesting snapshots BUT why the focus so much on the import players from the '60s onwards? It skews the book way too much towards the same-old tired \\"gaikokujin (foreigner)\\" viewpoint. Frankly, if you are going to do a book about Japanese baseball and the import quota in their leagues is so low, why not have a better balance between the J-view and the \\"foreigners' \\" view?<br /><br />Very disappointing, if you follow J-ball at all.

How about next time giving us something we can comprehend quickly when, say, comparing Ted Williams to Joe DiMaggio without having to pull out a calculator to figure HRs/plate appearance, or what their typical season was stat-wise, etc.?<br /><br />I liked the fact he gave Juan Marichal and Minnie Minoso their due and also made a strong argument for Roger Clemens as being the equal at least of any pitcher in history. At times, though, you can see Barra has an axe to grind which is fine, but I think his arguments would work better without that slant.<br /><br />I also think in any argument baseball writers have they should take into consideration post-season play. I mean, many consider statheads consider Derek Jeter to be less than the greatest thing to play SS in years but they base this ONLY on regular season stats. I'll take Jeter any day over any SS out there in the post-season....but I digress (and I'm not even a NYY fan...go figure).<br /><br />I didn't quite get why we needed some basketball and football chapters in a book clearly subtitled about baseball. I enjoyed the pieces but they need to retitle the book and maybe double the size. This book really is way too short as the baseball stuff only goes to 213 pages so the stuff on other sports looks like padding to me.	2005-08-19

After writing the bio of his famous brother, Frank, I figured that was just a labor of love. Little did I realize that Ted can tackle other people. First of all, a bio of Marcel Dionne is a terrific idea as he's a player, maybe because he was based in the hockey backwater of El Lay, most fans really overlooked for much of his career. The book gives you an unbelievable appreciation for a truly great player and and even better individual.<br />The stuff on his junior days and the whole push-me-pull-me battle of a top Quebec prospect playing his major junior hockey in the OHA was eye opening. It's also interesting to note Marcel was truly the first free agent (albeit under different circumstances) that resulted in him leaving Detroit for LA.<br />The insight on '72 Team Canada's turnaround in Russia may have been due to player's wives and girlfriends being allowed to join the players. That is certainly the first time I've heard that and it makes a lot of sense given the &quot;us vs. them&quot; bunker mentality Team Canada developed.<br />So much in this book is fresh and makes me wonder what were journalists reporting on back then because they missed a terrific subject in Marcel. It's also mind boggling how Lafleur and he were connected right to the end with the NYR shoving  a still productive 30-goal scorer in Dionne aside to bring back Lafleur from retirement. (for the record Guy got all of 18 goals in his comeback).<br />This book certainly gives Marcel his due and might I suggest Ted pick maybe Gilbert Perreault or Stan Mikita as his next hockey players to give the bio treatment to.	2005-08-19

The author also blends in enough history without overwhelming us all. It certainly turned me on to some areas of the nation I've missed. I also liked how he was able to blend the politics of today with the past and on how so many times throughout history Mexico missed the boat. Plus add to that his obvious love of Mexico, he never allows that pointed criticism of political leaders to descend into the typical &quot;we're superior&quot; Yanqui stance.<br />The only thing I never get about most travel essay writers, and he is no exception, is how they can travel all over a nation and miss, or never comment on, events involving hundreds of thousands of locals held almost weekly. I'm talking the impact of soccer on Mexican lives. I know this is off on a tangent but I found soccer matches esp. involving America, Chivas, Cruz Azul or Guadalajara brought me more insight into the Mexican psysche than many other better known explosions of color and emotion (i.e., &quot;festivals&quot;).	2005-08-17

Yes, we find out that all supporters seem hung up on chldish racist/sexist comments/chants. I did like the fact he incorporated Web site BBS postings as many of those were a laugh.<br />I mean, I do get the whole group mentality male bonding deal that soccer fandom is all about but what i really wanted to know more than anything from this book was why Italian soccer is so popular yet so mindnumbingly dull to watch. How many 0-0, 1-0 matches does Italian Serie A produce? I wanted to find out why a vibrant and colorful culture of fandom (and food, art, fashion, politics, etc.) can somehow produce possibly the worst excuse for entertainment on the soccer pitch ever.	2005-06-23

Where it gets better and reads more like a book is from Phil's management days with the NY Rangers and TB Lightning. I just love the whole behind-the-scenes stuff on how dumb owners are in hockey. The NYR turning down getting Gretzky in his prime because their building was full so they &quot;didn't need #99.&quot; Or trades often made by owners with GMs finding out after the fact--who knew this went on?<br />The whole mystery of the J-owners in Tampa is revealed and shows how Phil really is one hell of a dealmaker in getting hockey started there (and one Stanley Cup later...no matter what you think of hockey in the Deep South...that team is a success now on and off the ice).	2005-05-07

After you read one game analysis (not that they are bad or anything) you have kind of read them all.<br /><br />Being a Raiders fan it's not that I didn't enjoy the book but it's like this whole Gannon (who I think is just a KC Chief plant designed to destroy the Raiders from within) and Rice (aargh, an annoying 49er in Raider colors, something is not right there) era--it just falls short of being truly great.	2005-04-27

It starts off talking about the author's family history in Africa and looks to be about life during the British Empire. Then it shifts gears into overdrive as the author starts to talk about how he got into such hellholes as Somalia, Bosnia and Rwanda. Then it flips back and forth as the author tries to piece together a close family friend's life in Aden through diaries that seem to be a whole other story unto themselves. The whole approach to the book sounds like it's all over the map but it does work which proves either Hartley is a genius or he had  a great (and I do mean GREAT) editor.<br /><br />To say a book that contains a lot of death of not only millions in various conflicts, but also of numerous close friends wrapped up in those places reporting on these conflicts, is magical and uplifting may be oxymoronic.<br /><br />I thought it really was a magical and uplifting book that at the end is one of hope as the author seems to find peace at last.<br /><br />I also loved the fact he was not shy about writing about the sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll gonzo lifetstyle foreign correspondents seem to live. If there is a \\"foreign correspondent\\" equivalent to the modern Desert Storm GI book \\"Jarhead\\" this is it.	2005-04-27

It also is an eye opener about how Nux mgmt operates and how the Nux WILL NEVER WIN A CUP until they bag this whole Quinn and his acolytes (Burke and now Nonis) hiring policy.<br />It hurts to read some of this as what mgmt did during Pavel's era is jaw droppingly stupid from bad trades post-1994 to being so chintzy about contract negotiations with key members of that Cup run team and I can now understand why Pavel finally wanted out. And to those out there always talking about how &quot;great&quot; a place to live Vancouver is, read this and wake up to the fact Vancouver is still a backwater and not some sort of cultural and enlightened &quot;world-class&quot; city.	2005-04-17

Bernstein is somehow able to tie the entire history of the world to the pursuit of money. Well, it is in many ways and this book is just not about gold. How gold became the basis of wealth esp. in its battle with silver is endlessly fascinating. I also loved how he tied it all in to the evolution of \\"paper\\" money. The stuff on how the French franc freefell in the '20s helps explain the appeal of Paris for Hemingway and his ilk who not only loved the intellectual world there but, face facts, their US bucks stretched pretty far there.<br /><br />It's these and other asides that make this book rock!

This book fills in the blanks and is not only about the 1929 A's. It covers pretty much the entire time they were in Philadelphia and really does bring both the team and period alive. It focuses, of course, on Connie Mack but the postscript on what happened to these players from this 1929-31 dynasty is great followup. I also like his short, but sweet, statistical comaprison of these A's to the so-called \\"greatest team of all-time\\" the 1927 (or specifically 1926-28) Yankees. At times the author when describing scenes around and in Shibe Park, you can almost hear the fans and the crack of the bat.<br /><br />I also love the little trivia just thrown in a line or two in places like the fact Thomas Edison was a huge A's fan!	2005-01-24

What was really impressive was how much access a Western female journalist was able to get once she learned how to manipulate the system. Plus it is interesting to learn how differently Persians view the world from Arabs and how, in a strange twist, possibly the best hope for a democratic Muslim world is Iran (read the book and you'll understand). The great thing is Persian Mirrors reads like a travel essay book more than some dry political or sociological analysis so your eyes never glaze over despite the, at times, heavy issues brought out.	2004-12-28

There is plenty of interesting stuff about the usual Seattle stuff (Ivar's, the M's and Seahawks, the grunge music scene, Microsoft, Starbucks, Amazon.com, etc.) but it's all over the place. This book needed serious editing and more focus on what exactly the author wanted to say about Seattle. It read more like a series of disjointed essays.<br /><br />As far as Seattle goes, I got more out of the \\"politics\\" of the place reading Art Thiel's Out of Left Field and that book had a focus--specifically the history of the city's MLB team, the Mariners.	2004-12-28

I was most interested in Hall's days sharing the nets with Jacques Plante in St. Louis and it shows how Hall basically helped turn St. Louis  into the NHL's best new market back in 1967. Hall also comes across as no dummy and a very honorable teammate and man.<br />It's really great that when his story was told, it was told by someone who understands that Hall not Sawchuk, Roy, Plante, Hasek or Tretiak is hockey's greatest goalie.<br />The only points he missed were no action shots inside showing Hall's famous V, or butterfly, style that truly revolutionized goaltending (sorry, Patrick Roy, but it wasn't you) and he kept calling his &quot;glovehand&quot; his &quot;catch glove&quot; which I have never heard in all the years I've played or watched hockey.	2004-12-06

Lions in Empire Stadium (1954 - 1982)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Unlike the Lions' history, this is simply brilliant	You have to love the amount of unreal research the author did. Also, the organization of the book flows as he basically focuses each \\"chapter\\" on a certain player, owner or other football topic. It could be a bit tighter but that's a moot point. He does tell it like it is/was and doesn't mince words. I can attest based on his observations of the brutal '70s that he is spot on on his take on that decade's characters.<br />Personally, any book on the CFLthat mentions Paul Brothers is worth its weight in ...well, not gold, if you know who Brothers was. I would have loved to read about Jim Evenson or Johnny Musso but those are pet faves. There is so much arcane but fascinating trivia packed in here, it is really a treasure trove of both sports and local Vancouver history from 1954.<br />What is pleasing is the author does not stop at the Lions and delves into local teams long gone in one section on the other sports teams in town. I would have loved to see a listing of Lions W-L and playoff records along with average attendance year to year just as reference points maybe in a glossary but again that's nitpicking.<br />Every Lions' fan should pick up a copy and there are hopes that the author may do a 50th anniversary update.	2004-11-27

Basically, a story of love and reunification with one's family. The rhythms and patterns of speech and thinking as written from the point of view of an autistic child leave you speechless. The writer is able to make you feel you know what it is to be autistic. Of course, those of us who aren't can never know, but it is a magical weird ride he takes us on.	2004-11-22

The unique way she wove her story through the lenses of her lovers was a stroke of brilliance. And she has guts to say war is an adrenalin rush for journalists of all ilk and also is able to talk about men in a way that is refreshing and honest.

Never gets bogged down in year-to-year stats and his way of comparing Shoeless Joe and Manny Ramirez's careers was brilliant. The stories about Manny are priceless.<br /><br />Like all his other sports books, Terry Pluto is easily the best sportswriter on the planet.	2004-10-21

The book itself is a great read but the problem is this topic was already done better in Sparky Lyle's Bronx Zoo and Graig Nettles' Balls (one of the most underrated baseball books ever). Plus from the subtitle I thought it would only be about that crazy 1978 season but it takes 190 pages to get the reader there.<br /><br />Was the stuff on the origins of the Yankees really necessary to get to 1978?<br /><br />I did like the profiles of George (learned he's into poetry...who knew?), Billy Martin (came from a broken home...now there's a surprise...NOT!) and Reggie Jackson (never remarried after his divorce).<br /><br />Anyway, somehow given the fact that two excellent books on the '70s NYY came out around the same time, I don't get why a third is necessary over 25 years later. Personally, I'm now more interested in that Buster Olney book on the Torre dynasty Yankees and what made them tick.	2004-10-02

The photos are simply amazing esp. the panoramic shots. And who knew the \\"Hit Sign, Win Suit\\" sign at old Ebbets Field was at the bottom of the outfield fence? I always imagined it was up high.<br /><br />The text is mostly filler but interesting and intriguing filler at that. You learn stuff like kids who caught HR balls that cleared the park at League Park (the Indians' previous home) and Shibe Park (Philly A's and Phillies former home park) could turn in the balls for a free pass to a game. How cool is that?<br /><br />Would give it 5 stars but somehow in the \\"Gone, but Not Forgotten\\" section they forgot to put in the Expos' Parc du Jarry yet managed to fit in the Jays' Exhibition Park. Considering that ballpark had about ten times the character as the Ex, I have no idea why they left it out.	2004-09-29

For someone who has spent the entire '90s outside my so-called \\"homeland\\" of back bacon and beer, this was a good fill-in-the-blanks on what NAFTA has had on North America.<br /><br />The guy nails Canada pretty good esp. on the lack of opportunity and stifling of creativity. Plus he gets bonus points for seeing what our universal health care is all about--cheap but pretty useless should you ever really need to use it. Could've thrown in a lot about the whole underground grow-op economy that flourishes up here.<br /><br />I would say that the only mute pt. was his putting his kids into a private school in Ontario. Does the NY Times pay its writers enough to do this and what were his fears of Canada's public schools? The public schools up here are decent so I sort of lost a bit of respect for his views after reading that.	2004-09-29

I expected more of a comparison of pitchers maybe by era or some more depth to the text maybe focusing on interesting hi- and low-lites of their careers combined with the usual stat analysis that sabermetricians are known for.<br />Basically, all this book is  is a list of pitchers in alphabetical order and reads like a textbook, or an old scouting report, rather than what should have been a fascinating journey of the pitchers who made it to the bigs.	2004-09-10

Quinones is able to totally take you into worlds rarely heard about before. Who knew there was a thriving basketball hotbed in Oaxaca that has been transported to LA? The whole genre of narcocorridos (basically, traditional Mexican \\"country\\" [ranchero] music with a gangsta slant) started in LA, too.<br /><br />The topics of lynchings in rural Mexico, the popularity of telenovelas at home and in Eastern Europe(?) and the religious cult at Neuva Jerusalen are all so fascinating and far beyond anything anyone has probably imagined Mexico to be.<br /><br />He has an inate ability to dig up and find the most fascinating stories in the most out-of-the-way places yet also show how they often are a microcosmic reflection of how Mexican society operates in general.<br /><br />The question is: When is Sam Quinones going to compile a Tales 2?	2004-08-31

It's Klobuchar's newspaper writing style mixed with linebacker Jeff Siemon's journal of the 1976 season.  I never really got a feel for any of the athletes at all and Klobuchar's analysis of why the Vikes can't win the big one was just plain juvenile.

I mean, is that the worst drawing ever of a soccer shirt. Did a 3 y/o do it? They couldn't get a real pic of Pele? Or maybe of the confetti showers created by Argentina soccer crowds?<br />Well, never judge a book by its cover. This is as brilliant as Futebol by Alex Bellos. The stuff on how Mexican soccer is controled by Televisa was particularly insightful. The early Columbian breakway league of the post-WWII era was something new for me and adds to the nacrodollar mystique of the Columbian league always being way out of the norm. I just loved the explanations of the Menottistas vs. Bilardistos in Argentina and the Fla-Flu rivalry in Brazil.<br />The only chapter that is a complete waste is the one on Latin American amateur leagues in the UK. Frankly, who cares? Every nation with an immigrant population has these leagues and I couldn't really see the relevancy at all to his dissection of Latin American soccer. I'd sonner have seen another chapter on maybe one or two of the other nations the author didn't quite get into.	2004-07-15

It covers the activities of hooligans associated with the London-based clubs. So plenty of grist for the Millwall...as they say.<br />It's an eye opener as to how moronic the pursuit of other hooligan gangs, or firms, goes.  Highly entertaining read, if you feel the violence associated with soccer is both appalling, but like a traffic accident, strangely you are drawn to vicariously look at the carnage.	2004-07-15

Nothing wrong with that but it's not until year three of the USFL that the author writes anything of note about on-field play.<br />DO NOT waste over $100 on a used copy of this as it's waaaay too long, in need of serious editing and can be found in any large library.<br />The worst thing is I had to go online to find out why the jury awarded the USFL only a dollar in the anti-trust lawsuit they won over the NFL.

The only chapter that I skimmed was the one on religious connections. Endlessly fascinating though and ideal to take along if you ever visit Venice. I also love the fact that the author does not get bogged down so much discussing the architecture and gives plenty of historical background.

Rene Robert calling Scotty Bowman a &quot;platehead&quot; and Robert tossing a hat-trick puck at the Mtl bench was a classic howler. As was Butch Goring and the hot dog incident which is as funny as that wreck of a helmet he used to wear.

The funny thing is you start of thinking the book will be mainly about the events of Sept. 11, 1973, when Pinochet took power in a coup. It is not at all yet that event is really the one that has led Allende on this long journey as a observer of life par excellence.<br /><br />In reality the book is more about a woman searching for her sense of place in a world turned upside down by living a life in exile. The honesty and power of her words is just so uplifting without descending into \\"look at me, me, me\\" sort of navel gazing.<br /><br />If I could give it ten stars I would.	2004-05-18

Reminds me too much of the bright-eyed bushy-tailed who come over expecting it to be geishas and cherry blossoms and find it's pink salons and garbage strewn on beaches. They only missed the Edo period by 500 or so years just like this book missed the mark on really telling a less whiny tale of woe.

It's certainly worth buying Wa; just don't buy into all the opinions. The one saying that the Pacific and Central League MVP awards were both given to foreigners in the same season due to some weird theory that it had to do with trying to reduce the trade friction between the U.S. and Japan at the time is laughable. Like anyone back in the U.S. in those days noticed J-ball nor even correlated baseball with trade issues.<br /><br />The book though is spot on on capturing the spirit of '80s J-ball and the characters really come to life and especially for anyone who lived here during that era, it's a great read.<br /><br />Just take things with a grain of salt on his trying to tie other non-baseball issues in with the baseball bits.	2003-12-12

This is not just one of those &quot;Season in the Life of...&quot; type sports books. In the same vein as Roy MacGregor's pioneering look at the expansion Ottawa Senators early years and the NHL, this book shows all the machinations and goings-on behind the scenes in south Florida as the Panthers captured the area's imagination.<br />There is a great story within this on how Bobby Clarke (then with Florida) conned Brian Burke (then with Hartford) at the Cats' first foray into the amateur draft.

There is way way too much name dropping and quoting of other sources rather than getting the author's actual feel of the city of Buenos Aires as it is today. I understand this series is subtitled as &quot;a cultural and literary companion&quot; but I'd have preferred way more emphasis on the culture as it stands now and less of the literary references.

So why is the major part of the book all these boring lineup lists? Do we really need a first and second team for some teams? Does every danged team need an All-Rookie or All-Bust team? My eyes began to glaze over.<br />This book needed serious editing of the slash and burn type. Not that it's a bad read but it's so repetitious, it sucks all the enjoyment out of it. I mean, who cares beyond Rockies' fans about their all-time lineup let alone their All-Traded Away team or whatever team. They've only been around, what, less than 10 seasons. It's overkill.<br />Considering all the research he probably spent to come up with these definitive lists, the book can be read in less than a day. That is NOT good value!	2003-07-25

It's a good book, for sure, but I didn't get the relevance of references to how each Real Madrid great rated on the 100th anniversary fan poll. I also thought there'd be more than a little over 200 pages. I understand brevity but this book deserved about 200 more pages.<br /><br />Whereas Barca--A People's Passion by Jimmy Burns rocked.

I did not get why the author used some Austrian references when, let's face facts, Austria have not been a world power in soccer since the '20s and '30s. The footnotes alone are a book in itself.<br /><br />Despite this academic approach this book is beyond brilliant in its analysis of North American sports. Yes, it's not just about soccer but places soccer in the context of how it has struggled to establish itself at the pro level in North America and explains why.<br /><br />For those of us who love all four major sports...and soccer, it is an eye-opener to learn about how soccer was a fairly established sport in America but blew its advantage just as baseball and college football took over.<br /><br />A definite great read but could have used a better editor to slash and burn much of the lengthy overworking of some points.	2003-06-11

Not only does this capture a time (1945-70) when the CFL was great but it really shows how truly a special part of Canadian sports culture the CFL once was. Sure, the CFL has never gone away but in the days before cable TV and the NFL being beamed into every Canadian home, the CFL was all we had. Although I only experienced the period after this, it reminded me so much of stories my father used to tell of the greats--Jackie Parker, Normie Kwong, Sam Etcheverry, etc. It made the CFL's rich history really come alive and wish I could have been alive to see it all in its glory.	2003-03-16

This is a tale of great inspiration but also of great sadness. It's a warts-and-all look at how a family copes with a traumatic brain injury to their father who basically loses his memory and much of his former brain function. Think the movie Memento or Bourne Identity was wild, they have nothing on this tale. Worth tracking down, if you can find a copy.	2003-02-24

It's as if no one bothered to filter all this research into what is important and what isn't. This book needs serious editing as somewhere in the midst of it all is a GREAT story worth telling.

There really are no words to explain how insightful and fun the writing style is and the research here is beyond amazing.

I think the plain fact is despite Lefty Grove's greatness, he was a dull uninteresting guy himself. He's not even loathsome and looney like Ty Cobb to make for a &quot;the glory meets the train wreck of a life&quot; read. As far as pitchers of his era, check out &quot;Walter Johnson: The Big Train&quot; by Henry Thomas which is a far better book. Although &quot;Lefty Grove: American Original&quot; is an extremely well researched book giving it a good feel for the times, a better bet is probably to check out the books on manager Connie Mack and his A's of the '20s.	2001-07-18

Sadly, as excellent as that book is, this one is a total mess. First of all, there is way way too much extra info on things unconnected to Polo's trek along the Silk Road. You basically need a degree in the History of the Middle Ages to figure out the obscure references. I got the idea Dalrymple was showing off. Considering he supposedly knows all this arcane stuff, how come this obvious well-educated guy spends much of his trip searching for people who speak English to help him? Did he not use his vastly developed cranium to think of buying a few phrasebooks before heading out? Or how about studying at least one of the languages used in the region?<br /><br />Add to this he is, for want of a better word and no hate mail please, pussywhipped by the two females he travels with. One is so much of in a hurry to blitz across to the Indian subcontinent it's annoying beyond belief.<br /><br />With much better editing, this could have been as brilliant as Age of Kali. It is still a decent read but Dalrymple would be wise to read \\"Chasing Che\\" to see how to put together a follow-in-the-footsteps-of-the-greats travel book.	2001-05-24

How could Brian MacFarlane not tell the full story of the third member of that line, Vic Hadfield, and his tossing Bernie Parent's mask into the stands during a playoff game at the Garden. That tale warrants a short mention in the appendix only.<br />There are a few bad editing errors as Ranger great Ching Johnson is referred to as Ching &quot;Johnston&quot; throughout the book bar the appendix. There is a photo of Ratelle in a game vs. Buffalo but the caption refers to Dale Rolfe's pounding by Flyer Dave Schultz in the '74 playoffs. That same page features a photo of Brad Park but when he was with the B's (Ranger fans should be outraged at that, shouldn't they?). Ditto the photo of goalie Lorne Chabot who is seen wearing a Leaf jersey. Was the publisher prevented from accessing NY papers' or the Rangers' own photo archives so had to rely on other sources?<br />Overall the book's pretty much like the Rangers' history, a few moments of brilliance in an otherwise memorable run of near misses.	2001-02-10

His idea to travel across the Deep South using not only a  rental car but also all other forms from Greyhhound bus to Amtrak train  allows him to meet a good cross section of people to gain insight into the  region. It's also the first travel book I've read that fully explains how  BBQ differs region to region in the South and how grits has such a hold on  Southerners. His take on Southerners' obsession with heroes of the Lost  Cause (i.e., the Civil War) really hits home and shines a lot of light on  the recent Confederate flag debate in South Carolina. Highly recommended  and check out his other stuff especially &quot;Last Disco in Outer  Mongolia.&quot;	2000-08-27

Feargal Keane has written a superb account of his journey into Rwanda shortly after the 1994 genocide. It's a well-balanced look at both sides with Keane able to access both Hutu and Tutsi areas (albeit sometimes with great difficulty and not a little danger). The human face of the \\"war\\" so often missed by Western journalists is really brought to the fore by Keane's insightful and extremely compassionate account.	1999-08-13

I have a keen interest in L.A. but, despite a lot of great information in here, the thing is one big socialist rant against all that is L.A. I'm sorry, but I do not  need it shoved down my throat that big business is bad and the LAPD are  scum. Stating the obvious or picking on these targets is like the  proverbial shooting fish in a barrel. Give me something new!<br /><br />The  main problem with this tome is it's poorly edited. Take, for example, this  sample sentence: \\"They described the Culture Industry not merely as  political economy, but as a specific spatiality that vitiated the classical  proportions of European urbanity, expelling from the stage both the  'masses' (in their heroic, history-changing incarnation) and the critical  intelligensia.\\" Besides swallowing the dictionary on this one (and many others) Davis shows he has yet to learn the Orwellian principle of writing clear, concise and well-constructed sentences.<br /><br />Another major problem is his research seems to have been done mostly in the library. There are quotes that head sections within chapters but for someone presenting a  broad social history and criticism of L.A., why not interview a few of the  people who live there about the issues he brings about? Take the first  chapter--72 pages of text, 168 footnotes. Let me repeat that--that's 168(!) footnotes. Are there any original thoughts in that chapter given the number of footnotes?<br /><br />Also, for someone who rightly criticizes the L.A. Times for its political machinations, he certainly uses the Times as source  material especially for statistics. If, on the one hand, he portrays the  Times as a right-wing organ throughout pretty much most of its history,  wouldn't you think, from a socialist's point of view, that quoting or  reporting anything the Times says is counter to that?<br /><br />Davis only  truly writes well in the chapter \\"The Hammer and the Rock\\" which  focuses on the LAPD's aggressive policing policy of ghetto areas. This  chapter is as good as the excellent Miles Corwin book \\"The Killing  Season\\" on the lives of two LAPD homicide detectives over one summer.<br /><br />The last chapter on an area inland called Fontana seems to fit the  Davis agenda. It's the place he grew up in but explain to me how relevant  it is when it still remains a fringe area in L.A. history? Interesting but  certainly not needed in this book.  There are so many things Davis  could have touched on in this book. In fact, when he focuses on the  entertainment industry, it's on the Hollywood movie scene and about such  sad things as how it devoured such talents as Fitzgerald and Faulkner when  they came out West. Yet Hollywood is just one part of LA's entertainment  history.<br /><br />With his focus on the importance of land deals, it's  surprising he left out the sports industry altogether. There is a goldmine  of boondoggles in the Dodgers move from Brooklyn, the Oakland Raiders move  south then back north, the Rams to Anaheim and then St. Louis, the growth of  minor league baseball in the Inland Empire, etc. He does touch on music but  doesn't get into it enough. And what of pop culture trends, fads, and wacko  religions. Or even a focus on the drive-in religious temples that sprouted  in L.A. He does get in his digs at L. Ron Hubbard, but that's it.<br /><br />In other hands this could have been a tremendous book. All that was needed  was a little objectivity and less socialist rancor (and I'm not saying this  because I'm some kind of right-wing Nazi, I enjoyed Howard Zinn's  \\"People's History of the US\\" as that was well-written and felt  like I wasn't being lectured to.).on the LAPD's aggressive policing policy of ghetto areas.

Hynd wastes six to seven chapters at the beginning of the book talking about the early history of the major leagues. He could have summed up how the NY Giants came about in a simple one or two chapters, and then got on with it. Add to this the short shrift he gives to one of the most exciting periods of NYC baseball (1946-57) by devoting only the last five chapters to this glorious ten-year period, leaves you a tad disappointed. Also, why not put an Appendix in chronicling the year-by-year standings and stats of the NY Giants to allow readers to follow along much easier the narrative as years tend to blend into years. Also, how could a book on the NY Giants not have a photo of \\"The Catch\\" by Willie Mays in the 1954 World Series? Dump even just one of those static team photos for this in the next edition, please. Overall, this could have been the definitive book on the NY Giants, but sadly it just needed to be edited to give it a tighter, leaner look and read. Lastly, I have one ?: On page 188 he writes, \\"Remember basketball's New York Tuck Tapers?\\" Well, I've never heard of them, yet he assumes we all have and does not explain who they were.	1998-09-14

Or stories like the weirdly wonderful Japanese businessman who built a &quot;shrine&quot; to James Dean near the spot on the fault where Dean crashed and burned...the list goes on and on.

If you really want the inside dope on how the Suns screwed up their championship hopes, read this book. It certainly paints Charles Barkley in a bad light, but then again he is not alone in the failure of the Suns to win the whole thing.<br /><br />So the book does do justice to not just explaining Sir Charles's last season w. Phx., but also the whole Barkley era in Phx.<br /><br /> As a big Barkley fan, it gave me pause for thought as to whether he has what it takes to win it all. No doubt he's a Hall of Fame player, a great jokester, but his dedication to winning it all seems lacking. Still he has given the game a whole lot more than most.<br /><br /> For that I am grateful and the book does show him warts and all to be one of the true characters of sports.<br /><br /> And these days we need guys like him to make sports fun!<br /><br /> Highly recommended even if you hate Sir Charles.	1997-09-11
