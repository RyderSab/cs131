But the book has to be catchy, full of wisdom, and preferably full of belly-laughs.  Mamas, this is the book for your boy!  It is full of more wisdom, wit, irony, and real laughs than almost anything else you can find.  He couldn't put it down.   <br />How much good did it do?

His textbook is very well set up and easy to work with.  I'm just a little old lady, but am able to grasp everything if I just re-read it often enough.  I'm nearing the end of the book, and have used the workbook all the way.  It's a good thing to have the exercises, and one thing that makes it actually fun is to recognize the verse you are translating.  I ask myself, is this cheating?  Well, you do have to know your New Testament for it to work well for you.       But, well, I do have to confess to being rather bored as chapters drag by, always seeing the exact same format for every one.  Having studied a number of other languages, and taught French,I am an old enough hand to believe that variety keeps the students coming back for more, and sameness becomes deadening after a while.         There could be some other types of exercises, even crossword puzzles or fill-in-the-blanks or choosing the correct form for a particular sentence.

They will give you good advice; they are all helpful and positive.  <br />I want to add to the voices that say, \\"This is a great book for self-learning.\\" <br />However, I have one little quibble:  having learned and taught other, modern languages and  Latin (which I detested),  I was expecting more drill-type exercises.  I'm old, 64, do not memorize easily, but still find that sometimes that is easier than learning a list of rules, and trying to apply them.  At Chapter 20, I am going back and writing out the declensions of all the nouns and conjugations of the verbs we have had up to here.  Maybe then it will \\"stick\\" better. <br />I love the fact that it's based on the New Testament, and that I know what the verses are, if only I can get started with each one.  It's a little like puzzles, and then, when it comes to the \\"Additional\\" work in the workbook - oh, didn't I say, you MUST get the workbook, too - the fact that many of the sentences and verses come from other sources is a nice challenge.  By that point, you would hope to have some grasp of the concepts being taught.  Still, here I am, going back to review the whole book.   <br />I just love Greek, though, and it must be because this is a great learning tool.	2005-03-21

I was the ultimate orchid wimp, a complete novice, when a friend sent me an encyclia last summer, and I panicked.  I bought the Ortho orchid book, and tried to find a decent place for my plant, then went so far as to buy two more orchids - NOT knowing they were ones that needed the exact opposite treatment from the first.  And THEN the same friend moved, and had some careless friends crate up 14 of her orchids and ship them off to ME!  They arrived in terrible condition, having fallen out of their pots, leaves crushed, roots torn, a MESS.  I had no space, no good light for them, not enough humidity, NOTHING.<BR>Well, enter Orchid Growing for Wimps.  It gave me not only information but confidence.  In particular, I commend it for having pictures of the complete plants, not just the flowers.  It really shows you how to perform many  necessary tasks, gives good tips on care of many common types of orchids.  It convinced me at last that I'd better splurge and buy a large, lighted case for my babies, and they are now quite happy and doing well.<BR>My only complaint, and it is unrealistic, is that this book doesn't cover all the thousands of varieties and their sometimes highly speccialized culture.  The remedy for that is - MORE BOOKS, never a bad thing!<BR>But if you can only buy one book, this one may be the most helpful one you can find.<br />review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening In God	2004-04-01

It is a study of the history and meaning and reason for contemplative prayer, deeply thought of, deeply experienced.  My little old copy is dogeared and heavily underlined, having been read so many times.  And it is not my first copy - I've given others to friends.<BR>As with much of Merton's writing, it is a tool for examining our own prayer, our own lives.  He shows us many ways we may be evading the very goal of our prayer, how we may be shielding ourselves from God's light shining upon us.<BR>Merton did not write this book in order to become popular.  It is not all sweetness and gentle breezes of the Spirit.  It is more like a cold wind that seeks to blow away our defenses and leave us face to face with what our souls really want - God.  Whether we enjoy the process is not the point, but a book like this lets us know that we are not alone on the path, that, tough as it is, others have gone before.  It gives comfort in the old English meaning of the word:  strengthening.  Read this if you need a good dose of spiritual tonic.<br />review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God	2002-11-09

If you are not &quot;into&quot; contemplation, why would you start to read this book?  That being said, however, Merton wrote the predecessor of this book, which was just called &quot;Seeds of Contemplation,&quot; after several years in a Trappist monastery.  This one came after several more years, and he was writing out of his personal experience, so it reflects a mature contemplative spirit and may be hard for the beginning pray-er to fully digest.<BR>Even so, there will be much here for anyone who aspires to or who is already experienced in centering prayer, Christian meditation, Prayer of the Heart.  Since it is arranged in fairly short chapters, the reader is free to float around looking for what he or she needs right now.  Of course, you may simply not like Thomas Merton!  But cruise through the book today, and come back to it a year from now.  And a year after that, and so on.  It will speak to you at ever new levels, and will provide you with spiritual food all along your way.<br />review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God	2002-11-09

I have read many, many books on the subject.  This one stands out a mile!<br />Written for present-day Christians (although there is plenty for followers of any spiritual path), The Critical Journey is clear, easy to read, well organized, and full of excellent advice and guidance.  It is obviously based upon the classic teachings about the progressive stages of inner growth, but the authors had digested all the information so thoroughly that it seems newly invented, created especially for people of our own day.<br />One point I have never seen explained anywhere before is that a person can easily identify the material that describes his or her place on the path right now, and can get some meaning from material about the next stage in order.  However, when she comes to a stage beyond that, it doesn't make any sense at all.  This is very true.  It explains why so much of what we read seems nonsensical, meaningless.<br />That being said, anyone can find sound advice, answers to many questions, and inspiration for continuing on the inner way to full maturity.<br />review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God	2002-11-09

You have heard a lot about St. Teresa of Avila.  After all, she was one of the first women ever named a Doctor (in the Latin meaning of &quot;teacher&quot;) of the Church.  But lo and behold, you have found her Life puzzling and The Interior Castle just about impossible to understand.<BR>Then this is the place to start.  Yes, Teresa was writing 400 and more years ago, and her audience was cloistered contemplative nuns.  But this was written almost like a letter.  The personal tone gives it great charm and readability.  Very little of it is hard to understand, and almost all of it can be applied to our lives here and now.<BR>My only difficulty with Peers' translation is the huge number of footnotes.  They would be invaluable to a scholar, but I can never keep myself from looking at them, and they are not really necessary or even helpful when your desire is to learn the spiritual wisdom of one of our greatest saints.  I love her and love this book, and highly recommend it.<br />review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God	2002-11-01

It emphasizes that both prayer and action are necessary to our inner growth, but without being dogmatic about any of it.  As a feeble student of John of the Cross, I find Green's clarification of his teachings very illuminating, but he makes Ignatius of Loyola appealing, too.  Green obviously lives what he is writing about, and makes it a personal, friendly lesson, one much easier to digest than either author alone.<BR>Each of Thomas Green's books is on a different aspect of the spiritual journey, and most people will be able to find guidance in one or another of them.

If you are genuinely determined to climb Mt. Carmel, to pray and live your way into God, you need to read and re-read John.  Like the Gospels, his work is dense and allusive, and full of layer upon layer of meaning.  It is well to read present day authors who write about his work, too.  But by no means should you leave him aside in your search for information and inspiration.  There is no one else like him.

The depth of his experience will impress you.  The sheer beauty of his message will convince you.  John Main is without doubt one of the greatest modern masters of prayer.<BR>His teaching is about Christian Meditation.  That is the term he used for the deep interior prayer form, based upon use of a \\"Christian mantra\\" which he taught until his untimely death in 1982  He had learned to meditate while living in Asia, from a Buddhist monk.  When he returned to England, he found that such meditation was frowned upon by Western Christian religious, although it is not much different from the Jesus Prayer used for centuries in the Eastern Church.<BR>Over a long period, his superiors became convinced of his orthodoxy, and they even made it his task to spread the practice of this truly Christian prayer form.  He had by then read and studied many early Christian writers, and in his writing often refers to John Cassian and others, indicating that this is, indeed, a prayer like that used by Christians from the earliest times.  It had unfortunately become submerged for a few centuries, but Main was among the leaders in re-introducing a way of prayer accessible to everyone.  <BR>His writing is clear and will inspire you, be you a rank beginner or one far along on the path. <br />review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God	2002-10-31

What was it about this man?  Women, Protestants, the unchurched, all sorts of people who are outwardly nothing like him, yet feel a strange, strong kinship.  People have even told me what Merton would be doing if he were alive right now, as if they could know!  <BR>Reading this volume I understood anew how this is so.  Merton wrote his soul, he wrote his life.  We ARE THERE as we read it.  I actually find answers to some of my life questions as I share the life of this Trappist monk.  Many other people do, too.  <BR>This book is helpful because it puts so much of Thomas Merton's life between its covers.
