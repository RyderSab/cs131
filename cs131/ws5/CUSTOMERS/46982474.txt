The main character, Sarah, is extremely likeable and her family is even better! I have seen some reviews who say the characters were underdeveloped and I don't feel that way at all. I think their personalities were very dynamic and it was easy to get a quick perception of them. Sometimes things are better implied, instead of blatant.<br />The best part of the book for me was Sarah Hurlihy's big irish american family.  I wanted to be a part of it!

When I first heard of the book, I was excited! I thought this was going to be a story about a woman just like me, a stay at home mom with dreams of a career but also the desire to stay home and raise her own children. Sure, I identifed with Amanda a little, but I also felt like she just complained too much. Of course, it's incredibly hard to give up your job, and of course, it's even tougher to stay home all day with children, but she could have applied herself a little more and did more with her life! I was just frustrated! I wante Amanda to inspire me, to fill me with gratitude because I have these precious moments at home. I wanted her to prove that you can have a life and have children too. <br />Needless to say, I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to, but maybe that was the point the author was trying to make... You can't have everything. However, my philosophy is a little different... enjoy what you do have.	2004-06-14
US	46982474	R19JLXHAPB65WT	0060091428	991640158	The Wild Irish	Books	5	2	3	N	N	The Irish Pirate Queen	The legend of Grace O'Malley, Pirate Queen of Ireland, has been told by many Irish storytellers. Her story has been passed on from generation to generation, inspiring awe and gratitude in the hearts of many. However, you won't see this remarkable woman's tale in many history texts. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if few people outside of Ireland have ever even heard of her. This amazing woman, who fought for her beloved country, has been forgotten or simply overlooked by many history professors. Why? Why else? She was a woman in a man's world. <br />The story of Grace O'Malley is an astonishing one. She was a daughter, a mother, a wife and lover. But, most of all, Grace O'Malley was a fighter. She was Ireland's saving grace for years during the English invasion of the 1500's.  She fought side by side with men to defend her beautiful homeland. The daughter of a pirate and a one herself, she was well equipped to fight and battled with everything she had. <br />Robin Maxwell's novel The Wild Irish is a historical account of this woman's life and the life of another female figure of the times, Queen Elizabeth. In this book, the aging Grace and Queen Elizabeth meet secretly to discuss the ongoing tragedies occurring in Ireland. The women come to an agreement, but will they keep their word? The destinies of two countries lie in their hands.<br />The book is an extraordinary read. This version of the O'Malley tale is quite intriguing. A sizeable part of the story is told in Grace's own narrative. As she speaks, you can't help but be whisked back in time to accompany her on all her past adventures. She is, somehow, rough, abrasive, and gentle altogether as she tells her side of the conflict.<br /> As a reader, you are also allowed a peek into the minds of several other characters, including the Lord Deveraux, Queen Elizabeth's trusted confidante and ex-lover. Robert Deveraux, owing a great deal to the Queen, is sent to Ireland to quell the uprising of the Irish. Will he remain loyal to England or be swayed by the persuasive Grace O'Malley and her kin?<br />Robin Maxwell has written a fantastic epic, rich in history and legend. However, you may need to take a few notes. The characters can become confusing. The clans in Ireland during the 1500's were quite numerous and it can be difficult to keep track of them all. In spite that, though, the novel is a marvelous piece of literature and should be on the reading list of anyone who loves Irish or historical fiction. When you are finished, pass the book on.  Spread the word of this amazing woman who is often forgotten in the rich pages of history.	2004-01-14

I bought this book in hopes of an uplifting Christmas themed story. Well, Bah-Humbug! This one just didn't do it for me. I love Jude Deveraux's work and had high hopes for this one. Unfortunatly, it let me down. Maybe it's me, maybe the stress of the season leaves me unable to fully enjoy a book, but I just couldn't \\"get into\\" this one. The story feels rushed, too much too soon, especially where sex scenes are concerned. Don't get me wrong, I am all for a good sexy read, but I was looking for a more sweet type of love for a holiday book. The cover felt slightly decieving to me as well. It looked as if it was set in another time period. If someone who had just picked it up for that reason, they would be disappointed. The title character, Holly herself, just wasn't all that likeable either. She wanted to marry a man for his house. Nick was decietful and seemed to have alot of extra time on his hands. I had a hard time figuring out why he was pretending to be who he was. All in all, I just didn't understand this book. I wanted something with a little redeeming quality to it. Check out Jude Deveraux's other works though, they are fantastic.	2003-12-23

Hmm.. something tells me that Amtrack's PR department had a little something to do with this book! This book reads like an ad for Amtrack. Having never read any of David Baldacci's other works, I bought this book because of the Christmas theme. I was really hoping for a heartwarming story about the holidays. Although it is set in a christmas setting, it's mostly about the train! A little bit of Amtrack history would have been interesting, but it feels overdone to me. <br />I did enjoy the love story aspect to it, but it really wasn't as developed as it could have been. All in all, The Christmas Train was an average read. A nice read for the holidays, when concentration is at a minimum!	2003-12-18

Her lover has jilted her at the first words of the unwanted pregnancy. Esther is left alone to deal with the scandal. However, the only people Esther expected help from, her family, are ashamed and resentful. Her mother and brothers banish her from the home, sending her to Dublin.<br />Esther's new home is The Magdalen Home for Wayward and Fallen Home. A laundry, run by nuns, is where she will earn her keep. When her nine months have passed, her baby will taken from her and given up for adoption. Esther and the other women work long, hard hours on their feet and are under the constant watch of the nuns. The women live the lives of prisoners. There is no recreation, no fun. The women are there to pay penance for their sins and ask God for forgiveness. However, these women, otherwise knows as &quot;The Maggies&quot; manage to form strong frienships. Their companionship allows Esther to fight her way out of a deep depression and struggle to reclaim her life. The Maggies help Esther to realize that her baby deserves a happy life and so does she.<br />I have read quite a few books about the famous &quot;Magdalen Laundries&quot; that were once popular in Ireland. Many are dark and depressing. However, The Magdalen, is slightly more uplifting than most. Of course, this is not exactly a happy story, but these laundries did exist and it is something that many people have never heard of.	2003-12-03

Thanks for realizing that chick lit fans want something with heart. This book is so different from other books I have read of this genre! It's dark and uplifting at the same time, suprising and touching. Lindsay Faith Rech has created a unique story with a character we can all relate to on some level. <br />Diana Christopher is overweight. She works nights as a truck stop waitress. She lives alone. She does not have a network of loving girlfriends that she can confide in. She has no friends, expect for the elderly woman living in the apartment below her. She had one sexual experience in high school and has been celibate ever since. She is sad,lonely and desperate for her life to change. Through a number of ephipanies, she finally realizes that her life is worth living. Don't expect your typical \\"ugly-duckling into a swan\\" storyline here. This story is not just about looks. Diana becomes a new person. Her transformation is inspiring. Looks are part of it, yes, but it's also alot more than that. Read this book and witness it for yourself. I really hope that Red Dress Ink continues to seek out new authors with original stories to tell. Keep up the good work!!	2003-11-27

I was very intrigued by The Time Traveler's Wife when I first saw it announced as the Today Show Book Club pick for October. The story seemed so unique and fresh. I find it amazing when an author can come up with an inventive, new concept to base a novel on. It seems to me that in this day and age many authors &quot;borrow&quot; ideas from their rivals, or simply just recycle an old plot to make it seem fresh. That's not the case with Audrey Niffenegger. This first time novelist manages to create a unique character with an unheard of medical condition. Henry is a CDP, Chronologically Displaced Person. Henry spends his life with the constant fear that he will suddenly time travel to another era of his life. His wife meets him in an orchard when she is 6 and his 36. He doesn't actually &quot;meet&quot; her until years later when he is in his twenties. Doesn't make sense? Don't worry, read the book and it will all come together.<br />This book is thick, with a very complicated story. You will find yourself slightly confused at times, wondering where in life Henry's disorder has placed him. Keep reading. Although it may feel as if you are trying to fit together some strange puzzle of time and places, they do connect, creating a beautiful and absolutley exceptional novel. The prevailing concept that I took with me from reading this book is that love can stand the test of time. In fact, in the case of Henry and Clare, love is absolutley timeless.	2003-11-02

I am fan of the Red Dress Ink line, and rate most of them at least 4 stars. However, this book just wasn't as good as the others. I bought it because I liked the fact that it was two books in one. It reminded me of those \\"He said, She books\\" I used to read as a preteen. But these are two totally different books, and I think that's the problem. Becase of the two book format, the stories were short. The characters felt undeveloped. Too much drama in a small book just seems a little overwhelming. I felt as if I need more information and reasoning to why the two female characters acted the way they did. <br />I loved Erica Orloff's Spanish Disco (also Red Dress Ink) and this book just didn't measure up.	2003-10-28

First of all, I want to say that I think Alice Hoffman is one of our generation's most talented authors. Her books are incredible, filled with insight, magic and beautiful settings. I truly think that her books will stand the test of time and enchant readers for years to come.<br />Now, that said, I was slightly disapointed with Blue Diary. I enjoyed it, but it didn't cast that magical spell on me the way her other books have. My favorite aspect of Alice Hoffman's books has always been the mystical qualities that her charcters seem to have, and I didn't find that in this book. The characters were likeable, but not exactly enthralling. The story was interesting, but it did not keep me up all night trying to finish it. I was impressed, again, by her writing skills, but I just felt the story was a little weak. <br />However, do not let this book hinder you from reading her other books. Try Practical Magic, The Probable Future and Turtle Moon. Alice Hoffman's talent is immense. She may not have hit a home run with Blue Diary, but she has an incredible history of fantastic books. Try one of those instead.	2003-10-26

The Carter Street Hangman is a fabulous start to a wonderful collection of crime mysteries.<br />What I found so refreshing about this book was that fact that it was so calm, so sophisticated. Because of it's Victorian setting there were no gunshots, no foul language or explicit sex scenes. Even though the characters were watching their servants, neighbors and family members die at the hands of a madman, they remain composed and somewhat calm. The high society Ellison family faces these deaths with a sense of purpose as well as dignity.<br />The romance between Charlotte Ellison and police officer, Thomas Pitt begins to take place in this book, and by the end pages a true partnership is made. The sweet love affair between these two characters lends an enchanting twist to the story.<br />Historical fiction and mystery lovers, you will find the perfect mix of both genres in this book.

Full of irish scenery, small villages, friendly people and romance, The Delaney Woman is a perfect example of irish storytelling. Jeanette Baker manages to mix the aspects of a murder mystery with sweet romance and family tradition perfectly to create a book well worth it's cover price. <br />Kelly Delaney is a broken woman when she returns to Ireland to search for clues in the death of her brother and nephew.

The stories all tie together, but you can read them individually and still follow along perfectly. One hilarious, short chapter follows another. <br />The most amazing aspect of this book is just how real it is. Laurie says things that we all laugh about behind closed doors, when the &quot;real us&quot; is cut loose. Embarrassing &quot;booger jokes&quot; and &quot;jelly roll bellies&quot; are thrown together with mortage horror stories and new marriages, to make an altogether perfect novel.

When I found out that Judy Blume was publishing a new book after many years, I almost ran to the bookstore! I truly believe that Judy Blume is a voice for my generation. I grew up reading her preteen books and I am still a fan! I think she says what we are all thinking, but afraid to say. She writes about things that we keep hidden, thoughts that we didn't even know we had. Summer Sisters is just another work of art from this talented writer.<br />    I recently read this book again when it was chosen for my book club. I was not disapointed the second time around. Reading it twice gave me even more insight into the characters, each one more interesting than the next.<br />The book focuses on Caitlin Summers. She's self centered and spoiled and looking for trouble. The story starts when she is just a young girl of 12, and follows her and the whilrwind she creates until she is 30. She affects everyone around her in some way, and readers get a chance to hear the story told in each characters point of view. The one point of view we don't get, is Caitlin herself. Her motives, thoughts and inner thoughts remain a mystery.<br />The most intriguing character that is affected by Caitlin is her &quot;Summer Sister&quot; Vix. She's shy, quiet and introverted.

I was on the waiting list at the library for this book for over a month. When it was finally my turn I was so excited. I was really hoping that I would be able to identify with this book. I am a work from home mom. I was hoping to get some insight into how other stay at home moms feel. I was looking for a book that I would get sucked into because I could relate to it. Not true for this book. I tried and tried to keep reading, but I was bored. There was too much talk about the law case that Amanda's husband was working on. There was too much talk about what everyone else was doing. I wanted to know what Amanda was doing, how Amanda was feeling. I wanted a book that truly explained what it feels like to be a stay at home mom and have an actual life. I was disappointed.	2003-08-23

I had looked at this book on the store shelves for months now, and just now picked it up. I wish I hadn't waited so long! If you are doing the same thing, picking it up and putting it back on the shelf, STOP! BUY THIS BOOK! I was amazed at how quickly I was pulled into this amazing book. The story is told through the eyes of a young headmistress, Louisa Barret. She is softspoken, ladylike, and reserved, but her closet is overflowing with skeletons. She soon becomes involved in a series of murder investigations and learns that all is not as it seems in Buffalo New York.  The story is amazing with twist and turns around every corner, all told in the quiet, softspoken voice of a turn of the century woman. GET THIS BOOK! IT IS AMAZING!! The last few pages alone are worth the cover price!	2003-08-06

If I am bored after 50 pages, I put the book down and slowly back away. Sadly, this book was one of THOSE books. I just couldn't interest myself in the story. Now, I am one of those american's who devour just about anything british,(um... hence, the name...) but even that aspect of the book couldn't keep me reading. I was bored and couldn't have cared less about the characters. I hate to give a bad review, but if you are searching for something in the lighthearted, chick lit category, this is not what you are looking for.	2003-07-23

(come on, asking a booklover who her favorite author is compares to asking a mother which is her favorite child...)<br />Snap Happy was the first Fiona Walker book I read, and I paid a fortune for it at amazon.co.uk! But it was well worth the price. Juno is hilarious. I love the fact that she is a stand up comedian. Most chick lit novels are based on women who work in advertising or publishing. She is a unique character and very loveable. I am so glad to see that Fiona Walker books are available in the us now! Now you can all bask in Ms. Walker's glory!	2003-07-20

Don't get me wrong, I love it. I enjoy reading funny, romantic books. It's nice to read something for the pure escapism. However, a person can only take so much of the same story. They are all the same, Girls meets boy, girl gets dumped, girl loses weight, boy gets jealous and girl meets new boy.  Enough already! Lets get some new plot lines! Thank goodness, B.D Gardner must have felt the same way! This author has come up with a new idea.. the main character in this book has self confidence. She is already beautiful. She's friendly, she's approachable and open minded. She doesn't spend the whole time whining to her gay (male) best friend and she doesn't try to lose weight and stop smoking. She is sporty and healthy. Best of all she meets a great guy who can all root for. Buy this book, rebel against your average chick lit!!!	2003-07-20

Well, I have read the several &quot;not so good&quot; reviews of this book, and I can't believe it! I loved this book! I don't know if it was the online journal aspect, or the humor, or just the writing itself, but I thouroughly enjoyed this book. I loved Anna, she was so normal. She was flawed, and goofy and had smelly feet. She was loveable and sweet and funny, and innocent. I know this sounds so cliche but, I actually laughed out loud in some places and cried in others. Pamela Ribon, I think you are so talented!	2003-07-17

I have never read any Emilie Richards books before and I simply fell in love the cover and picked it up. The book just looked so welcoming with the pretty red door, I wanted to peek inside and see what was going on behind it. I was not dissapointed. I was hooked from the first page. The story of Faith and her family kept me turning the pages, staying up late, and taking way too lengthy lunch breaks at work! This book is full of heartache, mystery, love and family drama. Emilie Richards develops her characters so well, you can't help but keep reading. The characters come alive off the page. By the time you finish this book you will feel like a member of Faith's family, or at least a close friend. Buy this book! It may have a great cover but it has an even better story inside!	2003-07-08

I was really late to jump on this bandwagon, I know, but I really did love this book. I have known about the series for a long time, and it's always been one of those books on my &quot;I'll get to it one day list&quot;, but I am glad I bumped it up to the top! I am not a mystery lover, but this one was different. Lots of humor, laugh out loud sarcasm and a great story to boot! What more can you ask for? For those of you who are into romances, and chick lit books, try this one for a change of pace!	2003-06-15

I have heard some readers complain that it wasn't long enough or the characters weren't developed enough, but I thought that those things added to the mystery of the story. I like the fact that we as reader were open to imagine the background stories of many characters. <br />This book is small, but very enjoyable. Perfect for a nice cozy evening by the fire.	2003-02-24

I just didn't love it. It's a great, easy read with likeable, funny characters and lots of humor. The format is in email style which is a nice change of pace. Get this book if you are looking for a funny, light beach read. If you are looking for literary genious.. well, look somewhere else. But hey, what's wrong with having some fun once in awhile?	2003-02-19

I was expecting your run of the mill \\"chick lit\\" type story, but that is definitly not the case!It has much more heart than that! This story revolves around Jennifer, who lost her sister to suicide. As Jennifer tries to make her way as a New York playwright, she also has to overcome her fear and apprehensions about sex, love and relationships. This is no tawdry, sex filled beach book! It's much better than that!	2003-02-08

I have caught myself laughing out loud many times, (and that can be really embarrassing while in public!) and I can't help thinking that this book would make a fantastic movie. It's that funny. The women in this book all have major physcological problems, but when they team up  they don't seem so crazy.

It was just easy to read, with likeable characters that you wanted to know more about. I could have kept right on reading! The best thing about this book is it made me want to find my old girlfriends. It made me miss those late night chats and junk food binges. This story is mostly about friendship and the importance of it in our lives. We all make mistakes and go through rough times, but your friends are there to back you up.If you enjoy books about young women and friendship, this book is for you. If you miss your old girlfriends or cherish the ones you still have, read this book. You just may be calling them up when you're done!	2003-01-23

I had imagined that this would be a book about three young girls, growing up in a boarding school. I imagined a little love story, maybe a little drama. I had no idea what I was getting into. Don't get me wrong, once I let my expectations go, I loved it! This book is not about boarding school. Its not your average love story. This books is filled with mystery. Glenallen is a mystical place, filled with folk lore and legends. Ghost, strange deaths, and irish myths play starring roles, not young girls growing up together and overcoming small tragedies. There is nothing small or insignificant in this book. If you are looking for a haunting tale with lots of mystery and irish folklore, get this book!	2003-01-18

I have been a fan since I first read City Girls a few years ago and I have read everything she has published since then. I love her work and her stories always hook me in immediately. This book was no different.<br />From reading the book jacket, you would think that this is your average, run of the mill, divorce story. Bitterness, fights, heatrbeak and trauma. But its much more than that. I think this story was oddly uplifting. A dependent woman learns to stand on her own two feet. She suffers a terrible tragedy but learns that she make something of herself. This is her chance to become the type of woman she always admired. There is lots of drama and heartbreak along the way, making this an inticing read. I definitly recommend it anyone, not just fans of  Maeve Binchy. I think that Patricia Scanlan is in a category all her own!	2003-01-10

If you love to discuss books you have read, write reviews, or just plain like to see all the books you have read listed in one place, get this journal. You feel a sense of pride as the pages fill up. I also love the fact that there is a page where you can list you book goals. I used this section to list all the books that I have always wanted to read, but never quite got to.

I have read and loved everything she has published. I am waiting with baited breath for her next novel. Her books are down to earth and funny but still have lots of heart. <br />Even though this book does not include the wonderful Walsh Family, as in some of her other books, I loved it.

She says what many mothers feel, but are afraid to say. It's hard being a working mother. It's hard being a mother, period. But can we really have it all? A high-flying career and a balanced family life? Unlike some other reviews I have read, I won't give away the ending to this book. But what I can say is that I realize what a struggle it is to be a mother. That's what this book is about. This book is about real life, like it or not. Of course, this book's ending may raise a few eyebrows, but that's what I liked about it. I loved the ending, I may not have made the same decision as Kate Reddy if I were her, but I respect her for it. <br />If you are a mother, plan on being one, have a mother, know a mother, or are just plain curious about motherhood, read this book. I commend Allison Pearson for writing about reality, not some storybook romance where everything is \\"happily ever after\\".	2003-01-06

I loved the premise of the book, and it seemed to have a good heart to it. However, it was just too wordy for me. I think with a little more editing, I would have loved it.

I don't think that many of us(americans) realize just how brutal it was. This book brought it all to life for me. The poverty and starvation was shocking, but through it all, babies were born, people fell in love, people died. Life continued and this is the story of one woman's struggle through it. Gracelin is such a strong character, I can't wait to read more about her in the sequel, Leaving Ireland.	2002-12-30

I was very eager to read along with her book club and could not wait to start  this book. However, I was really disappointed. I realize The Bachelor was chosen because it is a easy and light read, but it was a little too light for me. The story was very predictable. I could pretty much figure out how it was going to end from the first few pages. I could have given this book an even lower rating, but it does have some redeeming qualities. The Bachelor is a great \\"beach book\\". Its simple to read, not alot of concentration involved. The sex scenes are very explicit, just what you need in a summer novel. I can't say that this book has alot of great literary content, but its a great \\"in-between\\" book. I sometimes like to read something easy as a break from heavier, more serious novels. As a whole, it was a nice break, but not something I can really recommend to serious readers.	2002-07-11

Why must they always hold on to the remote control? Why can they only talk during commercials, even when they are watching reruns? Why do they hate shopping with us? What exactly do they do in those electronics stores for hours? Why wont they commit? Mike Gayle gives a little insight in his book, Mr. Commitment. This is the story of Ben Duffy, and young comedian struggling to come to grips with his commitment phobia. His girlfriend, Mel, is ready for marriage, but is he?<br />This book was a big surprise to me. I really didnt expect to enjoy it as much as I did. I tend to usually read only female authors. I identify with them more, but this book was just what I needed. It was great to get the male perspective on relationships. Men and women will never fully understand each other, but it's nice to know that we all have the same doubts and worries. I will definitly be looking for more from Mike Gayle.	2002-07-10
