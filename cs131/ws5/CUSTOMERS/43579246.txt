To scan the list of publications prefacing her seventeenth collection of poems is to feel small jolts of recognition - one title recalling the moment when your sense of what it meant to be a daughter, wife, mother, self, or mind abruptly veered into dangerous new territory, and another evoking a whole decade of the American century. How bracing her tenacity has been, and how courageous her changes.  <br />In 1951, at the age of twenty-two, Rich received the coveted Yale Younger Poets award for poems W. H. Auden patted on the back because they &quot;are neatly and modestly dressed, speak quietly but do not mumble, [and] respect their elders.&quot; Twelve years later her &quot;Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law&quot; shocked readers with its broken prosodies and epiphanies of women's experience in a sexist society. &quot;Diving Into the Wreck&quot; (1973), &quot;The Dream of a Common Language&quot; (1978), &quot;A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far&quot; (1981), &quot;Your Native Land, Your Life&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Dark Fields of the Republic&quot; (1995) have established Rich as an activist writer of impressive reach and power. Despite crippling rheumatoid arthritis and looming despair at the degradations of language and the sociopolitical scene at the millennium, she's still here. Still talking.<br />And still making waves: two years ago Rich refused the President's prestigious National Medal for the Arts because of what she called, in a speech at the University of Massachusetts, the fracturing of our social contract by &quot;the omnivorously acquisitive few&quot; who preside over &quot;a dwindling middle class and a multiplying number of ill-served, throwaway citizens and workers.&quot; While many readers honor Rich's public stance against injustice, some deplore the entrance of such themes into her poetry, arguing that artmust transcend the political to be universal and enduring. <br />In Rich's case, what transcends politics is the voice at the center of her work: an ethical consciousness in the act of resolutely finding a way through terrible difficulties. Refusing to be distracted, she thinks and feels along the labyrinth, fully aware that whatever waits around the bend - barricade, abyss, torturer's knife, knowledge - can kill the spirit. The thing can't be foreseen or forestalled, either, without compromising the whole endeavor. Yet &quot;Look: with all my fear I'm here with you, trying what it / means, to stand fast; what it means to move.&quot;<br />&quot;Midnight Salvage&quot; is muted and elliptical because the experiences of individuals and the forces impinging on them have become harder to pinpoint. They're like water to a fish trying to identify the medium that presses evenly on all sides and supplies all sustenance. The home we live and breathe in is inchoately oppressive - a supersaturated marketplace where events, ideas, rights, governments, peoples, selves, health, oceans, the air, and the words that might tell them true are traded like consumables. Can we know the water we swim in? Rich writes less to galvanize or muster than to awaken. <br />So the poems read like bulletins from an elusive front, most of them linked in loose bluesy sequences, and punctuated by gaps or paired colons reminiscent of empty boxes - for the disappeared, perhaps, for all the solid assurances that have melted into air. Brilliant glimpses remind us why we want to be awake and alive, like the osprey rising over foggy Tomales Bay and its young &quot;in the windy nest / creaking there in their hunger,&quot; and like the older woman's amazed, half-protective-half-exultant memory of her adolescent self: <br />&quot;What a girl I was then what a body / ready for breaking / open like a lobster / what a little provincial village  / what a book I made myself / what a quicksilver study  / What agirl pelican-skimming over fear what a mica lump splitting / into tiny sharp-edged mirrors through which / the sun's eclipse could seem normal  / eager to sink / to be found / what a mass of swimmy legs&quot;<br />When &quot;You cannot eat an egg / You don't know where it's been,&quot; still, &quot;Unstupefied not unhappy / we braise wild greens and garlic / feed the feral cats / and when the fog's irregular documents break open / scan its fissures for young stars.&quot;<br />One or two catalogs seem facile, a few formal repetitions verge on sentimentality (&quot;I'll find you  I find you&quot;; &quot;I would look long  long I'd look&quot;), but these are cavils. An original voice and a scrupulously precise, penetrating mind are still on the urgent prowl, &quot;seizing the light / of creation / giving it back to its creatures // headed under the earth.&quot;	2001-07-28

His inspiration to write \\"Conditions of Faith\\" came from his mother's journal, which he found after her death. From entries his mother made about her experiences as a young woman living in Paris during the 1920s, his novel's restless heroine was born.<br />Emily Stanton is a bright 25-year-old Australian with eager dreams of making a brave, original life for herself. In the tradition of George Eliot's Middlemarch and Henry James's Portrait of a Lady, her story turns on the irony that a woman's very determination to transcend the world's conventional restrictions can blind her to the realities hidden behind her bravest choices. As Emily tries to make herself a character in a life story that will be uniquely true to her desires, she gets tangled in the narratives of other persons.<br />It's 1923, and Emily meets Georges, a promising architect ten years her senior who has come to Australia from Paris to brainstorm designs for the proposed Sydney Harbor Bridge, which will be the longest in the world. Although Emily might have embarked on a career of her own - she earned a First in history at Cambridge -she rejects that possibility to marry Georges.<br />This hardly sounds like an iconoclastic role choice for a woman desiring freedom. But Emily makes her decision on impulse, and very much against her father's expectation that she'll pursue a brilliant scholarly career. To her, rebelling against her father is a radical gesture that throws off a great burden. She won't surrender to family demands; she'll find her own purpose in life. And she'll do it in Paris!<br />Emily soon discovers family demands everywhere. Georges takes her to Chartres, where she meets his mother. This woman has always dominated her son's life, and she makes sure Emily knows that his ancestors' names appear in the 12th-centuryrecords of the great cathedral. Emily, vexed at her mother-in-law's arrogance and at her husband's blindness to her misery, has a fling at Chartres that complicates the rest of her life. The story is full of unexpected turns that take Emily all the way to Tunisia and the archaeological dig at Carthage, where history finally becomes more than an academic subject and takes on vital meaning for her.<br />Throughout the novel we meet intriguing characters, including Emily's powerful yet vulnerable father, and her mother, a woman of moral weight and wit who sees clearly and won't mince words. Georges' friend Antoine becomes Emily's confidant in Paris, and he's a terrific talker. So are others who play major supporting roles in the book, like the Paris doctor Leon, the Arab archaeologist Hakim, and the scholar Olive Kallam.<br />This strength is also a weakness in the narrative. You'd think a heroine in a novel full of conversation, who is described as assertive and intelligent, would speak up. But all the other characters talk more than she, and more interestingly.<br />Still, regardless of who's speaking at a given moment, the writing is provocative and absorbing on subjects ranging from Arab politics to the politics of motherhood, from freedom of choice to purpose in life.<br />For example: Is finding no purpose in life more frightening than finding a purpose that wholly takes it over? Can ambition substitute for purpose? Georges' ambition to build a fabulous bridge doesn't lead him to ask about what purpose it might serve - - a question that \\"'involves a kind of moral uncertainty  for which Georges possesses no curiosity.'\\"<br />But is purpose really different from ambition, or desire? Perhaps \\"'all passions are the same passion'\\" in that \\"'our passions always require from us a betrayal of our former state.'\\"<br />This kind of talk makes you glad \\"Conditions of Faith\\" can't be described as a page-turner. You want to put this book down and think about it.	2001-07-27

Most Americans believe that people should grow up to be autonomous individuals through the sustained exercise of personal will and effort. \\"A General Theory of Love\\" is an un-American book. <br />Lewis, Amini, and Lannon, all psychiatrists, argue that we develop confidence, happiness, and feelings of independent competence only through ongoing dependencies within intimate human relationships. True maturity is achieved not by scorning dependency but by continually satisfying our need for it throughout our lives. <br />Of course, op-ed writers tell us that children need time with attentive relatives instead of with TVs and computers, and psychologists commenting on recent school shootings theorize that teenagers with violent tendencies lack strong, healthy bonds with their families. \\"A General Theory of Love\\" takes such ideas further and grounds them in brain research made possible by new technologies. <br />Recent research into the physiology of the limbic brain is especially revealing, says the book. Scientists once believed that this part of the brain only coordinated sensations from the external world and internal organs. But recent brain-wave experiments show that experience lays down patterns in the limbic brain which regulate our emotions, and that these patterns change and grow throughout our lives.<br />Thus our nervous systems are not autonomous or self-contained, but continually rewired by intimacy with others. No wonder two lovers feel like one person: their closeness forms new psychic patterns in both. No wonder psychotherapy takes time: we heal by connecting with healthy therapists long enough for our minds to become more like theirs. <br />This persuasive, moving book is wise about the heart as well as the nervous system. But the writing can be exasperatingly verbose. Sometimes Lewis whips a sentence to a froth as if hoping the jargon will vanish among the bubbles; sometimes he just seems anxious to impress. If he listened to his prose as attentively as he listens to his clients, he'd create stronger, healthier bonds with his readers, but despite the book's overwrought style its fascinating content makes it well worth reading.	2001-07-27

Based on her origins, Jiang Ching should have grown up to be a foot warmer for a rich man's children. Yet she became Madame Mao Tse-tung, the most powerful woman China ever produced. In Anchee Min's historical novel we learn that Jiang's mother was the bed-slave of a brutal village businessman -- she called herself \\"a radish pickled in the sauce of misery.\\" Her daughter's only protection against a future of grinding drudgery was to have the \\"lotus feet\\" that would disable her for heavy work and make her a catch for a rich man -- if not as a potential bride, at least as a concubine. But four-year-old Jiang tore off her binding cloths and swore she'd kill herself if her mother bound her feet again. Thus began a public career of astounding feminine self-assertion unknown in China since the 7th century's notorious Empress Wu. <br />According to Min's novel, Jiang's grandfather told the girl she was \\"a peacock among hens\\" and taught her classical operas that featured ancient heroes including \\"women who fight fiercely for their happiness.\\" At 14, Jiang ran off to join an itinerant opera troupe. In five years she had become a Shanghai actress who wrote Communist operas in which memories of her father's violence against her mother were transformed into scenes of heroines fighting on despite wounds dripping with gore. <br />Min traces Jiang's erotic life through early romances, short-lived marriages, and a love-hate affair with the Communist Party. In 1937 -- Jiang was 23 -- she arrived in the harsh mountains of rural China where Mao Tse-tung was fomenting revolution. She flaunted \\"the brightest eyes men here [had] ever seen\\" to \\"catch the heart of their god,\\" and within a year she was Madame Mao, determined to play a starring role in national politics. Among other things \\"the white-boned demon\\" would spark the Cultural Revolution, back her husband's bloodiest moves against rivals, and punish her own enemies, real and imagined, with cold delight.<br />Jiang Ching's driveand deeds were shocking, but she inspired many women of mid-century China, including Anchee Min. As a member of the Red Guard during the Sixties, Min knew Jiang's operas by heart and auditioned for one of her propaganda films. In a recent interview Min said she wanted her novel to present the human side of Jiang Ching; as a result, perhaps, her central theme is that Jiang's childhood pain and humiliation left her with deep-seated needs to validate herself through displays of power and achievement. <br />Indeed, Min's novel becomes a virtual case history of the cruel forms grandiosity can take when born of shame. But psychological approaches to fiction can be reductive, and sometimes Min is so busy explaining Jiang's character she fails to create it. She tells us Jiang plays roles because she \\"can't be satisfied with who she is\\" and details \\"how the father plants the seed of worthlessness\\" in his daughter. Interpretation replaces the random, ordinary glimpses that register on a living mind, like those in Min's 1994 memoir, \\"Red Azalea\\"-- the father's bandaged fingers, the bearded hen, the rough factory women chattering in the family courtyard. Also distracting are Min's continual shifts between omniscient and first-person points of view. These dramatize the conflicting aims of any historical novelist--to be true to the facts, and to make the facts live in a fiction-lover's imagination. But arbitrary switches between \\"she\\" and \\"I\\" without consistent, parallel changes in voice or outlook don't solve the problem.<br />Still, \\"Becoming Madame Mao\\" is a vivid description of a time and place about which many Americans know little. Its spirited, research-based narrative sweeps us right into modern China's political torrents and a woman's raging need for approval. Min succeeds in humanizing Jiang, if only because it's hard not to feel for someone married to the husband from Hell -- Mao has mossy teeth and secret syphilis, he \\"practices longevity\\" with virgins herded in fromthe countryside, and he endlessly, numbingly intones self-important sentiments like \\"'I am a mythological pillar born to hold up the heavens. But without you I can only be a chopstick.'\\" Luckily, there are also exquisite passages like the one on Jiang's uneasy obsessions:  a \\"ghost opens a kitchen in her mind and cooks.\\" With writing like this, we can stand the heat.	2001-07-27

For more than a century, according to Deborah Willis, curator of photography at the Smithsonian, black photographers deliberately used their work to counter prevailing racial stereotypes and enhance racial pride. Her monumental portfolio of photographs by these artists, studio owners, and itinerant \\"painters with light\\" does more than counter stereotypes; it defies attempts to generalize about its subject. <br />People in this arresting collection of pictures are caught up in all kinds of ordinary pursuits--reading, working, dining, marrying, praying, talking, playing games, posing in lovely clothes, getting haircuts, making music or speeches or dinner--in a spirited, generally trustful relationship with the camera. Clearly Willis's criterion as she selected photographs was, as she says in the text, \\"expressive power.\\" <br />Still, white Americans viewing these pictures are likely to bring to the experience the same old images of slavery, Civil Rights marches, and past or present media caricatures of black life that they've drawn from school and popular culture all their lives. Perhaps the delightful photographs of children in the book will take on ominous overtones because we know of future trials the childish mind can't predict. But such a reaction can keep us from realizing that what's on the child's mind may be partly the point. <br />For example, two Boston children have been posed in front of ornate ironwork, wearing starched lace dresses (it's 1910) and starched bows in their hair. They look beautiful--and stiff, and miserable! Good little girls, they've let Mother dress them up today, but they seem to want to tear off those enormous bows, jump the iron fence, and tumble around on the grass like anyone else their age. <br />Another example: Malcolm X crouches to hold his two daughters in his arms. He's talking to little Attallah, his eyes warmly upon her. But she turns away from her father's handsome face to stare unhappily at the audience, as if asking us just to go away for a change and give her some private time with Dad. <br />If the original vitality in these photographs can't keep us from calling up the preconceptions we carry around with us, this may actually be useful. The book's very freshness about what seems familiar makes us realize how old and worn-out our assumptions can be. Thus the photographs can (as Willis says in her introduction) \\"create a new  historical consciousness that has the power to rewrite history itself.\\" <br />But \\"Reflections in Black\\" is more than a documentary that can provoke useful debates within ourselves and between groups interpreting past or present culture. It shows that despite their commonalities black photographers have a long history of debating with each other. Is their medium an art or an engine of social progress? Should photography make mementos for its subjects or involve and change its viewers? The competing purposes and conflicting angles of vision represented in the book are part of what makes it fascinating. <br />Best of all, the book is marvelous for simply wandering and wondering through: <br />A remarkable series by a photographer who eventually lived in Seattle presents a man in three poses- - seated for his formal portrait, then hanged for murder, and finally laid out in his coffin. <br />Women in the book are gloriously unpredictable. Billie Holliday rehearsing with Count Basie looks like a Fifties coed in sweater, plaid skirt, and ponytail. Zora Neale Hurston smiles like an angel instead of with her usual impish brass. <br />Men? None are alike. A nattily dressed man waits at a bright window, fedora tipped up to let in the view, papers gleaming mysteriously in the background. A lined, leathery cowboy smokes a cigarette, his arms roped with tendons. Seattle's own Jacob Lawrence looks like a serious man at twenty and equally serious midway through his life, midway up a stepladder, in reverie. <br />Elsewhere, a lonely stony beach caresses the eye with dark grays and liquid silver. And beside a brick building draped with a gigantic sky-blue banner painted with the face of Malcolm X, a black cowboy rides through a golden field.	2001-07-27

The characters talk -- to friends or strangers, to themselves, even to ghosts -- trying to make sense of things and relieve their isolation. Like the protagonist in the opening story, \\"Heads,\\" the characters throughout Frederick Busch's 20th book of fiction are filled with \\"half-remembered words, tatters of statement, halves of stories, the litter of alibis, confessions, supplications, and demand.\\"<br />Talking sometimes closes more doors than it opens, or taps into buried rages that erupt in threats of violence. As if improved expression could solve the problem, characters correct their own and each other's phrasing. But language has a life of its own, confusing and concealing even when a speaker is being careful or terribly honest, and what one tells oneself can be the most treacherous story of all. The title urges silence for strong reasons. Yet secrets cut the characters off from people they love, as well as from themselves.<br />Busch's world is problematic, but his stories awaken deep joy in the reader. In the gorgeous, heart-rending story \\"Malvasia,\\" a woman brings all sorts of comforts to her recently widowed father, who wants nothing except to believe that when night falls his wife will greet him in the room they used to share. In \\"Timberline,\\" the narrator's flashback to a dangerous hike with his father won't let the reader go, and this memory is only one dimension of his gripping present crisis. Some of an old man's haunting, half-realized wisdom in \\"Machias\\" comes from once having held together a broken telephone wire in a blizzard, so that a doctor could be called to help birth a baby. In the old man's recollection, the message passed through his veins.<br />Most of the stories are about the things that happen to everyone -- a love lost, a child in trouble, a parent understood -- butthat never come with directions or guiding principles attached. The rules and regulations of bureaucracies, on the other hand, are plentiful.<br />In \\"The Baby in the Box,\\" the legislature controls the police department budget, so the hapless and terrified night dispatcher at the station, Ivanhoe Krisp, is the only person available when a midnight caller says a newborn was left in a dumpster. Our hero has to ride a poorly maintained, not-at-all-trusty SUV through the darkness to the rescue, and his wrenching question at the end (\\"Who  would throw a person away?\\") won't be answered by any bureaucrat.<br />Nor, apparently, by any God. The book's title could be a mischievous deity's instructions to the universe: Don't tell anyone what things mean. Don't even tell people who they are. Is Krisp a hero like the great Scots warrior Ivanhoe, or just a flaky snack for the hungry night? When the narrator in \\"Timberline\\" has an amazing conversation with a stranger, has his life changed, or hasn't it? \\"Nobody tells him which.\\"<br />Sometimes knowledge arrives, although in bizarre forms. In \\"Bob's Your Uncle\\" a psychotic young man (\\"wily and odd-looking, very large and a little arrested-sounding, and coated with the grime of the world\\") drops in on long-ago friends of his parents and won't leave. His misery and menace become a coded message to the host about himself.<br />Busch's understanding and compassion are generous and energetic. So is his fascination with how life goes wrong and how irrationally, impossibly, we keep trying to make things right. Each of his very different characters speaks in a unique yet natural voice. His plots move like good horses with expert riders -- a touch here, a subtle shift of weight there -- through dauntingly broken terrain. His phrasing is often brilliant; his syntax does effortless heavy lifting; his humor is a constant, unexpected grace and delight.<br />\\"Don't Tell Anyone\\" is a hugely satisfying book, and its author (this isn't news, but do tell everyone) is a genius of a storyteller.	2001-07-27

All their sisters are \\"tenderheaded,\\" or sensitive about their hair one way or another. Some could never stand the heat of a curling iron, while others feel their scalps sting at the mere sight of a fine-toothed comb. Others, reading W. E. B. Du Bois' comment that a woman \\"black or brown and crowned in curled mists\\" is \\"the most beautiful thing on earth,\\" pat their own misty crowns and mutter, \\"mailman's hair: every knot's got its own route.\\"<br />Reading this anthology feels a little like talking with your girlfriends, grown daughters, or favorite aunts on a lazy afternoon. Now and then a simpatico male drops by--maybe Peter Harris, gloating at finally having learned how to box-braid his six-year-old daughter's curls, or maybe Henry Louis Gates musing on the \\"kitchen,\\" which isn't just the place at home where your mother and her sisters tended each other's hair but the place at the nape of the neck that's \\"Unassimilably African\\" because, says Gates, nothing can \\"de-kink\\" it.<br />Kinks can be a trial in a world where the fluid, silken tress is beauty's trademark. From the Sixties through the Eighties, if a black woman straightened her hair or wore extensions or a weave she was routinely accused of hating herself or insulting her race--the righteous and the rappers loved to diss fake or processed hair. Having naturally straight \\"good hair\\" has never been a picnic, either. Even if the \\"lucky\\" woman's friends weren't resentful, she missed out on the intimacy and catharsis of hair-wailing sessions, and if she decided on a short style she was said to have thrown her luck away.<br />Opinions are still divided, and everyone in these pages has a different one, whether the writer is Alice Walker or the great-great-granddaughter of Madam C.J. Walker, America's first black woman millionaire, whose hair care system gave dignified employment to thousands of impoverished women during Jim Crow times. Angela Davis discusses the Afro that made her a media icon, and bell hooks argues that hair-straightening is not about wanting to be white but about longing to grow up--the practice marks the graduation from braided girlhood into womanhood. Art historian Judith Wilson links the pompadours, hair extensions, turbans, and long fingernails popular in some American communities to African aesthetic traditions in which the self is ritually extended through deliberate overabundance and artifice in bodily decoration. Cherilyn Wright, in \\"If You Let Me Make Love to You, Then Why Can't I Touch Your Hair?\\" offers the hilarious survey she took among her friends, male and female, about how they handle lovemaking when a hot, damp breath can snap a woman's expensively sleeked hairstyle right back into its original \\"b-b's.\\"<br />The book has a marvelous array of photographs, from archive-quality portraits of 19th-century toddlers to Topsy cartoons and Aunt Jemima ads, to Ugandan foreign minister Elizabeth Bagaaya in splendid basket-braids. A New York City matron wears a Muslim head-wrap, and Grace Jones a gorgeous fade. Whoopi Goldberg sports a spoofy yard-long platinum wig.  <br />Best of all, Tenderheaded brings to life the millions of women who give each other their touch and their attention (if sometimes also heartaches or a headache) through the intimate rituals of washing, combing, trimming, oiling, braiding, pressing, winding, wrapping--caring for--each other's hair.	2001-07-27

Only my tree and its little white flowers had the power to move my heart.\\" <br />Adelise's mother wants to save her daughter from the heavy labor in sugarcane fields that made her an old woman at forty, so she sends Adelise to live with her pretty Aunt Philomene in the city. The aunt's home turns out to be in a slum, a \\"great plain swarming with shacks all tumbled together in the most perfect disorder and crossed by a muddy path dotted with wallowing pigs.\\" But Adelise learns how to survive. If she must sell her body to do so, her soul remains strictly her own. <br />\\"Mamzelle Dragonfly\\" serves up small slices of hardscrabble life with cool, casual precision. For its characters each day is merely another \\"day in the stream of time.\\" Passions tend to be uncomplicated spasms of lust, wrath, sorrow, or fear, and hope is \\"the sterile male papaya's when it goes ahead and flowers.\\" If the unfazed tone (in conjunction with the setting) recalls certain writings by Jamaica Kincaid and Edwidge Danticat, this book is more disconcerting. Kincaid's novels are partly arguments about colonialism in which the political awareness of her narrators suggests that one can make historical sense, at least, of life's flux; and Danticat's taut narrative lines firmly contain what might fall into confusion. But in Confiant's novel, events seem to happen for no reason. The effect is a peculiar feeling of vulnerability - the reader, like the book's characters, lives in the present moment with little warning of what comes next. Narrative direction is implied only occasionally, as when Adelise recalls the beloved tree behind her rural home and notes with mild surprise that she's become a city girl. <br />Holding the book together, besides its focus on Adelise's life between childhood and the age of twenty-six, is the author's voice: a blend of matter-of-fact reportage, coarse vulgarity, and song. Confiant is a Martinique citizen who wrote his novel in his native Creole and translated it into French, then turned it over to translator Linda Coverdale (who produced the glorious English version of Sebastien Japrisot's \\"A Very Long Engagement\\"). In \\"Mamzelle Dragonfly,\\" swift people \\"go birdspeed\\"; those who disappear fast \\"took scamper powder.\\" One character is \\"thin as a string's shadow,\\" and another is \\"tie-him-down nuts.\\" A man slow-dancing at the nightclub is \\"hard-oning\\" his partner, who just might consider giving him \\"a tiny taste of her box lunch.\\" Adelise falls in love at last and blissfully idles under \\"the terrific sunblast of noon.\\" <br />The setting of Martinique provides connective tissue, too, with Carnival and other social customs, including finely calibrated racial distinctions or identities from black to mulatto, from griffe to capresse, from France-white to beke. And there's thematic glue in the ongoing wars between the sexes. A worthy matron shouts at masculine intruders, \\"'Leave the women to deal with this or I'll lop off your plums!'\\" Another suggests, \\"'Airmail them some caca.'\\" Philomene sounds about right when she tells Adelise that a fallen man might stay down, but \\"A woman whofalls is a chestnut\\" and will sprout right up again. <br />\\"Mamzelle Dragonfly\\" flutters along, touching down in gritty neighborhoods then flying off again, making the life within it feel both fragile and tough, both heavy and light.	2001-07-27

Madison Smartt Bell's projected trilogy of historical novels tells the least well known of these momentous late-18th-century stories.<br />Volume 1, \\"All Souls Rising,\\" traced the gruesome first stages of the rebellion in the French colony then called Saint Domingue, from 1791 to 1794. One who hasn't read that harrowing masterpiece can still enjoy Volume 2, \\"Master of the Crossroads,\\" based on events of the next five years. In this novel the revolution is well under way, but the outcome is still uncertain. <br />It's a tumultuous, confusing time. The Spanish, who own the eastern half of Saint Domingue, and the British, who are at war with France, separately hope to oust the French, subdue the blacks, and possess the island known worldwide as the Jewel of the Antilles. Among the islanders, the French blancs, or white colonials, have split into factions: the royalists who want to enslave the Africans again, and the revolutionaries who believe that liberty is a universal human right. Old disputes flare between native-born Haitians and immigrants, between mulatto plantation owners and poorer mulattos, between rivals among the island's 500,000 rebellious Africans and, more broadly, between members of the resident races - 64 in all, according to France's official classification of blends ranging from Blanc to Négre.<br />Toussaint Louverture, whose amazing career Jacob Lawrence memorialized in a series of paintings, is at the center of the storm. Small and tough, formerly a slave, he possesses such extraordinary charisma and talent for leadership that he can force, frighten, mystify, or cajole various factions into agreeing to work for peace. Toussaint unites the armed, roving bands of blacks who seized their liberty and transforms them into a well-disciplined army. A brilliant military tactician, he regularly defeats the English and Spanish forces. His political gifts make him a formidable negotiator with the French and a master at switching alliances at strategic moments. He alone seems committed to protecting, regardless of the race or ideology of their owners, the lives and property that survived the time of bloodbath and burning.<br />Toussaint's motives are endlessly debated in the book. People close to him believe that he is unselfishly devoted to securing liberty and peace for everyone. But rumors that he secretly plans to crown himself King and reinstate slavery multiply. We view him from the perspectives of many different characters, yet he remains a mystery: a presence with a godlike power in crisis, an inscrutable Master of the Crossroads like the voudou deity of crossings and change, Legba. <br />Readers who can tolerate a little disorientation from chaotic historical events swirling around an enigmatic hero will have a wonderful time with this novel. Many of the episodes are works of literary art, the Haitian landscape is superbly rendered, and the characters are fully realized and memorable. We come to care deeply about them: Doctor Hébert; his beloved mistress Nanon; his sister Elise and her smuggler husband Tocquet; Hébert's friends the French captain Maillart and the African captain Riau; the African soldier Guiaou who is Riau's rival in love; plucky, wanton Isabelle; the dreamy boy-priest Moustique; the elusive, fascinating Toussaint.  <br />Since Bell can't string their stories on a clear historical plot-line (this history is a tangle) he braids the everyday incidents and subtleties of their private lives into a central strand to which scattered public events can be tied. The characters, absorbed in ordinary pursuits, are regularly pulled into battles and intrigues, then released again into personal concerns. The point of view shifts from chapter to chapter, and we open each new one with the pleasure of greeting an old friend.<br />Nobody achieves an overall view of events -- which is partly the point. Yet even patient readers will wish for an index of characters keyed to page numbers. It's hard to keep people named Dessources, Dessalines, Desrouleaux, and Desfourneaux straight in a complicated narrative (sometimes set in Descahaux) with a cast of hundreds that also includes Delahaye and Dieudonné. The author's memory itself falters - the girl Paulette is called Pauline for a while -- but the Glossary and Chronology help. <br />Without them \\"Master of the Crossroads\\" would still be a stunning achievement: marvelously crafted, meticulous in its historical detail, magnificent in its sweep.	2001-07-27
US	43579246	R3SML4BYO4V3OR	0374246262	591697846	Rails Under My Back	Books	4	9	9	N	N	"Rails" Follows the Tracks of Two Families"	...Jeffery Renard Allen's first novel presents the interwoven narratives of two extended families whose histories go back past the Great Migration to the middle of the nineteenth century. \\"Rails Under My Back\\" is partly autobiographical, but it is blessedly free of the personal grievances so typical of confessional writing. And though the subject of race figures naturally in the book, it differs from protest novels like Richard Wright's and from celebrations of African American life like Zora Neale Hurston's, in that it is driven by no particular racial agenda. Allen's themes are the ordinary mysteries of human beings anywhere: the fitful dynamics between generations, the various effects of minor events on different members of the same family, and the uniqueness of every human life, unfolding with its particular and unpredictable logic.<br />Twenty years ago the McShan sisters married the Jones brothers, conjoining two long-lived clans and establishing their homes in a Midwestern city rather like modern Chicago. Their teenaged children - - Hatch, the son of Sheila and Lucifer, and Jesus, son of Gracie and John - - were inseparable while growing up, but now they've drifted apart. Hatch, a voracious reader, wants a career in music; Jesus, smoldering with rages he doesn't wholly understand, gravitates toward gang life in the inner-city projects. As the narrative opens, 17-year-old Jesus is coming home only rarely, intimidating his relatives (including Hatch) with his iron eyes, bulletlike shaved head, and surly silences. <br />How did two boys so close in age, blood, and background turn out so differently? In Allen's book this question, explicitly the center of John Edgar Wideman's fine \\"Brothers and Keepers,\\" is merely implied. But it offers a plot that's taut as well as subtle, in vectors of simultaneous construction and destruction. By acts of violence Jesus seeks to tear the family apart, even as Hatch and his sister Porsha, a successful model who has fallen in love with an inner-city hoodlum, try to connect their lives with family history. At times the characters experience personal bonds as bondage, and separation from loved ones feels a lot like freedom. Will Jesus break every tie of kinship and affection? Will Hatch follow Jesus into an urban wilderness? <br />Social criticism is implied in scenes from the city projects--the rust-bucket elevators, urinous halls, disintegrating families, paralyzing oscillations between random violence and inertia--and in the baffled, dead-end fates of Black men who helped fight their nation's wars. But no rancors lie behind these themes. There's no piousness, either, in the book's focus on people who daily, endlessly do menial jobs in order to maintain decent lives. Allen's characters have simply inherited a remarkable capacity for work from ancestors like Pappa Simmons, who said, \\"Labor is the deck. All else is the sea.\\"<br />\\"Rails\\" is a long book. Though its recurrent railway journeys create a poetic coherence, they can be so dizzy we lose any sense of direction. Events sometimes merge confusingly, and a few plot threads are left dangling. Occasionally the prose reads like fragments shored against someone's ruin - - scraps of nursery rhyme, rap song, and jump-rope chant are juxtaposed with marginalia in family albums, an FBI clipping, an NAACP notice safety-pinned into a book, a funeral program. Maybe the unsigned letter found in a family Bible speaks for this novel's author: \\"It should be easy to follow the thread of my story The seams show.\\" But even fans of postmodern pastiche will sometimes need to ask of Allen's book (as Porsha asks of the letter), \\"How am I sposed to read this?\\" <br />Still, Allen's characters, including his remarkable women, are uniquely imagined. His portrayals of married life are fresh and intelligent: the helpless love between Lucifer and Sheila gives neither a window on the other's surprising inner world, while Gracie, strangely tormented by the ghosts ofbabies, struggles to accept John's bad case of the walking blues. Porsha's work in photography studios is fascinating. Young men in the projects talk amazing trash, part horrifying menace and part comic bluster. Cityscapes unfold like prose-poems, flashbacks to stories of Whole Daddy and Pappa Simmons are marvelous, and the book has intriguing religio-mythic dimensions - - the names of Jesus and Lucifer are no accident. <br />Readers who love the works of Ellison, Morrison, and Faulkner will welcome Allen's book. In an era when marketability reigns, we should thank his publishers, too, for backing a first novel this challenging, ambitious, and seriously literary.	2001-07-27

Go to online copy at the newspaper's website ..., or see the text below: <br />Taped to the door of Sam Wineburg's office at the University of Washington's College of Education are paired photos of dogs and their comically similar owners. Professor Wineburg greeted me with a pop quiz: \\"Which twins look most alike?\\" <br />Behind this playful question is an educational psychologist's interest in how people think, especially about history. Wineburg's \\"Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts\\" (Temple U. Press, 255 pages, ...) shows that historical thought is not a natural process: it \\"goes against the grain of how we ordinarily think, one of the reasons why it is much easier to learn names, dates, and stories than it is to [understand] the past.\\"<br />Wineburg told me his interest in this subject first awoke when he took a history class he couldn't ace with his good memory. He learned that histories aren't objective summaries of the facts but interpretations and arguments made out of information that's always incomplete. \\"But how did historians do that?\\" Wineburg asked. \\"Their books seemed like products of naturally systematic thought--which wasn't how my mind worked, but maybe I was just dumb!\\"<br />Wineburg's research into history and the mind has won many honors during his 12 years at the University of Washington. Through having students and professors think aloud while reading documents, he found that only novices just read something and decide what it means. \\"A historian's thought process is full of hunches and reverses, constant self-questionings and I-don't-knows,\\" Wineburg explained.<br />Standardized history tests inhibit this kind of thinking, besides guaranteeing that students will seem vastly ignorant. \\"Periodically, starting with the first national survey in 1917, Americans have concluded from factual tests that kids don't know history. The conclusion isn't logical.\\" Wineburg smiled wryly. \\"Kids have just never remembered the facts that adults sitting around a table making up a test say they should remember.\\"<br />He pulled a U.S. history text from a shelf. \\"Why not teach how to question the facts? Here's Rosa Parks: 'Tired after a long day's work, she sat down in the front section reserved for whites.' Actually, Parks sat in the middle of the bus, available to anyone unless the front was full. Other accounts have her saying she wasn't especially tired and wasn't sure why she kept her seat when challenged. Did Parks intend an act of civil disobedience? Why do these historians disagree?\\"<br />Comparing documents, Wineburg added, \\"is detective work that kids are usually deprived of. It shows them that no single authority has the whole story, and it raises real questions of meaning.\\" He paused, considering. \\"Every topic doesn't need endless debate. Students stay engaged once they realize history's not a fixed story they must swallow whole but a way of thinking they can apply to life.\\"<br />Americans need this way of thinking, Wineburg told me. \\"We're deluged by conflicting, fragmented information that tries to steer us in particular directions. We need to raise citizens who ask themselves, 'Is this true? Who's saying so? What's the nature of the evidence?' Taught this way, history is a training ground for democracy.\\"<br />Is such training too hard for schoolchildren? \\"We underestimate kids' abilities to think. Or we believe their self-esteem depends on having tasks they easily do. But we feel good about ourselves by doing things we thought we couldn't do, with capable people around to pick us up after a tumble and show us our reach can exceed our grasp.\\"<br />\\"Historical Thinking\\" is an academic book, but not daunting or dry, and full of stories any reader can enjoy. Wineburg describes Primo Levi's moving encounter with the student who swore that if sent to Auschwitz he could have escaped. There's a chapter on drawings that schoolchildrenmade of their mental pictures of Pilgrims, Settlers, and Hippies for one of Wineburg's studies--readers can bypass the statistical tables and walk right into these young imaginations. The high-school history class discussion that veers off the rails is as gripping as well-crafted fiction.<br />Wineburg's conversation with me was no merely academic exercise either. \\"History gives us a kind of humility,\\" he mused at one point. \\"I can read something written in 1860 but not know what it meant to live in 1860. I never lived in a world where you could wake up in the morning and go to an auction and buy people. Studying history, we think our way into what living in that world was like. It's the only form of time travel that exists.\\"<br />Small wonder that Wineburg was an early winner of the University of Washington's Distinguished Teaching Award.	2001-07-27

William Merwin opens &quot;The River Sound&quot; with songs of praise for the natural world in that familiar voice: his fluid, sonorous blend of elegy and ecstasy, sometimes tinged with bitterness about the earth's degradation at human hands. Like his earlier poems, these rejoice in beginnings--dawns, the freshly wakened spirit, &quot;April with the first light sifting/ through the young leaves,&quot; the Hudson River before British explorers arrived. Then Merwin turns his attention to history and aging. As he contemplates the past that shaped him, the people and events he has known begin to resemble &quot;the ancient shaping of water/ to which the light of an hour comes back as to a secret.&quot; It seems that the poet of mornings has made a new, personal peace with history and change. <br />The book is a dazzling collection of poems, wise and playful. &quot;Lament for the Makers&quot; is a series of affectionate, quirky eulogies for poets who influenced Merwin and who died during his lifetime, and a confession of his tendency to see himself (partly because of his early rise to literary fame) as &quot;the youngest on the block.&quot; This self-image lasted, he wryly admits, long after &quot;the notes in some anthology/ listed persons born after me.&quot; The glorious heart of the book is the moving 60-page &quot;Testimony,&quot; a leisurely, often funny family history about reaching an age when &quot;the open unrepeatable/ present in which [we] wake and live&quot; becomes &quot;a still life still alive&quot;: at last we &quot;know/ what to do with it.&quot; The poet ends &quot;Testimony&quot; by bequeathing treasures (a walk shared, a river heard together, a whole Manhattan city block) to each of his life's companions. <br />Merwin's sentences often run together without punctuation but (as in other work) not merely to echo the rivers, the music, or the sympathetic imagination winding through his pages. His stream of language invites readers inside it as collaborators in its syntax, listening for the sounds of the phrases in the mind's mouth. This intimate sharing of speech is just one of the great pleasures of &quot;The River Sound,&quot; written by a premier American poet at the pinnacle of his craft.	2001-07-27

The central problem of his book is knowledge, which made Apollo a god but divides us from ourselves. Cole seeks to unite body and mind in a self through Arte Povera poems - rough, impromptu works &quot;in motion, / stroking toward what [he] cannot see&quot; ('Apollo').  But the self proves to be neither a temple for the spirit nor a sturdy Greek column, and Cole becomes a tourist and connoisseur of his own disintegration -- he is marble rubble, broken stanzas, stray glimpses of porn flicks, bouts of loveless fellatio under the pier. The poet is a Visible Man in what he calls an &quot;erotic x-ray of my soul&quot; ('Self-Portrait as Four Styles of Pompeian Wall Painting'). <br />Though Cole refuses to flatter us with sweetness, he can be very funny, mingling exquisitely precise imagery with comic observation. Ancient crumbling statues resemble &quot;bodies sinking in quicksand,&quot; but &quot;a luckless prick / is frozen in the stucco.&quot; Scholars &quot;eat big bowls of pasta / and drain their preposterous bowels&quot; ('The Scholars'). Many passages are marvelous - history has &quot;white teeth / jammed with gristle&quot; ('The Black Jacket'); forgiveness is &quot;so hard to swallow it unshackles us&quot; ('26 Hands'); a house is &quot;illuminated all night, / like the unconscious, though no one enters&quot; ('The Coastguard Station'). <br />Cole is determined &quot;To write what is human, not escapist.&quot; He makes himself &quot;at home with evil, with unexamined feelings, / with just the facts&quot; ('Apollo'), and welcomes the &quot;Stranger, with genitalia greased,&quot; crooning, &quot;Come, unlace my boots; I chose you&quot; ('Etna'). Here the nervous system is, for better or worse, the organ of the mind.	2001-07-27

In \\"Figurehead: And Other Poems\\" the poet rings playful changes on the stories of Sappho, Arachne, Minerva, his mom, and the Duchess of Robert Browning's \\"My Last Duchess,\\" who tells us, in perfect Browning-style verses, that nobody murdered her. She's very much alive, thank you, and enjoying some peace and quiet in the convent to which she secretly escaped from the \\"mad fool\\" of a husband who doubtless, now, pontificates to bored listeners about the quality of her smile in the portrait he had commissioned. She faked that smile, you see, and she's freer behind her walls than the clod she married will ever be anywhere: \\"at which,\\" she concludes, \\"I truly smile.\\" <br />Hollander plays with the names of assorted ailments: \\"quinsy,\\" \\"whiffles,\\" \\"glanders,\\" \\"pip,\\" and \\"glottis\\" (\\"nature disposes,\\" he quips, but \\"medical science proposes\\" the names for what nature deals out). In \\"Variations on a Table\\" he ponders a poet's writing table, Locke's tabula rasa, the multiplication tables, and a motion tabled at a meeting, then segués to Babel, sable coats, Mabel, and transatlantic cables before \\"turning the tables\\" back to the polished surface upon which a writer does his work--each seemingly free association contributing to a cogent essay on language. Hollander's juggling of paradoxes, puns, and demanding forms is more than a literary version of Olympics-level gymnastics. \\"Figurehead\\" is virtuoso poetry from a brilliant mind at work.	2001-07-27

Anne Carson's two previous books string their wonderful perturbations along narrative lines, but \\"Men in the Off Hours\\" is a deliberately unstrung chaos, which Carson calmly, almost academically sorts through. Metaphor, she decides, is \\"the willful creation of error,\\" and poetry consists of misunderstandings and mistranslations (even by a classics professor like herself).

Can she learn to accept the death of her mother as a kind of mistake, or to enjoy having taken as her \\"true love\\" a man who left her?<br />Such a wholesale interpretation of the book is risky. Carson is always, as she says in \\"Men,\\" \\"uneasy with any claim to know exactly / what a poet means to say,\\" and her poetry generally avoids the confessional mode.

No cynic about technology, Stoll is a Berkeley astronomer and pioneer of the Internet who loves computers and computing. Yet he argues that the educational benefits of computers in schools are few: &quot;A good school needs no computers. And a bad school won't be much improved by even the fastest Internet links.&quot; Nor do school libraries need much technology--the best libraries invest most heavily in books, periodicals, and the expertise of librarians (not &quot;information specialists&quot;). <br />Stoll argues that computers actually retard  learning. They waste time because technical difficulties continually interrupt computer-dependent instruction, and they make students who use them for more than word-processing or spreadsheets into passive recipients of unreliable information. 99% of the material on the Web is &quot;inaccurate, out of date, one-sided, or no longer maintained,&quot; and the more dependable Websites tend to provide raw data instead of carefully distilled information. Besides, students are already overwhelmed with information. They need knowledge, which the Net fails to help them develop because its methods, pace, and style undermine the concentration, discipline, patience, and critical analysis required for learning. Stoll concludes that computers in schools are a terrible waste of educational funds.<br />Can a book like this one succeed in making educators across the nation think twice about their campaigns to wire every classroom or put a laptop in every kid's lap? Stoll's long experience with technology gives him authority, he cites reliable studies, and his claims are based on hard facts, clear logic, and plain common sense. But his argument is thinned by a digressive chatterbox style, folksy with nopes, yeps, hecks, heys, and the occasional ouch! or yee-ha! And no combination of facts, logic, or common sense has yet made much headway against America's worship of technology.	2001-07-27

In 1994 the best-selling &quot;Reviving Ophelia,&quot; by Gilligan disciple Mary Pipher, proclaimed a national emergency rooted in a &quot;girl-poisoning culture&quot; that kills the preadolescent female spirit. Now Christina Hoff Sommers, the author of &quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot; (1994), has discovered that America shortchanges boys, not girls. <br />Sommers begins &quot;The War Against Boys&quot; by arguing that girls are more successful in school. She cites studies showing that girls feel more engaged in their classes, get better grades, and more often believe that their teachers listen to their ideas. She says the overall SAT scores of boys are higher only because more girls (including low achievers) take the test, motivated by an educational system that favors and encourages them. She claims that instead of worrying about sexist bias in the SATs we should worry about the low-achieving boys who avoid the test and thus can't attend college at all--the Department of Education reports that only 6.7 million men were enrolled in American colleges in 1996 as compared to 8.4 million women. <br />Sommers' most interesting chapters dismiss Gilligan's lifework as bad science. Apparently, Gilligan drew what were hailed as revolutionary theories about gender from a small pool of data, whose details she still conceals from public scrutiny. Sommers gracefully concedes that pro-girl anti-sexism has benefited girls in important ways, but argues that Gilligan-inspired educators have gone too far. Indeed, some teachers create hostile environments in which boys feel blamed for being male and for belonging to a historically oppressive group. But Sommers goes further. She insists that the goal of gender equity in American education has devolved into a nationwide project to rescue boys from their &quot;masculine pathologies.&quot; <br />To support her idea that educators are systematically and even punitively &quot;feminizing&quot; American males, Sommers paints an anecdotal, extremely one-sided portrait of schools. At one, the rough-and-tumble play of boys at recess is prohibited as &quot;aggression.&quot; At another, a 6-year-old boy who hugged a classmate is called a harasser and punished. Elsewhere, teachers adorn their classroom walls with pictures of women exclusively, or ask boys to role-play famous females and help with class sewing projects. These last two ideas actually look sensible, but for the most part Sommers chooses to mention only curriculum initiatives and workshops so ridiculous they'd make you laugh if you didn't know that real human children are being taught by true believers in silly notions. <br />Ironically, such misguided efforts on the part of educators result from approaches closely resembling Sommers' own: a quick pinpointing of problems and simple solutions that make more nuanced, labor-intensive (and thus costly) education reforms seem esoteric or impractical. Sommers recommends all-male classes, strenuous competition for grades, back-to-basics curriculums, and old-fashioned character training--welcome ideas at the conservative American Enterprise Institute where she's a resident scholar. But if gender wars shouldn't drive choices in education, neither should right-wing politics, especially when Sommers bases her preference for a new regime of authoritarian lectures and drills at American schools on one main source:  &quot;national British proposals&quot; to improve the experiences of schoolboys in England, produced by one conference of headmasters and praised by a few London newspapers. <br />Sommers is eloquent on what we love about boys and men, and on the harm that even subtly institutionalized male-bashing can do to young minds. But her argument is tiresomely repetitious, simplistic, and at least as convenient as Gilligan's in the narrowness of its evidence.	2001-07-27

Shambhala, $25 No wonder dreams of journeys are so often associated with death. We travel to leave our lives behind - the familiar workaday parts, anyway - hoping to arrive in a Paradise where our eyes, ears, tongues, maybe even our hearts, will be startled awake. What we really want is a new self, but what we often get is more stuff -samples of a regional cuisine, eyefuls of great art, tidbits about Kafka's life in Prague, opinions, trinkets. Traveling becomes grazing on a global scale. <br />A different pathway opens up in Sam Hamill's newest collection of translations, The Essential Basho. Here for the first time in a single volume is the essence of Basho's work:  four travel narratives, including the best-known &quot;Narrow Road to the Interior,&quot; and 250 haiku returning us home to a dailiness transformed by awareness and attention. Whether the poet is on the road or behind his own brushwood gate he seeks, instead of new acquisitions or excitements, an honest encounter between world and mind. These two entities were never separate to begin with. So although Basho's travelogues seem to record his treks on foot through 17th-century Japan, they're actually journeys into his own true nature, the heartland within, where self and circumstances are one. <br />&quot;Very early on the twenty-seventh morning of the third moon, under a predawn haze, transparent moon barely visible, mount Fuji just a shadow, I set out under the cherry blossoms of Ueno and Yanaka. When would I see them again? A few old friends had gathered in the night and followed along far enough to see me off from the boat I felt three thousand miles rushing through my heart, the whole world only a dream. I saw it through farewell tears.<br /> &quot;Spring passes /  and the birds cry out - tears /  in the eyes of fishes.<br />&quot;With these first words from my brush, I started. Those who remain behind watch the shadow of a traveler's back disappear.&quot; <br />Carrying just a few necessities along with friends' farewell presents, which he can't bear to part with, Basho lets each event on the way speak the language of its particular life. At a farm he asks directions, but they're so complicated the farmer just lends Basho his horse (&quot;'He knows the road. When he stops, get off, and he'll come back alone.'&quot;) The horse takes Basho to a village and then turns around, a gift from the poet tied to his saddle. Farther on, Basho observes peasants wearing black formal hats for ancient rites, speaks with prostitutes on a pilgrimage, sadly leaves to his fate a child abandoned by his parents, retreats from a three-day storm into a shack:    Eaten alive by /   lice and fleas - now the horse /   beside my pillow pees.<br />At a mountain temple &quot;I crawled among boulders to make my bows at shrines. The silence was profound. I sat, feeling my heart begin to open.&quot; Elsewhere, hearing distant villagers clap wooden noisemakers to scare deer from their fields, he feels &quot;the utter aloneness of autumn.&quot; A stranger asks for a poem (&quot;'Something beautiful, please'&quot;) and Basho writes a verse about the cuckoo's cry that arrives, just then, from across a field. <br />Basho's words flow spontaneously out of each moment lived. Instead of giving us tours or mementos of the world, he helps us open to its presences and discover who we are. Through his haiku we sense the wholeness and sufficiency of an early frost, an eggplant seed, a hangover, &quot;Mr. Seagull,&quot; a nest of mice, a bean-floured rice ball, tears in the eyes of fishes, and ourselves, awake and alive again.        Hamill frames &quot;The Essential Basho&quot; with essays on Basho's life and work that are scholarly enough to educate a student of haiku or Japanese culture and lively enough to engage any reader. Their depth and ease testify to the virtuosity Hamill has achieved as Editor of Copper Canyon Press, Director of the Port Townsend Writers' Conference, author of over thirty books, and translator of poetry in several languages. Travelers like me have carried around the world his pocket-size Basho (&quot;Narrow Road to the Interior,&quot; now out of print) until it's tattered. We'll treasure the fine new volume silkily sleeved in Hokusai's portrait of the poet on the road again.	2001-07-27

Her mother rides into the icy night for a doctor, and Una is oblivious with pain when a runaway woman slave creeps through the cabin door and into her bed. A gang of bounty hunters led by a dwarf cloaked in wolfskin bursts in after the runaway but, persuaded by the compassionate dwarf not to grope under the bedclothes of a woman in travail, they soon depart. The women snuggle beneath the plump quilts, Una laughing with merry affection when not gasping with birth pangs. At last the infant Liberty is born. And Liberty dies. And dawn brings news of another disaster - Una's mother has frozen to death in the snow. Una, gazing skyward beside the grave that holds both her mother and her child, wonders if the universe is punishing her, but she rallies. She outfits her new friend for a flight to freedom and sends her skipping North across the floes of the frozen river like Liza in UNCLE TOM'S CABIN. We're on page 13.<br />And there are 650 to go, profuse in events, literary allusions, and love. For love is the answer - Una's every nerve vibrates with this truth. Thus she will never quite understand (although she'll forgive) the monomaniacal vengeance that her beloved husband later pursues against the White Whale and against the blankness of the existential void. What void? Rapt attention to each moment shows that life is full, and glorious. <br />Naslund takes us back to Una's childhood in leisurely poetical fashion. Twelve-year-old Una is sent away from her brutal zealot of a father to live with relatives at a lighthouse overlooking the Atlantic, where she learns to love the stars and the sea. These chapters glow with painterly images of windblown landscapes and picturesque vegetarian food, e.g., a \\"sweet potato gashed richly open\\" on a plate. How glad I am when Una hits puberty and ditches her warm, wonderful family for a couple of sailors, Kit and Giles. She cuts her hair, dresses as a boy, and secretly follows the guys aboard the whaler they've shipped with. Between trysts with them (they quickly see through her disguise) Una gives us a full report on the whaling life until the ship sinks and the crew is cast adrift. She and her friends survive by eating the flesh of shipmates who succumb, and after their rescue they are haunted by memories of their cannibalism. Giles commits suicide, Kit goes mad, and Una weds the madman. <br />Una's eventual union with her second husband Ahab is less convincing. As she wanders the Nantucket dunes during one of her dark nights of the soul, a flinty hand silently leads her to safety before its anonymous owner slips away. Was that Ahab? Must be! Later she hears him wail \\"Una! Obsession!\\" into the flames of a house that's conveniently afire at the moment. Their passion is terrific, but when Ahab gives Una money to buy furniture, readers may feel that their memory of MOBY-DICK has been handed ashore dressed in a blouse and skirt.<br />What Naslund does best is to portray a woman who joyously accepts the universe with the same unstinting ardor with which Ahab roars his everlasting \\"No!\\" Una's bliss is irrepressible, obstreperous, steeping random moments in its wayward shimmer. But the bold feminism so many reviewers praise in our heroine is rather compromised by her tendency to drop her emotional anchor next to every eligible or fatherly male who sails into her waters - first Giles, then Kit, then Captain Fry, Ahab, Isaac Starbuck, Judge Lord, Robben Avalon, and finally Ishmael. Nor is Una particularly scrupulous in ethical quandaries; her moral reflections on deceiving her friend Charlotte are only cathartic rationalizations after the fact. Finally, as a storyteller she doesn't measure up to the narrator of MOBY-DICK. Melville's Ishmael is as whole-hearted as Una, but half-sure, too, mingling meditation, wonder, affection, and horror in an ironically multiple vision. Una has only one purpose at a time in mind, so although her purposes change like the weather, her story achieves variety merely, not ambiguity or true complexity. She just wants (and wants us) to live, love, laugh and be happy.<br />AHAB'S WIFE will attract fans of popular fiction - a woman at last month's Northwest Bookfest told Naslund the book \\"felt comfortable the whole way.\\" But Naslund seems to be aiming at a different audience - one that's familiar with the authors she continually evokes: Chaucer, Cervantes, Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare, Donne, Goethe, Coleridge, Shelley, Byron, Bronte, Keats, Emerson, Fuller, Hawthorne, Douglass and  Melville. Her novel's best achievement may be to return readers to its origins.	2001-07-27

Zala Spencer has waited up all night for Sonny, her 12-year-old, to come home. Lately he's been hard to manage, but he's never stayed out overnight, and this morning she won't let him stroll in and talk his way around her. As Zala paces the house, she represses the knowledge currently terrifying Atlanta's black community:  this summer its children, one by one, are being murdered. Thus readers enter the life of a fictional family whose son disappears during the Atlanta child killings of 1979-1981, when 29 black youths were slain. <br />Author Toni Cade Bambara was living in Atlanta at the time of the murders, and after several children's bodies were found but officials seemed unconcerned, she began keeping a journal. She filled twelve notebooks, which she spent more than a decade revising into a historical novel. By the time she died in 1995, she had drafted an imposing manuscript, animated by her vexed fascination with America's latest racial Catch-22: that blacks who suspect authorities of prejudice are paranoid, or themselves prejudiced, because our society is now color-blind. <br />Bambara isn't a one-sided social critic. \\"Those Bones Are Not My Child\\" blames black communities for their quietism after the Civil Rights movement:  \\"The ballot secured, reps in office, &#8230; folks had laid down their weapons in the public square and sauntered off to read the papers.\\" In Bambara's view all Americans today are chasing the good life instead of social justice. Still, in Atlanta between 1979 and 1981, hundreds of black citizens became activists like Bambara's protagonist, Zala. Weary from the difficulties of raising Sonny in a world dangerous to black males, and now traumatized by his disappearance, Zala is feisty, too. She and her husband join STOP, a group of parents trying to energize a lukewarm, lagging investigation into the killings. <br />Readers are plunged into the daily round of a community in crisis whose situation is ignored, misunderstood, or exploitedby powers-that-be. STOP urges civic leaders to declare a public emergency - something is menacing Atlanta's children, even if it's not an organized vendetta against black youth. But the official view is that systematic or racist violence can't happen in \\"the city too busy to hate.\\" Stories about serial killings would be bad PR for an Atlanta ambitious to be a world-class location for corporations, conventions, even a future Olympics. Zala finds it infuriating that the minimal publicity given the case treats the parents as primary suspects. Worse, when evidence clears the parents, officials speculate that the children were narcotics runners murdered by ghetto druglords, or runaways from family poverty and neglect who met with fatal accidents. <br />Bambara shows that when citizens can't trust authorities to be diligent or impartial, rumors multiply. Someone in the black community hears that whites are kidnapping their boys to use in porn films and snuff flicks, but that all evidence implicating whites is being suppressed. Others say that an official deliberately lost a recording of a Klansman's boasts about participating in the murders. Still others insist that the 1980 explosion in a black daycare center that killed four children must be from KKK dynamite, not a flaw in the building's ancient boiler. The arrest of a black man looks like a predictable gambit in a white cover-up, especially because now newspapers jump to give the case daily front-page prominence at last. <br />Small wonder that Atlanta's black community comes to view the trial of the accused man, Wayne Williams, as a white frame-up. Williams is charged with two killings and convicted on the basis of circumstantial evidence, mainly fibers found on the bodies of victims. According to the grapevine, Caucasian hairs were also found but prosecutors ignored that detail, and they apply the fiber evidence to the other murders only because they want all the cases closed even if a killer is still at large. In sum, Bambara's novel shows us what it's like to live hours, days, and years in the midst of beleaguered fear, mistrust, and indignation. <br />So it's an important story for all Americans, although the book is overlong - the anguish of parents as they seek their missing children, build theories, and witness official inaction is a slender plot on which to hang 600+ pages. Had Bambara lived longer, she might have cut the manuscript. She does try to heighten drama by elaborating sensory detail and starting chapters like short stories whose temporarily withheld explanations might tantalize a reader, but these strategies often prove distracting. Still, the first half of the book compels attention, and domestic scenes with the Spencer family are deft and moving throughout the narrative. The final two chapters become gripping as the mystery of Sonny's disappearance is solved.<br />In any case, we choose a historical novel for more than just its novelistic technique, and we can't choose a different novel on the subject - there are no others. I'm grateful that Bambara wrote the manuscript before she died and that Nobel-winning novelist Toni Morrison shepherded it through posthumous publication.	2001-07-27

He spent most of his twenties in brutalizing industrial jobs, and after he escaped into a different life as a writer, the world he left behind became his central subject. Levine has devoted his  art to rendering justly the blunt, weary dramas that unfold in blue-collar neighborhoods and factories, in poems that  are works of praise as well as pathos. Like his award-winning  &quot;What Work Is,&quot; his new collection, &quot;The Mercy,&quot; presents recollected characters such as an immigrant peddler, a thick-armed farmer, a butcher, a man so happy to be changing a flat tire with his father that he sings--all palpably alive in the capacious honesty of the poet's vision. May Levine's blunt songs of the single grit-blown moment--that woman digging bulbs into bare ground,  this man-handled oildrum under exactly this sky--be heard and remembered through our shiny times.	2001-07-27

Walker, America's First Black Female Millionaire	Books	4	3	3	N	N	"Black Rose" - An Inspirational Story	[Note: This review originally appeared August 14, 2000, in the Seattle Times and is available online at ...P>This skillful biographical novel is about a woman who could have shown Horatio Alger what it really means to start with less than nothing and succeed against all odds by means of perseverance, imagination, talent, and generosity. <br />In \\"The Black Rose,\\" Longview author Tananarive Due (\\"My Soul to Keep\\") has traced the career of Madame C. J. Walker, America's first black millionaire. Due based her narrative on research that Alex Haley had gathered for a book on Walker, which he planned to write in the style of \\"Roots\\" but failed to finish before his death. <br />Madame Walker was born Sarah Breedlove in 1867 in Delta, Louisiana, to former slaves. When her parents died of yellow fever (she was only seven), she and her sister moved to Mississippi and found work doing laundry for white people. Later Sarah married and gave birth to a daughter, Lelia, then was widowed when her beloved husband was killed for protesting against injustices at work. <br />For fourteen years, during an era of violent prejudice against black people, Sarah worked as a washerwoman, eventually moving to St. Louis in search of a better life for Lelia. Sarah had always been intrigued by small businesses, from one-man fish stands to laundries that jobbed out their services. And she was a problem-solver. One day she bought an ointment that failed to ease a painful scalp condition, and it happened just when she'd begun worrying about teenaged Lelia's poor self-image in a world of white beauty standards. Sarah used healthier ingredients to develop a skin and hair treatment for black women, and a successful cosmetics business was born that would soon be worth over a million dollars, with offices in Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, and Manhattan.<br />Due makes an interesting, absorbing narrative of Madame Walker's philanthropy toward black causes, her work with leaders such as W. E. B. DuBois, and hercomplicated emotional struggles with Lelia and second husband C. J. Walker. Most moving of all is how Walker's life story and the independent, dignified work she gave to women across the nation inspired thousands of her sisters to believe in themselves.	2001-07-27

In a recent Seattle Times special on computers in schools, a U.W. professor of educational technology is quoted as saying that American culture no longer values \\"traditional book-based learning\\" and that teachers must adapt to the fact that \\"deep and sustained thinking\\" will no longer be central to students' development. The authors of two new books would doubtless see this as further evidence that education \\"experts\\" tend to view schools as establishments for teaching social adjustment. <br />Historian, scholar, educational policy analyst, and former Assistant Secretary to the Department of Education Diane Ravitch shows, in \\"Left Back,\\" that such anti-intellectual attitudes are typical among the progressive theorists who have dominated 100 years of education reform in America. <br />The premise of Ravitch's argument is that the real job of our schools is teaching students to think well. Everyone, regardless of origins or social status, finds pleasure and satisfaction in a developed mental life, but even more important is the fact that democratic self-government requires clear, independent, knowledgeable thinkers. According to these authors, the proper function of schools is to serve such ends, but competing demands have weakened school programs and blurred their proper focus on developing children's minds. <br />Ravitch traces our present conflicts about the purpose of schooling to various (sometimes contradictory) movements she groups under the rubric of \\"progressive.\\" Originally an educational philosophy that advocated building on children's interests and preparing students for a wide range of life's activities, progressivism split into divergent efforts to center schools on such concerns as vocational training, social reform, interpersonal skills, or \\"scientific\\" placements of children with normal IQ's in nonacademic tracks. To make such changes, says Ravitch, progressive theorists attacked the common curriculum that offered everyone the benefits of a liberal arts education. <br />Progressive campaigns were not wholly successful but, Ravitch says, they diluted academic programs and lowered standards. And the best progressive methods, such as individualized instruction, creative learning activities, and motivation through student interest, came to be used as ends in themselves instead of as means of achieving worthy intellectual purposes. <br />Above all, excellence in education requires excellent teachers. But though Ravitch is stern about improving teacher credentials and performance, she never mentions the possibility that where teaching is mediocre it's because low salaries and poor working conditions prompt many superb candidates to avoid the profession. <br />Yet teacher salaries now rank the lowest among those of highly literate college-educated workers..., and Seattle high-school teachers are typically assigned 150 students--an impossible number to teach adequately, let alone well. Better salaries and smaller classes would be expensive and would require leaders to inspire greater public respect for teachers, but would do more in the long run to improve education than the attempted quick-fix of standardized tests. <br />Still, though Ravitch's history sometimes overstates the case against progressive education it illuminates the origins of the more benighted claims we hear about the purpose of schooling, while offering effective counterarguments. In telling how American schools were shaped in the past by the decisions of human beings, Ravitch tells us, too, that our decisions today can make a difference.	2001-07-27

In his latest collection Port Townsend poet Sam Hamill speaks as Obaka-san, or \\"big fool\\" - an honorific that Japanese friends gave him, recalling the nickname of the early writer Ryokan. Like Shakespeare's wise fools and Nietzsche's Wise Child, Obaka-san surrenders to life instead of trying to manipulate, buy, or sell it. And like the Zen and Ch'an poet-calligrapher-monks of old, he makes his home everywhere and noplace, with a community of artists spanning the centuries. In \\"Gratitude\\" we meet these friends - in letters and elegies the poet sends them, in his translations of their writings, and in epithalamia celebrating their children's marriages. <br />More precisely, Hamill, his friends, and the reader meet in the sociable situation his pages provide. Creating spaces where readers and poets living and dead can gather has been his life work as Editor of Copper Canyon Press, Director of the Port Townsend Writers' Conference, author of over thirty books, and translator of Latin, Estonian, Japanese, and Chinese poetry. Gratitude can be read as Hamill's gift of thankfulness for being able to devote himself to these labors.  <br />But if we open it to find a certain something for ourselves - a newly carved insight for our mental treasury, a voice that will set our deeper beliefs to music, a self-enhancing mirror of our life or a soothing escape from it  - we'll miss the poems. The painting on the cover of Hamill's book, Morris Graves' \\"Little Known Bird of the Inner Eye,\\" suggests another approach. This creature's feathers blend so imperceptibly into surrounding cloud, and its slender features are such fleeting glimpses in the whiteness, that we realize the bird not by looking for it in the painting but by letting it meet our alert yet unexpectant regard, like the selfless gaze we rest lightly, wholeheartedly, on a friend in close conversation. <br />Indeed, speaking these poems aloud as if in quiet talk with a friend is the way to know them; for the poetry communicates \\"The heart by way of the ear\\" and asks the reader, in turn, \\"What's that you wanted to say?\\" ('Preface: Ars Poetica') - as in this excerpt:<br />This world is neither / fair nor wise, but paradise / reveals itself in every line.<br />What, finally, IS love? / Willingness to face the end / without blinking?    ('Lives of a Poet')<br />Hamill's loose and easy Chinese-style couplets, Japanese-derived tanka, and free verse let the poems unfold as spontaneously as good conversation. Still, there is rhyme (so subtle we may have dreamed the sound preceding the echo) through which the words can enact, instead of merely declaring, the connectedness of everything. In being the speaker of the poems, we merge with their life and move with their changes. We grasp the poetry by letting go.<br />The best poems in \\"Gratitude\\" slow us and quiet us down for themselves, each one becoming (as Basho put it) the only poem in the world. How good the only poem in the world is! And the next one, and the next.	2001-07-27

The great Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837) is radiant again in a fresh translation, \\"Leopardi: Selected Poems\\" ... that appeared just as Iris Origo's marvelous 1935 biography, \\"Leopardi, A Study in Solitude\\" ... was reissued. Leopardi's birth into an aristocratic Tuscan family was no protection against a case of scoliosis that left him hunchbacked, a permanent invalid, unlovable in the eyes of any woman he might come to love. Yet his poetic world is often as enchanting and full of health as a convalescent's, for whom all things come alive, and \\"roofs and meadows and little hills / Are shining in the sun.\\" Leopardi celebrates such moments of renewal and delight, though his self-forgetful pleasures always return him to a lonely prison.

A discovery in the University of Washington's Suzzallo Library collection sent him to Nashville, Tennessee, where he found archives of material on the Jubilee Singers, a remarkable troupe of African American students who sang spirituals to audiences around the world after the Civil War, countering racial stereotypes wherever they went. <br />\\"The Jubilees were front-page news during the 1870s,\\" says Ward. \\"From newspaper clippings it's obvious that their performances gave audiences everywhere their first exposure to authentic African American music. And at a time when it was risky for blacks to assert themselves in public, these young people (many of them former slaves) stood on stages and denounced any segregation they encountered. It astonished me that I had never heard of their contribution to American history.\\" <br />History isn't Ward's field, though he won a Washington State Governor's Award in 1997 for Our Bones Are Scattered, a historical account of the 1857 Indian Mutiny against British rule. Local readers are more likely to remember his NPR monologues about living in the Seattle area, broadcast ten years ago on \\"All Things Considered\\" and collected in the volume Out Here: A Newcomer's Notes from the Great Northwest. <br />Ward says, \\"I'm an essayist and novelist, not an academic, and I don't have a historian's training. But I like to tell stories. When writing history I try to stay close to the experiences of people who were there.\\" <br />Ward's \\"Dark Midnight When I Rise: The Story of the Jubilee Singers\\" tells a deeply American story that shows the \\"can-do\\" national character at its best: people uniting to save something they love. <br /> In this case it was Nashville's Fisk School, established for the education of African Americans after the Civil War. While many comparable schools offered only agricultural or industrial training, Fisk boasted a liberal arts curriculum meant to produce teachers and missionaries. But like other black schools of that era it was underfunded. When Fisk faced financial ruin, with teachers and students falling ill from poor food and bitter cold in buildings virtually rotting away, the choir and their director went on the road (another resonant American theme) to raise what today would be millions of dollars. <br /> The story is also American in featuring people who work together despite divergent backgrounds and conflicting aims. Ward observes, \\"Many of the missionaries who helped build black colleges and the white teachers who staffed them were Northern abolitionists who thought they'd find in black people a kind of blank slate to write on. What they found were real African American persons in all their human variety, with a complex, vital culture of their own.\\" Yet in spite of mistakes, quarrels, and mixed motives on the part of all, black and white, the Jubilees succeeded. <br /> \\"'We were nothing but a bunch of kids,' wrote soprano Maggie Porter. 'All we wanted was for Fisk to stand.'\\" <br /> But they were a savvy, resilient bunch, too. Tenor Benjamin Holmes had taught himself to read and write by studying the letters on city signs. Soprano Georgia Gordon had learned to read by memorizing a Bible verse she heard in church, comparing it with the text until she could match each word's sound with its shape, and finding other words like it. Bass singer Greene Evans had built a schoolhouse for black children from discarded lumber, wryly noting that the building \\"'did not lack for ventilation, for a bird could fly through anywhere.'\\" Like Evans, Porter had taught in a country school, until it was burned down by the KKK. <br />On their first U.S. tour the Jubilees wore shabby clothes and lackedwinter coats. Critics confused the slave songs that, in soprano Ella Sheppard's words, \\"'were sacred to our parents'\\" with the vulgar comedy of blackface minstrels.

A discovery in the University of Washington's Suzzallo Library collection sent him to Nashville, Tennessee, where he found archives of material on the Jubilee Singers, a remarkable troupe of African American students who sang spirituals to audiences around the world after the Civil War, countering racial stereotypes wherever they went. <br />&quot;The Jubilees were front-page news during the 1870s,&quot; says Ward. &quot;From newspaper clippings it's obvious that their performances gave audiences everywhere their first exposure to authentic African American music. And at a time when it was risky for blacks to assert themselves in public, these young people (many of them former slaves) stood on stages and denounced any segregation they encountered. It astonished me that I had never heard of their contribution to American history.&quot; <br />History isn't Ward's field, though he won a Washington State Governor's Award in 1997 for Our Bones Are Scattered, a historical account of the 1857 Indian Mutiny against British rule. Local readers are more likely to remember his NPR monologues about living in the Seattle area, broadcast ten years ago on &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and collected in the volume Out Here: A Newcomer's Notes from the Great Northwest. <br />Ward says, &quot;I'm an essayist and novelist, not an academic, and I don't have a historian's training. But I like to tell stories. When writing history I try to stay close to the experiences of people who were there.&quot; <br />Ward's &quot;Dark Midnight When I Rise: The Story of the Jubilee Singers&quot; tells a deeply American story that shows the &quot;can-do&quot; national character at its best:people uniting to save something they love. <br /> In this case it was Nashville's Fisk School, established for the education of African Americans after the Civil War. While many comparable schools offered only agricultural or industrial training, Fisk boasted a liberal arts curriculum meant to produce teachers and missionaries. But like other black schools of that era it was underfunded. When Fisk faced financial ruin, with teachers and students falling ill from poor food and bitter cold in buildings virtually rotting away, the choir and their director went on the road (another resonant American theme) to raise what today would be millions of dollars. <br /> The story is also American in featuring people who work together despite divergent backgrounds and conflicting aims. Ward observes, &quot;Many of the missionaries who helped build black colleges and the white teachers who staffed them were Northern abolitionists who thought they'd find in black people a kind of blank slate to write on. What they found were real African American persons in all their human variety, with a complex, vital culture of their own.&quot; Yet in spite of mistakes, quarrels, and mixed motives on the part of all, black and white, the Jubilees succeeded. <br /> &quot;'We were nothing but a bunch of kids,' wrote soprano Maggie Porter. 'All we wanted was for Fisk to stand.'&quot; <br /> But they were a savvy, resilient bunch, too. Tenor Benjamin Holmes had taught himself to read and write by studying the letters on city signs. Soprano Georgia Gordon had learned to read by memorizing a Bible verse she heard in church, comparing it with the text until she could match each word's sound with its shape, and finding other words like it. Bass singer Greene Evans had built a schoolhouse for black children from discarded lumber, wryly noting that the building &quot;'did not lack for ventilation, for a bird could fly through anywhere.'&quot; Like Evans, Porter had taught in a country school, until itwas burned down by the KKK. <br />On their first U.S. tour the Jubilees wore shabby clothes and lacked winter coats. Critics confused the slave songs that, in soprano Ella Sheppard's words, &quot;'were sacred to our parents'&quot; with the vulgar comedy of blackface minstrels. Railroad conductors ignored the singers'coach tickets and banished them to the smoking cars. Hotels that didn't turn them away often provided rooms which, Sheppard wrote, were &quot;'so well occupied' with insects 'that a part of us only could sleep while the others slew the occupants.'&quot; Some innkeepers were more welcoming - - one tied his wife to the upstairs banister to keep her from throwing the singers out of the parlor. <br />Despite fears, threats, exhausting schedules, and serious illnesses (contralto Julia Jackson had a stroke; tenor Benjamin Holmes developed TB), the Jubilees persevered. Their gracious ways and marvelous music inspired newspaper reporters to write articles that shamed hotel and restaurant owners into admitting black customers, and several railways, steamship lines, and schools integrated. <br />Through incessant rehearsals the singers had developed a sweet, stirring sound &quot;that rose and soared and faded like a passing breeze.&quot; They sang for royalty throughout Europe, they sang in the Taj Mahal. Packed audiences listened to their praise songs and sorrow songs with astonished joy, weeping and applauding. <br />It was the first truly American music, and it would influence music everywhere in the next century.

Professor Wineburg greeted me with a pop quiz: \\"Which twins look most alike?\\"<br />Behind this playful question is an educational psychologist's interest in how people think, especially about history. Wineburg's \\"Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts\\" (Temple U. Press, 255 pages, [price]) shows that historical thought is not a natural process: it \\"goes against the grain of how we ordinarily think, one of the reasons why it is much easier to learn names, dates, and stories than it is to [understand] the past.\\"<br />Wineburg told me his interest in this subject first awoke when he took a history class he couldn't ace with his good memory. He learned that histories aren't objective summaries of the facts but interpretations and arguments made out of information that's always incomplete. \\"But how did historians do that?\\" Wineburg asked. \\"Their books seemed like products of naturally systematic thought--which wasn't how my mind worked, but maybe I was just dumb!\\"<br />Wineburg's research into history and the mind has won many honors during his 12 years at the University of Washington. Through having students and professors think aloud while reading documents, he found that only novices just read something and decide what it means. \\"A historian's thought process is full of hunches and reverses, constant self-questionings and I-don't-knows,\\" Wineburg explained.<br />Standardized history tests inhibit this kind of thinking, besides guaranteeing that students will seem vastly ignorant. \\"Periodically, starting with the first national survey in 1917, Americans have concluded from factual tests that kids don't know history. The conclusion isn't logical.\\" Wineburg smiled wryly. \\"Kids have just never remembered the facts that adults sitting around a table making up a test say they should remember.\\"<br />He pulled aU.S. history text from a shelf. \\"Why not teach how to question the facts? Here's Rosa Parks: 'Tired after a long day's work, she sat down in the front section reserved for whites.' Actually, Parks sat in the middle of the bus, available to anyone unless the front was full. Other accounts have her saying she wasn't especially tired and wasn't sure why she kept her seat when challenged. Did Parks intend an act of civil disobedience? Why do these historians disagree?\\"<br />Comparing documents, Wineburg added, \\"is detective work that kids are usually deprived of. It shows them that no single authority has the whole story, and it raises real questions of meaning.\\" He paused, considering. \\"Every topic doesn't need endless debate. Students stay engaged once they realize history's not a fixed story they must swallow whole but a way of thinking they can apply to life.\\"<br />Americans need this way of thinking, Wineburg told me. \\"We're deluged by conflicting, fragmented information that tries to steer us in particular directions. We need to raise citizens who ask themselves, 'Is this true? Who's saying so? What's the nature of the evidence?' Taught this way, history is a training ground for democracy.\\"<br />Is such training too hard for schoolchildren? \\"We underestimate kids' abilities to think. Or we believe their self-esteem depends on having tasks they easily do. But we feel good about ourselves by doing things we thought we couldn't do, with capable people around to pick us up after a tumble and show us our reach can exceed our grasp.\\"<br />\\"Historical Thinking\\" is an academic book, but not daunting or dry, and full of stories any reader can enjoy. Wineburg describes Primo Levi's moving encounter with the student who swore that if sent to Auschwitz he could have escaped. There's a chapter on drawings that schoolchildren made of their mental pictures of Pilgrims, Settlers, and Hippies for one of Wineburg's studies--readers can bypass the statistical tables and walk right into these young imaginations. The high-school history class discussion that veers off the rails is as gripping as well-crafted fiction.<br />Wineburg's conversation with me was no merely academic exercise either. \\"History gives us a kind of humility,\\" he mused at one point. \\"I can read something written in 1860 but not know what it meant to live in 1860. I never lived in a world where you could wake up in the morning and go to an auction and buy people. Studying history, we think our way into what living in that world was like. It's the only form of time travel that exists.\\"<br />Small wonder that Wineburg was an early winner of the University of Washington's Distinguished Teaching Award.	2001-07-27
