As a newswriter, I regret not getting this book when I first saw it here. Writing press releases is an exacting task when it comes to punctuation, spacing and page setup. Had I followed the tips in this book, I would not have the chore of reformatting my templates next week. Simple things like one space after a period at the end of a sentence is only one of the valuable tips in the book. The explanations of why we should do things differently on a PC are clear. The reasons why things are done differently on a typewriter are just as useful. This little book also covers how to make your type easy to read with plenty of examples to prove its points.

With Down and Dirty Tricks, I feel as if I have been working in the field for years. You don't even have to start at page one, just jump right in anywhere and start working.

Master Corporate Politicians are survivors...he is one, he tells you how to become one and tells you how to deal with someone who is one. As my business partner said, &quot;These are the sort of things you really want to do to people but are afraid of the retribution!&quot; Everyone will recognize the people the author describes and the situations that go with them. It really is a great book to have if you are trying to work your way up in the corporate world.

Her characters are always fully developed and her plots are intricate. However, being a woman of African descent and not inclined to play the skin-color game, I found the frequent references to skin tone tedious and pretty soon tired of the reading. That's not to say that I won't pick it up and finish it (I can't get away from several of the characters in the book). West knows a lot about race relations on the east coast and I find that fascinating. I find her works are intriguing as Dr. Morrison's. As a writer, I love her flow of words and the scenic structure of her settings. As an African American who spends a great deal of time teaching young Black citizens that the love of your color comes from the inside out and not just something worn on a tee-shirt, I find that some of her characters too defeating or, rather, defeated because there are too many instances when the quality of their lives are lessened because they refuse to get beyond things that have been instilled on us through colonization.	2000-12-26

There is not much help on how the pages were done, but anyone with an illustrator or publishing program can duplicate like results. The examples are diverse and inspiring, even for a beginning graphic artist. Since ordering the book, I have taken two more classes in simple graphic layout and this book has been a tremendous help. One thing I learned about graphics is that it is okay to copy other artists' work, unlike in other mediums. So, if you are going to do that, then this book is worth having on hand.	2000-12-26

Reading Passing made me wish that I had lived in Harlem in that era so I went back to the library and read as much as I  could on Black America in that area at that time.  It made me do research  on the Dunbar Hotel here in Los Angeles.  The scene on the rooftop  restaurant was riveting and even I grew uncomfortable with the staring  scene. Quicksand was a totally different tragedy and just as compelling.  Imagine having that much uncertainty in your life, educated or not. I can  see that if the time period had been different and the book was turned into  a movie by Tarentino, the main character would have surely turned to hard  drugs and some form of retaliation by murder.	2000-07-07

She is very detailed  and that requires concentration. She answers no questions for you and  perhaps that is what makes some readers say she is too complicated. If you  remember the character, when she jumps forward or backward in the story, it  is easy to pick up where she left off. Beloved is merely a song about a  woman's commitment to not suffering any more indignities if it were in her  power not to do so. Perhaps her initial method was extreme but then again,  what is not extreme about enslavement? What is not extreme about a group of  people having no history beyond the 19th century? What is difficult about  her novels is that you have to have the answers to these questions before  you start reading.	2000-07-07

Of course she was and she was one of the  writers who helped give it its significance. Just the scene in Jonah's  Gourd where she is talking about the physical features of the male  protagonist is important enough. Her &quot;peope&quot; are real and you  wonder if she had interacted with them in real life because they are your  neighbors, relatives and friends...they are just that touchable. Her pain  in life comes through all her books but you are so busy savoring her prose  that you only wonder about it after you are done. The best thing to do is  to gather several authors from that period and read them all. She is among  the genius of the era but you will see how far she stands out from the  brilliant.	2000-07-07

The complicated characters that Ms Morrison creates are really the every  man and every woman in the black community. Her prose are lyrical and deep.  What is usually referred to as &quot;dark&quot; passages in other books are  merely conditions forced on the people she writes about. Two friends go  through changes that most of us think we escape but really experience in  one form or another. Granted, the big scene is thankfully one that is  uncommon but it is representative of that big hole that African Americans  fall in because they are easily indentifiable as African American or Black.  It is nonstop reading.	2000-07-07

I wish it was required reading for everyone. It certainly  would do much to clarify the problems African Americans have had in this  society. It is also very humorous and not all facts and dates. Actually,  the author, who appears to be a warm and nurturing person, supplies dates  and figures so subtly that they do not interfere with the reading. I am  buying another copy as a gift.

I bought a second Cake Bible after I realized that the first one would become dog-earred from use.  I have tried several of the recipes in this book and the results have been spectacular. If you follow her methods for  mixing, you will see the difference from the \\"cream the butter  first\\" way.  Her recipes are exquisite and the results will make you  feel you are ready to appear on Great Chefs. Like the author, I prefer the  taste of butter in cakes rather than the overpowering sweetness of sugar.  In addition, the photographs are wonderful and any baker will be able to  produce the same results. All the previous raves about the cheesecake are true and the difficulty level for making it is around 1.<br /><br />Do not buy this book if you are looking to use substitutions! Or if you want to do it your way. The author wrote me a personal letter when I asked her to develop recipes using yogurt. Her reply was that she prefers working with real butter and no substitutes. It was a very nice note, full of charm just the way her books are written.<br /><br />One other reason a recipe might fail is humidity. I have had her buttercreams fail because of the high humidity in my house during the winter but had spectacular results during the hottest, dryest summer months.<br /><br />To succeed with the recipes in this book one needs to first sit and read it like a novel, then have patience while creating. Have all the equipment and ingredients you need and do not try to do substitutions.	2000-04-29
